{"total_words": 1405, "documents": ["The authors examined whether early adolescents' sibling relationships ameliorate the effects of a difficult temperament on best friendships, exploring whether qualities of early adolescents' sibling relationships would moderate the link between temperamental difficulties and best friendship quality. Data were collected at two points. At first collection, parents provided temperament ratings for 73 later-born siblings (M = 7 years). Five years later, adolescents provided information about support and discord present in their best friendships and older siblings provided information about the warmth and conflict in their same-sex sibling dyads. The hypothesized moderating effect of the sibling relationship was found only for early adolescent girls. Support and discord in girls' best friendships was negatively and positively predicted, respectively, by level of temperamental difficulty only when relationships with their older sisters were lower in warmth or higher in conflict. Implications for understanding and improving early adolescents' closest friendships are discussed.\n      </p>", "Through qualitative analyses of narratives of what students and faculty wanted in their relationships, the authors identified three themes. The Teaching/Learning Environment theme illustrated needs for nurturing, open, nonthreatening, and respectful attitudes in student-faculty relationships. Exchange of Information students reported a desire to learn and interact with each other, but not with the instructor. With regard to Mentor/Peer Association theme, students wanted to develop networks of friends to help with course work, whereas teachers wanted to find principles of effective teaching to help students learn. Applications of this data for improving student-faculty interactions and instructional processes are discussed.\n      </p>", "The present paper focuses on professionals as a special group of microenterprises. It explains their characteristics and financial relationships, using data from a survey conducted in Germany in 2002. Consistent with the theory of asymmetric information and relationship lending, we find that these firms maintain a small number of bank relationships, which increases in firm size and age. They tend to choose multiple banking relationships to overcome credit rationing and finance larger loans. Credit risk and the structure of the banking market do not seem to matter.\n      </p>", "The purpose of the present study is to examine associations between quality of teacher-child relationships from preschool through third grade and children's third-grade achievement using Phases I, II, and III data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Care and Education, a prospective study of 1,364 children from birth through sixth grade. There are three main findings. First, positive associations were found between quality of teacher-child relationships and achievement. Second, high quality teacher-child relationships buffered children from the negative effects of insecure or other maternal attachment on achievement. Third, the effect of quality of teacher-child relationships on achievement was mediated through child and teacher behaviors in the classroom. In sum, high quality teacher-child relationships fostered children's achievement. Implications for educational practice are discussed.\n      </p>", "The international data on tidal prism and cross-sectional area of tidal inlets and estuaries are examined as a basis for exploring the variability in the comparable UK data. The data are then used to evaluate the existing classification of estuary types; to present a number of relationships between the key bulk parameters of estuary volume, plan area, and cross-sectional area; and to test some theoretically derived relationships. The results suggest that the degree of Holocene sedimentation, and hence Holocene development, may explain much of the variability seen in the data, and this is not, as yet, fully accounted for in the theoretical relationships.\n      </p>", "To better understand the social factors that influence the diverse pathways to family formation young adults experience today, this research investigates the association between opposite-gender relationships during late adolescence and union formation in early adulthood. Using data from the first and third waves of the Add Health (n = 4,911), we show that, for both men and women, there is continuity between adolescent and adult relationship experiences. Those involved in adolescent romantic relationships at the end of high school are more likely to marry and to cohabit in early adulthood. Moreover, involvement in a nonromantic sexual relationship is positively associated with cohabitation, but not marriage. We conclude that the precursors to union formation patterns in adulthood are observable in adolescence.\n      </p>", "Using the French botanist Henri Cassini's work as an example, the complex relationship between characters, groups and relationships in the period 1770\u20131850 is explored. Cassini thought that classifications should be natural and that groups were to be based on numerous characters, although they would be difficult to recognize and characterize. For the most part he saw relationships between organisms as two dimensional, with one group directly joining two or more other groups. At the same time he asserted that the best way to think about affinities was as if they were linear, largely because this was most compatible with how he thought that the human mind worked. When he discussed relationships between individual plant parts he used words like type, analogy, and hypothesis that were rarely used when he discussed relationships between groups. In Cassini's writings it is difficult to connect his work on the analogies between plant parts with his ideas of affinities between groups. In the early nineteenth century zoologists in particular were developing various ways of thinking about organisms as being related indirectly, whether using abstract types or the taxonomic hierarchy to structure relationships. Similarly, Darwin's discussion of affinities between groups was separate from that on homologies between particular structures, but he saw relationships as being like a tree, with extant taxa being related indirectly by their ancestors.\n      </p>", "In this paper we present a study of the structure of three lead firm-network relationships at two points in time. Using data on companies in the packaging machine industry, we study the process of vertical disintegration and focus on the ability to coordinate competencies and combine knowledge across corporate boundaries. We argue that the capability to interact with other companies-which we call relational capability-accelerates the lead firm's knowledge access and transfer with relevant effects on company growth and innovativeness. This study provides evidence that interfirm networks can be shaped and deliberately designed: over time managers develop a specialized supplier network and build a narrower and more competitive set of core competencies. The ability to integrate knowledge residing both inside and outside the firm's boundaries emerges as a distinctive organizational capability. Our main goal is to contribute to the current discussion of cooperative ties and dynamic aspects of interfirm networks, adding new dimensions to resource-based and knowledge-based interpretations of company performance.\n      </p>", "Children's feelings of loneliness related to family and peer relationships have only recently been documented by researchers. These feelings, once thought to be of importance only to adolescents and adults, are now being recognized, researched, and assessed in children as young as 5 years of age. Helping professionals need to understand the short- and long-term consequences of children's loneliness as it relates to their personal well-being and self-esteem. The article concludes with several recommendations and identifies the need to develop clear and articulated methods of intervention.\n      </p>", "A selective review of some recent theoretical developments in the field of close relationships is presented. We describe demographic developments reflecting flux in relationships and the family and what may be viewed as a revolution in gender relations and the family over the past three to four decades. Also reviewed are theories on the development, maintenance, and ending of relationships, as well as the \"dark side\" of close relationships. We conclude that the close-relationships field is likely to continue to develop and prosper as people search for answers to daunting relationship problems.\n      </p>", "Multivariate analyses were carried out on 32 greenhouse populations derived from the same number of wild populations of three taxa of California Fragaria. Population samples varied from 5 to 9 individuals and the total sample size was 254. Relationships among taxa were assessed by principal components, cluster, and discriminant analysis. Population relationships were determined by discriminant analysis. When all populations were included, there was 77% correct classification of individual plants. Further, there was no overlap among the three taxa (F. vesca, F. chiloensis, F. virginiana subsp glauca). Separate analyses of F. vesca and F. chiloensis resulted in, respectively, 91% and 78% correct classification These analyses revealed considerable variation among populations and each population illustrates adaptation to different ecological circumstances. Additional analyses of F. vesca and F. chiloensis were prepared by assigning populations to community types. This results in three community types for F. vesca (coastal forest, scrub, sierran forest) and four for F. chiloensis (dunes, scrub, strand, and woodland-meadows). Discriminant analyses of these groups revealed 91% correct classification, by community type, for F. vesca and 87% for F. chiloensis. These results indicate that (a) each taxon has segregated into morphological types that correspond to general community types and that (b) within each community type there is further differentiation into population types.\n      </p>", "Research in organizational communication has examined the structure and content of interaction, but has paid little attention to research traditions outside the organizational sciences that explore the social-psychological interconnections between relationship development and interaction. In this paper we draw upon and extend those traditions to develop a model of how communication relationships develop within organizational dyads. The proposed model examines organization-based communication relationships through a synthesis of theoretical perspectives on communication richness, relational communication, interpersonal attribution, and social expectancy. We also call upon precepts of structuration theory to embed these microlevel processes in an organizational context. The relational outcome in the model is \"interactional richness,\" a dyad-level construct that assesses the extent to which communication within the dyad is high in shared meaning. Model antecedents are aspects of interaction through which communicators reciprocally define their relationships, including relational message properties, message patterns that emerge over time, and relational perceptions. We propose that these communication properties and behaviors give rise to relationship attributions. We then incorporate processes of expectancy confirmation and violation to explain how specific communication encounters lead individuals to reformulate attributions regarding the status of a given relationship. Research propositions articulate how attribution/expectancy processes mediate between relational communication behavior and relationship development outcomes. We also develop propositions addressing how relational communication behavior is influenced by macrolevel factors, including hierarchy, structure, and culture. In a concluding section we discuss the model's potential contribution to research and practice, address its limitations, and offer recommendations for future research aimed at testing its embedded hypotheses.\n      </p>", "This article describes the Ideals Standards Model, which deals with the content and functions of partner and relationship ideals in intimate relationships. This model proposes that there are three distinct categories of partner ideals (warmth-loyalty, vitality-attractiveness, and status-resources), and that ideals have three distinct functions (evaluation, explanation, and regulation). The model also explains how perceived discrepancies between ideals and perceptions of one's current partner or relationship can have different consequences, depending on which of two motivating forces is active (the need to see the partner or relationship positively or the need to be accurate). Recent empirical studies that support some of the main features of the model are described.\n      </p>", "Current expectations of men and women in society have undergone tremendous changes concerning roles and the expression of intimacy within intergender relationships. African American intergender relationships have not escaped these changes. Three theoretical perspectives are offered to enrich the discussion on African American intergender relationships: patriarchy, role, and love. This article posits that African American intergender relationships are defined within some particular significant parameters like patriarchy, gender roles, love, and a history of enslavement and discrimination. Current discussions of such relationships miss their complexity when they omit these conceptual perspectives and the unique historical and present-day experiences of African Americans. The Million Woman and Million Man Marches have made healing, nurturing, atonement, love, and acceptance national priorities for African Americans. This article promotes the incorporation of the perspectives-patriarchy, role, and love-as avenues of contributing to an enriched debate that will be beneficial to such national priorities.\n      </p>", "Agency theorists argue that organizations typically get little value from using employees and that they should instead use nonemployees operating fully as residual claimants. Yet, even in a context where those theorists would predict virtually no employees-taxicab organizations-they are common. What drives the use of employment relationships in these organizations? The authors show how employment relationships are linked to firm capabilities and strategic opportunities in a sample of taxicab organizations, relying on arguments about the linkage of employment to the internal liquidity of labor, organizational routines, and internal cooperation. The theoretical arguments and findings suggest what organizations gain by having employment relationships and show that integrating the agency theoretic argument with the other theoretical arguments leads toward a resource-based view of strategy and human resources. The authors highlight the importance of embedding arguments on the internal management of human resources in the strategic and competitive context in which organizations operate. Their arguments also have implications for the resource-based approach to strategy in mapping the resource space of human assets in organizations and, within that space, directing attention to how organizations gain sustainable competitive advantage through managing human resources.\n      </p>", "Both linear and non-linear structural relationships can be formulated explicitly in terms of random-effects models. When the random effects are normally distributed, the SAS NLMIXED procedure can be used to fit such models to data by using maximum likelihood estimation. Any distribution for the data conditional on the random effects can be used although certain common distributions are built into the procedure. Techniques for detecting parameter unidentifiability are discussed. Examples covering a range of applications are given.\n      </p>", "When their first child was 5, 30 couples discussed an unresolved issue in their marital relationship that involved one of their parents, and how they would resolve this issue. Five intergenerational themes were identified in these disagreements: (a) balancing nuclear vs. extended family time, (b) changing rules and roles, (c) pleasing parents vs. spouse, (d) struggling with power, and (e) fearing future obligations. Most couples decided to resolve the issue between themselves.\n      </p>", "Children's genotypes and their social relationships are correlated throughout their development. Heritable characteristics of children evoke strong and specific responses from their parents; frequently, these same heritable characteristics also influence the children's adjustment. Moreover, parental heritable traits that influence their parenting are also transmitted to children and influence their children's adjustment. Thus, genetically influenced evocative processes from children and parental-transmission mechanisms influence the covariances between measures of family relationships and child development. These findings suggest new targets for preventing adverse development: altering parental responses to heritable characteristics of children and influencing the genetically influenced ontogeny of parenting.\n      </p>", "In this chapter I review recent research on the nature, meaning, and impact of extrafamilial relationships during adolescence. I use findings of quantitative and qualitative studies to develop the idea that close friendships, wider networks of peers, and romantic relationships have distinct meanings and significance for the developing adolescent. Sociologists' work inevitably focuses attention on the ways in which the adolescent's social addresses and locations (gender, race, social class) influence many aspects of these early relationships. The review also highlights some limitations of the dominant perspective on adolescent relationships, attachment theory, and provides suggestions for future research (particularly in the area of romantic relationships, where the literature is growing but still relatively undeveloped).\n      </p>", "Romantic relationships are central in adolescents' lives. They have the potential to affect development positively, but also place adolescents at risk for problems. Romantic experiences change substantially over the course of adolescence; the peer context plays a critical role as heterosexual adolescents initially interact with the other sex in a group context, then begin group dating, and finally have dyadic romantic relationships. Adolescents' expectations and experiences in romantic relationships are related to their relationships with their peers as well as their parents. Although research on adolescents' romantic relationships has blossomed in the past decade, further work is needed to identify the causes and consequences of romantic experiences, examine the diversity of romantic experiences, and integrate the field with work on sexuality and adult romantic relationships.\n      </p>", "A study of 322 gay men and women sought to provide information concerning parent-child relationships of the respondents. Two-thirds perceived their relationships with their fathers as extremely satisfactory or satisfactory. Over three-fourths perceived their relationships with their mothers as extremely satisfactory or satisfactory. The majority perceived that both their fathers and mothers would accept their homosexuality. Data support the belief that gays as a group are not couple-oriented.\n      </p>", "We used a probabilistic approach to address the influence of sampling artifacts on the form of species-area relationships (SARs). We developed a model in which the increase in observed species richness is a function of sampling effort exclusively. We assumed that effort depends on area sampled, and we generated species-area curves under that model. These curves can be realistic looking. We then generated SARs from avian data, comparing SARs based on counts with those based on richness estimates. We used an approach to estimation of species richness that accounts for species detection probability and, hence, for variation in sampling effort. The slopes of SARs based on counts are steeper than those of curves based on estimates of richness, indicating that the former partly reflect failure to account for species detection probability. SARs based on estimates reflect ecological processes exclusively, not sampling processes. This approach permits investigation of ecologically relevant hypotheses. The slope of SARs is not influenced by the slope of the relationship between habitat diversity and area. In situations in which not all of the species are detected during sampling sessions, approaches to estimation of species richness integrating species detection probability should be used to investigate the rate of increase in species richness with area.\n      </p>", "This study focuses on the relationship between an adolescent girl's family relationship patterns and her peer relationship patterns. Degree of connectedness in family relationships is measured using global coding of family interaction process. Peer connectedness is measured by a sociometric questionnaire. Results reveal a similarity between the degree of connectedness the adolescent girl experiences in her family relationships and the degree of connectedness which she experiences in her relationships with peers. These results support the importance of family system patterns in the development of social relationships outside of the family.\n      </p>", "The well known result that, when the ratio of error variances is specified in normal theory bivariate linear relationships, the maximum likelihood estimator of the slope parameter takes the same form for both structural and functional relationships is extended to the multivariate case. Furthermore, it is well known that in the bivariate case the estimator of the slope is bounded by the two regression estimators. Analogous results are derived for the multivariate case. The asymptotic variance-covariance matrix of the maximum likelihood estimators of the coefficients of a multivariate linear relationship is determined, and an estimator of this matrix is proposed. Large sample confidence regions for the parameters are formulated and the relationship between these and normal theory regression confidence regions is discussed.\n      </p>", "Research on information processing, managerial cognition, and social networks demonstrates that people rely on other people for information. However, this work has not specified how seeking information from others results in actionable knowledge-knowledge directed at making progress on relatively short-term projects. This research employs both qualitative and quantitative methods to investigate how personal sources of information contribute to actionable knowledge. Our qualitative study found that people cultivate different kinds of information relationships that are the source of 5 components of actionable knowledge: (1) solutions (both know-what and know-how), (2) referrals (pointers to other people or databases), (3) problem reformulation, (4) validation, and (5) legitimation. Our quantitative study revealed that, while source expertise predicted receipt of these components of actionable knowledge, so too did expertise of the seeker and features of the relationship between the seeker and source. We draw implications from these findings for the study of social capital and organizational learning.\n      </p>", "Much of the recent discussion concerning the form and underlying mechanistic basis of metabolic rate\u2013temperature and development rate\u2013temperature relationships has been precipitated by the development of the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE). Empirical tests of the theory\u2019s fundamental equation are an essential component of establishing its validity. Here, we test the temperature component of the fundamental equation of the MTE as it applies to metabolic rate and development rate, using insects as model organisms. Specifically, we test (i) whether mean activation energies, E, approximate the 0.65 eV value proposed by the proponents of the MTE and whether the range of values is tightly constrained between 0.6 and 0.7 eV, as they have argued; (ii) whether phylogenetic signal is apparent in the rate\u2010temperature relationships; (iii) whether the slopes of the rate\u2010temperature relationships show consistent, directional variation associated with environmental variables; and (iv) whether intra\u2010 and interspecific rate\u2010temperature relationships differ significantly. Because the majority of activation energy values fell outside the predicted range and rate\u2010temperature relationships showed consistent directional variation correlated with large\u2010scale climatic variation, we conclude that data from insects provide only limited support for the MTE. In consequence, we consider alternative explanations for variation in rate\u2010temperature relationships.\n      </p>", "\"Connections: Relationships and Marriage\" is a high school marriage education curriculum designed to teach students how to develop healthy relationships and marriages. This study evaluated the effectiveness of this curriculum with 410 high school students who were in \"Connections\" or a control group. Although the effects were relatively small, findings suggest that the curriculum increases knowledge of relationship concepts, decreases violence in dating relationships, decreases risk factors for adolescent pregnancy, and positively impacts attitudes related to future successful marriage. Implications for further development of the curriculum and other implications for practitioners are discussed.\n      </p>", "Recent research has identified control in interaction as an important theoretical construct in understanding relationships. This research expands on this notion by building a theoretical model of control over one's partner while dating. It is suggested that control can be understood as a compensatory process where people are most likely to control their partners when control over their environment is challenged, as it is when low mastery, low trust, or high conflict occurs in relationships. For individuals, controlling their partners serves to compensate for their perceived lack of control. Using a broad sample of college daters, the results support the idea of a compensatory process of control.\n      </p>", "One hundred and fifty-five middle-class black men were surveyed through questionnaires to obtain data on their perceptions of key issues related to problems affecting black male-black female relationships. A majority of these men reported that black women had more opportunity than black men, and a large minority felt that black women were, in part at least, responsible for the relative low status of black men. Those respondents who had a pessismistic view of black male-black female relationships also tended to feel that they had been affected little by racial discrimination, and preferred traditional gender roles for men and women. It was concluded that salient issues affecting black male-black female relationships may vary by socio-economic status, political and ideological orientations, and the overall social circumstances experienced by black men and black women during any given historical period.\n      </p>", "A common characteristic of recent research dealing with dyadic relationships in career development is the focus on mentor-protege relationships at a particular stage in the protege's career. Moreover, the mere presence of a dyadic relationship has often been emphasized, while the psychosocial dimensions inherent in the relationship have been ignored. The present study examines the relationships between four psychosocial dimensions of dyadic relationships and various indices of career success. This analysis encompasses two dyadic career relationships (mentor-protege and peer-peer) at two career stages (graduate school and employment after graduate school). Data were gathered by questionnaire from 64 family and child development doctoral students and graduates. Results indicate that both mentor and peer relationships are related to career success and that the influence of various psychosocial dimensions varies by both type of relationship (mentor or peer) and career stage (student or graduate). Implications of the findings for early career professionals are discussed.\n      </p>", "Family relationships do not occur in isolation but rather are embedded within greater systems of family ties. In recognition of the need to study families holistically, we explore how relations between grandparents and grandchildren are contingent upon a matrix of intergenerational relationships. Using data from the Iowa Youth and Families Project, our analyses focus on person-centered types of grandparent-grandchild relationships and the legacy of social ties across the generations, as mediated by other family relationships. We find multiple dimensions of grandparents' involvement with their grandchildren to be associated with (a) whether the grandparents knew their own grandparents when they were young, (b) the grandparent's perceptions of contact and closeness with the target grandchild, and (c) nuances in the relationships of grandparents with the parent generation.\n      </p>", "Whether biological diversity within communities is limited by local interactions or regional species pools remains an important question in ecology. In this paper, we investigate how an experimentally applied tree-harvesting disturbance gradient influenced local-regional richness relationships. Plant species richness was measured at three spatial scales (2 ha = regional; 576 m\u00b2 and 1 m\u00b2 = local) on three occasions (one year pre-disturbance, one year post-disturbance, and 10 years post-disturbance) across five disturbance treatments (uncut control through clearcut) replicated throughout the southern Appalachian Mountains, USA. We investigated whether species richness in 576-m\u00b2 plots and 1-m\u00b2 subplots depended on species richness in 2-ha experimental units and whether this relationship changed through time before and after canopy disturbance. We found that, before disturbance, the relationship between local and regional richness was weak or nonexistent. One year after disturbance local richness was a positive function of regional richness, because local sites were colonized from the regional species pool. Ten years after disturbance, the positive relationship persisted, but the slope had decreased by half. These results suggest that disturbance can set the stage for strong influences of regional species pools on local community assembly in temperate forests. However, as time since disturbance increases, local controls on community assembly decouple the relationships between regional and local diversity.\n      </p>", "Using data on a sample of 435 young adults who were interviewed in 1992 and their parents who were interviewed in 1988, we examine the effects of coresidence on multiple dimensions of parent-child solidarity. Results show that coresident young adults give, receive, and perceive more support from their parents than nonresident children, but that they report significantly, albeit modestly, lower affective relationships with their parents. The effects of coresidence are more positive when children are more adult and responsible (older, employed, in school). Coresidence and proximity are strongly related to parent-child solidarity, but parents' reports of the quality of prior family relationships have surprisingly little effect on the likelihood of coresidence or on children's reports of current relationships.\n      </p>", "This study examines the relationship between the intensity of adopted adolescents' thinking about their adoptions and their adoptive family relationships. Participants included 135 adopted adolescents involved in an ongoing study of openness in adoption. Adolescents who reported high levels of preoccupation with adoption reported greater alienation from their adoptive fathers than did adolescents who reported moderate or low levels of preoccupation. Adolescents with extremely high levels of preoccupation reported significantly higher levels of alienation and significantly lower levels of trust for their adoptive mothers and fathers than adolescents with extremely low levels of preoccupation. These findings, along with the divergences between adolescents' perceptions of dyadic and overall family relationships, are discussed in terms of how they relate to the process of adoptive identity exploration.\n      </p>", "In bilateral interorganizational relationships, individual firm's self-interest is subordinate to the larger interest of the collective system. Bilateral governance is facilitated by exclusivity under certain conditions. Exclusive relationships draw partners closer and improve coordination. However, exclusivity leads to a loss of flexibility in dealing with turbulent environments. We test relationships between exclusivity and antecedent variables from transaction-cost analysis, resource-dependence theory, and organization theory. We find that while relationship-specific investment calls for more exclusivity, interdependence and rapid technological change call for less. Further, in the computer and semiconductor industry, exclusivity is negatively related to perceived effectiveness. Hence exclusivity should be used judiciously in the management of bilateral interrorganizational relationships.\n      </p>", "Sociality has positive effects on female fitness in many mammalian species. Among female baboons, those who are most socially integrated reproduce most successfully. Here we test a number of predictions derived from kin selection theory about the strength of social bonds among adult female baboons. Our analyses are based on systematic observations of grooming and association patterns among 118 females living in seven different social groups in the Amboseli Basin of Kenya over a 16-year period. Females in these groups formed the strongest bonds with close kin, including their mothers, daughters, and maternal and paternal sisters. Females were also strongly attracted toward females who were close to their own age, perhaps because peers were often paternal sisters. Females' bonds with their maternal sisters were strengthened after their mother's deaths, whereas their relationships with their maternal aunts were weakened after their mother's death. In addition, females formed stronger bonds with their paternal sisters when no close maternal kin were available, and they compensated for the absence of any close kin by forming strong bonds with nonrelatives. Taken together, these data suggest that social bonds play a vital role in females' lives, and the ability to establish and maintain strong social bonds may have important fitness consequences for females.\n      </p>", "In academic research on interracial relationships, as well as popular discourses such as film and television, Black women are often characterized as angry and opposed to interracial relationships. Yet the voices of Black women have been largely neglected. Drawing from focus group interviews with Black college women and in-depth interviews with Black women who are married interracially, the author explores Black women's views on Black-white heterosexual relationships. Black women's opposition to interracial dating is not simply rooted in jealousy and anger toward white women but is based on white racism, Black internalization of racism, and what interracial relationships represent to Black women and signify about Black women's worth. The impact of racism and sexism are clear, with Black women devalued by white standards of beauty and faced with a shortage of available Black men and a lack of \"substantive opportunities \" to date interracially.\n      </p>", "Within the genus Scorpidium, the two species S. cossonii (Schimp.) Heden\u00e4s and S. revolvens (Sw. ex Anonymo) Rubers are similar to each other in habit and superficial morphological traits, whereas S. scorpioides (Hedw.) Limpr. appears to be very different. Because finer morphological characteristics seem to tell another story, the taxonomic treatment of these species has been debated. A molecular analysis of exemplar specimens based on ITS, atpB-rbcL, rpl16, and trnL-trnF sequences reveals that S. cossonii and S. scorpioides differ from each other by 10 base substitutions/indels and from S. revolvens by 46. When relationships based on ITS, rpl16, or both markers together are analysed for numerous specimens, those of S. scorpioides appear with some S. cossonii specimens in a basal grade (rpl16) or in a clade nested within S. cossonii (ITS or both markers together). The molecular data suggest that superficial morphological data are misleading as regards to relationships within Scorpidium. There is no evidence for the recognition of the genus Limprichtia for S. cossonii and S. revolvens, or for merging these species into one. ITS data suggest recombination in S. scorpioides and rpl16 indicate exchange of chloroplast genetic material among populations of S. cossonii.\n      </p>", "Avian paramyxoviruses (PMVs) and avian pneumovirus (APV) belong to the family Paramyxoviridae. Antigenic relationships between PMVs were shown previously, hence, this study was designed to investigate possible antigenic relationships between APV and four avian PMVs (PMV-1, PMV-2, PMV-3, and PMV-7). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test, and virus neutralization (VN) test in chicken embryos and in Vero cells were used. The HI test was performed with the PMVs as antigens against the APV and PMVs antisera. The ELISA and VN test in chicken embryos were performed with PMVs and APV antigens and antisera. The VN test in vero cells was performed with the APV as an antigen against the PMV antisera. All the viruses were isolated in the United States or Canada. No antigenic relationships between APV and the PMVs were detected by the described tests. /// Los paramyxovirus y los pneumovirus aviares pertenecen a la familia Paramyxoviridae.

Based on questionnaire and interview data from a nationwide self-selected sample of 100 battered lesbians, the article first examines the incidence and forms of abuse in violent lesbian relationships. It then analyzes victims' help-seeking efforts, the responses of help providers to these requests, and the impact of these responses on both victims and violent episodes.

The clade Amphibia, incorporating the crown-group Lissamphibia, also includes the Nectridea, Colosteidae, Microsauria and the temnospondyls. The Nectridea and Colosteidae may form the sister clade to the clade comprising the Microsauria, the temnospondyls and the Lissamphibia. The Nectridea are a distinct clade of Permo-Pennsylvanian dwarf amphibians and are not of polyphyletic origin from within the temnospondyls, nor are they closely related to lissamphibians. The balance of evidence favors a monophyletic origin of all lissamphibians from within the temnospondyls but the number of character states involved is not so great that this theory can be considered robust. The alternative possibility that gymnophionans are microsaur derivatives is less well supported but remains open. If the Microsauria formed the stem-group to the Gymnophiona, this would not violate the monophyly of the living amphibians or of lissamphibian soft-anatomy characters, although to extend the Lissamphibia to include temnospondyls and microsaurs would be unacceptable. Within the temnospondyl grade of evolution, the only two families that are plausible lissamphibian relatives are the Amphibamidae and the Branchiosauridae. Each shares a few different character states with the Lissamphibia but the Amphibamidae share more character states and also show nesting of derived character states towards the lissamphibian condition. While the Branchiosauridae were perceived as completely neotenous, they were less likely to be the stem-group of the Lissamphibia than the Amphibamidae, but the recent discovery of metamorphosed branchiosaurids will undoubtedly alter this viewpoint.\n      </p>", "Three concepts of ancestry are distinguished, the individual organism as ancestor, the population or species as ancestor, and the supraspecific taxon as ancestor. Of these, only the first two can be objectively applied, the third is a taxonomic artifact. Of the first two, only the population or species as ancestor is used extensively in phylogeny reconstruction. We adopt the view that empirical or objective statements must be potentially falsifiable. The introduction of initial assumptions concerning the historical interpretation of empirical relationships can make phylogeny objective in this sense. We suggest that our outlook precludes identification of ancestors as self-evident. But, does it preclude hypotheses of ancestry? The strongest case for incorporating hypotheses of populational or species ancestors into phylogenetic reconstructions rests on the conclusion that the incorporation of such hypotheses seems to add to the information content of a purely \"cladistic\" statement. On morphological grounds, a statement of ancestor-descendant relationships would seem falsifiable if the hypothesis can be refuted by finding autapomorphies and can be corroborated by finding plesiomorphies in the supposed ancestor. We explore the nature of phylogenetic testing to assess this conjecture. In testing the relationships of a limited group of organisms, conflicts between alternate phylogenetic hypotheses may be resolved without introducing bias if those sets of characters which provide valid tests (the apomorphies) can be sorted out from those sets of characters which do not (the non-homologies and plesiomorphies). The weighting of characters as apomorphous, plesiomorphous, or non-homologous is an appeal to parsimony which represents an effort to sort out which set of characters provide tests of relationship within the problem at hand, given a higher level phylogeny. The resultant estimate will be the most parsimonious of the alternatives within the context of the higher level phylogeny. This estimate may or may not prove most parsimonious in an unweighted character analysis of the problem at hand carried out in isolation from the higher level phylogeny. It is the adoption of the higher level phylogeny which allows the investigator to objectively assess a problem of realistic proportions without ignoring relevant information. Plesiomorphies can not be used to test phylogenetic hypotheses because they are ad hoc statements required by the acceptance of the most parsimonious solution. Therefore, they can not provide corroboration for ancestor-descendant relationships. Autapomorphies are identified because they supposedly differ from the hypothetical ancestor. But, the ancestral morphotype is not a scientific statement, rather, it is a simple summary of characters derived from a cladistic hypothesis. An autapomorphy can only be identified by rejecting the alternate character as synapomorphous. We conclude that autapomorphies can not refute ancestor-descendant relationships. Therefore, given our initial assumptions, ancestor-descendant relationships based on morphology are not objective statements when applied to fossil populations or species. With the additional assumption that a particular cladistic relationship is true, ancestor-descendant relationships might be testable, but, this would render the cladistic relationships untestable. Another argument states that when fossil samples are close in time and space, it is more parsimonious to postulate that the ancestor is represented in the lower stratigraphic sample than to postulate it is missing. The apparent success of this argument rests on the requirement that the investigator answer a question that can not be answered objectively because its structure limits the alternate answers to non-objective statements.\n      </p>", "A systematic treatment of the entire genus Piptochaetium, which complements that of Cialdella and Arriaga for the South American species, is presented herein. A synopsis of 36 species and 2 varieties, a key to identify these species, as well as synonymy and geographical distribution, are given. Illustrations and photographs of diagnostic characters are presented for the North American species for the first time. We propose a phylogenetic hypothesis for the genus based on morphological and anatomical characters. Monophyly of Piptochaetium was supported by the combination of three synapomorphies: a grooved palea, involute lemma margins that fit into a longitudinal palea groove, and the palea protruding from the lemma. Two sections were previously recognized in Piptochaetium: Podopogon and Piptochaetium. The cladistic analysis showed that only South American species of Piptochaetium sect. Piptochaetium, together with P. brevicalyx, form a monophyletic group (Obovoid group), while Piptochaetium sect. Podopogon is polyphyletic. Therefore, the taxonomic recognition of sectional taxa cannot be supported. Phylogenetic relationships of two varieties of Piptochaetium stipoides (var. stipoides and var. echinulatum) were not clearly resolved. Furthermore, based on cladistic analyses, taxonomic observations, and the study of type material, Piptochaetium tovarii subsp. pilosa is raised to specific rank (= P. pilosum). /// Se presenta un tratamiento sistem\u00e1tico de todo el g\u00e9nero Piptochaetium, que complementa el propuesto por Cialdella y Arriaga para las especies sudamericanas. En este trabajo, se presenta una sinopsis de las 36 especies y 2 variedades, una clave para identificar las especies, su sinonimia, distribuci\u00f3n geogr\u00e1fica y observaciones. Se incluyen por primera vez ilustraciones y fotograf\u00edas de los caracteres diagn\u00f3sticos para las especies norteamericanas. Se propone una hip\u00f3tesis filogen\u00e9tica basada en caracteres morfol\u00f3gicos y anat\u00f3micos. Mediante el an\u00e1lisis filogen\u00e9tico, fue confirmada la monofilia de Piptochaetium sobre la base de tres sinapomorf\u00edas: una p\u00e1lea surcada entre los nervios, los m\u00e1rgenes de la lemma involutos insertos en el surco longitudinal de la p\u00e1lea y la p\u00e1lea asomando por entre los m\u00e1rgenes de la lemma. Dos secciones fueron previamente reconocidas para Piptochaetium: Podopogon y Piptochaetium. Como resultado del an\u00e1lisis clad\u00edstico, s\u00f3lo las especies sudamericanas de la secci\u00f3n Piptochaetium, junto con P. brevicalyx, conformaron un grupo monofil\u00e9tico (grupo Obovoide). Consecuentemente, en este tratamiento, no se considera v\u00e1lido el reconocimiento de categor\u00edas formales infragen\u00e9ricas. En el an\u00e1lisis, se incluyeron 2 variedades de Piptochaetium stipoides (var. stipoides y var. echinulatum) y la posici\u00f3n filogen\u00e9tica de ambas variedades no fue claramente resuelta.

In this study, 71 college couples participated in a survey. Findings indicate long-distance couples have more restricted communication and are more idealized than their geographically close counterparts. Further, an associative pattern between restricted communication and positive relational images is found. Speculation is offered that long-distance couples, due to their limited contact, postpone realistic assessments. Implications of these findings are discussed.\n      </p>", "Family therapists involved with religious communities as leaders, employees, or community members face unique challenges in evaluating the potential benefits and risks of dual relationships. Building on existing literature, we propose a three-level model of factors for therapists to use to evaluate risk: (a) professional ethics codes and legal guidelines, (b) theory of therapy, and (c) contextual variables and relationships among the therapist, the client, and the religious community.\n      </p>", "The family lives of lesbian and gay people have been a source of controversy during the past decade. Despite prejudice and discrimination, lesbians and gay men have often succeeded in creating and sustaining family relationships. Research on same-gender couple relationships, parent-child relationships, and other family relationships is reviewed here. In general, the picture of lesbian and gay relationships emerging from this body of work is one of positive adjustment, even in the face of stressful conditions. Research is also beginning to address questions about individual differences among the family relationships of lesbians and gay men. Future work in this area has the potential to affect lesbian and gay lives, influence developmental and family theory, and inform public policies in the decade ahead.\n      </p>", "The morphology of a macropterous form of Anommatocoris China is described for the first time, based on Anommatocoris bolivianus, new species.

However, the complexities of current health care and changes in the expectation of some patients and their families justify a review of such concepts. Their limitations and relativities may suggest that other descriptions of partnership and negotiated goal-setting, while based on respect for autonomy, reflect more modern and ideal multi-disciplinary practices. Discussion should extend beyond the 'classic' participants of patient and doctor to a more realistic picture where other health carers are included. It is therefore apposite that other professional relationships are considered as they affect areas of doctors' and patients' responsibilities. Such partnership between members of the team may not be without problems and conflict, but the principle of negotiated agreements could result in more long-term harmony, and greater patient welfare.\n      </p>", "We tested for the presence and importance of nonlinear relationships among bird species abundances and vegetation characteristics of the lower Colorado River valley. We transformed vegetation variables into polynomials and then ran multiple regressions, with bird densities as the dependent variables. Polynomial variables were selected in 36% of first steps and 45% of second steps in the regressions. In a significant number of cases there was a response to a polynomial variable but not to the original linear variable. Importance of curvilinear responses varied among bird species. This method offers a more comprehensive examination of responses to envirnomental gradients because unimodal and some skewed relationships can be detected.\n      </p>", "One of the issues arising out of the introduction of stalking legislation is how to distinguish between the kinds of courting behaviours, reconciliations, termination of relationships and other social interactions that are within the 'normal range' and those behaviours that are perceived by the wider community as stalking. This study examined the impact of intent, persistence, perspective and gender on perceptions of behaviours following the dissolution of a relationship. Responses of 868 community members indicated that behaviour was only perceived as illegal when explicit evidence of intent was present rather than when it was absent. Ratings for foreseeability of arousing fear were higher when explicit evidence of intent was present rather than absent and when behaviour constituted a repeated rather than single episode. Participants were more likely to determine that the behaviour of the actor would be repeated when the scenario depicted a repeat episode rather than a single episode. Suggested target responses differed according to whether or not the scenario depicted explicit evidence of intent to arouse fear. Results are discussed in relation to previous studies on community perceptions of stalking as well as the capacity of the research to inform interpretations of stalking legislation.\n      </p>", "The species-rich fynbos of the southern Langeberg Mountains, South Africa was studied along three transects (a) to evaluate the compatibility of a floristic classification of the southern Langeberg vegetation with a fynbos biome-wide structural classification of mountain vegetation, (b) to describe the environmental gradients to which the vegetation responds and (c) to investigate the relationship between the vegetation and the abiotic environmental variables which determine the pattern of distribution of the fynbos communities on the southern Langeberg. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was used to determine correlations between environmental variables independent of vegetation data. Similarities between the 46 communities (determined by floristics) from the three transects were determined using cluster analysis and grouped into 14 higher-level units. Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) was then used for indirect gradient analysis after which Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was used in a direct gradient analysis of the vegetation with the environmental variables. Compatibility between the floristic and structural classification of the vegetation was analysed. The PCA principal gradient was defined as one from sites with high rock cover, shallow soils and north aspects to those with low rock cover, deeper soils and south aspects. The second gradient is most strongly positively correlated with percentage organic carbon and most strongly negatively correlated with soil clay content. In contrast to the PCA, the DCA showed that the principal gradient is a precipitation gradient, with the response of the vegetation dominated by the change from wet to dry conditions and from low to high winter incoming radiation. The CCA showed that the variation in the mountain habitats to which the vegetation responds can be predicted from a combination of a few environmental variables. The principal gradient was one of change from high to low mean annual precipitation with an opposite change in winter incoming radiation. The second gradient was described by percentage surface rock cover and soil clay content. A simple model using the environmental factors selected in the CCA was proposed for predicting the distribution of floristically determined community groups in the fynbos vegetation of the Langeberg and the southern Cape coastal mountains in general.\n      </p>", "This study used computer-assisted content analysis of more than four hundred presidents' letters to shareholders to examine empirical linkages between cognitive strategic groups clustered by themes in the reports and strategic groups clustered by performance. We found these groups converged as predicted by the literature, and that mental models and performance are involved in a recursive process of competitive enactment which contributes to strategic group stability. Our research used inductively derived themes from the letters to structure a mental model widely shared in the pharmaceutical industry, and then employed thematic variations to find stable clusters of companies. These thematic clusters were triangulated with the strategic groups from a published study of the same industry, in the same period, and were shown to converge. Additionally, longitudinal linkages between earlier mental models of strategic goals and later reports of performance were found. The findings of our large-scale empirical study support strategic group theory, demonstrate a novel approach to data mining, and pose questions for future research.\n      </p>", "We used phylogenetic analyses of cytochrome b sequences of malaria parasites and their avian hosts to assess the coevolutionary relationships between host and parasite lineages. Many lineages of avian malaria parasites have broad host distributions, which tend to obscure cospeciation events. The hosts of a single parasite or of closely related parasites were nonetheless most frequently recovered from members of the same host taxonomic family, more so than expected by chance. However, global assessments of the relationship between parasite and host phylogenetic trees, using Component and ParaFit, failed to detect significant cospeciation. The event-based approach employed by TreeFitter revealed significant cospeciation and duplication with certain cost assignments for these events, but host switching was consistently more prominent in matching the parasite tree to the host tree. The absence of a global cospeciation signal despite conservative host distribution most likely reflects relatively frequent acquisition of new hosts by individual parasite lineages. Understanding these processes will require a more refined species concept for malaria parasites and more extensive sampling of parasite distributions across hosts. If parasites can disperse between allopatric host populations through alternative hosts, cospeciation may not have a strong influence on the architecture of host-parasite relationships. Rather, parasite speciation may happen more often in conjunction with the acquisition of new hosts followed by divergent selection between host lineages in sympatry. Detailed studies of the phylogeographic distributions of hosts and parasites are needed to characterize these events.\n      </p>", "Aim: To determine the empirical relationships between species richness and spatial turnover in species composition across spatial scales. These have remained little explored despite the fact that such relationships are fundamental to understanding spatial diversity patterns. Location: South-east Scotland. Methods: Defining local species richness simply as the total number of species at a finer resolution than regional species richness and spatial turnover as turnover in species identity between any two or more areas, we determined the empirical relationships between all three, and the influence of spatial scale upon them, using data on breeding bird distributions. We estimated spatial turnover using a measure independent of species richness gradients, a fundamental feature which has been neglected in theoretical studies. Results: Local species richness and spatial turnover exhibited a negative relationship, which became stronger as larger neighbourhood sizes were considered in estimating the latter. Spatial turnover and regional species richness did not show any significant relationship, suggesting that spatial species replacement occurs independently of the size of the regional species pool. Local and regional species richness only showed the expected positive relationship when the size of the local scale was relatively large in relation to the regional scale. Conclusions: Explanations for the relationships between spatial turnover and local and regional species richness can be found in the spatial patterns of species commonality, gain and loss between areas.\n      </p>", "According to The Resiliency Model of Family Stress, Adjustment, and Adaptation, certain family strengths can promote positive outcomes for children undergoing adverse or stressful circumstances. We proposed that chief among these potential strengths are high quality parent-child relationships. Data from self-report questionnaires from 190 long-term survivors (3+ years posttreatment) of childhood cancer were analyzed. The findings indicated that survivors who report better relationships with their mothers and fathers consistently report a higher quality of life, especially in the psychological domain. Although survivors reported better relationships with their mothers than with their fathers, father-child relations were associated more highly with survivors' reports of selective quality of life scales. Important implications for family therapists and practitioners are discussed, especially those that employ a growth or resilience approach.\n      </p>", "This study investigates the utility of the family of origin parachute model in predicting longitudinal outcomes for couples in romantic relationships. This conceptual model contains common family variables that are theoretically and empirically related to later adult functioning and are believed to influence attitudes that adult children develop regarding romantic relationships as well as self-esteem. Data from two samples were used to analyze this model. The results support the model and demonstrate its ability to predict membership in relationship satisfaction groups. Suggestions are presented for integrating the family of origin in applied work.\n      </p>", "A group of genera, e.g., Chamaesaracha, Leucophysalis, Physaliastrum, Margaranthus, and Withania, in the subfamily Solanoideae (Solanaceae) is centered around the genus Physalis and has been named the physaloid group. It comprises a number of small and often poorly known genera, sometimes seen as united with Physalis and/or each other. A hypothesis of the phylogenetic relationships within this group, based on parsimony analyses of morphological data, is here presented for the first time. The result is discussed in relation to prevailing generic circumsciptions and taxonomic consequences. It is also compared with hypotheses of relationships based on cpDNA data.\n      </p>", "Chemical concentrations in leaves are reported for 14 elements in 6 tree species of a montane rain forest in Sri Lanka. The plant taxa varied greatly in chemistry and a few taxa appeared to concentrate several elements in high amounts.

Several species seemed to have typical patterns of concentration ratios for certain elements and the interelement relationships of different species seemed to be repeated across varying habitat conditions.\n      </p>", "Parents and children are connected throughout their lives. Each generation experiences life course transitions, and these, in turn, influence the lives of the other generation. Using data from the 1987-1988 and 1992-1994 waves of the National Survey of Families and Households, we examine how life course transitions experienced by each generation affect changes in the adult child-parent relationship. There is substantial variability in child-parent relationships. Approximately one fifth of relationships deteriorate, and one fifth improve over this time period. Results indicate that parental divorce and declines in parents' health lead to deteriorating child-parent relationships. Problems in a child's marriage also strain the adult child-parent relationship. Gender has an important mediating effect on intergenerational relations, as evidenced by the differential effects on son-mother and daughter-father relationships of having children, changing work hours, and increasing distance.\n      </p>", "In this paper, seasonal changes in resource partitioning among Anolis lizards in the Luquillo rain forest in eastern Puerto Rico were investigated with the aim of understanding how climatic variation, competition and resource availability interact to affect niche relationships and community structure. Arthropod densities within the Luquillo forest were found to remain stable between the summer (July 1976) and winter (January 1977) seasons at lower levels of the forest but to decrease during the winter season at higher levels. Seasonal changes in the niche relationships of Anolis gundlachi, A. evermanni and A. stratulus included: (1) a winter season decrease in spatial overlap and spatial niche widths, (2) an expansion of the prey size and prey taxa components of the food niche during the winter. However, compared to anoles in more seasonal environments at Maricao and Guanica in southwestern Puerto Rico, anoles in the relatively aseasonal Luquillo forest exhibited greater niche stability between seasons and greater niche overlap during both seasons. At Maricao and Guanica, spatial niche widths and spatial overlap also decreased during the winter dry season but to a much greater extent than at Luquillo. Data on seasonal changes in food abundance, food consumption, and reproductive condition suggest that food competition is more intense during the prolonged dry seasons at Maricao and Guanica. Thus within Anolis communities, spatial overlap and spatial niche widths may be an inverse function of food competition and the degree of seasonal change in niche relationships may be directly correlated with the magnitude of seasonal fluctuations in food supply. Finally, loss rates of anoles from census areas at Luquillo were analyzed and suggested high rates of predation. The hypothesis was advanced that greater predation pressure may explain the generally higher levels of niche overlap among anoles in stable environments compared to more variable environments.\n      </p>", "This paper analyzes the performance implications of interorganizational relationships in the development of technological innovations, focusing on the characteristics of the tasks partitioned between a manufacturer and its suppliers in the development of new products. We identify two critical dimensions: (1) the design scope and (2) the level of task interdependency. The design scope dimension characterizes the type of problem-solving activities outsourced by the manufacturer. The level of task interdependency dimension characterizes the influence of any given supplier-manufacturer interaction on other activities within an overall innovation process. Data analyses on 50 supplier-manufacturer relationships drawn from three new product development projects show that the type of problem-solving activities being partitioned and their level of interdependency with the rest of the project are important predictors of performance outcomes of the relationship, controlling for contractual differences. Further, the analyses demonstrate a clear trade-off between short-term efficiency-increasing and longer-term learning-enhancing outcomes.\n      </p>", "First, two aspects of the partiality issue are identified: (1) Is it right/reasonable for professionals to favour their clients' interests over either those of other individuals or those of society in general? (2) Are special non-universalisable obligations attached to certain professional roles? Second, some comments are made on the notions of partiality and reasonableness. On partiality, the assumption that only two positions are possible -- a detached universalism or a partialist egoism -- is challenged and it is suggested that partiality, e.g. to family members, lies between these two positions, being neither a form of egoism, nor of impersonal detachment. On reasonableness, it is pointed out that 'reasonable' is an ambiguous concept, eliding the notions of the 'morally right' and the 'rational.' Third, a series of practical examples are taken from counselling, medicine, law, education and religious practice and some common principles are abstracted from the cases and discussed. These include truth-telling, confidentiality, conflicts of interest between clients and particular others and between clients and society. It is concluded that while partiality can be justified as a useful tool in standard cases, particular circumstances can affect the final verdict.\n      </p>", "Numerous studies have documented the prevalence of forced sex in heterosexual couples. Positive effects of this research include increases in awareness about the problem among helping professionals and the public, as well as increases in support services and prevention programs. However, no research has been done on sexual coercion in gay male and lesbian relationships, and few support services exist. Therefore, this study is an investigation of the prevalence and correlates of coercive sex in gay male and lesbian relationships. Participants were 36 women and 34 men who were in gay or lesbian relationships. The results indicated that 12% of the gay men and 31% of the lesbians reported being victims of forced sex by their current or most recent partners. The higher reporting rate among women may be due to greater awareness of issues pertaining to sexual abuse, and greater likelihood of identifying various forms of coercion as force. For men, being a victim of forced sex was generally associated with being a victim of other forms of violence. For both sexes, victims of forced sex believed that it would be relatively difficult to get counseling. Implications for support services are discussed.\n      </p>", "The purpose of this paper is to explore relationships among frogs that have been (variously) placed in the Ranoidea. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted on data sets including 10 morphological characters and sequences from portions of the 12S, 16S, and ${\\rm tRNA}^{{\\rm val}}$ mitochondrial genome. The resulting phylogenetic trees suggest that (1) the sooglossids are the sister group to all other microhyloid and ranoid frogs, (2) the Microhylidae may be the sister group of the Hyperoliidae, (3) the Hyperoliidae as classically defined may be diphyletic, (4) Hemisus appears to be a microhylid, and (4) the mantelline frogs may be clustered within the Rhacophoridae. Analysis shows that both morphological and molecular characters contain significant phylogenetic signal. Nonetheless, more morphological and molecular characters will be necessary to resolve completely the relationships among the deep branches of the Ranoidea.\n      </p>", "Phylogenetic relationships of the pantropical family Ebenaceae s.1. were investigated using plastid DNA sequence data from six regions: atpB, matK, ndhF, trnK intron, trnL intron, and trnL-trnF spacer. Sampling included representatives of all currently recognized genera of Ebenaceae, Diospyros, Euclea, and Lissocarpa, and nearly all taxa that were previously recognized at the generic level, e.g., Cargillia, Gunisanthus, Maba, Macreightia, Royena, and Tetraclis. Our results strongly support monophyly of Ebenaceae s.1. and demonstrate that the previous infrafamilar classifications of the family do not circumscribe monophyletic groups. A new infrafamilial classification based on a phylogenetic approach is proposed here and consists of two subfamilies, Lissocarpoideae and Ebenoideae, and four genera, Lissocarpa, Euclea, Royena, and Diospyros. Relationships and potential synapomorphic characters are discussed and summarized. This study supports a western Gondwanan origin of family and indicates that both vicariant and long-distance dispersal events played an important role in attaining current distributions.\n      </p>", "This study explored mothers' perceptions of how homelessness and shelter life affected family relationships. Participants reported increased closeness and heightened quality and quantity of interaction with their children, but a disruption in their roles as disciplinarians and providers/caretakers. Factors which mothers perceived to affect relationships were shelter conditions (rules and interactions with staff and residents), the mother's emotional state, and the child's emotional state, temperament, and behavior. Implications for practice are suggested.\n      </p>", "The mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene was sequenced from 16 individuals representing 10 species of the genus Geomys. DNA sequences of Cratogeomys castanops, Thomomys bottae, T. umbrinus, Dipodomys phillipsii, and Pedetes capensis were included as outgroup taxa. Levels of 12S rRNA sequence divergence (average 3.5%, range 0.6-7.5%) suggested low levels of genetic differentiation within Geomys, with the transition: transversion ratio lower than that observed in other mammalian groups. Relative rate tests did not detect significant levels of rate heterogeneity between Geomys and outgroup taxa; however, certain ingroup taxa did show significant levels of rate heterogeneity when compared with other ingroup members. Phylogenies consistently supported previously identified relationships among taxa of Geomys.\n      </p>", "The authors investigate the effect of managers' perceptions of two types of transaction-specific investments on their intention to terminate a current interorganizational relationship: (1) the specific knowledge necessary for a manufacturer's representative (rep) to carry out the selling function for a given manufacturer and (2) the specific knowledge reps acquire about their own customer accounts. The extent to which the length of prior relationship strengthens or weakens the hypothesized linkages is also examined. The authors test the hypotheses within the context of distribution channels (i.e., between a manufacturer and its selling agent), which are characteristic of many vertical organizational relationships. The results replicate in an additional setting some prior findings on the influence of transaction-specific investments between two parties directly involved in a relationship. The authors also find that specialized investments by a downstream partner (i.e., a manufacturer's rep) in relationships that are even farther downstream (i.e., customer accounts) can influence a manufacturer's intention to terminate the manufacturer-rep relationship. Moreover, the length of prior relationship between a manufacturer and its rep is shown to moderate this effect.\n      </p>", "Previous studies have concluded that southern ocean islands are anomalous because past glacial extent and current temperature apparently explain most variance in their species richness. Here, the relationships between physical variables and species richness of vascular plants, insects, land and seabirds, and mammals were reexamined for these islands. Indigenous and introduced species were distinguished, and relationships between the latter and human occupancy variables were investigated. Most variance in indigenous species richness was explained by combinations of area and temperature (56%)\u2014vascular plants; distance (nearest continent) and vascular plant species richness (75%)\u2014insects; area and chlorophyll concentration (65%)\u2014seabirds; and indigenous insect species richness and age (73%)\u2014land birds. Indigenous insects and plants, along with distance (closest continent), explained most variance (70%) in introduced land bird species richness. A combination of area and temperature explained most variance in species richness of introduced vascular plants (73%), insects (69%), and mammals (69%). However, there was a strong relationship between area and number of human occupants. This suggested that larger islands attract more human occupants, increasing the risk of propagule transfer, while temperature increases the chance of propagule establishment. Consequently, human activities on these islands should be regulated more tightly.\n      </p>", "We examined the reported influence of participation in research on individuals in premarital relationships. Data were from a larger longitudinal study of 60 dating couples. We designed a questionnaire to evaluate the effects of participation. Responses to open-ended questions revealed 3 major sources of influence: attention to relationship evaluation, effects on relationship activities, and indirect or no influence. Closed-ended items yielded 2 dimensions: relationship-defining influence and relationship-evaluating influence. Relationship-evaluating influence was greater the more respondents participated in the study. The higher were respondents' scores on relationship-evaluating influence, the more their relationship satisfaction increased over the year long study. We conclude that the effects of participating in the research are primarily educational and enriching in nature, rather than therapeutic as suggested in previous research (Rubin &amp; Mitchell, 1976).\n      </p>", "Forty women and partners were interviewed separately about changes in parent-child interactions and other family relationships after the mother had returned to college study. Mothers reported spending less time with each child. However, both parents generally reported that, overall, their children were not receiving more and better parental contact and that there had been qualitative improvement in father-child relationships, in particular. Rather than be guided by some earlier more pessimistic research, counsellors and educators are encouraged to recognize that the benefits to older women of returning to study and to their families seem widespread and important.\n      </p>", "This research examines the evolution of cooperative interorganizational relationships and provides an empirical test of four propositions from the DSO (Dwyer et al. 1987) life-cycle theory, and one proposition from the RV (Ring and Van de Ven 1994) theory of relationship development. Using primary data from over 1,500 resellers in a channel of distribution, we find that the mature phase is not the pinnacle of the relationship lifecycle; relationship properties (e.g., relationship harmony, overall dependence, and the reseller's trust in the manufacturer) in this stage are no different than in the build-up phase. However, relationship properties that support relationship expansion (e.g., goal congruence and information exchange norms) reach their zenith in the build-up phase and afterwards fade into the background. All of the various relationship properties hit their nadir in the decline phase. We also examine the development of relationships over a five-year period and consider whether movement across the stages in accordance with DSO's theory has the same association to overall performance evaluations as movement through regressive patterns. We find that a negative history extracts a price: Movement through regressive patterns is negatively related to performance, and these relationships do not enjoy a fresh start. Instead, these movements can last for an extended period of time and are negatively related to performance outcomes during the decline phase. Thus, the development path taken appears to be related to the results achieved. Finally, we also find evidence of the critical role that individual sales representatives play in creating successful interorganizational relationships.\n      </p>", "We studied parents' direct involvement in adolescent sibling relationships, including parents' reactions to sibling conflict and their time spent in the company of the sibling dyad. Participants were 185 White, working- and middle-class families; firstborns averaged 15 and secondborns averaged 13.5 years of age. In separate home interviews mothers, fathers and both adolescents described their personal and family relationship qualities and experiences. In a series of 7 evening phone calls, family members reported on each day's activities including the time they spent and their companions in 63 daily activities (e.g., do dishes, play sports, talk on phone). Analyses revealed 3 general conflict reactions by parents: (a) noninvolvement (e.g., tell siblings to work out problem themselves); (b) intervene (e.g., step in and solve problem); and (c) coach (e.g., give advice about how to solve problem). We found mother-father differences in conflict reactions and time spent with siblings; differences in parents' direct involvement as a function of the gender constellation of the sibling dyad also were evident. Direct involvement was linked to sibling relationship qualities and explained variance beyond that accounted for by an index of indirect involvement, that is, parental warmth. Further, parents' orientations toward autonomy were linked to the indices of involvement such that parents with stronger autonomy orientations were less involved, and parents' orientations explained variance in their involvement beyond that explained by adolescent characteristics.\n      </p>", "Relationships between habitat structure and spatial variations in vegetation composition were determined in catenas of central Argentina salt marsh landscapes. Vegetation was classified following a multi-technique strategy. An analysis of species distributions along an environmental gradient was made and a redundancy analysis was used to relate the environmental variables to vegetation data. The spatial covariation was evaluated through fractal analysis. The vegetation can be divided into four discrete noda that correspond to different topographic positions (summit, backslope, footslope and toeslope, respectively): nodum of Stipa trichotoma + St. tenuissima, nodum of Distichlis scoparia, nodum of Distichlis spicata and nodum of Spartina densiflora. Each of these nodum is characterized by a definite combination of floristic groups. Symmetric aggregation of vegetation borders was observed in all three sites. The existence of vegetation discontinuities along the catenas depended largely on water table depth and salinity which in turn controlled the edaphic salinity. The arrangement of sites by multivariate analysis reflected the influence of a complex gradient representing halomorphic and hydromorphic factors. \u03b2-diversity was associated with abrupt changes in the physical structure of the catena for a reduced spatial dimension (300-m scale). Absolute diversity and evenness were higher on the summit and declined progressively toward the toeslope. The rate of change was higher on the backslope and the dominant species have different ecological amplitudes overlapping along the gradient. The main operational factors associated with the floristic differences are: (i) the variations in the chemical composition and the seasonal dynamics of the soil solution in the aerated layer of soils, (ii) the salinity and dynamics of groundwater, and (iii) the length of time that the soil is flooded during the rainy season (summer). The fractal dimension was close to 2, implying weak spatial dependence. Fractal dimension varied as a function of scale. The fractogram only revealed a significant spatial dependence on the summit. This spatial dependence was associated with short distances of gradient showing that the organizational pattern of Distichlis spp.- Spartina was related to combinations of underlying environmental factors rather than to a specific position in the catena. The catenas are highly structured spatially, floristic compositions are inextricably linked to this structure. Habitat complexity may directly affect associated vegetation by regulating the hydrohalomorphic conditions in the aerated layer of the soils. The relationships of the habitat-floristic groups are not simple, hydromorphism interacts in a complex was with halomorphism.\n      </p>", "Multi-national corporations (MNCs) have been criticised for not behaving ethically in some situations, which could have a negative effect on their reputation. This study examines the ethics of a large MNC in its relationship with its suppliers. A brief literature review of corporate identity, business ethics and buyer-supplier relationships is undertaken. The views and perceptions of the buying staff and the suppliers to a large South African MNC are obtained and discussed. The results indicate that this MNC has a good corporate reputation among both its suppliers (an important stakeholder) and its own buying department. The existence and implementation of formal codes of ethics was found to be a necessary, but not sufficient condition for good ethical practice. Candid relationships with suppliers emerged as a second and important factor. Ethical perceptions of buyers by suppliers are driven by the management of corporate identity, through the elements of ethical standards and candid relationships. We present a model of corporate identity/reputation in Buyer-Supplier Relationships.\n      </p>", "Allometries and scaling relationships have become popular among biologists. One reason for this popularity is the generality of these relationships, which has provided authors hope that allometries and scaling relationships represent biological laws or explanatory generalizations. In this article, I discuss three roles of allometries and scaling relationships: the explanatory, the predictive, and the heuristic. I argue that allometries and scaling relationships often function successfully heuristically\u2014that is, discovering or elucidating patterns from data rather than making accurate predictions or giving illuminating explanations. The heuristic role is not to be overlooked. A science or discipline without interesting objects of explanation lacks the potential to progress and mature.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "This study used national longitudinal data to examine parent-child relationships before and after parental divorce. Parents' reports of problems in their relationships with children were significantly elevated as early as 8 to 12 years prior to divorce. Low quality in the parents' marriage largely accounted for these associations. Early problems in the parent-child relationship and low quality in the parents' marriage when children were 10 years old (on average) predicted low parental affection for children when they were 18 years old (on average). Divorce further eroded affection between fathers and children, but not between mothers and children. These findings suggest that the quality of the parents' marriage has both direct and indirect long-term consequences for parent-child affection.\n      </p>", "Multilocus protein electrophoresis was used to study the phylogenetic relationships among seven species of Strigiformes. Genetic divergence was quantified by Nei's unbiased standard genetic distance, and dendrograms were computed both with distance and parsimony methods. Caprimulgus europaeus was used an an outgroup. The average genetic distance between Tyto alba and the Strigidae was D\u0304 = 1.49; among the Strigidae was D\u0304 = 0.88. Dendrograms computed with distance methods, with or without assuming a molecular clock, as well as the character state matrix tree, support the following phylogenetic relationships: Tytonidae and Strigidae are very divergent lineages; Athene is ancestral to most of the modern Strigidae and is related to Strix; Bubo is related to Otus; Asio otus and Asio flammeus show high genetic distance. These findings have been discussed taking into account both DNA-DNA hybridization data and the fossil record. A tentative calibration of the molecular clock is used to date divergence times among the studied taxa.\n      </p>", "Management of Residual Open Spaces (ROS) in highly urbanized areas is currently receiving increased interest in the city of Hoboken and other municipalities along the Palisades in northeastern New Jersey. The preservation and proper utilization of these ROS requires a comprehensive management plan based on both a knowledge of community compositions and relationships of the pre-urbanized (natural) communities and the effects of urbanization on such communities. Working toward this goal, we have analyzed the forest compositions and relationships of the Greenbrook Sanctuary in 1949 and 1980 and 31-year changes which have occurred. The 1949 forest communities were analyzed utilizing unpublished historical documents and data generated during the late 1940's and early 1950's whereas the 1980 forest communities were analyzed using data generated during July-August 1980.\n      </p>", "We proposed a family process model that links maternal and paternal formal religiosity to marital interaction quality, parental cocaregiver support and conflict, parent-youth relationship quality, and parental use of inconsistent/nattering parenting strategies. The sample included 90 African American youths and their married parents, who lived in the rural South. African American community members participated in the development of the self-report instruments and observational research methods used to test the model. The results supported most of the hypotheses. Religiosity was linked with higher levels of marital interaction quality and co-caregiver support, and with lower levels of marital and co-caregiver conflict. The associations between religiosity and parent-youth relationship quality were mediated by the marital and co-caregiver relationships.\n      </p>", "Nonmarital romantic and sexual relationships occur concurrently with the human capital acquisition process and contribute to delaying or forgoing marriage. Event history analysis is used to model the marital hazard rate of 341 White women born between 1960 and 1963 in a Western metropolitan area. In addition to family background, adolescent characteristics, and employment and educational histories, the structure of the women's premarital liaisons is shown to play an important role in the timing of first marriage. The greater a woman's involvement in nonmarital romantic and sexual activity, the less likely she is to be married by age 27-30. Human capital characteristics and the dynamics of relationship histories operate independently to explain marital timing. This supports the theory that women substitute premarital liaisons for marriage early in the adult life course. However, there is no evidence that highly educated women, or those who are students, are more or less likely to do so than others.\n      </p>", "This paper seeks to uncover dominant configurations of interorganizational relationships across the United States and Japan in the automotive industry. We integrate relevant theoretical concepts from transaction cost economics, organization theory and political economy to develop a conceptual model of interorganizational relationships based on the fit between information processing needs and information processing capabilities. This model is employed to collect data on 447 buyer-supplier relationships in these two countries. We empirically uncover a set of five naturally occurring patterns of interorganizational relationships. These configurations provide rich explanations of the complexity of interorganizational relationships as well as offer differential insights across United States and Japan. We discuss implications for further research pertaining to the logic and development of configurations.\n      </p>", "Poltys and the genera Cyphalonotus, Homalopoltys, Ideocaira, Kaira, Micropoltys and Pycnacantha have historically been considered members of the tribe Poltyini. There is little published information on most members of the group and their potential relationships in the context of recent advances in araneid systematics. Information is sought on possible relatives of Poltys. All araneid members of the group except Pycnacantha were added to the data matrix compiled by Scharff &amp; Coddington (1997), which already contained Kaira. Homalopoltys was found to be a tetragnathid when males were identified and was not considered further. The full data matrix of 74 taxa and 82 characters was run in PAUP* and NONA. The resulting placement of Poltys was not well supported but it frequently occurred in association with members of a slightly modified version of the 'Hypsosinga clade' of Scharff &amp; Coddington, including Kaira. Cyphalonotus may be placed close to Araneus and Ideocaira may also belong in the same area of the araneines. Micropoltys may belong in the sister clade to these two.\n      </p>", "Person-centered education is a counseling-originated, educational psychology model, overripe for meta-analysis, that posits that positive teacher-student relationships are associated with optimal, holistic learning. It includes classical, humanistic education and today's constructivist learner-centered model. The author reviewed about 1,000 articles to synthesize 119 studies from 1948 to 2004 with 1,450 findings and 355,325 students. The meta-analysis design followed Mackay, Barkham, Rees, and Stiles's guidelines, including comprehensive search mechanisms, accuracy and bias control, and primary study validity assessment. Variables coded included 9 independent and 18 dependent variables and 39 moderators. The results showed that correlations had wide variation. Mean correlations (r = .31) were above average compared with other educational innovations for cognitive and especially affective and behavioral outcomes. Methodological and sample features accounted for some of the variability.\n      </p>", "1. The tree-ring growth response of stone pine (Pinus cembra L.) to climatic variability was studied in the Alps. The aims were (i) to assess tree-ring growth patterns at different spatial-temporal scales; (ii) to identify the climate parameters that explain most of the variability in radial growth at different time domains; and (iii) to study past and current trends in radial growth and climate-growth relationships at different locations. 2. High-and low-frequency stone pine chronologies were compiled for 30 treeline sites on the French and Italian Alps. We used gridded climate data computed from 200 years of instrumental records from an extensive Alpine network. Climate-growth relationships were computed with bootstrap correlation functions and their stationarity and consistency over time assessed with moving correlation. 3. No spatial patterns were detected in stone pine chronology statistics despite the regional clustering observed in tree-ring series and climate responses. This can be attributed to (i) local weather variability; (ii) different biophysical conditions caused by soil moisture, solar radiation, snowmelt dynamics and growing season length; and (iii) forest stand history and age structure, the expression of long-term land use and disturbances. 4. The exceptionally long-term climate records allowed significant stone pine growth response changes to be assessed at both annual and decadal time scales. Winter conditions and spring-summer temperatures mainly affected the growing season length, in addition to site carbon and water balance. Most of these limiting factors varied spatially and temporally along the latitudinal and longitudinal gradients in response to the corresponding changes in local conditions. 5. Our results show evidence of a clear response variability of Pinus cembra to climate limiting factors, at both spatial and temporal scale. Such knowledge extended to other species and regions will provide better estimates of the effect of climate variability on species distribution and dynamics within global change scenarios and more accurate past climate reconstruction and forest ecosystem modelling.\n      </p>", "Although the ongoing sharing of romantic intimacy is recognized as being health promoting and as a sought-after goal, there has been no consensus in the literature on a definition of the construct. The present paper proposes a multidimensional definition of romantic intimacy that was developed following a review and analysis of published definitions of intimacy. The differences between the constructs of love and intimacy are also discussed, as well as how the present definition may have value to family practitioners.\n      </p>", "This exploratory qualitative study used individual interviews and a focus group to investigate how women in Black-White interracial heterosexual partner relationships retrospectively described their racial identity development over the course of the relationships. Racial identity development, social constructionist, and feminist theories guided the grounded theory methodology. Participants described a process of restorying constraining narratives of racial identity into empowering racial identities through three types of strategies: blocking strategies, transforming strategies, and generating strategies.\n      </p>", "We studied the organization and temporal stability of an assemblage of malaria parasites (genera Plasmodium and Haemoproteus) and their passerine avian hosts in a forested study area in southern Missouri, USA, over four years. We detected parasite infections by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of parasite DNA from host blood samples and identified parasite lineages by sequencing a part of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. We obtained 757 blood samples from 42 host species. Prevalence of malaria parasitism judged by PCR averaged 38.6% and varied in parallel in the three most abundant host species over the four years of the study. Parasite prevalence bore a U-shaped relationship to host sample size. Prevalence was weakly positively associated with host body mass, but not with foraging stratum, nest height, nest type, plumage brightness, or sexual dichromatism. Over the sample as a whole, parasite prevalence did not vary between males and females or between hatch-year and older individuals. We differentiated 34 parasite lineages. The number of host species per lineage varied from one to eight and increased with sample size. We recovered up to 14 lineages of parasite from a single host. Three relatively common lineages in the Ozarks were found nowhere else; four others were recovered from other sites in eastern North America; and six additional well-sampled lineages were distributed in the Greater Antilles among resident island host species. Parasites that are endemic among native species of hosts on the tropical wintering grounds of Ozark birds were recovered from hatch-year birds in the Ozarks, indicating that transmission takes place on the summer breeding grounds, and consequently, that suitable vectors are present in both the temperate and tropical portions of the parasite lineage distributions. We estimate that the number of parasite lineages within a local area will approximate the number of host species and that our perception of host breadth and parasite diversity will increase for most lineages and hosts with increased sampling. Thus, host-parasite relationships in a local area, including the role of parasites in sexual selection and the evolutionary maintenance of sex, are likely to be complex, with population and evolutionary dynamics involving many actors.\n      </p>", "Scatter diagrams have historically proved useful in the study of associative relationships in ecology. Several important ecological questions involve correlations between variables resulting in polygonal shapes. Two examples that have received considerable attention are patterns between prey size and predator size in animal populations and the relationship between animal abundance and body size. Each is typically illustrated using scatter diagrams with upper and lower boundaries of response variables often changing at different rates with changes in the independent variables. Despite recent statistical contributions that have stimulated an interest in characterizing the limits of a variable, a consensus on an appropriate methodology to quantify the boundaries of scatter diagrams has not yet been achieved. We tested regression techniques based on least squares and least absolute values models using several independent data sets on prey length and predator length for piscivorous fishes and compared estimated slopes for consistency. Our results indicated that least squares regression techniques were particularly sensitive to outlying y values and irregularities in the distribution of observations, and that they frequently produced inconsistent estimates of slope for upper and lower bounds. In contrast, quantile regression techniques based on least absolute values models appeared robust to outlying y values and sparseness within data sets, while providing consistent estimates of upper and lower bound slopes. Moreover, the use of quantile regression eliminated the need for an excess of arbitrary decision-making on the part of the investigator. We recommend quantile regression as an improvement to currently available techniques used to examine potential ecological relationships dependent upon quantitative information on the boundaries of polygonal relationships.\n      </p>", "Because of the linear nature of riparian environments, direction and scale are closely linked. Cross-valley variation in mountain stream valleys is typically seen on a scale of meters, while variation up- and down-valley may be measured in kilometers. As a result, environmental factors at transverse scale (varying within a cross section) and at longitudinal scale (varying between cross sections) impose different patterns on vegetation. This paper compares these scale influences on the composition of woody riparian vegetation in southern California. Using cover data from 37 valley cross sections in the Transverse Ranges, and dividing these into four-meter segments, I determine segment values for the longitudinal-scale variables of elevation, years since burning, aspect, valley width and lithology, and for the transverse-scale variables of water-table depth, unit stream power (for the 20-year flood), and substrate particle size. The influence of variables at these contrasting scales on the vegetation composition are compared using detrended correspondence analysis, principal components analysis, multiple regression, and analysis of variance. The results show that transverse- and longitudinal-scale variables have significant influences on the vegetation, though neither scale is dominant. All of which suggests that the complex mosaic of riparian vegetation in this environment reflects the coincidence of environmental relationships operating in different directions on contrasting scales.\n      </p>", "We describe vegetation-environment relationships in the saltmarshes of central Argentina. Gradient analysis (Detrended canonical correspondence analysis, DCCA) was performed involving 14 parameters of the groundwater that account for most of the variation in plant communities. We used a stepwise multivariate procedure to classify the vegetation data into 8 clusters, named according to the most abundant characteristic species: Chloris canterai, Cynodon dactylon, Distichlis spicata, Spartina densiflora and Paspalum vaginatum clusters, containing relev\u00e9s of tall grassland communities, and Atriplex undulata, Cyclolepis genistoides and Heterostachys ritteriana clusters, containing relev\u00e9s from scrub. Our interpretation of DCCA ordinations suggests that vegetation pattern is primarily related to a salinity-moisture gradient. There is a strong relationship between vegetation type and the amount of salt in the groundwater and the pattern of its variation during the year. The depth of the groundwater and the conditions of submersion are also related to the compositional variation of the vegetation. Although flooding causes some differences between sites, the most important discriminant variable, and therefore the best predictor of floristic variation, is salinization.\n      </p>", "Modularity in product design and flexible supply chains is increasingly common in buyer--supplier relationships. Although the benefits of supply chain flexibility and component modularity for end-product manufacturers are accepted, little is known about their impact on suppliers. We advance the literature on modularity by exploring how three aspects of a supplier's relationships with its customers affect the supplier's survival: duration of buyer--supplier relationships, autonomy from customers, and links to prominent buyers. We compared the effects of these aspects of buyer--supplier relationships for low- and high-modularity components. Using data on U.S. carburetor and clutch manufacturers from 1918 to 1942, we found that suppliers of high-modularity components benefited more from autonomy provided by potential customers, whereas suppliers of low-modularity components benefited more from ties to higher status customers. Both benefited from autonomy generated by existing customers. Thus, relationships that require trust and extensive sets of interfirm routines, as do those for low-modularity components, led to both greater relationship benefits and greater constraints.\n      </p>", "This study examined differences in the quality of relationships between immigrant parents and their adolescent children as a function of the languages with which they speak to one another. Over 620 adolescents with East Asian, Filipino, and Latin American backgrounds completed measures on parent-adolescent language use and relationships. Adolescents who spoke in different languages with their parents reported less cohesion and discussion with their mothers and fathers than did their peers who spoke the same language with their parents. Adolescents who mutually communicated in the native language with their parents reported the highest levels of cohesion and discussion. Longitudinal analyses indicated that whereas language use did not predict differential changes in parent-adolescent relationships over a 2-year period, the quality of relationships did predict changes in language use. The associations between language use and relationships generally existed regardless of the families' ethnic and demographic backgrounds, and these associations did not vary across families of different backgrounds.\n      </p>", "This paper sets out to explore apparent contradictions between claims or assumptions to the effect that: (i) teaching is a profession; (ii) good teaching involves the cultivation of positive personal relationships with pupils; (iii) professional relationships should be of an essentially formal or impersonal nature. It is argued that the very real contradictions to which teaching as a professional occupation is prone are a function of fundamental tension between the essentially deontic character of professional principle and regulation, and the inherently 'virtue ethical' nature of teaching as a form of pre-theoretical and non-technical moral association. The paper concludes by identifying and offering some comment on three such areas of tension.\n      </p>", "In this article, the authors introduce the idea of a compound relationship; that is, for many pairs of firms, the overall relationship between the two firms is composed of multiple simple relationships: supplier to customer, and vice versa; competitor to competitor; and partners. This multiplicity of relationships can lead to both opportunities and challenges for each of the two firms in the dyad. The authors define the nature of compound relationships and delineate why it is important for the firm to treat them as such rather than focusing only on the simple relationships. They distinguish compound relationships from social networks and simple dyadic relationships and relate the construct to exchange theory, \"coopetition,\" and the interorganizational relationship literature in marketing. They then use the political economy framework to develop a set of conceptual propositions that apply to many aspects of compound relationships. They end with some speculations regarding the appropriate management of compound relationships and propose opportunities for further research.\n      </p>", "1. The social relationships in a group of Icelandic horses without a mature stallion were studied. The horses were all familiar to each other. Mutual grooming and play relationships, spatial associations, dominance-subordinate relations and the effect of kinship on these relationships were analysed. 2. The social structure was clearly dominated by the behaviour of the adult mares. The horses preferred to form bonds within their social class (sex/age) and they kept close proximity with their friends. The group was effectively divided into two social subgroups, adult mares as one group and adult geldings and sub-adults as another group. The sub-adults and adult geldings formed associations, which were based on mutual grooming and play, while the adult mares did not play. Differences between the sexes were evident. Males played more than the females, had more playing partners and were more popular as playmates. 3. Aggression rates were low. The dominance hierarchy was linear. Adult mares ranked higher than adult geldings, sub-adults and the foals. Rank was significantly correlated with age. The closer the adult mares were in rank, the more they groomed with each other. Such relationships were not found amongst the other social group. 4. Kinship was calculated between all pairs of animals for up to 4 or 5 generations. Allogrooming and play frequencies and proximity were all positively correlated with kinship. Adult mares, which were close in the dominance hierarchy, were on average more related than those further apart. 5. The social relationships in the Icelandic herd were, to some extent, different from relationships reported from unmanaged and feral horse-herds with mature stallions and bachelors. Our results suggest that adult mares groom more in groups without a stallion. Furthermore, they have more preferred partners than in natural harems and their partners are other adult mares, not their weaned offspring as seems to be the case in feral herds. The sub-adults also seem to be more socially active in the absence of stallions. Interestingly, in the Icelandic group, the adult mares showed stallion like behaviours, like mounting and protecting foals. Only by studying the behaviour and the nature of the relationships of horses in groups of different compositions, can we expect to gain a comprehensive understanding about individual social strategies and cognitive capabilities of the species. Such knowledge is valuable for management and welfare of the horse.\n      </p>", "Trust is a vital relationship concept that needs clarification because researchers across disciplines have defined it in so many different ways. A typology of trust types would make it easier to compare and communicate results, and would be especially valuable if the types of trust related to one other. The typology should be interdisciplinary because many disciplines research e-commerce. This paper justifies a parsimonious interdisciplinary typology and relates trust constructs to e-commerce consumer actions, defining both conceptual-level and operational-level trust constructs. Conceptual-level constructs consist of disposition to trust (primarily from psychology), institution-based trust (form sociology), and trusting beliefs and trusting intentions (primarily from social psychology). Each construct is decomposed into measurable subconstructs, and the typology shows how trust constructs relate to already existing Internet relationship constructs. The effects of Web vendor interventions on consumer behaviors are posited to be partially mediated by consumer trusting beliefs and trusting intentions in the e-vendor.\n      </p>", "Tepuis are uplifted mountains surrounded by forest or savannas in the Guayana Shield in northern South America. Large areas of the summits of these mountains are characterized by bare rock with vegetation isolates ('islands') that vary in size from less than 1 m2 to over 100 m2. The species composition, species-area relationships and the factors involved in the formation of these vegetation islands were quantified on Roraima Tepui, Canaima National Park, Venezuela. A total of 40 species were present on the islands, 35 of which were angiosperms. Orchidaceae was the family with the highest diversity, but Bonnetiaceae, Poaceae and Rapateaceae achieved higher coverage. A positive correlation between island size and species richness was found. This relationship was not linear and the best fit model between island size and richness was exponential. Of the environmental variables studied, the highest correlation was found between the log of soil volume and species richness. Soil nutrient availability, and not water, might be the limiting factor determining the species composition and diversity of these communities.\n      </p>"], "words": {"limited": {"number": 1,
