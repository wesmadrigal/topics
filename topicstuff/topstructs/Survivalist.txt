Applying this theory, I analyze survivalist entrepreneurship among Black women in the urban North during the Great Depression, when many Black women had to find an independent means of livelihood. I hypothesize that (1) the participation of Black women in entrepreneurial occupations, i.e., occupations that lend themselves to self-employment, was positively associated with the disadvantage of these women in the labor market and (2) Black women would be inclined to participate in those entrepreneurial occupations with low barriers to entry, namely, boarding and lodging house keeping and hairdressing and beauty culture. These occupations, according to a review of historical studies, provided northern Black women with their best opportunities for survivalist entrepreneurship. The analyses of census data support my hypotheses and suggest that the resource constraint version of the disadvantage theory of entrepreneurship is relevant to the economic adjustment strategies of northern Black women during the nation's worst employment crisis.\n      </p>", "Explanations of variability in public opinion on crime have drawn disproportionately from the literature on specific symbolic orientations including religious fundamentalism and racial prejudice. In contrast, this article hypothesizes that public opinion is linked to the strength of a general cultural axis of nations: survivalism vs. selfexpressionism. Data are from the fourth wave of the World Values Survey. Hierarchical modeling techniques are used to sort out the bi-level effects of survivalist culture on the approval of prostitution. Controlling for all other predictors, the personal survivalism index was the most powerful predictor of prostitution acceptability, followed by the country-level survivalism index. Unlike previous investigations, which relied on specific symbolic orientations, the present results suggest that attitudes about criminality are linked to a generalized cultural axis.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

First, it discusses the resources, constraints, and interests of the ministry of finance at the central government level. Second, it focuses on the roles the ministry of finance has played over time in Chinese economic policy making. These include a passive survivalist role; a bureaucratic interest group within three different types of coalitions; as a contender for power; and as a restorer of balance. Third, the roles the ministry plays are related to several broad independent variables, such as the political and economic climates, and the degree of financial centralization and decentralization. These structural variables are more effective in explaining the roles of the ministry than are ministry leadership variables.\n      </p>", "Despite public promises to the contrary, Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia continue to be ruled autocratically even as their civil societies aspire to greater public space. Rather than promoting concrete steps towards democratization including institutionalizing freedom of speech, association, and pluralistic political practices, the three states of the Maghrib are pursuing survivalist strategies leading to a robust authoritarianism that seems unlikely to be overturned anytime soon. Yet failure to transform authoritarian politics dramatically and decisively into a sustainable democracy will not only hamper long-term socioeconomic development but, more ominously, foster an environment within which radical forces will emerge to threaten domestic as well as regional and global stability. Current American efforts to promote democratic reform in the region must evolve more imaginatively if they are to meet the challenge of global terrorism that itself is so deeply embedded within the authoritarian impulse that can only be overcome through the democratic imperative.\n      </p>", "The dichotomous images of Jessica Lynch, a West Virginia soldier who was rescued from an Iraqi hospital in 2003, and Lynndie England, another West Virginia soldier whose picture became synonymous with prison abuse in Iraq in 2004, have necessitated a feminist contribution to the theorizing of the hillbilly as a cultural icon. This article examines historical, political, and literary contexts for diverting attention to the hillbilly as a defense against criticism of America as an uncivilized nation, connecting the narratives of Lynch and England with accounts of Eric Rudolph, a supposed mountaineer survivalist who in 2005 was convicted of bombing abortion clinics, a lesbian bar, and an Olympic celebration. In each case, the hillbilly-that liminal, primitive white icon of ambivalence about modernity's \"progress\" and its American discontents-is deployed culturally to mediate American military extremism, religious retribution, and terror.\n      </p>", "This paper demonstrates how \"Soldier of Fortune\" magazine can be read as an apocalyptic text which expresses a postmodern and secular form of the classical millennial myth. The millennial myth has accompanied the development of numerous emancipatory and utopian movements in the 2,000 year history of Christianity. In its American form, the myth renders America as the millennial \"Redeemer Nation,\" and it has played an important role in the nation's history and culture. \"Soldier of Fortune\" and the survivalist subculture it represents (including literature, products, and conventions) demonstrate the way the millennial myth becomes altered in form, redefined, and reproduced in the mass media and popular culture. The power of religious myths such as the millennial myth lie in their persistence and adaptability to changing times. The data were collected from a sample of \"Soldier of Fortune\" magazines 1983-1990; additional information derived from a study of the 15th Anniversary \"Soldier of Fortune\" Convention and Exposition held in Las Vegas, Nevada, in September 1990.\n      </p>", "In developing countries with high levels of corruption, people are often forced into small-business venturing or survivalist entrepreneurship because larger, more efficient firms do not exist. In developed countries, however, low corruption means that people choose entrepreneurship as a better means of innovating. In this article we use federal convictions of state and local officials and the Small Business Administration's firm formation data to test whether corruption within the United States forces some people into business venturing. We find that business venturing within the United States is caused in part by corruption.\n      </p>", "This paper provides an endogenous growth model to illuminate the role of entrepreneurial start-up firms in structural economic transformation. We follow the Lewis-model distinction between a traditional and modern sector and underpin this distinction with micro-foundations. We specify mature and start-up entrepreneurs and make a distinction between survivalist self-employment activities in the traditional sector and opportunity-driven entrepreneurship in the modern. The model shows how opportunity-driven entrepreneurship can drive structural transformation in both the modern and traditional sectors through innovation and the provision of intermediate inputs and services (which permits greater specialization in manufacturing) and by increasing employment and productivity.\n      </p>", "This survey argues that the substantial sub-genre of SF cinema which has entertained visions of nuclear Armageddon primarily concerns itself with survival as its dominant discursive mode, not disaster as suggested by Susan Sontag. From the early post-Hiroshima films which anticipated global atomic conflict, the '50s cautionary tales of short- and long-term effects, through to '80s hero myths of apocalypse, a discernable shift away from an imagination of disaster toward one of survival is evident. These films have drawn upon pre-existing mythologies of cataclysm and survival in their renderings of post-holocaust life, the most potent being a recasting of the Judeo-Christian messianic hero. The cinematic renderings of long-term post-nuclear survival appear highly reactionary, and seemingly advocate reinforcing the symbolic order of the status quo via the maintenance of conservative social regimes of patriarchal law (and lore). In this way the post-nuclear survivalist cycle of the '80s has signified another mode by which a generation has learned to stop worrying and love-if not the bomb-a (post-holocaust) future, which promises a compelling, utopian fantasy of a biblical Eden reborn in an apocalyptic millennia of peace on Earth.\n      </p>", "Lichens, a symbiotic relationship between a fungus (mycobiont) and a photosynthetic green algae or cyanobacteria (photobiont), belong to an elite group of survivalist organisms termed resurrection species. When lichens are desiccated, they are photosynthetically inactive, but upon rehydration they can perform photosynthesis within seconds. Desiccation is correlated with both a loss of variable chlorophyll a fluorescence and a decrease in overall fluorescence yield. The fluorescence quenching likely reflects photoprotection mechanisms that may be based on desiccation-induced changes in lichen structure that limit light exposure to the photobiont (sunshade effect) and /or active quenching of excitation energy absorbed by the photosynthetic apparatus. To separate and quantify these possible mechanisms, we have investigated the origins of fluorescence quenching in desiccated lichens with steady-state, low temperature, and time-resolved chlorophyll fluorescence spectroscopy. We found the most dramatic target of quenching to be photosystem II (PSII), which produces negligible levels of fluorescence in desiccated lichens. We show that fluorescence decay in desiccated lichens was dominated by a short lifetime, long-wavelength component energetically coupled to PSII. Remaining fluorescence was primarily from PSI and although diminished in amplitude, PSI decay kinetics were unaffected by desiccation. The long-wavelength-quenching species was responsible for most (about 80%) of the fluorescence quenching observed in desiccated lichens; the rest of the quenching was attributed to the sunshade effect induced by structural changes in the lichen thallus.\n      </p>", "Das Ziel dieser Studie war es, in Marabastad die Verkn\u00fcpfung zwischen formellen und informellen Sektor, sowie dessen innere Heterogenit\u00e4t zu untersuchen. Die erhobenen Daten wurden in einer SPSS Cluster Analyse daraufhin analysiert, ob sich bedeutende Gruppierungen von informellen Stra\u00dfenh\u00e4ndlern bei beiden Fragestellungen oilden.

Data was analysed by means of a SPSS cluster analysis to reveal major groupings of hawkers in both research foci. It was found that only a small number of hawker activities could be classified as growth enterprises whereas for the majority of street vendors trading is a survival strategy. The link to formal business was not as strong as reported in other studies and no significant clustering of hawkers could be found in the statistical analysis. The findings pose a major challenge to policy-makers and role-players in Marabastad because it will be difficult to promote informal enterprises without a significant reduction of their number. The fact that the informal economy consists mainly of survival enterprises calls into question the overall developmental role often posited for the informal sector: at least in Marabastad.\n      </p>", "In many developing countries, buyer-seller exchange among the poor occurs mainly in unique, socially embedded environments that are essentially informal markets. This article describes the findings of an in-depth, in situ study of an informal-economy subsistence marketplace in South India. Through interviews with consumers and owners of survivalist microenterprises, the authors identify seven themes that characterize the subsistence marketplace context, buyer-seller interactions within them, and specific elements of exchange. Drawing on these findings, along with theories of social capital and consumption in poverty, they make the case that business policy in developing countries should aim to empower subsistence entrepreneurs and consumers, embrace emergent solutions, help build bridges between informal and formal economies, and adopt a bottom-up orientation to policy development. The study's findings offer important insights into policy that can help microenterprises of the informal economy become engines of economic growth in these countries.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "This essay updates and refines Peck and Tickell's important notion of global-local disorder that is identified as the centrepiece of their classic thesis 'Jungle law breaks out'. Three points are offered to nuance this concept in today's complex political-economic times. First, we need to identify local governances as more vibrant and active in engaging capital. Whereas Peck and Tickell present a constricted, moribund local governance, I posit this formation as surprisingly active (i.e. it accepts and spurns fractions of capital). Second, we need to recognise the importance of the national scale in structuring governance-driven economic development. While Peck and Tickell posit an essentially 'hollowed out', unimportant national scale, I suggest that this scale continues to house an important resource routinely tapped by local economic development actors: nationalist ideologies. Third, we need to identify the most recent survivalist strategy used by local governances: the deploying of the 'economy of fear' generally and the 'global trope' in particular. Peck and Tickell provide little specificity about this governance's ability to negotiate turbulence and contradiction. These points are meant as refinements of a thesis that I suggest is still important in guiding our understanding of contemporary economic development policy in the UK and US.\n      </p>", "Data were collected on annual (1980-1983) and seasonal (spring vs. summer) variation in reproduction by the double-brooded Eastern Phoebe (Sayornis phoebe) to test the proposal that phoebes modify reproductive patterns on a seasonal basis and switch from being brood survivalists in spring to brood reductionists in summer. Clutch size did not differ between spring and summer broods nor among years, but spring nests fledged one more nestling than summer nests. In 1981 breeding began earlier, eggs were larger, and nestlings grew faster than in all other years. Clutch size and egg mass within spring clutches increased seasonally. Egg mass was also larger in summer clutches. These observations suggest that food is usually limited during the initiation of spring clutches. However, because spring broods were more productive than summer broods, I predicted that phoebes should act as brood survivalists in spring, but become brood reductionists in summer. All predictions were supported. During the spring: (a) clutches hatched synchronously; (b) egg mass increased significantly with laying order; (c) hatch order had little impact on nestling growth and; (d) last-hatched young fledged as frequently as their siblings. However, during the summer: (a) clutches hatched asynchronously; (b) egg mass did not consistently vary with laying sequence; (c) hatch order had a significant negative impact on growth; and (d) last-hatched young fledged only about 50% of the time. Thus, phoebes seemed to adaptively shift reproductive patterns seasonally, switching from a brood-survivalist strategy in spring to a brood-reductionist strategy in summer. However, I suggest that proximate responses to food availability provide a more parsimonious explanation for the observed patterns. The increase in egg mass with laying sequence was most likely the result of progressive increases in food availability in spring. Higher food availability and reduced energy demands during summer probably also allowed females to lay uniformly large eggs and start incubation sooner. The latter resulted in greater hatching asynchrony in summer clutches. The poorer growth and higher mortality of last-hatched young in summer resulted from a severe size disadvantage that was the result of the greater asynchrony of summer broods. Thus, brood reduction in summer was probably an incidental and nonadaptive outcome of hatching asynchrony.\n      </p>", "This article examines the interplay of agency, culture and context in order to consider the social embeddedness of money and trade at the margins of South Africa's economy. Focusing on small-scale, survivalist informal enterprise operators, it draws on socio-cultural analysis to explore the social dynamics involved in generating and managing wealth. After describing the informal sector in South Africa, the article elucidates the relationship between money and economic informality. First, diverse objectives, typically irreducible to the maximization of profit, animate those in the informal sector and challenge meta-narratives of a 'great transformation' towards socially disembedded and depersonalized economic relationships. Second, regimes of economic governance, both state-led and informal, shape the terrain on which informal economic activity occurs in complex and constitutive ways. Third, local idioms and practices of trading, managing money and negotiating social claims similarly configure economic activities. Fourth, and finally, encroaching and often inexorable processes of formalization differentially influence those in the informal sector. The analysis draws on these findings to recapitulate both the ubiquity and centrality of the sociality at the heart of economy, and to examine the particular forms they take in South Africa's informal economy.

The author documents and analyzes three subcultures' constructions of Y2K. The three subcultures are millennial (Evangelical-Charismatic-Pentecostal) Christians, militia-patriot survivalists, and computer professionals. Each subculture interpreted, received, comprehended, and explained the cultural object of Y2K. Combining the data from content analysis and interviews, the author creates a detailed picture of each subculture's response to Y2K. She compares and contrasts the three subcultures. Each subculture created a subcultural filter based on previously held value and belief systems, attitudes toward technology and computers, and interpretations of social environments to create a unique picture of Y2K. She examines how each of the subcultures framed technology through the framing of it as a technological object. Each response was located within the technological determinism versus social determinism debate and juxtaposed with its place in the technology as utopian or dystopian.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "r />\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sociology.uchicago.edu/ajs/about.shtml\">Editorial Office Website</a>\n<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1290223406099/AJSrecform.pdf\">Library Recommendation Form</a>\n<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"/page/publisher/ucpress/adv.html\">Advertise in <i>AJS</i></a>\n<br />\n</p></p>\n\t\t\t", "r />\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sociology.uchicago.edu/ajs/about.shtml\">Editorial Office Website</a>\n<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1290223406099/AJSrecform.pdf\">Library Recommendation Form</a>\n<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"/page/publisher/ucpress/adv.html\">Advertise in <i>AJS</i></a>\n<br />\n</p></p>\n\t\t\t", "", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Some philosophers believe he held that human persons survive their deaths.Other philosophers think he held that human persons cease to exist at their death, but come back into being at the general resurrection. In this paper, I defend the latter view against one of the most significant objections it faces, namely, that it entails that God punishes and rewards separated souls for the sins or merits of something else: the (non-existent) persons to whom those souls once belonged. The objector takes this entailment to be problematic. I argue that it fits in well with St. Thomas's views about punishment and about persons.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
