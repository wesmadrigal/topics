{"total_words": 848, "documents": ["The objective of this descriptive study was to analyze the contents of self-help books for parents of adolescents that were published from 1980 to 1993. Child developmentalists, counselors, and family life educators endeavor to provide valid information about child and adolescent development to parents through various media, including popular books, in order to assist in parenting. We examined the scope of topics presented and the authors' views about parenting practices to determine the extent to which these parenting books reinforce or debunk cultural stereotypes about adolescents. The most frequently occurring topic across the books concerned the significant role of the family in shaping adolescent development. Although the information presented in these books does not explicitly reinforce stereotypes of adolescence, few authors devoted attention to refuting existing myths.\n      </p>", "Using an analysis of child care books and parenting Web sites, this article asks if second-wave feminism 's vision of gender-neutral child rearing has been incorporated into contemporary advice on child rearing. The data suggest that while feminist understandings of gender have made significant inroads into popular advice, especially with regard to the social construction of gender, something akin to \"a stalled revolution \" has taken place. Children's gender nonconformity is still viewed as problematic because it is linked implicitly and explicitly to homosexuality.\n      </p>", "The author describes an introductory economics course in which all of the reading material is drawn from the Great Books of Western Civilization.

The new convent later established its own scriptorium, which produced numerous codices, including liturgical choir books, manuscripts from the Polish Carmelite convent of Lwow were later added to the collection. The surviving codices now number twenty-five choir books from both the medieval and Tridentine eras. Table 1 gives an entire list of the Carmelite Codices of Krakow. Table 2 enumerates the feast celebrated in the medieval Krakow Carmelite liturgy. These codices offer valuable insights into Carmelite liturgical practices before and after the Council of Trent.\n      </p>", "Sociologists tend to publish either in the form of articles in scholarly journals or in the form of books. This paper attempts to show that not only do specific university departments have scholarly cultures emphasizing one or the other, but that structural and demographic factors --such as location, public or private status, and size --are correlated with each. Book departments tend to be found at exclusive private universities in or near big cities on both coasts, while article-producing departments tend to be in land grant universities in the South and Midwest. Recognizing that such publication decisions are not purely scientific in nature but are also partially socially constructed ought to allow us to have more diversity in how departments structure their scholarly cultures.\n      </p>", "A modern form of narrative, comic books are used to communicate, discuss, and critique issues in business ethics and social issues in management. A description of comic books as a legitimate medium is followed by a discussion of the pedagogical uses of comic books and assessment techniques. The strengths of the pedagogy include crossing cultural barriers, understanding the complexity of individual decision-making and organizational influences, and the universality of dilemmas and values. We provide an initial source for educators on the topics, comic books, plotlines, and other commentary for consideration of use in the classroom from high school to graduate business ethics and social issues in management courses.\n      </p>", "This paper discusses the extent to which books about business ethics are purchased or read outside of tertiary institutions in Australia, whether the subject is commonly perceived as business, philosophy or both, what range of business ethics books is commonly offered for purchase, and what conclusions might be drawn from the above considerations. Investigation shows that the range and availability of busienss ethics books is quite limited outside of tertiary institutions, and that the general perception is that business ethics is something which pertains specifically to business rather than to moral philosophy. It is likely that this tends to isolate the subject from philosophy as broadly conceived in the minds of business practitioners.\n      </p>", "Explanations of the past both reflect and influence the way we think about the present and future. Like artists and politicians, social movements develop a \u201creputation\u201d that includes a capsule history of a movement's origins, goals, and impact. Both popular narratives and scholarly treatments identify four books published in the early 1960s as having spurred important social movements and government action. This \u201cbig book myth\u201d provides a simple origins story for social movements, a version of an \u201cimmaculate conception\u201d notion of social change. We compare the mythic accounts of feminist, environmental, anti-poverty, and consumer movements of the 1960s to fuller histories of these movements and find consistent distortions in the common big book narratives. Mythic accounts shorten the incubation time of social movements and omit the initiating efforts of government and political organizations. The myths develop and persist because they allow interested actors to package and contain a movement's origins, explicitly suggesting that broad social dynamics replicate idealized individual conversion stories. They also allow actors to edit out complicated histories that could compromise the legitimacy of a movement or a set of policy reforms. These mythic accounts spread and persist because they simplify complicated social processes and offer analogues to the individual process of becoming active, but they may lead us to misunderstand the past and make misjudgments about collective action and social change in the future. We consider those implications and call for more research on the construction of myths about the past.\n      </p>", "The ever-increasing quality and quantity of recently-published books in Spanish for children and adolescents are evident in the books discussed in this paper. From folklore to poetry, to nonfiction, to classics, to contemporary fiction, these books, published worldwide, will satisfy and inspire eager minds as they are exposed to well-written books that they can read and understand. Toddlers and the very young delight in boardbooks and wordless spreads. Beginning readers appreciate books with simple, repetitive texts. The humor and excitement evident in traditional tales and tonguein-cheek stories are enjoyed by all.\n      </p>", "Eleven stepfamily self-help books for children and adolescents were reviewed and critiqued. The books were coded on several dimensions: appropriate audience, authors' background, issues identified, advice given, strengths presented. The general interest and quality of writing were rated and books were assigned to one of three categories: highly recommended, recommended, recommended with reservations. The use of the books as an adjunct to therapy was discussed.\n      </p>", "Children's first school books contain a considerable amount of reported talk among characters in the stories. This is a central aspect of the characterization of these books as transitional from the conventions of oral language to the conventions of written prose, that is, as introductions to literacy. The nature of the written representation of conversation in such books has not previously been examined. This paper presents a partial analysis of this feature of beginning school readers, focussing on \"question-answer sequences.\" We show how these representations of talk compare with naturalistic research on child-adult interaction at home and in classrooms, and we propose that the model of child-adult talk portrayed in \"home\" and \"school\" scenes in the books appears to endorse some of the conventions for participation in instructional talk, and in this respect is implicitly a source of socialization into classroom culture. At the same time, we find that the texts give child speakers far more initiative in conversation than typically obtains in classroom talk, and this is seen also to be a feature of the social constitution of the child in these texts. Thus an image of childhood which combines conversational initiative and conversational competence as a member of the classroom community is conveyed. The paper also points out possible difficulties for child readers in interpreting the talk-on-paper, arising both from textual formats and from the particular version of the child as conversationalist which the books describe.\n      </p>", "In this archival study, themes of authoritarianism (Adorno, Frenkel-Brunswik, Levinson, &amp; Sanford, 1950) were content coded in American comic books. Comic books produced during years of relatively high social and economic threat (1978-82 and 1991-92) contained more aggressive imagery, more conventional themes, less intraception, and fewer spoken lines by women characters relative to comic books produced during years of relatively low threat (1983-90). Unexpectedly, speaking roles for characters of color did not differ due to the influence of threat. Discussion focused on the theoretical relationship between threat and manifestations of authoritarianism at the societal and individual levels.\n      </p>", "This paper looks at the ways in which popular science books, through their explicit insertion of science into the public domain, act to reinforce a distinct demarcation between scientists and their publics. It is argued that these books acquire a distributed media presence by acting as nodal points in an intertextual web. The intertextuality of popular science books causes images of science which are supportive of scientists' interests to continue to circulate in public discourse despite the alternative images thrown up by public scientific controversies reported in the news. The paper looks at examples of popular physics books which, like many other popularizations of physics, draw explicitly on science fiction. Since these texts do not respond to any specific controversy within or around science, they provide examples of 'routine' boundary work. It is argued that by working at multiple boundaries, texts such as these are able to claim potentially contradictory attributes for science at the same time as sustaining its place at the top of a hierarchy of ways of knowing.\n      </p>", "Descriptions of sea ice in Hudson's Bay Company ships' log-books and trading post journals are used to reconstruct sea ice conditions in Hudson Bay, James Bay, and Hudson Strait in the summer of 1816. The results demonstrate that exceptionally late sea ice dispersal occurred in James Bay, southeastern Hudson Bay, and at the western extremity of Hudson Strait. A relatively intense flow of ice in the Labrador current occurred at the eastern extremity of Hudson Strait. These patterns of ice behaviour are indicative of the prevalence of northwesterly atmospheric circulation over this region in the summer of 1816. /// Les archives de La Compagnie de La Baie d'Hudson ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consult\u00e9es pour reconstruire les conditions des glaces de mer.

This article explores how eighteenth-century artists reproduced a novel and idealizing version of antiquity out of the excavated and collected remains. We will follow the process whereby the collection of ancient vases belonging to Sir William Hamilton, the British ambassador in Naples, were reworked as two-dimensional canvas paintings and published as engravings in a luxury folio, Collection of Etruscan, Greek and Roman Antiquities (Naples, 1766-76). These folios were not only collected as 'ornaments' for the aristocratic library, but their coloured plates were utilized as 'pattern books' by English artists and craftsmen hand-crafting and mass-producing a range of imitation antique furniture (including pottery, furniture and fabrics) for the \u00e9lite English home. In the course of my article, we witness the transference and transformation of classical artefacts to a neoclassical setting: transposed from an ancient material culture in Italy into a new (fabricated) material culture in England. Through the transformation of the ancient material evidence, we witness the preoccupations of an eighteenth-century consumer society. That is, a society in which the acquisition and reproduction of 'antiquity' as possession is a means to manufacture material objects and social opportunities.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Contrary to predictions of a transference effect, critical foil lineup identifications did not differ across conditions. To test for a commitment effect, only participants who selected the critical foil in the mug book were considered; there was evidence of a commitment effect in the large mug book condition.

After he returned to London he carried on a correspondence with Cassiano in letters of more than ordinary interest. Cassiano had sent Ent specimens of fossil wood and a table made from fossil wood. They had come from the estates at Acquasparta belonging to Prince Federico Cesi, the founder of the Accademia dei Lincei. The specimens and the table were shown to early meetings of The Royal Society and had a significant part in the developing debate on the origin of fossils.

Correspondences among Poe's tale and the ones that surround it in The Gift invite us to read \"The Purloined Letter\" in relation to the social economy of the gift book and against the background of what could be called its generic plot. While the mainstream stories reemphasize commercial strategy based on commodified seduction, I contend that \"The Purloined Letter\" provides us with a more complex model that both fulfills the reader's expectations and critiques the underlying ideology of \"The Gift.\" I therefore show how Poe \"purloins\" the gift book's typical gender economy and how the homosocial eroticism of his tale bears on its famous twentieth-century readings.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

A significant minority of patients admitted to Ashburn Hall turned to religion to interpret their surroundings, express their feelings, or assert their identity within the space of the asylum. For those allowed out of the asylum to attend their own denominational services, religion also opened up a community other than the forced community of the asylum.

Seven children from an urban Head Start classroom participated in 6 small-group read-aloud sessions of 3 typical information books. Children were encouraged to respond to the books, though their responses were not guided or directed. After each read-aloud session, the children were invited to participate in a group pretend reading of the book they had just heard. Transcripts of each audiotaped session were analyzed. Responses were coded according to a content analysis system that included focus of talk and type of talk. Pretend readings were analyzed in order to learn about children's knowledge of information book language and about the ways in which children used textual and illustrated information to make sense of the books. Children's responses suggested attention to both the illustrations and the text of these information books, though their attention was more often directed at the illustrations than at textual information. Responses also indicated that children took both aesthetic and efferent stances during the readings. Children tried out the information book language during their pretend readings, often mixing typical information language features (such as describing classes of objects and characteristic events) with more specific descriptions of illustrations. The results indicate that even young children are attuned to characteristics of texts and that those characteristics (especially illustrations) have a powerful influence on children's responses.\n      </p>", "Though evidence is slight that books ever helped spread the epidemics of smallpox, tuberculosis, and scarlet fever that raged in American and European cities at the turn of the century, fear of such a possibility led public libraries to adopt extraordinary measures in efforts to decontaminate books that had circulated to infected borrowers.

In both Britain and America, the problem proved a challenge for the public health and library movements-both in their infancy.

In early isolarii it usually appeared in a round insular shape featuring four main monasteries--a representation that bears no resemblance to reality. Scholars have tended to dismiss these representations of Mount Athos as rudimentary and inaccurate. This article offers a re-evaluation of the maps in their context, interrogating them in their cultural specificity and as complex visual artefacts. As part of a long manuscript tradition, these maps were liable to change over time and according to the geographical contexts in which they were copied. This approach leads to the suggestion that rather than being representations of reality, isolarii maps of Athos were intended mainly as mnemonic and moral devices for self-edification. /// Le Mont Athos, le troisi\u00e8me doigt de la presqu'\u00eele de Chalkidike dans le nord de la Gr\u00e8ce, enclave monastique autonome pendant plus d'un mill\u00e9naire, est un trait frappant dans les livres d'\u00eeles de la Renaissance.

While it is often assumed that books are more important to the discipline than articles, there is little evidence on their relative scholarly impact. The present paper assesses the scholarly impacts of 100 books and compares them to the impact of articles in the American Sociological Review. On the average, monographs, the elite form of book publishing, received 8.01 citations and ASR articles received 5.49 citations per year. The results of a multiple regression analysis indicate that monographs and articles have similar levels of scholarly impact. Past scholarly reputation of the author had, however, the largest effect on the impact of books and articles. I conclude that both \"scholarly cultures\" are viable means for developing the stock of sociological knowledge; subjective ratings of the impact of books relative to ASR articles are. however, much higher than objective ratings.\n      </p>", "The Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus (1707\u20131778) is reputed to have transformed botanical practice by shunning the process of illustrating plants and relying on the primacy of literary descriptions of plant specimens. Botanists and historians have long debated Linnaeus's capacities as a draftsman. While some of his detailed sketches of plants and insects reveal a sure hand, his more general drawings of landscapes and people seem ill-executed. The overwhelming consensus, based mostly on his Lapland diary (1732), is that Linnaeus could not draw. Little has been said, however, on the role of drawing and other visual representations in Linnaeus's daily work as seen in his other numerous manuscripts. These manuscripts, held mostly at the Linnean Society of London, are peppered with sketches, maps, tables, and diagrams. Reassessing these manuscripts, along with the printed works that also contain illustrations of plant species, shows that Linnaeus's thinking was profoundly visual and that he routinely used visual representational devices in his various publications. This paper aims to explore the full range of visual representations Linnaeus used through his working life, and to reevaluate the epistemological value of visualization in the making of natural knowledge. By analyzing Linnaeus's use of drawings, maps, tables, and diagrams, I will show that he did not, as has been asserted, reduce the discipline of botany to text, and that his visual thinking played a fundamental role in his construction of new systems of classification.\n      </p>", "We constructed a corpus of digitized texts containing about 4% of all books ever printed. Analysis of this corpus enables us to investigate cultural trends quantitatively. We survey the vast terrain of 'culturomics,' focusing on linguistic and cultural phenomena that were reflected in the English language between 1800 and 2000. We show how this approach can provide insights about fields as diverse as lexicography, the evolution of grammar, collective memory, the adoption of technology, the pursuit of fame, censorship, and historical epidemiology. Culturomics extends the boundaries of rigorous quantitative inquiry to a wide array of new phenomena spanning the social sciences and the humanities.\n      </p>", "In descriptive models of non-routine buying behavior, a consumer is traditionally regarded as passing through a sequential hierarchical decision-making process consisting of six phases: problem recognition, information acquisition, information evaluation, choice, purchase and post-purchase evaluation. This paper discusses the modelling of the decision-making process and deals only with choice within one product class: i.e. books belonging to the category of fiction. The paper argues that buying books is in most cases a choice problem which is too complex to handle in one sequential hierarchical decision making process, employing a linear decision rule. The complexity of the choice problem is caused by a huge and rapidly changing book-supply, the sequential structure of information on books, a limited degree of comparability of alternative titles and the tendency of buyers of books to base their evaluations an many attributes.\n      </p>", "According to Salomon's (1981) model, children usually invest less effort in television viewing than in book reading, with the result that information from television is less deeply processed than information from books. The amount of invested mental effort, in its turn, is assumed to depend on the way a medium is perceived. Most children perceive television as an easy medium and books as a difficult one. In this article, Salomon's model and the research in which the model was tested are discussed, and a replication study is presented. The study determines the internal structure of the Dutch versions of Salomon's instruments and tests some predictions following from the model. Unlike their American peers, Dutch children do not unconditionally perceive television as an easy medium.\n      </p>", "Larrick (1965) observed that few children's books portrayed Blacks, and Miller (1998) has claimed this observation is particularly germane for Newbery Medal books. Weitzman et al. (1972) pointed out that female characters were practically invisible in picture books produced during the 1960s and that this was especially true for Caldecott Medal and honor books. This paper examines the degree to which the problems of female and minority invisibility in children's books honored by the Newbery and Caldecott committees has been ameliorated by these critiques, as well as the progressive social movements in which they were embedded, as well as by earlier social movements of the 20th century. I examine data on essentially all books honored by these two committees. I find that female characters were highly visible in Newbery and Caldecott books during World War II, became much less visible after the war, became much more visible after Weitzman et al.'s (1972) critique and have suffered declining visibility within the Caldecotts since the late 1980s, while enjoying increasing visibility within the Newberys since then. I find minority characters, particularly Black characters, enjoyed increased visibility in Newbery and Caldecott books after Larrick's (1965) critique, reached a second peak in visibility during the 1990s, but became slightly less visible in both sets of books in the first half decade of the 21st century.

Song categories found across these books were: folk, composed (including patriotic, hymn, chorus/opera), and Christmas, consisting of folk and composed songs. The rank ordering of categories changed over time. Patriotic songs were found in all books. Approximately half of the songs in later books were folksongs. The earlier dated books and Hirsh 's lists contained hymns and choruses/opera. Christmas songs were not found in the earliest or the latest books.

The goal of the study was to investigate the college's undergraduates' usage and attitudes toward electronic books. The study grew from the college librarians' informal observations of students' reactions, many times negative, to e-books over a four-year period. Results ran counter to what one might expect of undergraduates belonging to the Millennial or \"net\" generation. The findings show that students have mixed feelings about using e-books; students will use e-books but prefer using traditional print books.

Various methods of estimation are used, and they provide surprisingly unambiguous results. Our hypotheses about the price and income sensitivity of book demand are confirmed. Books turn out to be \"luxury\" goods. Our calculations do also suggest that they are quite price sensitive and that they are close substitutes to other cultural goods. The results for socio-demographic variables indicate that access to outlets for books, sex and age matter for book demand. Moreover, we find that single persons and households with small children, especially those with children less than 7 years, are frequent book-buyers.\n      </p>", "A great deal of attention has been paid to the role of women in Iran since the revolution of 1978. Western writers have usually depicted a return to sex role segregation and degradation of the status of women while the local Iranian government claims that women's status has improved since she is now participating openly in the political process. In any case, defining women's place in Iranian society has been considered an urgent matter after the revolution and the formal socializing agents have been among the first to be controlled so as to adhere to the traditional orientation toward women. By examining the elementary school books which are prepared by the central government, it is possible to see how far the values toward sex roles being propagated by the religious clergy have been formally transmitted to the generation of the revolution. Because the books are prepared and distributed by the central government and all students use the same books, it can be said that this is a study of formal sex role socialization patterns within the educational system for the whole Iranian society. The universe consisted of elementary school books for the first through the fifth grades, including books dealing with the Persian language, social sciences, religion and science. Art and mathematics books were excluded because no sex roles were presented. The data were collected by means of content analysis of the roles being played by whom in the books and by comparing the role presented to a standard of traditional roles constructed from the responses of four judges who are Iranian family sociologists, two males and two females. The roles and activities were listed from both pictures and the text and grouped into major types as follows: economic, household, recreational, artistic, scientific, religious, social and political, and personality images. The findings indicated that roles traditionally performed by males were almost always portrayed as such in the school texts for all grades. Significantly, males performed more roles, especially those of an economic, recreational or scientific nature. Female roles, when presented, were traditionally viewed and if a change occurred it was usually the male taking over a female role. When a role was traditionally shared, after the revolution, it was presented as being performed by either one sex or the other with nearly three times as much the male as the female. The patriarchal orientation of the present regime has definitely been incorporated into the elementary texts, Thus, it will serve to reinforce the traditional values concerning women's role in society which are held by a majority of the population. An attempt has been made to do away with any culturally conflicting situation which may have been presented in the past, and curtail movement toward egalitarian norms.\n      </p>", "The fact that German-speaking countries are charging more per book than any other group of countries has an impact on funds allocated by libraries for German books and in turn on scholarly activities of German Studies students and faculty.

It sets the account books in the context of Scott's accounting education and experience, which took place at the time of the Scottish Enlightenment, an 18th century movement which saw a great flowering of writings on accountancy in Scotland as well as considerable progress in the arts and sciences. The style, layout and content of the account books is also studied from the point of view of elucidating Scott's domestic financial arrangements and expenditure patterns. These are seen as confirming the insights of Vickery [1998], who posits a liberated role for women such as Mrs Scott in 'genteel' households, which Scott's undoubtedly was. The study also establishes that Scott's personal expenditures, and indeed his accounting practices, otherwise conformed to the general patriarchal pattern identified by Davidoff and Hall [1987]. The final part of the article uses what has been discovered about Scott's personal accounting to revisit the question of his financial imprudence (or otherwise) in business. It concludes that Scott's risk-taking in business was not unreasonable, and was informed by his bookkeeping knowledge and practices.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

During the 1760s and 1770s he compiled detailed catalogues of the contents of books and manuscripts in his possession, together with his estimation of their value. Not only do these catalogues provide an important insight into the type of material he considered worth collecting but they also point towards the fact that he functioned as a book-dealer. The bilingual nature of these catalogues, and the large number of books in the English language they contained, challenge the argument first put forward by Daniel Corkery in the 1920s that the worlds of the Gaelic-speaking Irish and the English-speaking Protestant \u00e9lite were divided from one another with little interaction between them, and Joep Leerssen's contention more recently that Gaelic Ireland was isolated from print culture in English.\n      </p>", "This study focuses not on individual Lives or pairs of Lives, but on the book as a whole and its articulation across the full corpus. It argues that the Plutarchan book consists of up to four distinct sections: prologue, first Life, second Life, synkrisis. Each of these sections has a fairly consistent internal structure, and each has a distinct set of strategies for opening, for closure, and for managing the transition from one section to the next. Prologues provide an introduction to both Lives, and are clearly delineated from them, even though in our manuscripts they appear as part of the first Life; in fact, there is often a stronger break between prologue and first Life than there is between the two Lives themselves. Prologues usually begin with generalized reflections, to be followed only later by the naming of the subjects and a statement of their similarities. Most Lives begin with a thematically organized section (the \u2018proemial opening\u2019), which surveys the subject's life as a whole, not just their youth, and which is marked off with varying degrees of distinctness from the narrative that follows. Crucially, proemial openings do not narrate and the logic of their structure is not chronological. Closure in many Lives is signalled by \u2018circularity\u2019 and sometimes by a closural or transitional phrase, though first Lives are different here from second Lives. Synkriseis are structured both by a series of themes on which the two subjects are compared, and by a two-part, agonistic structure in which first one of the subjects is preferred, then the other. Synkriseis may also recall the prologue; both prologue and synkrisis operate at the level of the book, and between them frame and weld together the two Lives.\n      </p>", "William Blake's interests in the living body and its aesthetic analogue, \"Living Form,\" underlie his attempt at representing motion, a hallmark of animal life since at least the time of Aristotle's De Anima. In scenes such as Albion's climactic rise and subsequent falling back in Milton, motion emerges as a representational problem, however, in large part due to the unsatisfying dominance of a Newtonian mechanical account of motion. Phenomenological accounts of both self-motion and motion in the object world, such as Maurice Merleau-Ponty's, can nevertheless suggest how Blake points to the problem of perceiving motion, even if it finally resists full representation.\n      </p>", "This study explores the context for a small monophonic Latin song preserved in an eclectic Italian anthology manuscript produced around the turn of the fifteenth century. The song bears the Italian heading L'antefana di Ser Lorenzo, and is presumably connected to the Florentine composer Lorenzo Masini. \u201cDiligenter advertant chantores\u201d (as the Latin text begins) attracted considerable attention when it was first made widely available in facsimiles of the mid-twentieth century. Scholars of late medieval music, confronted by the song's apparent intellectual virtuosity and the diabolical excess of its so-called musica ficta signs, drew the conclusion that its musical context lay hidden within the history of music theory and perhaps even in its most esoteric corners. But repositioned against a new and still-emerging understanding of the pedagogical practices of the ars grammatica and ars memorativa, L'antefana takes on a different sort of historical significance. Details of its previously neglected text and the evidence of its fantastical notation suggest that it is a simple riddle intended for the youngest singers, likely a learning game of a very rudimentary sort (one of several considered in this article). Such classroom amusements still remain childhood constants, bridging the supposed gap between medieval and modern musical lives.\n      </p>", "There are few designs for woven silks of the 1750s that can be compared, in terms of motifs, aesthetic qualities and feasibility, to those by Anna Maria Garthwaite (1690-1763), the pre-eminent silk designer of her period. The lack of comparative material makes the premium-winning designs in the collection of the Royal Society of Arts particularly interesting. These designs were considered good by the Society of Arts during the period 1756-59. Conversely, in 1757, a mercer doubted the ability of the Society's committee to assess the feasibility of the designs and recommended that a master weaver attend the adjudgment session. Current discourse overwhelmingly dismisses the role of academies and premiums as the creative force which transformed the quality of design for a range of manufactures from the 1730s. The aim of this article, however, is to evaluate the contribution of William Shipley's School and the Society of Arts to the creation of good design for the silk industry. Part of the evaluation involves tracing the careers of premium-winners and a comparison of their designs to woven silks with similar motifs and patterns. It is argued that the evaluation shows how the Society of Arts did influence employment within the silk industry.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

'Blue Data Books' include additional information on the ecology, conservation, and promotion of the species. For describing the overall change of abundance of every individual species six categories are defined. Furthermore, the effects of nature conservation techniques (NCT) on a species are evaluated using six additional categories. In a test area of 3 431 km2 in northern Switzerland, information was compiled on the change in abundance of the 708 Red List species of higher plants (spermatophyta) over the last 10 - 15 yr. Overall, 33% of these species showed a stabilization or even increase in abundance; these are Blue List species; ca. 20% showed a decline and for almost 50% the change in abundance is not known. NCTs have been successfully applied to more than 50% of all the species, at least locally. For about a further 30%, the required NCTs are known but have not yet been tried out.

The program was designed to flood over 330 child care centers with high-quality children's books, at a ratio of 5 books per child, and provide 10 hours of training to child-care staff. Conceptualized as a formative experiment, this study examined the project's impact, systematically sampling 400 3- and 4-year-old children randomly selected from 50 centers across 10 regions and 100 control children from comparable child care centers not involved in the project. Children's early literacy skills (receptive language, concepts of print, environmental print, letter name knowledge, concepts of writing, and narrative competence) were assessed prior to and following the study. In addition, a posttest-only sample and a kindergarten sample were included, focusing on the project's longerterm impact. Changes in child care practices were assessed throughout the project, using photographic accounts of the physical environments of classrooms, literacy-related interactions between teachers and children in sample classrooms, and storybook reading activity in both treatment and control classrooms. Process measures indicated enhanced physical access to books, greater verbal interaction around literacy, and more time spent reading and relating to books as a result of the intervention. With greater access, children in the intervention group scored statistically significantly higher than the control group on four of six assessment measures, with gains still very much evident 6 months later in kindergarten. Findings provide powerful support for the physical proximity of books and the psychological support to child care staff on children's early literacy development. /// [Spanish] Este estudio examina el impacto de una intervenci\u00f3n dise\u00f1ada para ni\u00f1os de sectores econ\u00f3micamente en desventaja que asist\u00edan a centros de atenci\u00f3n para ni\u00f1os. El programa fue elaborado para colmar de libros infantiles de buena calidad 330 centros, a un promedio de 5 libros por ni\u00f1o, as\u00ed como proveer 10 horas de entrenamiento al personal de los centros.

Antes de comenzar el estudio y al final del proyecto se evaluaron las habilidades tempranas de los ni\u00f1os en comprensi\u00f3n del lenguaje, conceptos sobre la escritura, lectura de logos, nombre de las letras, conceptos sobre el lenguaje escrito y competencia narrativa. Adem\u00e1s se incluyeron una muestra post-test y una muestra de preescolar, poniendo el foco en el impacto del proyecto a largo plazo.

Boy characters were also found outside more than inside, but with little difference shown for girls. When the two time samples were compared, male child characters were depicted in significantly fewer outdoor settings in the post-compared with the pre-1980 samples. But, the number and variety of occupations for males in the post-1980 sample exceeded those for females by a considerable amount.

This hypothesis is tested by analyzing the effect that the unemployment rate in the individual's state and community has on the individual's retrospective evaluation of the national unemployment situation in 1992, using data from the 1992 American National Election Study survey, supplemented with data on the unemployment rate during the third quarter of 1992 for the respondent's community and state. The findings show that the state unemployment rate has a clear effect on retrospective evaluations of national economic conditions. This effect occurs apart from any effect on fear of unemployment, which is unaffected by the state unemployment rate. The community unemployment rate has little or no effect on retrospective economic evaluations, except for a small impact on personal unemployment experience. The contextual effect that we observe therefore is primarily sociotropic, not personal pocketbook, in nature. We suggest that the contextual patterning of information, perhaps especially through media reporting of economic conditions, is responsible for producing this effect.\n      </p>"], "words": {"essay":
