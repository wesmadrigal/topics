{"total_words": 1372, "documents": ["This article discusses how the issue of precarity has developed into a new catalyst for activism in Italy and demonstrates how this activism is linked to changes in the employment and capitalist manufacturing environment of the 1980s and 1990s. It links events in Italy to the activism of the global anti-neoliberal movement and discusses how various activist movements (the independent Marxist tradition, creative activism, social activism, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT), radical feminist activism) are mobilizing around the issue of precarity. This article focuses specifically on the activist network 'Precari su Marte' (Precarious on Mars) which has been active in Turin since 2005. It demonstrates how the theoretical and practical evolution of this network has led to various outcomes, including experimenting with creative forms of political practice at MayDay demonstrations and questioning the boundaries of gender.\n      </p>", "Constructions of women's activism as social service, volunteer, or charity work contribute to the relative invisibility of these forms of activism. The author conducted field research at an affiliate office of the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. She analyzes how these women volunteers resist the label \"activist\" at the same time that they engage in activities that resemble activism. The author also examines the reasons for their resistance to the term. Her analysis shows that implicit connections between constructions of activism and gender shape the extent to which volunteers think of their work either as political or as activism. In light of Komen 's heteronormative gender ideology, the author concludes by raising questions about the relationships among gender, activism, and civic participation.\n      </p>", "In this article, we utilize data from a representative sample of Massachusetts adults to assess the extent of citizen activism on nuclear issues and to identify some of the factors that predict this activism. Nuclear activists were generally those individuals who had high levels of political interest, strong feelings of political efficacy, the belief that activism against nuclear war would reduce its likelihood, and, most importantly, who had already been active on other political issues.\n      </p>", "The contributions of women to liberation movements globally have not been fully recognised or acknowledged. This briefing explores the concept of contemporary activism through the global social movement and its activities and failures to engender liberation movements. The case of the South African women's movement is provided as an example that global social movements can learn from.\n      </p>", "This article addresses the relatively scant sustained attention to HIV/AIDS in the South African academy as we try to re-conceptualise the university as a space for various kinds of activism and education. We distinguish twin dimensions of the AIDS pandemic: the virus's physical, social, and economic effects and its multiplying meanings. In order to understand the inaction to date, we sketch some broad contextual features of the AIDS landscape in South Africa and particularly in universities. We examine the nature of academic work and the context in which it is performed, evaluated and rewarded. We also explore the impact these features have on education-and-activism in the context of AIDS. The gendered landscape of the academy and its interaction with the HIV/AIDS pandemic are also analysed. We end with an overview of a range of alternative approaches to education-and-activism: from curricular approaches to AIDS that address the epidemic of narratives, to university-wide programmes and outreach activities beyond the university campus.\n      </p>", "We study relationships between shareholder proposal activism, managerial response, and corporate social performance (CSP). We find that shareholder proposal activism reduces CSP. We infer that rather than pressuring firms to improve CSP, activism may engender diversion of resources away from CSP into political activities used by managers to resist external pressures and retain discretion. We also find that managers are more likely to settle proposals filed by 'salient' shareholders (i.e., those with power, legitimacy, and urgency). Settlement with salient shareholders, however, also reduces CSP, suggesting that managers' responses are symbolic; i.e., they settle with salient shareholders to demonstrate conformance but continue to resist making the substantive changes to core policies that may compromise their discretion.\n      </p>", "We present findings on women's political perspectives, participation, and activism derived from a survey of women in Montgomery County, Ohio, undertaken by the Women's Research Network formed at Wright State University, which we argue have both local and national implications for feminist organizing. We connect this work and these findings to the history of feminism in Dayton as well as to other status-of-women studies at national, state, and local levels. Our analysis shows that there has been a substantive decline in feminist activism and radicalism in Dayton, Ohio, the \"heartland of America,\" in the face of continued race and class divisions among women, the rise of the New Right, and an aging population. Given increasing barriers to the renewal of feminist activism in the heartland, local research on women such as this can provide one avenue for the reanimation of feminist civil society by identifying not only what divides women but also what issues can connect them. Such data offer the raw materials for future feminist activists and such research projects constitute one form of renewed feminist activism.\n      </p>", "Argentina recently underwent a period of economic crisis that shook societal foundations. People turned to collective action for social and political change, and women were at the forefront of many protests. This crisis offers an opportunity to study a moment of \"quotidian disruption\"\u2014when routine practices and ingrained assumptions are threatened\u2014as an impetus for mobilization. The authors draw on ethnographic observations and analyze 44 in-depth interviews with activist women in Argentina to explore their responses to quotidian disruption. The authors show that the Argentine crisis challenged everyday practices and expectations that were often gendered, fostering activism that drew on previous social frameworks while also creating new ones. Activism became a new quotidian for many women and transformed their identities and experiences with politics and gender relations.\n      </p>", "This paper contributes to a discussion on networks as political spaces by examining the work of an environmental activist group in Kaliningrad, Russia. Drawing from geographic work on communication and from literature on organizational structure and communication technology provides a useful means of understanding and conceptualizing computer networks from a social science perspective. The case study of grassroots activism illustrates how computer-based communication may support a unique space of political activity. Electronic mail (e-mail) communication can be a channel through which activists may overcome the constraints of location as an information container in order to create spaces of interaction and action appropriate to their political agenda. This case study is an example where organization members use e-mail communication to connect their activities, information sources and collaborative partners at different scales to create a viable space for environmental activism and information distribution within a shifting political context.\n      </p>", "Prior research on political activism focused on direct predictors of collective action (e.g., life experiences), with little attention paid to what psychologically motivates individuals to act. The group consciousness literature provides an obvious psychological motive for activism, but ignores individual difference variables that differentiate people who develop group consciousness from those who do not. This article integrates the two literatures on activism and group consciousness, and presents a model whereby group consciousness mediates relationships between collective action and personality and life experiences. The general model was evaluated empirically by examining feminist consciousness and women's rights activism in two samples. Feminist consciousness was found to mediate relationships between activism and a number of personality and life experience variables, including low authoritarianism, political salience, sexual oppression, and education about women's position in society. The possible extension of this model to other kinds of political activism is discussed.\n      </p>", "While prior studies have often defined social activism as protesting or marching and political activism as voting, we define social and political activism with multiple measures. For each type of activism, we create an additive index that includes various social and political activities. In this research, we ask the following question: do black information networks, political involvement of church, and nationalist identity affect social activism and political activism of blacks? Using the 1993 Black Politics Study data, the results suggest that black information networks and church's political involvement were strong predictors of both social and political activism; however, nationalist identity was not significant.\n      </p>", "This study examines patterns of judicial conflict and policy activism during 1930-1980 on the supreme courts of California, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia. The findings indicate that dramatic shifts from passivity to activism take place over very short periods of time, and that when a shift to judicial activism does occur, it is due mainly to a change in court composition involving the introduction of \"maverick\" justices. Furthermore, of the four courts in the study that underwent a transition to activism, none have subsequently become non-activist.\n      </p>", "In this article we argue that while new kinds of political activism are flourishing in local areas, increasing partnership with economic development interests poses serious challenges to the political efficacy of environmental activism. We examine the shifting terrain of local political activism within the context of the American Heritage Rivers Initiative, a new federal program designed to facilitate environmental preservation, economic development, and cultural preservation along U.S. rivers. This article is based on research done along the New River in North Carolina and Virginia with a collection of local groups organized into a regional partnership. That partnership exemplifies emerging forms of local political action under new regimes of state power and hybrid partnerships. We argue that if hybrid forms of environmental activism spread, with their emphasis on neoliberalism and ecological modernization, they will likely pose challenges for grassroots politics and, as has been the case along the New River, blunt the critical edge of the environmental critique.\n      </p>", "The effects of professionalism on volunteer activism within social movement organizations (SMOs) are more complex than generally recognized. Professionalism can inhibit or erode, substitute for, or facilitate volunteer activism. Most studies identify one of these patterns as typical of SMOs or dominant in a particular case. This article argues that some combination of the three, rather than a single pattern, is probably more typical of SMOs. To identify such combinations two analytic tools are needed: a more complex concept of volunteer activism than is generally used, and, a broader understanding of the means by which professionals influence volunteer activism. This article develops these tools through a comparative case study of the umbrella organizations of three major peace campaigns - the Emergency Peace Campaign (1936-1937), the atomic test ban campaign (1957-1963), and the nuclear weapons freeze campaign (1979-1986). The umbrella organizations are then shown to incorporate different combinations of the three basic patterns of professional-volunteer relations.\n      </p>", "This focus conveys some ideas and questions that arose in conversations with NELISIWE (NELLY) GUMEDE and MANDISA MBALI -- two young women members of the Treatment Action Campaign -- about their experiences of HIV/AIDS activism and the extremely high HIV prevalence among young women in their age group of 20-24. NELLY and MANDISA share the stories of how they became involved in HIV/AIDS activism, discuss some of the factors that influence the disproportionately high HIV prevalence among young women in South Africa, and consider what forms their activism might take in the future.\n      </p>", "This article explores the relationship between hope and agency in the contexts of migrant rights activism and alternative trading relationships created through social and environmental certification systems. Using interviews with key respondents from nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), hope is assigned a positive role in the complex process of social change, providing that common goals can be agreed upon and achieved along the way. Two main layers of analysis emerge in this article. The first explores the relationship between hope and agency, with a particular focus on power, both enabling and coercive. Powerful groups can hijack hope, but also hope can be used to mobilize various marginalized groups to find a collective voice, eventually leading to empowerment. The power relations among groups determine how competing collective hopes play out in action. A second layer to the relationship between hope and action is the way in which hope effects social change. Through conceptualizing hope within the context of the change process, we address the relationship between hope, agency, and time. An important ingredient linking hope, agency, and time in a sustainable manner is the notion of empowerment.\n      </p>", "This research adopts a structural identity theory framework to examine post-recruitment activism in the Irish Republican Movement. The data are from members of Provisional Sinn F\u00e9in who were first interviewed in the mid-1980s and subsequently reinterviewed in the mid-1990s and the late 2000s. Ten and 20 years after their initial interviews, some respondents were still involved in Provisional Sinn F\u00e9in while others had: helped create a rival organization, Republican Sinn F\u00e9in, in 1986; helped create another rival organization, the 32 County Sovereignty Movement, in 1997; withdrawn from activism; and withdrawn from and then reentered activism. The interviews show that the decision to exit from activism was primarily motivated by changes in the respondents' personal lives and not for political reasons. For some respondents, life changes brought with them new relationships and new identities that limited their availability for activism and also forced respondents to choose between competing identities. The decision to remain an activist but to create a rival organization was influenced by interaction among subgroups of activists in Provisional Sinn F\u00e9in and by the respondents' perception of what is important for Irish Republicanism.\n      </p>", "Geographies of activism draw on many traditions but few have charted social movements over time. This paper suggests that the consideration of action over time not only enhances our understanding of the degree of social change that occurs, but also the way activists' interests are acknowledged, or contained, by those they seek to influence. The paper reviews existing literature and proposes the adoption of a particular conceptualization of time-space geometries. The case is made for attending to kairological and topological notions of time-space while recognizing these involve complex geometries of power relations, meanings, resources and social actions. The variability of these patterns in different time-spaces can stimulate multi-dimensional studies and the example of women's agricultural activism in Australia is employed to explore the usefulness of these ideas for geographies of social movements.\n      </p>", "The activism of institutional investors tends more and more toward the supervision and control of the behavior of the managers of big companies. In this article, we present a model based on the creation of an activism index that lets us evaluate such activism's effect on the sensitivity of the investment policies of a company in the face of financial variables (such as cash flow and liquidity ratio) and market variables (ownership concentration and value creation index). To test our assertions, we analyze firm-level data for United Kingdom (U. K.), Germany, France, Denmark, and Spain during the period 1995-2004. Our results point to a significant reduction in the sensitivity of company investment decisions in the face of these variables, especially relative to intangible capital, as a result of the neutralizing effect of activism on the high agency costs of free cash flow and on the information asymmetries of the market.\n      </p>", "This article presents a history of the Memphis chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW) that challenges traditional analyses of second-wave feminist activism as either liberal or radical. Through examples of feminist activism on behalf of the Equal Rights Amendment, rape and wife-abuse awareness and prevention, and pornography, the author illustrates how one chapter of NOW, which is typically identified as a liberal organization, was simultaneously liberal and radical. In addition, the author calls for more attention to location in order to understand second-wave feminists' tactics, styles, and structures as well as to make more prominent the nuances and complexities of a movement often obscured by the liberal/radical divide.\n      </p>", "The fledgling literature concerning institutional investors' impact on U.S. corporations has been plagued by mixed results. We argue that an improved understanding of an intervening variable-investor activism-may help to clarify future studies. In this article we synthesize the financial, legal, and management literature to arrive at an integrated model of twelve key variables that may lead to variations in these investors levels of activism and, hence, their impact on firm behavior.\n      </p>", "This article examines feminist performance activism in the context of the contemporary anti-war movement. Using data gathered through ethnographic participant observation, formal and informal interviews, and content analysis from October 2002 through January 2005, this article describes and analyzes the use of performance activism by three women's anti-war groups as an activist repertoire used to challenge cultural assumptions about gender. This paper argues that these groups used a combination of norm-embracing and norm-challenging performance elements to integrate gender into the anti-war agenda and promote a feminist ideology among fellow protesters and suggests that different combinations were more or less effective.\n      </p>", "Against existing explanations based on economic structural and organizational differences, this paper contends that patterns of union activism in newly democratized polities are shaped by unions' interaction with political institutions and actors, particularly political parties. Unions' propensity for militant mobilization or accommodation is molded by the permissiveness of political institutions and electoral incentives for partisan alliances.\n      </p>", "To date, most models of policy motivated campaign participation claim participation derives from the intensity or extremism of one's policy views. I approach the policy motivation differently, generalizing the logic of proximity voting to model policy motivated campaign participation. Modeling participation as a function of extremism captures the activist's policy preferences and suggests those with strong prefer participate more, while modeling participation as a function of proximity captures both the activist's policy preferences and the relevant comparisons to the positions of the candidates. Noting the two alternatives lead to different predictions about variation in individual particip beyond turnout (e.g. campaign activities), I find consistent support for a proximity model of activism and I find no independent effect of extremism once I control for proximity. Moreover, the proximity model's predictions about ideological responsiveness to changes in the candidates' locations over time prove robust, while predictions based solely on ideological extremism do not.\n      </p>", "Recent narratives of the civil rights movement document black veterans' contributions to the movement's success, often attributing their efforts to their military experience. While this attribution makes sense intuitively, alternative explanations for black veterans' mobilization are not fully explored in existing work. For instance, black veterans were often among the most active members in many of the civil rights organizations from which insurgency was launched. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that black civic institutions, not military service per se, drove black veterans' activism. Furthermore, if military service did lead to political activism, we lack a microlevel mechanism to explain the means by which it did so. In this article, I show that military service did motivate black veterans' activism independent of their membership in black civic institutions or feelings of group solidarity and theorize a mechanism by which it did so.\n      </p>", "This article develops the concept of \"televisionary\" activism--a mediated form of social justice messaging that attempts to transform culture. Focusing on a locally produced and very popular television show in Nicaragua, I consider how social justice knowledge is produced through television characters' scripting and performance. The ideological underpinnings aspire to a dialogic engagement with the audience, as producers aim to both generate public discourse and benefit from audiences' suggestions and active engagement. Several levels of media advocacy interventions are considered including the production, scripting, and translation of transnational material into local registers. Televisionary activism offers challenges to several conservative social values in Nicaragua by placing topics such as abortion, domestic violence, sexual abuse, homosexuality, and lesbianism very explicitly into the public sphere. At the same time, sexual subjects on the small screen must be framed in particular ways, as, for instance, with the homosexual subjects who are carefully coiffed in normalized human dramas. Finally, many of these televisionary tactics draw from and engage with transnational tropes of identity politics, and \"gay\" and \"lesbian\" subjectivity in particular, confounding the relationship between real and idealized sexual subjects in Nicaragua. That is, these televisionary tactics \"market\" transnational identity politics but derive legitimacy through their very \"localness\".\n      </p>", "Multi-issue activists are sorely understudied, despite their acknowledged importance as bridges between social movements and issue domains. In this article we explore multi-issue activism, beginning with a large sample of AIDS activists and charting the degree and nature of overlapping issue involvement, the key role of \"initiator\" issues, and individual characteristics that promote multi-issue activism. We demonstrate that the great majority of these AIDS activists had sizable prior and ongoing participation histories in other issues, suggesting that movement across issue areas may be the norm rather than the exception. We also show that involvement in specific past issues served as gateways to later involvement in AIDS, that psychological engagement in politics prompted cross-issue activism even among these already activated individuals, and that unique personal characteristics (in this case gender and sexual orientation) led to more issue interconnectedness.\n      </p>", "This focus analyses strengths and weaknesses of the media coverage of the 16 Days of Activism Campaign. The authors explain the current media representation of gender-based violence and the changes that need to be made to ensure that gender-based violence issues are covered more substantially and regularly in the media. This focus also critiques the quality of media articles and the degree to which comprehensive analysis of gender-based violence issues are dealt with in the press and whether or not the media coverage adds new information to the debates around gender-based violence.\n      </p>", "This article is concerned with the historical origins of student activism in Greece and an analysis of present activism in nine institutions of post-secondary education. The empirical analysis was based on a sample of nearly 1500 students and revealed that activism mainly relates to the regional origin of the student. The findings are used to make some speculations on the likely future course of student activity.\n      </p>", "Normatively and intuitively, we conceive of political participation as an integral component of democratic policymaking. However, research on participation generally does not include policy considerations as part of individuals' decisions to engage in activism. I offer an opportunity model of participation that begins to study how policy goals shape individual participation and how aggregate participation shapes policymaking. The central argument is that individuals' policy goals allow them to recognize those moments when it is most efficient and/or effective to take action. Examining black participation from 1980 to 1994,I show that black Americans are more likely to participate when they face external threats, are embedded in social networks, and have greater access to policymakers. Most importantly, the recognition of these opportunities varies according to individuals' resources. This research moves beyond the discussion of who participates to address the equally fundamental question: participation for what?\n      </p>", "Shareholder activism has been largely neglected in the few available studies on corporate governance in sub Saharan Africa. Following the recent challenges posed by the Cadbury Nigeria Plc, this paper examines shareholder activism in an evolving corporate governance institutional context and identifies strategic opportunities associated with shareholders' empowerment through changes in code of corporate governance and recent developments in information and communications technologies in Nigeria; especially in relation to corporate social responsibility in Nigeria. It is expected that the paper would contribute to the scarce literature on corporate governance and accountability in Africa.\n      </p>", "This study uses data from a nationally representative sample to identify predictors of rank-and-file feminist activism by women in the United States. Predictors are identified as relevant from the literatures on feminist attitudes, social movements, and political participation. Under a wide range of controls, activists are distinguished from nonactivists by certain attitudinal variables and by their higher levels of education, non-South residence, and greater labor force experience. Various microstructural factors suggested by recent work on social movements are not associated with activism among women who are highly concerned about women's rights, but do partially explain what little activism exists among women who are less concerned. These results suggest an inverse relationship between the importance people place on movement goals and the importance of microstructural factors for recruitment. The implications of the findings for social movement literature are also examined.\n      </p>", "If active institutional investors matter to corporate governance, then understanding what influences institutions to become involved also matters. Ryan and Schneider (2002) proposed that the type of institutional investor determines activism. Ryan and Schneider advanced a model that identified a number of antecedents/determinants of activism, including fund size, investment time horizons, performance expectations, pressure sensitivity, legal restraints, and internal or external portfolio management. Using a sample of 102 institutional investors, this study examined that model, but found only partial support \u2014 institutional shareholder size, investment time horizon, and internal portfolio management were found to be significant determinants of institutional shareholder activism. However, performance expectations, pressure sensitivity, and legal restraints were not significant antecedents. Overall, the results support the view of institutional shareholder heterogeneity. Not all institutions act the same and even similar institutions do not react to the same Stimuli for action in identical ways. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.\n      </p>", "Do activists lead happier and more fulfilled lives than the average person ? Two online surveys using a sample of college students (N = 341) and a national sample of activists matched with a control group (N = 718) demonstrated that several indicators of activism were positively associated with measures of hedonic, eudaimonic, and social well-being. Furthermore, in both studies, activists were more likely to be \"flourishing\" (Keyes, 2002) than were nonactivists. A third study of college students (N = 296) explored the possible causal role of activism by measuring well-being after subjects either engaged in a brief activist behavior, a brief nonactivist behavior, or no behavior. Although well-being did not differ substantially between these three groups, the subjects who did the brief activist behavior reported significantly higher levels of subjective vitality than did the subjects who engaged in the nonactivist behavior. Potential mediators of the relationship between activism and well-being and the usefulness of these findings are discussed.\n      </p>", "Frank Sulloway (1996) has claimed that later-borns are more likely to rebel against the status quo than are firstborns. The two studies reported here attempt to examine more fully Sulloway's claims about rebelliousness. The studies draw on archival data from studies of high school and college students in a midwestern state between 1969 and 1982. The current studies compare the effects of birth order, gender, family size, and father's education on two self-report measures: participation in protests and demonstrations, and involvement with marijuana. The data on involvement with marijuana provided support for Sulloway's thesis that later-borns are more rebellious than firstborns, but the data on participation in protests and demonstrations did not. These mixed findings, which contribute to the ongoing debate about Sulloway's theory, are discussed.\n      </p>", "In this paper, I consider the activities of a group of individuals who tinker with and build radio hardware in an informal setting called 'Geek Group'. They conceive of Geek Group as a radical pedagogical activity, which constitutes an aspect of activism surrounding citizen access to low-power FM radio. They are also concerned with combating the gendered nature of hardware skills, yet in spite of their efforts men tend to have more skill and familiarity with radio hardware than women. Radio tinkering has a long history as a masculine undertaking and a site of masculine identity construction. I argue that this case represents an interplay between geek, activist, and gendered identities, all of which are salient for this group, but which do not occur together without some tension.\n      </p>", "We study political activism by several interest groups with private signals. When their ideological distance to the policymaker is small, a \"low-trust\" regime prevails: agents frequently lobby even when it is unwarranted, taking advantage of the confirmation provided by others' activism; conversely, the policymaker responds only to generalized pressure. When ideological distance is large, a \"high-trust\" regime prevails: lobbying behavior is disciplined by the potential contradiction from abstainers, and the policymaker's response threshold is correspondingly lower. Within some intermediate range, both equilibria coexist. We then study the optimal organization of influence activities, contrasting welfare levels when interest groups act independently and when they coordinate.\n      </p>", "Blauner (1995, Racism and Antiracism in World Perspective. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage), Winant (1998, Ethnic and Racial Studies 24(4): 755-766) and Bonnett (1997, New Communities 22(1): 97-110) all express concern over the construction of \"racism\" as a white-only phenomenon and the corresponding degree to which whiteness is essentialized as a negative identity. This paper explores how white antiracism activists mediate between a static construction of \"white racism\" and a more contextual understanding of racism and possibilities for white activism. While whiteness is clearly hegemonic in the larger social world, within movements for racial justice, whiteness is often seen as suspect. Given this, white antiracism activists spend a fair amount of their activist hours negotiating a problematic identity. This paper explores the mechanisms by which such an identity is negotiated. I conclude that while white activism is complicated by a definition of racism that tends to essentialize whiteness, the activists have found ways to empower themselves and to conceptualize their relationship to racism and antiracism activism in a less rigid way. All of this contributes to our understanding of the complexity of white identity and efforts to demonstrate how it is an identity that, like other identities, is always in formation.\n      </p>", "This essay explores Judith Merril's early fiction in relation to the maternalist politics characteristic of midcentury women's peace activism. Dominant Cold War discourses encouraged American women to become \"domestic patriots\" by using their natural caretaking instincts to prepare their homes against the eventuality of nuclear war. Conversely, midcentury peace organizations posited that it was women's civic duty to protect their families by protesting against the militaristic social and moral orders attending the dawn of the atomic era. As science fiction became increasingly central to the American imagination in the 1950s, women writers turned to the genre as an ideal vehicle through which to express their dissent from the Cold War status quo. Premier among them was Judith Merril, whose passionate antiwar sensibilities led her to write science fiction that invoked the maternalist logic of midcentury peace activism by demonstrating how militaristic practices threaten to destroy the very families they are designed to protect. Additionally, Merril's stories extend the logic of her activist counterparts by imagining how women might connect with other caring workers-especially doctors and scientists-and create new communities that will protect future generations from the devastating legacy of the nuclear age.\n      </p>", "The present study finds that there is very little direct effect on activism by social background, indicating that past studies of student political activism have overemphasized the influence of social background factors. Social background explains more of the variation in political attitudes and beliefs than it explains in political activism. This is not to say the social background is not important or influential in the development of an activist political commitment-merely that no univalent rules exist which link social background characteristics with an individual's involvement in politics. There are too many intervening factors, such as political attitudes and beliefs (and others not accounted for here) which influence individuals in numberless ways.\n      </p>", "A generation ago, Barber and Rifkin [The North Will Rise Again: Pensions, Politics and Power in 1980s (Beacon Press, Boston)] envisioned a new strategy for American Labor that would make extensive use of the capital in multi-employer and public pension plans. They argued that organized labor could influence how these funds were invested in order use this capital as both a weapon in struggles with recalcitrant management and as a tool to generate new union jobs. A number of union officials took this advice seriously, to make labor-connected individuals and organizations were among the most determined and successful investor activists of the 1990s. It is, however, hard to find evidence that this activism has effectively met the goals of organized labor, leading to the ironic conclusion that the innovations of labor's investor activist will do more to assist the investment community than the American labor movement.\n      </p>", "The issue of how an activist identity develops is one of the core issues in social psychology and social movement research. Because of problems in the measurement of individuals' propensities to engage in social action, however, findings in this area are often equivocal, and cross-study comparisons and conclusions are difficult to draw. Hence, the aim of these studies was to develop a measure to assess individuals' propensities to engage in social action. This measure, the Activism Orientation Scale (AOS), demonstrates strong psychometric properties and allows assessment of activist propensity across a wide continuum of social action behaviors, ideological positions, and movement issues. Additionally, the broad applicability of the AOS allows for its use by researchers, activists, and policymakers.\n      </p>", "This study seeks to examine the relationship between church-based social capital resources and political activism among black Americans. Our results suggest that simply attending church does not provide enough social capital resources to propel blacks into voting and nonvoting political activities. Rather, it is largely those churches that espouse a civic culture where members are exposed to political discussions and are encouraged to be activists that lead to black political engagement. In addition, involvement in church committee life is important to black civic skill development (e.g., communication, writing, and organizing skills), which increases these church activists' competence and confidence to participate in costly and risky political acts. This study also sought to investigate the class composition of such politicized church networks. It is largely the case that such networks are stratified by socioeconomic status, such that middle-class blacks disproportionately hear political messages in church and serve as church activists.\n      </p>", "Acid attacks on women are increasing at alarming rates in Bangladesh, but the government has failed to provide medical care to the victims. Easily available sulfuric acid, which can mutilate a human face in moments, has emerged as a weapon used to disfigure a woman's body. By the mid-1990s, activists had documented acid attacks, and urban protests were followed by demands for better medical care. I show how the interaction between local and international-level civil society organizations made international resources available to local feminist groups engaged in domestic social struggles and helped to improve medical care for acid victims of Bangladesh.\n      </p>", "While protecting a tent encampment of student protesters on 18 November 2011, UC Davis freshman Ian Lee was pepper-sprayed by campus police.

The vast literature on environmental behavior has identified correlates of environmental concern and some explanations for why some modes of political action are engaged in. This study attempts to develop a holistic explanation of eco-political activism by identifying pathways to political action. The results show that individual values and beliefs determine environmental concern and help develop ecological consciousness in individuals. This consciousness may lead to a perception of threat, which in turn influences participation in environmental policy-making. To the extent that psychological factors such as fear for the sustainability of the community and the nation are present and individuals feel threatened by environmental conditions, they are likely to take political action. Multivar\u00edate analysis revealed that individual values and beliefs explain 45% of the variance in ecological concerns, which explain 34% of the variance in publics' perception of threat. The latter then explains 14% of the variance in eco-political activism. Both race and class offered interesting insight into why some may take ecopolitical action and others may not, although class indicators seemed a bit more helpful.\n      </p>", "Through an exploration of settings in eastern Kentucky, southwest Virginia, and western North Carolina, this article explores lessons that poor and working class people have to offer about grassroots activism in response to processes of economic restructuring and political disenfranchisement.

Whereas many feminist scholars urge us to return to social movement to counter the forces of institutionalization, I question the assumption that the political future of Women's Studies as a field can be guaranteed by repairing the distinction between academic institutionalization and feminism as a world changing social force. Indeed, I worry more about the implications for Women's Studies of refusing altogether the distinction between the academy and activism than about the difficulty of repairing the distinction between them.\n      </p>", "Based on fieldwork in Knoxville, Tennessee, I analyze the ethical dilemmas of conservative evangelical Protestants engaged in faith-based activism and social outreach, especially dilemmas stemming from the theological paradox of compassion and accountability. Evangelicals who minister to the poor and distressed must reconcile romanticized notions of pure sacrificial giving with an ideology of personal responsibility inherent in their concept of accountability. Socially engaged evangelicals struggle with competing moral ambitions and religious imperatives that derive meaning from an overarching rubric of Christian evangelism, in which gifts of divine grace are seen as creating reciprocal obligations as well as insurmountable debt on the part of recipients. The outreach efforts of suburban churchgoers are further complicated by unequal power dynamics between charitable givers and charity recipients. While exploring the complexities of a vernacular theology through which socially engaged evangelicals wrestle with these issues, I discuss theoretical and political implications of the case study, including the role of activism in shaping religious identities and the resurgence of religious conservatism in U.S. civil society and public culture.\n      </p>", "This study employs a resource mobilization model to explain racial differences in congregation-based political activism. The fewer resources (i.e., members, income, clergy leadership, civic ties) that black congregations possess relative to white congregations largely accounts for racial differences in congregation-based lobbying and protest politics -forms of political activism that exact relatively high resource costs upon political activists. That is, black congregations become more heavily involved than white congregations in lobbying and protest politics when they have a resource capacity similar to that of white congregations. Despite their relatively few resources, black congregations are, on average, more likely than are white congregations to involve themselves in voter registration efforts. This finding has much to do with the heightened social-political expectations of African American congregants concomitant with the relatively low resource cost of voter registration programs.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Many women in the generation that attended college during the 1960s have reported that they were influenced by the social movements of that era, even women who did not participate in them. In addition to political activists, social movements also appear to include \"engaged observers\"-individuals who are attentive to movement writings and activities, and express moral and even financial support for them, but who take no other action. Although activism in a movement may be the best predictor of future political action, engaged observation may be related to other indicators of political socialization, such as a powerful felt impact of the movement and well-developed political attitudes.

Specifically, the gendered ways in which youth conceptualize and negotiate parental power influences whether or not, and in what ways, youth can emerge as visible agents of social change in their communities. For girl activists, there is more of a marked discontinuity between their political ideals and their political action because of their conflicts with parental power than for boys.

These concerns and struggles have not, however, emerged in all postsocialist contexts, and new activism in Russia reveals strikingly different agendas. Innovative groups of health providers seeking to increase women's access to birth control methods and safe sex, home birth opportunities, and improved health services work outside of feminist perspectives and reject political paths for change. By examining the ideological inspirations, cultural logics, and political-economic constraints shaping the outreach work of Russian health practitioners, the article explains how and why health activism became a site for personal \"spiritual\" revival and the strengthening of nuclear families.

By focusing on a short period of time, it aims to capture the relevance of opportunities for mobilization. It uses multivariate statistical methods to relate variations in conflict rates to economic and political conditions in the area. It shows that even when using aggregate data it is possible to identify a pattern of concentration of activism following the geographical distribution of economic growth. The paper identifies that in this region the two important factors shaping the patterns of environmental activism are the influence of border dynamics and the presence of environmental groups with the experience and capacity to form international coalitions. The analysis demonstrates that these patterns of activism may eventually influence the geography of environmental pollution in the region.

In such settings, we would not expect to find much impact by foreigners and small NGO actors on policy changes, but the cases in these countries challenge this assessment. Relatively unskilled foreign workers in present-day Northeast Asia face a range of hardships, and existing government programs have provided little support until recently. Media portrayals of foreign workers\u2014as in several other industrialized democracies\u2014reinforce popular suspicions and fear of these foreigners. Yet, citizens of host countries themselves have formed numerous voluntary associations aimed at assisting foreign workers. I call the activities of these groups \"associative activism.\" My account of associative activism makes explicit the process through which some activists, who initially work in concert chiefly to solve specific problems, eventually form broader political ambitions as they exert pressure on dominant features of the public sphere, especially processes of governance, political representation, and opinion formation. I identify three domains of associative activism through which political influence is exerted by immigrant rights groups: legislative, juridical, and municipal.

We elaborate, specify, and empirically test a collective interest model approach to citizen policy support, environmental political participation, and environmental behavior related to the issue of global warming. Key elements of the collective interest model-perceived risk, personal efficacy, and environmental values-are found to be directly, and positively, related to support of government policies and personal behaviors that affect global warming.

In this paper, I examine the factors that account for this variation in campus activism: why student activism occurred on some campuses during the 1960s and not others. With some notable exceptions (e.g., Soule 1997) theoretical developments and insights in the social movement literature have not been applied to student activism. In addition, most existing studies of student protest are ahistorical. They examine protest only within one time period, failing to recognize the influence of history and culture in fostering protest activity. I use social movement theory to explore the factors that influence the location of student protest, and develop the hypothesis that a history of activism is strongly associated with student protest. I also demonstrate that locations that have protest around one issue are likely to have protest around multiple issues. I suggest that this is due to the influence of activist subcultures, which underlie movement families within a protest cycle, influencing the ideology and tactics of activist organizations. A sample of 423 colleges forms the basis for these analyses, conducted using logistic and OLS regression models.\n      </p>", "This paper examined the hypothesis that women who took part in student movements of the 1960s would be distinguishable from their contemporaries in terms of political ideology, political behavior, and feminism in middle age. Women who had been identified as student activists in public records during the late 1960s and early 1970s were compared to a sample of nonactivist peers. Although the two groups scored similarly on variables related to work and family arrangements, former activists scored higher on measures of leftist political orientation and political efficacy, reported greater political salience and collectivism, and reported greater current political participation. Although both groups reported high levels of feminist consciousness and identity, activists scored significantly higher. The difficulty of politically mobilizing women to combat gender discrimination is discussed in light of the discrepancy between consciousness and activism in the comparison group.\n      </p>", "Using a large hand-collected data set from 2001 to 2006, we find that activist hedge funds in the United States propose strategic, operational, and financial remedies and attain success or partial success in two-thirds of the cases.

The tendency to view all environmental activism through this lens has deprived us of a deeper understanding of the way in which class, race and gender relations structured environmental experiences and responses over time. The inability of the white middle class environmental supporters of the reform environmental agenda to recognize the limits of that agenda has led working class whites, people of color and some middle class activists, marginalized and/or excluded from the reform environmental discourse, to develop alternative environmental agendas. The environmental movement is a powerful social movement, however, the movement faces enormous challenges in the future. Among the most urgent, is the need to develop a more inclusive, culturally sensitive, broad-based environmental agenda that will appeal to many people and unite many sectors of the movement. To do this the movement has to re-evaluate its relationship with industry and the government, re-appraise its role and mission, and develop strategies to understand and improve race, class and gender relations\n      </p>", "This article investigates whether school activism diminishes the alienation that accompanies urban youths' observations of unequal educational conditions, and often leads to underachievement and school rejection. The study is based on interviews with 13 urban youth about their participation in a community-based program that supports education organizing. Findings reveal that school activism is a promising intervention that encourages more constructive responses to schooling. However, the opportunity to participate in school activism was more influential for students who were already integrated into school life and initially felt less acutely alienated. Implications for enhancing the prevalence of success among urban students are considered.\n      </p>", "This article examines the contextual determinants of two types of NAACP activism between 1930 and 1939. They are the justice-oriented outreach of insurgency (e.g., a civil rights rally), and chapter-building activities (e.g., electing committee chairpersons). Activism is analyzed using a more diverse set of factors than previous research on the sociopolitical context of social movements. Specifically, I examine historical urbanization and prior racial institutional development in 136 urban counties of the United States, about 95% of the 1930 African American urban system. WLS regression is used to provide a strong statistical basis for understanding the structural power and liberation context of these two distinct types of activism during the uniquely constrained Depression Era. Both insurgency and chapter-building activities increased due to the expanding non-southern location of African Americans and the effects of WWI-era declines in the population of foreign-born whites. They declined as a result of extreme racial-occupational segregation in the local area and being distant from a predominantly African American county. The factors shaping the two types of activism were not equal, in part due to both shared and non-shared determinants. A particularly instructive finding was that wage growth served as a lever of social control, being negatively related to insurgency. Viewed together, the findings clearly point to the joint influence of economic and noneconomic factors in shaping NAACP activism during the 1930s, and enhance our understanding of the broader determinants of African American activism generally.\n      </p>", "This work offers an empirical analysis of 32 gay/lesbian sponsored anti-violence projects in the United States. The analytic focus is on how gay and lesbian communities have brought attention to the scope and consequences of anti-gay and lesbian violence in the United States, which \"has taken its place among such societal concerns as violence against women, children and ethnic and racial groups\" (Comstock 1991:1). In large part, this is because within lesbian and gay communities across the United States there has been an \"unprecedented level of organizing against violence\" (National Gay and Lesbian Task Force 1991:22). This activism continues to include documenting the incidents and prevalence of anti-gay and lesbian violence, establishing crisis intervention and victim assistance programs, sponsoring public education campaigns, and undertaking surveillance efforts in the form of street patrols. My analysis of these activities brings together elements of the social problems and the social movements literature; it demonstrates that domain expansion (Best 1990) accompanies social movement growth and provides a necessary resource for framing select social conditions as a social problem.\n      </p>", "Social movement scholars have long been skeptical of culture's impact on political change, perhaps for good reason, since little empirical research explicitly addresses this question. This article fills the void by examining the dynamics and the impact of the month-long 2004 same-sex wedding protest in San Francisco. We integrate insights of contentious politics approaches with social constructionist conceptions and identify three core features of cultural repertoires: contestation, intentionality, and collective identity. Our analyses, which draw on rich qualitative and quantitative data from interviews with participants and movement leaders and a random survey of participants, highlight these dimensions of cultural repertoires as well as the impact that the same-sex wedding protest had on subsequent activism. Same-sex weddings, as our multimethod analyses show, were an intentional episode of claim-making, with participants arriving with a history of activism in a variety of other social movements. Moreover, relative to the question of impact, the initial protest sparked other forms of political action that ignited a statewide campaign for marriage equality in California. Our results offer powerful evidence that culture can be consequential not only internally, with implications for participant solidarity and identity, but for political change and further action as well. We conclude by discussing the specifics of our case and the broader implications for social movement scholars.\n      </p>", "This paper presents a game between a fiscal authority, an independent central bank and non-atomistic wage setters.

Numerical results suggest that the benefits of targeting inflation are larger when the government pursues an activist policy and therefore that there is some substitutability between fiscal and monetary rules.\n      </p>", "Women Waging Peace is a partnership of NGOs, government structures and award-winning community-based women activists.

She also poses questions for feminist scholars who struggle about whether moving toward the center or mainstream of an institution means having to lose pieces of oneself in the tenure process. In order to provide additional perspective on this issue, Fred P. Piercy, the department head, and Andrew Stremmel, the departmental chair of the tenure and promotion committee, also reflect on this dilemma and suggest ways of turning teaching and service into scholarship that counts for tenure.

Statistically controlling for other influences, including precollege measures of each outcome, we found that interactional diversity positively influenced both social/political activism and liberal political views, and that classroom diversity had a small positive influence on social/political activism. More importantly, however, we also found that the magnitude of the effects of both interactional and classroom diversity is substantially determined by individual student precollege characteristics.\n      </p>", "Past decades have witnessed the growing success of branding as a corporate activity as well as a rise in anti-brand activism. While appearing to be contradictory, both trends have emerged from common sources - the transition from industrial to post-industrial society, and the advent of globalization - the examination of which might lead to a socially grounded understanding of why brand success in the future is likely to demand more than superior product performance, placing increasing demand on corporations with regard to a broader envelop of socially responsible behavior. Directions for strategic and managerial options are suggested.\n      </p>", "This essay examines the applicability of the concept of civil society to contemporary Japanese religions. The first section discusses the concept of civil society, addressing the potential advantages and pitfalls of considering religious organizations alongside civil society organizations. The second section addresses issues in the history of Japanese civil society and religion. Subsequent sections present the results of an attempt to align the founding of a variety of religious organizations with a chronology of the expansion of civil society, and to examine religions' peace activism from 1999 to 2003 in the context of civil society debate about peace, with an assessment of the results.\n      </p>", "This political memoir describes the author's 1979 summer job, at age eighteen, going door-to-door for the Equal Rights Amendment (E.R.A.). Critical attention is paid to the difficulties experienced in \"the field\"-fundraising expectations, canvassing assignments in remote or right-wing suburbs, and the often hostile responses from householders unexpectedly presented with feminist petitions on their own doorsteps. How did false rumors about the E.R.A. create a backlash among Americans? Wry nostalgia aside, are historians and students of feminism in danger of forgetting this unique period of political activism?\n      </p>", "In this article, we document the growing influence of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the realm of socially responsible investing (SRI). Drawing from ethical and economic perspectives on stakeholder management and agency theory, we develop a framework to understand how and when NGOs will be most influential in shaping the ethical and social responsibility orientations of business using the emergence of SRI as the primary influencing vehicle. We find that NGOs have opportunities to influence corporate conduct via direct, indirect, and interactive influences on the investment community, and that the overall influence of NGOs as major actors in socially responsible investment is growing, with attendant consequences for corporate strategy, governance, and social performance.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "This paper examines the challenges facing the Society of Muslim Brothers in Egypt as it negotiates the democratic opening of the Arab spring. An Islamist movement with an established ideological track record, the Society of Muslim Brothers has played a prominent role in Egyptian society for over eighty years. It has now emerged as a major political faction, but its Islamist values and goals may conflict with the democratic politics to which it has committed. Compromise is not new to the Society of Muslim Brothers; it has survived as a movement by doing so. Working on behalf of the Islamist cause in the streets, however, is vastly different than representing an entire nation in the halls of power. Now the Society of Muslim Brothers must decide whether to reinterpret its Islamist agenda for the good of the polity or reinterpret democracy for narrow movement interests.\n      </p>", "There are challenges to the dominant research paradigm in breast cancer science. In the United States, science and social activism create paradigmatic shifts. Using interviews, ethnographic observations, and an extensive review of the literature, we create a three-dimensional model to situate changes in scientific controversy concerning environmental causes of breast cancer. We identify three paradigm challenges posed by activists and some scientists: (1) to move debates about causation upstream to address causes; (2) to shift emphasis from individual to modifiable societal-level factors beyond an individual's control; and (3) to allow direct lay involvement in research, which may raise new questions and change how questions are approached, the methods used, and the standards of proof. We use our model to examine controversies about doing scientific research, interpreting scientific results, and acting on science. Ultimately, we aim to understand what impedes construction of new methodologies and knowledge about environmental factors in human disease.\n      </p>", "Higher education is in crisis, especially in the public sector. Over the past few years, tuition at state universities across the country has increased dramatically, their budgets have been slashed and federal funding for need-based financial aid has been reduced. The results are increased class sizes, fewer course offerings, more adjunct faculty and fewer working-class students at public colleges and universities. In Massachusetts, where we teach, these trends are particularly pronounced. In this paper, we describe \"Crisis in Higher Education,\" a critical experiential course we offered to raise student awareness about the crisis and to encourage them to work for change on our campus. This course is an example of critical experiential education because it integrates classroom learning with political activism. This article describes the context and rationale for teaching the course, reports on students' responses to its form and content, and discusses what we learned from this experience.\n      </p>", "ABSTRACT: This case study of the birth and death of a human relations commission in California contributes to our understanding of the emotional stakes of social movement participation and the meaning of multiculturalism in the U.S. post\u2013civil rights era. The research indicates the extent to which resonant movement frames are necessary for movement success and how their absence can cause emotional harm to movement adherents. In this account of institutional activism, the frameworks of human relations and multiculturalism\u2014simultaneously affective and amorphous\u2014attracted participation but produced a harmful emotional climate and ultimately proved insufficient to inspire collective identity and action. Thus, instead of transforming social movement behavior, the state project of human relations deployed here succeeded in invigorating entrenched grievances and identities. Other factors, such as leadership, social movement identity work, and the \u201cemotion culture\u201d of movements are also discussed. Findings presented herein are based on one year of participant observation, twenty-four interviews, and analysis of public records.\n      </p>", "In this paper I explore the emergence of women's organizations and feminist consciousness in the twentieth century in the English-speaking (Commonwealth) Caribbean. The global ideas concerning women's equality from the 1960s onwards clearly informed the initiatives taken by both women and states of the Caribbean. None the less, the paper illustrates, by use of examples, the interlocked nature of women's struggles with the economic, social and political issues which preoccupy the region's population. I examine in greater detail two case studies of women's activism and mobilization around the impact of structural adjustment policies in the two territories of Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago. By tracing the connections between and among the organizations and initiatives of women in the region, the paper situates the feminist movement in the English-speaking Caribbean as a continuously evolving one, fusing episodic struggles in different territories, engaging women of different classes and groups, and continuously building on past experience.\n      </p>", "Integrating system-justification and objectification theories, the research reported here broadens the scope of prior work on women's self-objectification to examine its system-justifying function. I investigated the relation of trait and state self-objectification to support for the gender status quo and engagement in gender-based social activism among U.S. college women. Study 1 established that greater trait self-objectification was related to more gender-specific system justification and less engagement in gender-based social activism. The data supported a mediational model in which gender-specific system justification mediated the link between trait self-objectification and social activism. Results from Study 2, in which self-objectification was situationally activated, confirmed the same mediational model. These findings suggest that trait and state self-objectification may be part of a wider pattern of system-justifying behavior that maintains gender inequality and thwarts women's pursuit of social justice.\n      </p>", "Contemporary Islamic activism is manifested in heterogeneous and overlapping forms. This paper aims at furthering the understanding of Islamic activism by developing a two-dimensional typology that accounts for the nature of Islamic activism discourse and the outlook of its programmatic action. Specifically, the terrain of Islamic activism is mapped out by intersecting two orientations: the approach toward understanding sharia (Islam's socio-religious teachings) and the form of activism. As for sharia approaches, three modes of thinking occupy Islamic activism: a didactic mode, a literalist mode, and an eclectic mode. On the other hand, three forms of activism divide the field of action: a local social movement of a limited scope of concerns, a global social movement of expansive social and political themes, and an individualistic type of activism. The interaction of these types of activism with the modes of sharia understanding produces the ecology of contemporary Islamic activism.\n      </p>", "As the prevalence of \"conscious\" consumption has grown, questions have arisen about its relationship to political action. An influential argument holds that political consumption individualizes responsibility for environmental degradation and \"crowds out\" genuine forms of activism. While European and Canadian empirical research contradicts this perspective, finding that conscious consumption and political engagement are positively connected, no studies of this relationship have been conducted for the United States. This article presents ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models for two datasets, the 2004 General Social Survey and a detailed survey of approximately 2,200 conscious consumers conducted by the authors, to assess the nature of the relationship between conscious consumption and political activism. The authors find that measures of conscious consumption are significantly and positively related to political action, even when controlling for political involvement in the past. The results suggest that greater levels of political consumption are positively related to a range of political actions.\n      </p>", "Hedge fund activism is a new form of investment strategy. Using a large hand-collected dataset from 2001 to 2006, we find that activist hedge funds in the United States propose strategic, operational, and financial remedies and attain success or partial success in two-thirds of the cases. The abnormal stock return upon announcement of activism is approximately 7 percent, with no reversal during the subsequent year. Target firms experience increases in payout and operating performance and higher CEO turnover after activism. We find large positive abnormal return to hedge fund activists, which is higher than the return to other equity-oriented hedge funds.\n      </p>", "Modern nation states have tied their political processes to the actions of citizens and have therefore become preoccupied with developing \u201cthe good citizen,\u201d positioning youth as the key to this social experiment. Modernist attitudes and practices, however, are giving way to new economic, political, and cultural structures. This new age of postmodernity and globalization is characterized by a declining ability of nation states to control economies, cultures, and, to a certain degree, politics. In many cases, the meaning and the promise of political participation has eroded. This, in turn, has given rise to a new preoccupation with civic engagement. Most studies have found low levels of interest in civic engagement among youth. Despite these general findings, there are some youth who care deeply about their communities and whose activism has been increasing in recent years. In this paper, I present some preliminary thoughts on an ongoing project that seeks to understand the participatory trajectories of civically engaged youth; the ways in which they engage; and their thoughts on their rights, their world and on politics in general.\n      </p>", "Capture-recapture methods are of general interest because they can be applied to conventional historical sources to address otherwise intractable questions about the size and dynamics of historical populations. When employed to assess alternative explanations for the long-term trajectory of party activism in Britain\u2014based on data drawn from the South Lewisham Labour Party\u2014they suggest that the falling supply of individuals prepared to become politically involved is more important than the changing demand of parties for activists.\n      </p>"], "words": {"essay": {"number": 3, "prob":
