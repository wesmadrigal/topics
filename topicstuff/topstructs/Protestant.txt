{"total_words": 1156, "documents": ["This essay seeks to survey the range of themes and approaches taken by Southern Irish Protestant memoirists writing since 1950. It argues that their testimony as descendants of the former Protestant Ascendancy and as members of a small religious minority adapting to life in independent Ireland provides a unique perspective on Irish social life in the twentieth century demanding closer scrutiny. Far from the homogenous and moribund community it is generally assumed to be, Southern Irish Protestantism is depicted by its memoirists as a diverse and evolving part of the larger society. Particular attention is paid here to the writers' treatment of such questions as genealogical inheritance, relationship to the land, and participation in civic life.\n      </p>", "This article analyzes how thirty mainline Protestant clergy who addressed homosexuality in their local congregations positioned themselves within their congregations on the issue. Regardless of their positions, all of the pastors first situated the root causes of religious and broader societal conflicts over homosexuality in an emotion, fear, which they understood as their congregants' fears of sexuality, gay and lesbian people, misinterpreting scripture, and the unknown. Based on their understandings of these fears, clergy then drew from their individual cultural \"toolkits\" to construct personal \"strategies of action\" via personal identities as facilitators, quiet advocates, or more outward advocates around homosexuality in their congregations. The authors analyze the processes by which clergy constructed these identities, with particular attention to the strategies of action attendant within each identity category. This analysis advances substantive knowledge about how clergy respond to homosexuality in local congregations and theoretical knowledge about how religious leaders construct personal identities as one \"strategy of action\" (among many) when addressing controversial social issues in local religious organizations.\n      </p>", "Weber's conceptualization of the Protestant ethic has played a significant role in modern social and economic thought. However, a flaw, which he himself had noted, is that he was putting forth a psychological argument when psychology was not yet adequately developed. A striking omission is the release of hatred and violence engendered by the Protestant ethic. The major thesis of this paper is that because of its intolerable destructiveness, the Protestant ethic is gradually giving way to the psychoanalytic ideal as a guideline for work and for society. Studies have shown a shift in the democratic countries from traditional outer-directedness to a more inner-psychological view of man and of happiness. Although love and work were the cornerstones of Freud's philosophy, a psychoanalytic theory of work had never been clearly formulated. Such a formulation is attempted here. Work satisfaction must derive from favorable early socializing experiences. Ideally there is a growth from working for love to love of work.\n      </p>", "It is accepted that Victorian attitudes to love, chastity, marriage, and the family, all rooted in Christianity, played an important part in changing norms of behavior related to gender relationships in Meiji Japan. But writers on Christianity in Meiji Japan have paid little attention to women and the influence of Christian ideals on the actual behavior of Meiji Christians. This paper examines gender interaction in early Meiji Protestant circles and the evidence available for the marriage relationships of five Protestant leaders: Ibuka Kajinosuke, Uemura Masahisa, Ebina Danj\u014d, Kozaki Hiromichi, whose marriages seem to have been successful, and Uchimura Kanz\u014d, whose first marriage was not. Particular attention is paid to four issues: the extent to which the individuals studied had participated in gender interaction in Christian circles before becoming deeply involved, how partners were chosen, how the partnerships developed and, finally, the tensions that arose and what was done about them.\n      </p>", "The author discusses the sixteenth-century Protestant Reformation as a human rights movement. The Reformation not only laid the groundwork for religious human rights but also created the platform for the more expansive conceptions of individual liberty that shaped the political development of the West.

Born in 1862 in Morioka in the last years of the Tokugawa period, he imbibed Christianity while attending the Sapporo Agricultural College. That institution's unique historical environment, and the spiritual legacy implanted there by its charismatic founding president, William S. Clark, is described, and it is demonstrated how Inaz\u014d and his classmates were profoundly influenced by New England puritan values in their early exposure to Protestant Christianity. It follows Inaz\u014d on his six-and-a-half years of study abroad, and traces his inward struggles to attain a genuine Christian faith free from the taint of foreign culture. His academic studies in the United States and Germany is described in detail. Special attention is paid to his Quaker religious experiences, since these left indelible marks upon his later life and career. Peculiar tenets of his faith and mentioned, and one in particular-the doctrine of pacifism-is highlighted; one which many people who have studied Nitobe's career feel he failed to resolve adequately. Finally, there are some remarks about the legacy of the Sapporo Band, of whom Sat\u014d Sh\u014dsuke, \u014cshima Masatake, Uchimura Kanz\u014d, Miyabe Kingo, and Nitobe stand out most notably today.\n      </p>", "This paper explores the symbolic and dramatic expressions in town ceremony of death themes associated with war and emigration and with the life and death of towns in the process of recurring changes.

Insgesamt umfa\u00dft diese Bev\u00f6lkerungsgruppe etwa 120 000 Menschen. Sie repr\u00e4sentieren weniger als 5% der Gesamtbev\u00f6lkerung. Die meisten protestantischen Schulanf\u00e4nger besuchen eine staatlich unterhaltene National School, die gew\u00f6hnlich von einem protestantischen Geistlichen geleitet wird. Grundlage der Ausbildung sind hier vorwiegend die F\u00e4cher Irisch, English und Mathematik. Sch\u00fclerzahl und Gr\u00f6\u00dfe der protestantischen National Schools variieren je nach der geographischen Lage der Schulen stark. Etwa 50% der Schulen haben weniger als 25 Sch\u00fcler und weniger als 1% haben 100 und mehr Sch\u00fcler. Die sch\u00fclerreichen Schulen liegen alle in oder in der N\u00e4he von County Boroughs. Die Betonung des Irischunterrichts zeigt, welche Bedeutung die Regierung der irischen Sprache f\u00fcr das \u00f6ffentliche Leben beimi\u00dft und macht ihr Bestreben deutlich, diese Sprache wieder zur ersten offiziellen Landessprache zu erheben. Diese Politik hat wichtige Folgen f\u00fcr die Lehrplangestaltung der Primar- und Sekundarschulen sowie f\u00fcr Anstellung und Besoldung der Lehrer durch den Staat. Die Sekundarschulbildung erfolgt gew\u00f6hnlich an einer der 42 privaten protestantischen Sekundarschulen. Mehr als die H\u00e4lfte dieser Schulen liegen im Gebiet von Dublin, und weite Gebiete der Republik besitzen \u00fcberhaupt keine protestantische Sekundarschule. Die meisten dieser Schulen sind Internate, und viele au\u00dferhalb von Dublin gelegene Schulen nehmen Jungen und M\u00e4dchen auf. Infolge des Zur\u00fcckgehens der protestantischen Bev\u00f6lkerung liegen die Schulen in Konkurrenz, um Schulgeld zahlende Sch\u00fcler zu erhalten. Alle protestantischen Sekundarschulen erhalten staatliche Unterst\u00fctzung, wenn sie die staatlichen Bestimmungen erf\u00fcllen. Die nach dem staatlich anerkannten Lehrplan durchgef\u00fchrte Ausbildung f\u00fchrt gew\u00f6hnlich zur \u201eMittleren Reife'' (Intermediate Certificate Examination), die mit etwa 16 Jahren abgelegt, und zum Abschlu\u00dfexamen (Leaving Certificate Examination), das mit etwa 18 Jahren abgelegt werden kann. Die Betonung des Irischunterrichts isi f\u00fcr die gesamte Ausbildung charakteristisch. Dar\u00fcberhinaus besuchen einige protestantische Sch\u00fcler staatlich unterhaltene Berufsschulen und erhalten eine gewerbliche oder kaufm\u00e4nnische Ausbildung. Gegenw\u00e4rtig ist die Zahl dieser Sch\u00fcler jedoch sehr niedrig, sie l\u00e4\u00dft die geringe Bedeutung erkennen, die noch immer der Berufsschulbildung beigemessen wird. Die Ausbildung protestantischer Lehrer erfolgt f\u00fcr National Schools am Seminar der Church of Ireland und f\u00fcr Lehrer der Sekundar- und Berufsschulen am Lehrerseminar der Universit\u00e4t Dublin. Die Lehrer erwerben entweder das Primarschullehrer-Diplom (Diploma in Elementary Education) oder Sekundar- schullehrer- Diplom (Higher Diploma in Education). Um in den Staatsdienst aufgenommen zu werden, m\u00fcssen die Lehrer die irische Sprache beherrschen. Erhebliche Besorgnis erregen zur Zeit der Mangel an protestantischen Hochschulabsolventen, die die Lehrerlaufbahn einschlagen wollen, die vielfach unzureichenden Schulgeb\u00e4ude, Finanzieringsfragen und die Besoldung der Lehrer. Neuere Empfehlungen betonen die Notwendigkeit, die Zahl der Schulen zu reduzieren und gr\u00f6\u00dfere Schulen zu bauen, sie fordern bessere Ausstattung und engere Koordinierung der protestantischen Schulpolitik /// Les Protestants de la R\u00e9publique d'Irlande se composent des membres de la Church of Ireland (3.7%), de Presbyt\u00e9riens (0.7%) et de M\u00e9thodistes (0.2%). Ils comptent en tout 120.000 personnes qui repr\u00e9sentent moins de 5% de la population nationale qui est principalement catholique. Au niveau primaire la plupart des \u00e9l\u00e8ves protestants fr\u00e9quentent une \"Ecole Nationale\" subventionn\u00e9e par l'Etat o\u00f9 ils suivent un programme bas\u00e9 sur l'irlandais, l'anglais et l'arithm\u00e9tique et qui est dirig\u00e9e par un pasteur protestant. Les \"Ecoles Nationales\" protestantes varient en importance suivant leur situation. Pr\u00e8s de 50% d'entre elles comptent moins de 25 \u00e9l\u00e8ves et moins de 1% ont 100 \u00e9l\u00e8ves ou plus. Celles-ci sont toutes situ\u00e9es dans les County Boroughs de la R\u00e9publique ou dans les environs. L'accent qui est mis sur l'irlandais d\u00e9montre que le Gouvernement est conscient de l'importanc\u00e9 de la langue irlandaise dans la vie nationale et qu'il tend \u00e0 la promouvoir au rang de premi\u00e8re langue officielle. Cette politique a d'importantes r\u00e9percussions sur l'organisation du programme scolaire aussi bien au niveau primaire que post-primaire ainsi que sur la consid\u00e9ration des professeurs pour le paiement de leurs appointements par l'Etat. L'\u00e9ducation post-primaire pour les Protestants a lieu g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement dans d'une des 42 \u00e9coles secondaires priv\u00e9es.

Devant la diminution de la population protestante il y a une comp\u00e9tition en vue d'attirer des \u00e9tudiants payants. Toutes les \u00e9coles secondaires protestantes b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient d'une subvention de l'Etat pour autant qu'elles observent les exigences du Gouvernement. Le programme approuv\u00e9 conduit normalement \u00e0 l'Intermediate Certificate Examination (qui a lieu vers l'\u00e2ge de 16 ans) et au Leaving Certificate Examination (qui a lieu vers l'\u00e2ge de 18 ans) et continue \u00e0 mettre l'accent sur l'irlandais. En outre quelques Protestants fr\u00e9quentent des \u00e9coles professionnelles subventionn\u00e9es par l'Etat et suivent en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral les cours techniques ou commerciaux. Actuellement, toutefois, cette fr\u00e9quentation scolaire est peu importante ce qui refl\u00e8te le peu de prestige accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l'enseignement professionnel.

But the proportion Protestant in the population has been falling for over a decade, and Protestants are poised to lose their majority status. This decline results from a decline in the intergenerational retention rate for Protestants and from the attrition of Protestants among the youngest cohorts. Shifts in immigration also contribute to the Protestant decline. We also consider the role of an increasing share of people identifying as generic Christians and as inter- or nondenominational.\n      </p>", "Social transformations in Brazil in recent years have included a substantial increase in adolescent fertility, a dramatic rise in membership of Protestant religious denominations, and an accompanying decline in the number of Catholics. We used the 2000 Brazil Census to examine differentials in fertility and family formation among adolescents living in Rio de Janeiro by the following religious denominations: Catholic; Baptist; other mainline Protestant; Assembly of God Church; Universal Church of the Kingdom of God; other Pentecostal Protestant; and no religion. Results from logistic regression models show that the majority of the Protestants are at a lower risk of adolescent fertility than Catholics, and that among adolescents who have had a child, most Protestants are more likely than Catholics to be in a committed union. Our findings offer some support for the hypothesis that Protestant churches are more effective than the Catholic Church in discouraging premarital sexual relations and childbearing among adolescents.\n      </p>", "As part of ongoing research on Protestant evangelism in Central Mexico, this article focuses on two native evangelical congregations in the C\u00f3rdoba-Orizaba region in the state of Veracruz: one of very recent inception, the other founded five decades ago.

This exercise should illuminate a religious tide that is not well understood, and appears bound to spread under the increasing proselytism of Protestant evangelism in most countries of Latin America.\n      </p>", "This study examines the question: Why would an employee engage in work that enhances organizational performance but is not necessarily recognized or rewarded by his or her employer?

We examine this for Catholic-Protestant intermarriage in the Republic of Ireland. We use a multivariate analysis on survey data to test the hypotheses that urban dwellers, persons of non-farming parents, persons with higher levels of education and the young are more likely to be religiously intermarried. While the odds of being in an intermarriage are greater for urban dwellers, this is in large part due to their being non-farmers. The farming effect is not necessarily related to religiosity. The odds of being in an intermarriage do not increase significantly for persons with third level education and this can be explained in terms of the marriage market for minority groups. It is shown that the historical context and the minority position of religious group should be taken into account in explanations which relate modernization to the pattern of religious intermarriage.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The tabulation suggests that the likelihood of marriage across the Catholic-Protestant divide is no greater for manual workers than for nonmanual workers when controls are introduced for relative group size. Though care needs to be taken in interpretation in the absence of data on conversion patterns, there are indications that Catholic women marry out more often than Catholic men and that Catholics marry Anglicans more frequently than they do members of other denominations.

I examine interactions among Protestants as they discuss homosexuality in two sites, an ex-gay movement seminar and a pro-gay liberal congregation. In two opposed groups, the genre of testimony produced an authentic-seeming truth, working performatively to produce group boundaries, to legitimate authority and hierarchies in the group, and to tacitly define certain categories as abject, unlivable.

In the 1985 survey, family size was similar for those Catholics who actively participated in religious activities and those who, though nominally Catholic, were not active participants. By 1999, the family size of the latter was lower and comparable to the family size of those without religious affiliation. These findings accord with the declines in both church attendance and fertility in Spain. The small groups of Protestants and Muslims had the highest fertility.

But what does it mean to call the Century influential? Whom did it influence, and how? This article takes a historical approach, examining the size of the Century's audience, the nature of the magazine's impact on its readers, and the ability of those readers to extend the magazine's impact beyond themselves. The main source for this investigation is a cache of more than 2,100 unpublished letters collected in 1928 to celebrate Charles Clayton Morrison's twentieth anniversary as editor. In subscribers' own words, the letters illustrated the Century's role as a crucial link among readers with similar backgrounds and aspirations, as well as the limits of its reach beyond this cohort. The article argues that the Century was influential, but not because it converted (directly or through its clergy readers) large numbers of American Protestants to its progressive vision for Christianity. Rather, the Century was primarily influential in the process of mainline identification, both in the sense of defining which writers, institutions, and ideas belonged to the emerging mainline tradition and in the sense of offering readers an opportunity to identify with that tradition. A better understanding of the Century's influence during the Morrison era sheds light on the rise of the mainline. Additionally, a better understanding of the kinds of influence magazines do and do not exercise is helpful for anyone who looks to periodicals to provide a barometer of cultural trends.\n      </p>", "The first aim of this paper was to investigate how the traditional Protestant work ethic (PWE) and more contemporary work values (i.e., masculine, feminine, and entrepreneurship values) were related to one another, and differed across genders and two cultural contexts, namely Turkey and the U.S. The second aim was to elucidate the role of religiosity in PWE among the two cultural groups. Two hundred and sixty six American and 211 Turkish university students participated in this questionnaire study. The analyses examining cross-cultural differences revealed that Turkish university students reported greater scores in the PWE and all contemporary work values as compared to their American counterparts. For the Turkish sample, there were no gender-related differences in the PWE, whereas in the U.S. sample, men reported greater PWE scores than did women. With regard to gender differences in contemporary work values, our results showed that gender groups differed in feminine and entrepreneurship values in both cultural contexts; men emphasized femininity and entrepreneurship more than women in Turkey but the reverse was true in the U.S. Correlations between contemporary work values and the PWE illustrated that the PWE is associated with entrepreneurship and masculine values in both cultural contexts and with feminine values in the Turkish context. Finally, our results regarding the role of religiosity in PWE indicated that highly religious participants reported greater PWE scores than the less religious ones regardless of culture. Findings are discussed with reference both to differences in the two socio-cultural contexts and to recent change in the social structure of Turkish society.\n      </p>", "Max Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, studied in isolation, shows mainly an elective affinity or an adequacy on the level of meaning between the Protestant ethic and the 'spirit' of capitalism. Here it is suggested that Weber's subsequent essays on 'The Economic Ethics of World Religions' are the result of his opinion that adequacy on the level of meaning needs and can be verified by causal adequacy. After some introductory remarks, particularly on elective affinity, the paper tries to develop the concept of adequate causation and the related concept of objective possibility on the basis of the work of v. Kries on whom Weber heavily relied. In the second part, this concept is used to show how the study of the economic ethics of India, China, Rome and orthodox Russia can support the thesis that the 'spirit' of capitalism, although it may not have been caused by the Protestant ethic, was perhaps adequately caused by it.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Using data from the 1972-1996 General Social Surveys, no difference greater than sampling variation is found between Protestants and Catholics in the most recent 5-year period (1992-1996) in the proportion holding either a pro-life or a pro-choice position on abortion. Sociological factors underlying this convergence are found to be: a steep decline in church attendance over the period among Catholics, but not Protestants; increasing variance from church teaching even among the highly committed; and strong polarization in opinion by age. A loglinear model fitting contrasting linear trends for Protestants and Catholics in successive 5-year categories of age, cohort and period provides an extremely close fit to the data. However, younger, highly committed Protestants (even liberal Protestants) are growing much more restrictive and while younger, highly committed Catholics are growing much more permissive on abortion. This combination of within-group polarization and between-group convergence provides qualified support for the thesis of religious restructuring advanced by Wuthnow and Hunter, but more detailed analysis reveals complex countercurrents of opinion that defy theoretical systematization. It is argued that the future behavior of the opposing trends -- whether they continue, producing a new divergence, or diminish, producing continued equivalence -- will adjudicate between theoretical strategies for future research.\n      </p>", "This paper examines similarities and differences in Roman Catholic, Protestant and Mormon religious beliefs and moral values. Questionnaire data were collected from 405 adults attending church in one of 12 congregations representing six denominations. Factor analysis of the items and multivariate analysis of variance of scales assessing these factors were used to illuminate Mormon and non-Mormon similarities and differences. These data indicate that Mormons have adopted many religious beliefs and moral values accepted by other Christian groups (especially conservative ones) while at the same time strongly holding to a set of religious views very different from those of the other Christian groups studied.\n      </p>", "Protestant Christianity has been a prominent part of the general religious resurgence in China in the past two decades. In many ways it is the most striking example of that resurgence. Along with Roman Catholics, as of the 1950s Chinese Protestants carried the heavy historical liability of association with Western domination or imperialism in China, yet they have not only overcome that inheritance but have achieved remarkable growth. Popular media and human rights organizations in the West, as well as various Christian groups, publish a wide variety of information and commentary on Chinese Protestants. This article first traces the gradual extension of interest in Chinese Protestants from Christian circles to the scholarly world during the last two decades, and then discusses salient characteristics of the Protestant movement today. These include its size and rate of growth, the role of Church-state relations, the continuing foreign legacy in some parts of the Church, the strong flavour of popular religion which suffuses Protestantism today, the discourse of Chinese intellectuals on Christianity, and Protestantism in the context of the rapid economic changes occurring in China, concluding with a perspective from world Christianity.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ms to reverse unenlightened prejudices which have resulted from the lack of intellectual improvement of the people of Ireland.

Using data from a large random sample of Protestant clergy, we find a substantial amount of engagement in culture wars by all types of Protestant clergy. The amount of polarization is more attributable to views of religious authority (i. e., biblical inerrancy) than to religious tradition. Moreover, polarization among clergy is somewhat more evident on culture wars issues than on other social and political issues. These findings are generally supportive of the culture wars thesis and should help return examinations of culture wars back to where they were originally theorized to be waged: among elites.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "The relationship between religion, the work ethic and socioeconomic success was examined using longitudinal survey data.

We then develop a theoretical model, and test hypotheses distilled from this model using data on a sample of Protestant seminary students (base N = 635) drawn in 1995-96. As expected, seminarians from Conservative Protestant denominations are less supportive of family planning than their mainline counterparts, although respondents in both groups express broadly favorable views of family planning. This observed denominational pattern is accounted for by the disproportionate tendency of fundamentalist and evangelical students to view the Bible as the inerrant Word of God. In turn, the strong relationship between inerrancy and family planning attitudes seems to reflect the inclination of inerrantists: (a) to interpret a key fertility-related passage, Gen. 1:28a, as a command and/or a blessing from God directed at individuals and couples; and (b) to harbor more conservative attitudes regarding human sexuality. Several alternative explanations for the denominational variations in family planning attitudes are also explored. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for future research on Conservative Protestant attitudinal distinctiveness, and on the links between religion and health issues.\n      </p>", "Under the auspices of the Institute of Social and Religious Research, 2,000 white Protestant churches in urban sectors of sixteen American cities have been studied for a period of two years.

A schedule was devised to factorize the progress of churches out of line with the social trends of their environment. The percentage of such churches was found to be very small, less than I3 per cent of the total. Analysis of so-called inner causes of the failure of certain churches to conform to the rule of corespondence between church progress and social trends indicates that the number of strictly internal forces determining progress is very small.

Responses to 7 original questionnaire items indicate that Protestants and Catholics perceived Protestant churches as democratic and the Catholic church as hierarchical.

However, a review of recent studies indicates that this hypothesis is anything but fruitful.

It is doubtful that sociological study of American religion will make much progress until a moratorium is proclaimed on further use of the current simplistic version of the Weberian theory.\n      </p>", "In this analysis of 7,443 parish clergy from six mainstream Protestant denominations, we have examined the clustering of religious beliefs. The survey provides a substantially more sophisticated array of theological belief than previous research, and covers sixteen theological content areas.

The key factor which represents the major dimension of belief among Protestant clergy forms a continuum from a relatively literal to a relatively demythologized interpretation of the faith. We have conluded, therefore, that the structure of belief among mainstream Protestant clergy is unidimensional. We would further speculate that the most significant concomitants of belief would stem from this fact.\n      </p>", "During biblical tours, Jewish Israeli guides and Protestant pastors become coproducers of a mutually satisfying performance that transforms the often-contested terrain of Israel-Palestine into Bible Land.

While some scholars claim that Protestant hegemony persists, others argue that we live in a post-Protestant era. We assess these conflicting views by examining the religious affiliations of persons listed in Who's Who in America in 1930 and 1992. The results indicate that the Protestant Establishment has lost some ground since the 1930s but remains overrepresented among the nation's power and cultural elites.

Since individual-level data are not available for this time period, aggregate census data for small geographic units have been heavily used to infer the support of the Nazi party by various compositional groups. Many of these studies hint at a complex geographic patterning. Recent developments in geographic methodologies, based on Geographic Information Science (GIS) and spatial statistics, allow a deeper probing of these regional and local contextual elements. In this paper, a suite of geographic methods\u2014global and local measures of spatial autocorrelation, variography, distance-based correlation, directional spatial correlograms, vector mapping, and barrier definition (wombling)\u2014are used in an exploratory spatial data analysis of the NSDAP vote. The support for the NSDAP by Protestant voters (estimated using King's ecological inference procedure) is the key correlate examined. The results from the various methods are consistent in showing a voting surface of great complexity, with many local clusters that differ from the regional trend. The Weimar German electoral map does not show much evidence of a nationalized electorate, but is better characterized as a mosaic of support for \"milieu parties,\" mixed across class and other social lines, and defined by a strong attachment to local traditions, beliefs, and practices.\n      </p>", "\"One Protestant Looks At Centesimus Annus\" is an attempt to analyze Pope John Paul II's centennial encylical on economic justice in context. It relates the early contributions of Reformation thought to the emergence of laissez-faire capitalism. It describes the \"social gospel\" as a convergence of the radical implications of 19th century German Protestant scholarship and the harsh economic/social realities of the industrial revolution. Then it compares the economic teachings of the institutional church from Leo XIII and the old Federal Council of Churches to John Paul II and the World Council of Churches one hundred years later. All of this prepares the way for a critical analysis of Centesimus Annus with a special emphasis on the Pope's understanding of \"Christian truth\".

Besides the hostility to magic, or disenchantment of the magical world view, these include: a collective religious discipline typified by a perception of time as the schedule of activities; an open or linear time perspective or \"frozen\" eschatology; an the need to create or establish one's personal identity as an heir to the divine blessings.\n      </p>", "The author examines the views of several theorists associated with the Frankfurt School of Social Research on the subject of the authoritarian character.

Specifically, religion of friends, church participation, religious self-identification, and intermarriage attitude were studied. Results indicated that conservative denominations were decidedly more communal than the liberal ones. Important differences persisted within both white- and blue-collar categories. Non-church Protestants differed sharply from the liberal as well as the conservative denomination members, as nearly all were low in communal orientation.\n      </p>", "The Protestant Ethic not only had behavioral implications, as Max Weber and others have pointed out, it also had ideological implications in providing a moral legitimacy for capitalism. The Protestant Ethic provided a moral justification for the pursuit of profit and the distribution of income that are a part of the system. Currently there is a good deal of intellectual concern about the moral legitimacy of the capitalist system. Thus it is important to trace the origins of the Protestant Ethic and recover the ideological functions it performs in a capitalistic society.\n      </p>", "Conservative Protestant child discipline has recently become the subject of considerable social research and public controversy. However, no systematic empirical evidence has been brought to bear on conservative Protestant rates of parental yelling, which we view as a key indicator of an authoritarian style of parenting. We review parenting advice offered by conservative Protestant elites, who articulate child-rearing schemata grounded in both religious and psychological rationales for the discipline of youngsters. Notably, conservative Protestant family specialists advocate corporal punishment while discouraging the parental use of yelling at children. Data drawn from the 1987-88 National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH) indicate that conservative Protestant parents of preschoolers and school-age children are significantly less likely to report yelling at their children. Moreover, the estimated effects of denominational affiliation on the parental use of yelling are partly mediated by conservative theological views. We conclude by calling for research that analyzes the effects of the distinctive conservative Protestant approach to discipline on child well-being.\n      </p>", "The study examined the relationship between various measures of the Protestant Work Ethic (PWE) and Holland's (1973) hexagonal model of vocational preference which specifies six personality and environmental types. It was predicted that PWE measures would be positively correlated with realistic, enterprising and conventional types but not social investigative or artistic. The hypotheses were supported but the PWE measures, themselves all correlated, were also positively correlated with the artistic type. Implications of these findings for vocational guidance and the assessment of individual differences is discussed.\n      </p>", "The investigation by the consistory of the Reformed Church of Montauban of an unmarried pregnancy and attempted abortion in the sixteenth century offers important insights into moral and social relationships within the early modern European community. Though the effect of the consistory's activities on the lives of those that it sought to discipline ought not be overestimated (instrusive as those activities might be by modern standards), a close reading of the narrative embedded in the consistorial records provides a valuable understanding of the Protestant church's role in reordering traditional attitudes and everyday behavior.\n      </p>", "Eighteen Protestant ministers were interviewed concerning their self-images as political leaders. While members of both traditions believed that politics and religion had considerable areas of overlap, Evangelical and Mainline ministers felt themselves constrained from exerting political leadership by theological considerations. For Evangelical clergy, the content of religious beliefs (with a strong emphasis on individualist theology) constitutes the principal impediment to political socialization, while Mainline ministers are constrained by the style of their theological thinking. Mainline ministers appear reluctant to invoke religious authority to support their political viewpoints. In both cases, ministerial political leadership seems self-limiting.\n      </p>", "Previous definitions of the unchurched combined persons who retain an identity as church members with persons who are non-member affiliates. Our research shows that the two groups are quite distinct and that previous efforts to type unchurched Protestants have hidden the unique characteristics of \"marginal members\" (inactive Protestant church members). Using cluster analysis, four types of marginal members are identified. The social characteristics and beliefs of individuals representing these types explain their low levels of church attendance and continued identification as church members.\n      </p>", "Using the case of a deeply divided society (Northern Ireland) in the aftermath of a major peace accord, this article combines two methodological approaches to assess the public reception of the peace accord and its impact on intergroup competition. The social psychological concept of esteem (central to social identity theory) and time-series data are used to assess intergroup relations between Protestant-unionists and Catholic-nationalists in Northern Ireland in the wake of the 1998 peace accord. By illustrating the disparity of esteem between the two main politico-religious groups, the article indicates early settlement weakness. Moreover, it suggests a conceptual approach that may be applicable to the study of intergroup competitions in other divided societies.\n      </p>", "Widely regarded as a government instrument for the suppression of religious groups, the 1939/1940 Religious Organizations Law has so far been denied a nuanced treatment in historical literature. The complex nature of the law and its consequences can best be estimated when examining the case of the Christian churches, supposedly the foremost victims of suppression by the Japanese state, around 1940. The historical record shows that not all of the implications of the legislation were seen as adverse by the Roman Catholic Church and Protestant groups. This is especially clear if one takes into account trans war continuities at the institutional and organizational levels, although inquiring into writings on the substance of religious teaching can also be illuminating, as changes in Catholic catechisms between 1936 and 1947 demonstrate. I will suggest that the analytical framework of corporatism might be helpful in coming to terms with the Japanese states religious policy in the 1930s and 1940s.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Catholic and Protestant couples in which the husbands had a vasectomy operation performed between 1966 and 1969 in London, Ontario were surveyed in 1970 for the purpose of comparing them on actual and desired family size, contraceptive use before the operation, contraceptive failures resulting in unplanned births, satisfaction with the operation, and on such other demographic characteristics as age, education and family income. We found that Protestant males and females were older and better educated than their Catholic counterparts and Protestant couples had higher median annual family incomes. Catholic males desired fewer children than their wives and the same relationship held for Protestants. Catholics desired more children than Protestants, and the Catholic couples had on the average more children. Both religious groups had more children than they desired, more a result of contraceptive failures than the non-use of contraceptives. Catholics and Protestants alike had used several contraceptive methods prior to resorting to vasectomy. Protestant and Catholic couples chose vasectomy at different average parity levels, with the Catholics being higher than the Protestants. From these data, it is hypothesized that the trend toward convergence in North America of Protestant and Catholic fertility will stop short of complete similarity.\n      </p>", "During the late nineteenth-century, anti-Protestantism revived in French political thought. This was part of a right-wing attack upon the \"quatre \u00e9tats conf\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9s\" (Jews, Protestants, Masons, m\u00e9t\u00e8ques) seen as threatening the nation and its traditions. Anti-Protestant rhetoric can be found in the writings of such well-known figures as Edouard Drumont, Charles Maurras, and Maurice Barres as well as in the works of many less prominent figures. They argued that Protestantism was (1) a foreign religion, essentially Germanic; (2) revolutionary, threatening all authority; (3) anti-Catholic, or even anti-Christian; and (4) that Protestants had begun a \"conquest\" of France, holding vastly disproportionate power during the early Third Republic. Anti-Protestant arguments typically rested on misrepresentations of the French Protestant community and on fallacious logic, such as depicting Protestantism through prominent Parisians rather than studying the Protestants of the C\u00e9vennes or the pays de Montbeliard.\n      </p>", "Previous studies have established a relationship between pastors' theology and laymen's party preference among Protestants. This study, based on responses to questionnaires mailed to the Baptist and Methodist clergymen of Oregon, indicates a similar and marked relation between theology and party preference among pastors themselves. Specifically, theologically conservative ministers are more likely to prefer the Republican party than are theologically liberal or neo-orthodox ministers. The relation between theology and party preference is not materially affected by the class position of the pastors' present parishioners. The data provide clues to the manner in which denominational affiliation may affect political preference. The findings suggest that Protestant pastors may influence the political outlook and behavior of the laity.\n      </p>", "Max Weber's thesis of a relation between a Protestant ethic and a spirit of capitalism is examined. The Calvinist calling is taken as the central notion of Weber's thesis. Weber fails to demonstrate that the doctrine of the calling would channel the motivational force of religious interests into ascetic, economic activity that could be innovative in the face of traditional patterns of behavior. He fails in two ways: (1) he does not demonstrate a strict logical, meaningful relation between these elements; and (2) he does not account for the changing historical dynamics of Calvinism itself. If the configuration of events occurred as Weber argued, then nonreligious factors would be crucial in bringing it about. Yet, such factors take us outside of the framework in which Weber was working and, more seriously, they contest the very basis of his argument: the influence of religious forces on the capitalistic spirit.\n      </p>", "In a series of articles, Benton Johnson has investigated the effects of ascetic Protestantism on political party preference. His findings indicate that among laymen exposed to fundamentalist teachings, religious involvement would vary directly with Republican party preference. However, among laymen exposed to liberal teachings, religious involvement would vary inversely with Republican identification. This present study shows that church involvement and political party identification are not significantly related. A refinement of Johnson's liberal-fundamentalist dichotomy and his church interaction index again resulted in non-significant findings. Finally, a weighted least-squares procedure was employed yielding a set of linear estimation equations that again showed no significant effect. Results such as these should make the social scientist wary of the dangers associated with the measurement of religion and the contemporary relevance of Weber's Protestant ethic.\n      </p>", "This paper seeks to explain the initial successes and failures of Protestantism on economic grounds. It argues that the medieval Roman Catholic Church, through doctrinal manipulation, the exclusion of rivals, and various forms of price discrimination, ultimately placed members seeking the Z good \u201cspiritual services\u201d on the margin of defection. These monopolistic practices encouraged entry by rival firms, some of which were aligned with civil governments. The paper hypothesizes that Protestant entry was facilitated in emergent entrepreneurial societies characterized by the decline of feudalism and relatively unstable distribution of wealth and repressed in more homogeneous, rent\u2010seeking societies that were mostly dissipating rather than creating wealth. In these societies the Roman Church was more able to continue the practice of price discrimination. Informal tests of this proposition are conducted by considering primogeniture and urban growth as proxies for wealth stability.\n      </p>", "The ideal and actual configurations of control over the National Staff of the Reformed Church in America was measured using a modified version of Tannenbaum's control graph. Modifications include an \"open system model\" which assumes that, in voluntary associations, the governing board and association members must be perceived as active environments relative to the bureaucratically structured National Staff. To varying degrees, depending upon respondents' social location relative to the National Staff, members of these social units (a) desire and (b) feel that they do exercise different amounts of control over the National Staff. It was found that, in contrast to traditional Protestant rejection of ecclesiastical exercise of power, bureaucratic demands have led to perceptions of highly centralized patterns of control resting in the National Staff.\n      </p>", "What is the result of the research stimulated by Lenski's \"The Religious Factor?\" This research testing hypotheses derived from Weber's Protestant Ethic thesis focused on Protestant-Catholic differentials in social status and mobility, in achievement motivation, and in educational and scientific performance. Most of the data were nonsupportive of, or contradictory to, the hypotheses derived from the Weber thesis. None of the research was adequate to the task of causal inference which is required by the logic of the hypotheses. Moreover, the independent variable--differences in religious belief--was not adequately operationalized. Finally, the researchers are criticized for the simplistic derivation of poor hypotheses from the analytically rich work of Weber.\n      </p>", "This paper examines the work ethic characteristics of particular practising Protestant, Catholic and Muslim managers in Britain, Ireland and Turkey. Max Weber, argued that Protestant societies had a particular work ethic which was quite distinct from non-Protestant societies. The Protestant work ethic (PWE) thesis of Weber was reviewed. Previous empirical and analytical research results showed that the number of research results which support Weberian ideas were more than those which did not support. Methodological issues were also discussed. Results revealed that there was a considerable difference between Muslim and other groups in terms of PWE characteristics. The Muslim group showed the highest PWE level, while the Protestant group was placed second and the Catholic group third. The Protestant group showed a slightly higher of PWE level than the Catholic group. The possible reasons for the higher level of the PWE values of Muslim managers are discussed in the light of historical, political, social and economic developments in Turkey.\n      </p>", "This paper is concerned with Protestant fears of the sexual character and intent of Catholic Priests in England in the period 1830-1914. It supports the findings of previous studies which suggested that such fears could, for some people, be pleasurable fantasy. It is also argued that the perceived sexual threat posed by the Priesthood was the production of wider sexual and social attitudes. In effect this clerical intrusion threatened much more than sexual norms in Protestant society,. it had profound implications for existing gender roles, the family, and ultimately the stability of Victorian society.\n      </p>", "Religious differences in educational attainment and persistence in school are investigated in an analysis of data from a 1957 national survey. Although no consistent Protestant-Catholic educational differences are found in gross comparisons, some Protestant advantage does appear after the introduction of controls. Controlling for ethnicity, region of birth, age, generation, father's occupation, and size of community of orientation, Protestants are consistently found to be somewhat more likely to achieve a college degree and are substantially more likely to persist in college once enrolled. These differences are largest among men with higher status origins.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "The literature on gender differences in orientations to work among Protestant clergy has been mixed, but generally points to the hypothesis that female clergy hold fewer career and professional work values than their male counterparts. This expectation flies in the face, however, of other more general population studies that show women and men hold similar work values and orientations to work. Using a national sample of clergy from two Protestant denominations, we test for gender differences in these values and orientations. Consistent with the general population findings, female clergy have professional values and orientations that are just as strong, if not stronger than those of male clergy.\n      </p>"], "words":
