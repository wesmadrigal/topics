{"total_words": 576, "documents": ["A perceived limitation to incorporating herbicide application decision support system (HADSS\u2122) into routine peanut weed management decisions is efficient scouting of fields. A total of 52 peanut fields were scouted from 1997 through 2001 in North Carolina to determine the weed density in a $9.3\\text{-}{\\rm m}^{2}$ section for each 0.4-ha grid of the field. These weed populations and their spatial distributions were used to compare theoretical net return (TNR) over herbicide investment for various scouting methods and weed management approaches. HADSS was used to determine the expected net return for each treatment in each 0.4-ha section of every field under differing assumptions of weed size, soil moisture conditions, and pricing structures. The treatment with the highest net return averaged across all 0.4-ha grids was considered to be the optimal whole-field treatment. For all 52 fields, TNR for the best whole-field treatment and for site-specific weed management (applying the most economical recommendation on each 0.4-ha grid) averaged $414 and $435/ha, respectively. Estimated return from the commercial postemergence herbicide program of aciflurofen plus bentazon plus 2,4-DB followed by clethodim (where grass was present) averaged $316/ha across all 52 fields. For fields of 5 ha or more (17 fields) in which 12 or more samples were taken, TNR was $500, $510, and $516/ha for three-sample (one pass through the middle of the field with samples taken on both ends and the center of the field), six-sample (two passes through the field with three stops per pass), and full-sample (one stop for each 0.4 ha) approaches, respectively.\n      </p>", "On-farm trials were conducted in 16 North Carolina peanut fields to obtain estimates of scouting times and quality of herbicide recommendations for different weed scouting methods. The fields were monitored for weed species and population density using four scouting methods: windshield (estimate made from the edge of the field), whole-field (estimate based on walk through the field), range (weed densities rated on 1-5 scale at six locations in the field), and counts (weeds estimated by counting at six locations in the field). The herbicide application decision support system (HADSS) was used to determine theoretical net return over herbicide investment and yield loss ($ and %) for each treatment in each field. Three scouts estimated average weed population densities using each scouting method. These values were entered into HADSS to obtain treatment recommendations. Independently collected count data from all three scouts were combined to determine the optimal treatment in each field and the relative ranking of each available treatment. When using the whole-field method, scouts observed a greater number of weed species than when using the other methods. The windshield, whole-field, and range scouting methods tended to overestimate density slightly at low densities and underestimate density substantially at high densities, compared to the count method. The windshield method required the least amount of time to complete (6 min per field), but also resulted in the greatest average loss. Even for this method, recommendations had theoretical net returns within 10% of the return for the optimal treatment 80% of the time. The count method appears to have less economic risk than the windshield, whole-field, and range scouting methods.\n      </p>", "We studied the extent to which worker honey bees acquire information from waggle dances throughout their careers as foragers. Small groups of foragers were monitored from time of orientation flights to time of death and all in-hive behaviors relating to foraging were recorded. In the context of a novice forager finding her first food source, 60% of the bees relied, at least in part, on acquiring information from waggle dances (being recruited) rather than searching independently (scouting). In the context of an experienced forager whose foraging has been interrupted, 37% of the time the bees resumed foraging by following waggle dances (being reactivated) rather than examining the food source on their own (inspecting). And in the context of an experienced forager engaged in foraging, 17% of the time the bees initiated a foraging trip by following a waggle dance. Such dance following was observed much more often after an unsuccessful than after a successful foraging trip. Successful foragers often followed dances just briefly, perhaps to confirm that the kind of flowers they had been visiting were still yielding forage. Overall, waggle dance following for food discovery accounted for 12-25% of all interactions iwth dancers (9% by novice foragers and 3-16% by experienced foragers) whereas dance following for reactivation and confirmation accounted for the other 75-88% (26% for reactivation and 49-62% for confirmation). We conclude that foragers make extensive use of the waggle dance not only to start work at new, unfamiliar food sources but also to resume work at old, familiar food sources.\n      </p>", "Little is known about the molecular basis of differences in behavior among individuals. Here we report consistent novelty-seeking behavior, across different contexts, among honey bees in their tendency to scout for food sources and nest sites, and we reveal some of the molecular underpinnings of this behavior relative to foragers that do not scout. Food scouts showed extensive differences in brain gene expression relative to other foragers, including differences related to catecholamine, glutamate, and y-aminobutyric acid signaling. Octopamine and glutamate treatments increased the likelihood of scouting, whereas dopamine antagonist treatment decreased it. These findings demonstrate intriguing similarities in human and insect novelty seeking and suggest that this trait, which presumably evolved independently in these two lineages, may be subserved by conserved molecular components.\n      </p>", "The value of weed scouting information for soil-applied and post-emergence weed management is estimated using a dynamic, whole-farm, stochastic simulation model. The model simulates outcomes of four expected utility functions from management strategies using three levels of weed information. Results from a representative Minnesota corn and soybean farm indicate high value of weed seedling counts (for post-emergence control) but relatively low value of weed seed counts (for soil-applied control). While herbicide use is often reduced under information-based management, this is not always the case.\n      </p>", "Field experiments were conducted across the north-central United States to determine the benefits of various weed control strategies in corn. Weed control, corn yield, and economic return increased when a preemergence (PRE) broad-spectrum herbicide was followed by (fb) postemergence (POST) herbicides. Weed control decisions based on field scouting after a PRE broad-spectrum herbicide application increased weed control and economic return. Application of a PRE grass herbicide fb a POST herbicide based on field scouting resulted in less control of velvetleaf and morningglory species, corn yield, and economic return compared with a PRE broad-spectrum herbicide application fb scouting. Cultivation after a PRE broad-spectrum herbicide application increased weed control and corn yield compared with the herbicide applied alone, but economic return was not increased. An early-postemergence herbicide application fb cultivation resulted in the highest level of broadleaf weed control, the highest corn yield, and the greatest economic return compared with all other strategies. Weed control based on scouting proved to be useful in reducing the effect of weed escapes on corn yield and increased economic return compared with PRE herbicide application alone. However, economic return was not greater than the PRE fb planned POST or total POST strategies.\n      </p>", "Full-count random sampling has been the traditional method of obtaining weed densities. Currently it is the recommended scouting procedure when using HERB, a herbicide selection decision aid. However, alternative methods of scouting that are quicker and more economical need to be investigated. One possibility that has been considered is binomial sampling. Binomial sampling is the procedure by which density is estimated from the number of random quadrats in which the count of individuals is equal to or less than a specified cutoff value. This sampling method has been widely used for insect scouting. There has also been interest in using binomial sampling for weed scouting. However, an economic analysis of this sampling method for weeds has not been performed. In this paper, the results of an economic analysis using simulations with binomial sampling and the HERB model are presented. Full-count sampling was included in the simulations to provide a benchmark for comparison. The comparison was made in terms of economic losses incurred when the estimated weed density obtained from sampling was inaccurate and a herbicide treatment was selected that did not maximize profits. These types of losses are referred to as opportunity losses. The opportunity losses obtained from the simulations indicate that in some situations binomial sampling may be a viable economic alternative to full-count sampling for fields with weed populations that follow a negative binomial distribution, assuming no prior knowledge of weed densities or negative binomial k values.\n      </p>", "Every recruitment system in social insects requires some individuals that serve as scouts, foragers that search independently for food sources. It is not well understood which factors influence whether an individual becomes a scout or a recruit, nor how the division of labor between the two forager groups is regulated. It is shown here for honeybees (Apis mellifera), using two different molecular techniques, that there is a genetically based difference in the probability that individuals will scout independently for food. In contrast to earlier suggestions, experimental tests showed that the age of a bee does not seem to influence its probability of becoming a scout or a recruit. Furthermore, scout bees do not search opportunistically for either pollen or nectar but, rather, individuals have preferences that are genetically based. These findings are discussed in the framework of foraging regulation by specialization in honeybees and the adaptive significance of polyandry.\n      </p>", "Growers need affordable methods to sample weed populations to reduce herbicide use with site-specific weed management. Sampling programs and methods of developing sampling programs for integrated pest management are not sufficient for site-specific weed management because more and different information is needed to make treatment maps than simply estimate average pest density. Sampling plans for site-specific weed management must provide information to map the weeds in the field but should be developed for the objective of prescribing spatially variable management. Weed scientists will be most successful at designing plans for site-specific weed management if they focus on this objective throughout the process of designing a sampling plan. They must also learn more about the spatial distribution and dynamics of weed populations and use that knowledge to identify cost-effective plans, recommend methods to make maps as well as collect data, and find ways to evaluate maps that reflect management to be prescribed from the map. Foremost, sampling must be thought of as an ongoing process over time that uses many types of information rather than a single event of collecting one type of information. Specifically, scientists will need to identify common characteristics rather than just differences of the spatial distribution of weeds among fields and species, recognize that map accuracy may be a poor indicator of the value of a sampling plan, and develop methods to use growers' knowledge of the distribution of weeds and past spatially variable management within a field for both making a map and recommending a sampling plan. The value of proposed methods for sampling and mapping must also be demonstrated or adoption of site-specific weed management might be limited to growers who enjoy using sophisticated technology.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

This research was conducted to identify an appropriate scouting protocol for use when weed populations are clumped in such a manner.

Scouting was imported into the Middle East from Europe just before World War I and was quickly appropriated by Arab societies. In the 1930s it gained significance not only as a social phenomenon but also as a forum for political expression. The Mandate administration initially sought to use scouting to expand France's cultural and political foothold in the region. Quickly, however, Lebanese leaders imbued scouting with their own distinctive ethos, which frequently opposed French interests. This process is especially interesting owing to the cross-pollination of ideological and cultural forces that nourished the burgeoning scout associations, including not only Islam and French scout methods but also Arab and Lebanese nationalism, fascism, and Anglo-Saxon political and cultural objectives in the Middle East. The discussion here addresses how Islam intertwined with these diverse influences and how this ideological conglomeration affected and reflected Franco-Muslim relations in Lebanon. /// Cet article traite du r\u00f4le que joua l'Islam dans la formation et l'\u00e9volution du scoutisme musulman au Liban \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque du mandat fran\u00e7ais.

We determined whether foraging is improved in part because patriline diversity generates more responsive populations of scouting foragers. Scouts search for new food sources and advertise them with waggle dances to inform other foragers about unexploited discoveries. We moved multiple-patriline and single-patriline colonies to unfamiliar locations so that colonies relied heavily on successful scouts to initiate recruitment and then compared the development of foraging effort between the two types of colonies. More waggle dance signals were produced during the incipient stages of foraging in multiple-patriline colonies compared to single-patriline colonies because scouts reported food discoveries with longer dances. Scouts also returned to multiple-patriline colonies at rates that were two thirds higher than those of single-patriline colonies, although return rates for general forager populations were not significantly different between colony types. The distance of reported food sources from hives increased with time for all colonies, but by the end of their first day in an unfamiliar environment, maximal foraging reach was greater if colonies had multiple patrilines. Most scouts in multiple-patriline colonies came from a minority of scoutrich patrilines that were generally not those from which general forager populations were derived; the presence of such scout-rich patrilines was correlated with the extent of recruitment signaling in colonies. We show how a honeybee colony's scouting effort is (and is not) enhanced when extremely polyandrous queens produce genetically diverse colonies.\n      </p>", "Bioeconomic weed management models help growers achieve appropriate weed management with less herbicide by matching management to the weed population in a field. Growers, however, will not use bioeconomic models unless cost-effective methods to sample their weed populations are identified. Counting and identifying seeds and seedlings is the most time-consuming and costly part of sampling weed populations. The time required for this process was investigated and modeled as a first step in developing sampling plans for growers using WEEDCAM, a bioeconomic model for weed management in Zea mays L. in Colorado. The time required to count and identify seeds or seedlings was recorded for 9,405 soil cores (5 cm in diameter and 10 cm deep) and 9,726 quadrats (18-cm band over 1.52 m of crop row) collected or examined in eight corn fields in eastern Colorado. The time required to count and identify seeds was best described using a log-linear regression with time increasing with the number of seeds and species and the amount of sand in the core. The average cost of determining there are no seeds in a core is $1.07 for a core from a field with 37% sand and $4.32 if the field has 88% sand. The average cost of counting and identifying 36 seeds of four species is $2.70 and $10.88 for cores with 37 and 88% sand, respectively. The time required to count and identify seedlings was best described using a log-linear regression with time increasing with the number of seedlings and species. Classifying seedlings as grass or broadleaf did not improve the model. The average cost of determining that a quadrat is weed-free is $0.02.

The birds are obligate cavity-roosters, and I performed an experiment in which several woodhoopoe territories were established after the introduction of artificial roost sites in an area which previously supported no woodhoopoes. The evidence supports the hypothesis that roost cavities are critical in determining the limits to woodhoopoe distribution. Group size, dispersal frequency and dispersal distance differed significantly between the two study sites. I suggest that where cavities are in short supply and unevenly distributed, long-distance scouting forays are undertaken at a high probability of not finding a safe roost site to sleep in. This may result in an increased probability of predation, or physiological conditions with which an individual in poor body condition cannot cope. I propose that among woodhoopoes a stay-and-foray dispersal strategy is preferred to a depart-and-search strategy for a number of reasons. First, there is no within-group competition for limiting resources, since roost cavities do not provide a situation in which within-group conflict could arise. Second, I show that competition for breeding vacancies is more severe at the inland than at the coastal site, further borne out by the fact that, compared to coastal birds, inland ones are proportionally more likely to attain breeding status in the natal group than elsewhere. Finally, I propose that such environmentally-induced differential dispersal patterns between the two study sites have indirectly affected the frequency with which apparent inbreeding occurs, and I suggest that since incestuous pairings are relatively common, they either have no deleterious consequences for breeder fitness, or the potential costs of inbreeding are counterbalanced by the risks associated with dispersal.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Allozyme analyses of honey bee workers revealed significant differences in the intracolonial subfamily composition of groups of nectar foragers, pollen foragers, and nest-site scouts.

Finally, it explores the significance of teaching and researching as activities that contribute to the shaping of an anthropology of sport. The paper argues for a disciplinary commitment to anthropology coupled with an acknowledgement that we should be extending our reach beyond the current boundaries of our discipline.

The Croix de Feu's paramilitarism has often been seen as a superficial borrowing from Italian and German fascist movements and therefore not reflective of the league's real nature. This article argues that paramilitarism was central to the self-definition of the league's militants, permitting them to reassert a sense of threatened masculinity, to differentiate themselves from the parliamentary Right, and to express the value of \"action\" over parliamentary debates. Paramilitarism was also a form of \"physical propaganda\" designed to establish the fitness of the league to govern France. It is also suggested that the Croix de Feu's use of political violence, although it remained largely symbolic, was distinctively fascist. This fascist quality resided above all in the combination of a conservative desire for order with a populist claim that national reconstruction demanded the coming to power of a new elite drawn from the people. As in all fascist movements, the tensions between radical and reactionary impulses were difficult to contain. In practice, therefore, the league's aim of cultivating an image of disciplined force was undermined by involvement in a series of violent clashes with the Left. This was one reason why the Parti social francais gradually abandoned paramilitarism. Nevertheless, the level of political violence in the late 1930s remained high and is illustrative of the extent of social and political crisis of the Third Republic on the eve of war.\n      </p>", "The grape root borer, Vitacea polistiformis Harris, is the principal pest of grapes (Vitis spp. L.) in Florida where chlorpyrifos is 1 of the few chemicals registered for its control. However, chlorpyrifos is not an ideal treatment because it is highly toxic to birds, fish, aquatic invertebrates, and honeybees. Also, the recommended timing of application conflicts with harvest dates. There is an effective cultural control method, known as mounding, but this method is currently cost prohibitive for commercial production and is not widely used. If mounding could be applied only to infested plants, the cost of this method would be reduced considerably. This study evaluated the potential of acoustics for detecting the larvae in-situ. Human listeners assessed likelihood of arthropod infestation for each site based on live acoustic samples as they were being recorded. Computer software later constructed acoustic indicators from these recordings that were used for computer assessment of infestation likelihood. After recording, the roots of sampled vines were excavated to determine infestation levels. Infestation likelihood predictions of both human listeners and computer software largely reflected infestation condition of tested sites. Consequently, acoustic methods could be developed as tools for growers to employ mounding only at sites most likely to be infested, and thus enable more cost-effective use of this cultural control tactic. El barrenador de la ra\u00edz de la uva, Vitacea polistiformis Harris, es la principal plaga de la uva (Vitis spp. L.) en la Florida, donde clorpirifos es uno de los pocos productos qu\u00edmicos registrados para su control. Sin embargo, el clorpirifos no es un tratamiento ideal, ya que es altamente t\u00f3xico para aves, peces, invertebrados acu\u00e1ticos y abejas. Adem\u00e1s, el tiempo recomendado para la aplicaci\u00f3n del producto esta en conflicto con la fecha de cosecha. Existe un m\u00e9todo eficaz de control cultural, conocido como \"el montonar\" (agregando la tierra debajo de la vid despu\u00e9s de que las larvas se empupan en el suelo, que impeden que los adultos emergen), pero actualmente este m\u00e9todo es muy costoso para la producci\u00f3n comercial y no se utiliza ampliamente. Si se aplica el montonar s\u00f3lo a las plantas infestadas, el costo de este m\u00e9todo se reducir\u00eda considerablemente. Este estudio evalu\u00f3 el potencial de la ac\u00fastica para detectar las larvas en-sitio. Oyentes humanos evaluaron la probabilidad de infestaci\u00f3n por artr\u00f3podos para cada sitio basado en las muestras ac\u00fasticas en vivo, mientras que fueron grabadas. El programa de computadora m\u00e1s tarde construyeron indicadores ac\u00fasticos de estas grabaciones que se utilizaron para la evaluaci\u00f3n hecha por computadora de la probabilidad de infestaci\u00f3n. Despu\u00e9s de la grabaci\u00f3n, las ra\u00edces de la vid muestreadas fueron excavados para determinar los niveles de infestaci\u00f3n. Las predicciones de la probabilidad de infestaci\u00f3n tanto por los oyentes humanos y por los programas de computadora en gran parte reflej\u00f3 la condici\u00f3n de infestaci\u00f3n de los sitios evaluados. En consecuencia, los m\u00e9todos ac\u00fasticos se podr\u00edan desarrollar como una herramienta para que los productores empleen el montonar s\u00f3lo en los sitios de mayor probabilidad de estar infestados y por lo tanto permita un uso m\u00e1s rentable de esta t\u00e1ctica de control cultural.\n      </p>", "Certified Crop Advisors of Arkansas and members of the Arkansas Crop Consultants Association were surveyed in Fall 2006 through direct mail to assess current weed management practices and needs in rice from both a research and educational perspective. Consultants reported scouting 228.2 of the possible 567 thousand hectares (40%) of rice grown in Arkansas. Pre-emergence herbicides most often recommended were clomazone (93%) and quinclorac (40%). Propanil (55%) and quinclorac (47%) were the two most commonly recommended postemergence herbicides. Thirty-two percent of the consultants often recommend three or more herbicide applications per field. An average of 37% of the fields were believed to have \"serious\" or \"very serious\" weed infestations, and fields were scouted for weeds on average 11 times per growing season. Ninety-two percent of the consultants had \"moderate\" to \"high\" concerns with herbicide-resistant weeds. The perceived average additional expense associated with managing a resistant weed in rice was $65.60/ha. Propanilresistant and quinclorac- barnyardgrass were believed to be infesting 24 and 7% of the scouted rice hectares, respectively. Barnyardgrass was the most problematic weed of rice followed by red rice. Northern jointvetch and smartweeds were the two most problematic broadleaf weeds. The number one research need was improved broadleaf weed control. Respondents indicated that research and educational efforts should continue to focus on herbicide performance and development of economical weed control programs.\n      </p>", "Le mouvement des boy-scouts aux Etats-Unis donne \u00e0 ses valeurs la forme du v\u00e9cu; c'est en ceci qu'il peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme porteur d'une id\u00e9ologie \u00ab grassroots \u00bb.

The evolution of Rockwell's mode of depiction reflects the scout movement's continuing concern to situate itself beyond controversy as one of the givens of the American scene.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "Field experiments were conducted on two North Carolina research stations in 1999, 2000, and 2001; on-farm in Lenoir, Wayne, and Wilson counties, NC, in 2002; and on-farm in Port Royal, VA, in 2000, 2001, and 2002 to evaluate possible gains from site-specific herbicide applications at these locations. Fields were scouted for weed populations using custom software on a handheld computer linked to a Global Positioning System. Scouts generated field-specific sampling grids and recorded weed density information for each grid cell. The decision aid HADSS\u2122 (Herbicide Application Decision Support System) was used to estimate expected net return and yield loss remaining after treatment in each sample grid of every field under differing assumptions of weed size and soil moisture conditions, assuming the field was planted with either conventional or glyphosate-resistant (GR) soybean. The optimal whole-field treatment (that treatment with the highest expected net return summed across all grid cells within a field) resulted in average theoretical net returns of $79/ha (U.S. dollars) and $139/ha for conventional and GR soybean, respectively. When the most economical treatment for each grid cell was used in site-specific weed management, theoretical net returns increased by $13/ha (conventional) and $4.50/ha (GR), and expected yield loss after treatment was reduced by 10.5 and 4%, respectively, compared with the whole-field optimal treatment. When the most effective treatment for each grid cell was used in site-specific weed management, theoretical net returns decreased by $18/ha (conventional) and $4/ha (GR), and expected yield loss after treatment was reduced by 27 and 19%, respectively, compared with the whole-field optimal treatment. Site-specific herbicide applications could have reduced the volume of herbicides sprayed by as much as 70% in some situations but increased herbicide amounts in others. On average, the whole-field treatment was optimal in terms of net return for only 35% (conventional) and 57% (GR) of grid cells.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

This study applies an implicit demand formulation of the Lichtenberg-Zilberman damage abatement model to data from a survey of Maryland field crop growers to examine differences in pesticide demand between growers using scouts trained and supervised by extension and those using chemical dealer employees or scouting themselves. The results give partial support to those skeptical of the quality of scouting by farmers themselves and by consultants working for chemical dealers. Soybean growers using extension-trained scouts had significantly lower pesticide demand than those using chemical dealer employees or scouting themselves.

However, the means by which this is achieved remain unclear. Shortly before takeoff, one hears a crescendo of a high-pitched mechanical signal\u2014worker piping\u2014so we explored the role of this signal in coordinating a swarm's mass takeoff. Specifically, we examined whether exclusively nest site scouts produce the worker piping signal or whether it is produced in a relay or chain reaction fashion. We found no evidence that bees other than the scouts that have visited the swarm's chosen nest site produce piping signals. This absence of relay communication in piping suggests that it is a signal that only primes swarms for takeoff and that the release of takeoff is triggered by some other signal or cue; perhaps the takeoff of bees on the swarm periphery as they reach flight temperature in response to piping.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "Process-level simulation models can be a unique and effective medium for teaching concepts of crop biology and management which can usually only be studied in the field.

Experienced foragers scout more than do novice foragers. The cost of finding a forage patch is greater for recruits than scouts, but the patches found by recruits are evidently superior to those found by scouts. The honeybee's combined system of recruitment communication, scout-recruit division of labor, and selectivity in recruitment, apparently enhances a colony's overall foraging efficiency by guiding a large majority of a colony's foragers to good forage patches.\n      </p>", "We investigated the ability of the tropical social wasp Polybia occidentalis to recognize local species of scouting-and-recruiting ants by their odor.

Following contact with these ants, however, some of the individuals responded defensively to the odor of these ant species, showing that wasps can learn the odor of ants. Wasps were better able to learn to respond to the odor of Crematogaster than to Solenopsis. The results of this preliminary field study point to a role for learning in the defensive behavior of social wasps.\n      </p>", "           ", "There is a natural tendency for untrained scouting bees to associate certain perfumes with food (e.g. those of the flowers of Crataegus oxyacantha and Trifolium repens) whereas the perfume of some other flowers (e.g. Spirea arguta) are unattractive to the honeybee. If the perfume of a new crop of flowers is sufficiently strong it will sometimes attract scouting bees when they are still unable to see the flowers. It is often necessary for a bee to approach within an inch or so of a flower before she can discern any perfume it may possess. When a bee approaches an object closely enough any attractive perfume it may possess tends to act as a stimulus to further exploration which involves settling upon the object and possibly seeking food in any small crevice in or around it. Thus the perfume of the individual flower plays an important part in stimulating a nectar-seeking bee to enter it, whether she has learned to associate its perfume with food or not. Normal visitation of a flower which has previously been worked is suspended when the bee's olfactory sense is disturbed. This can be caused either by mutilation or by the presence of a strong foreign perfume. In general the results obtained from experiments with untrained bees support the conclusions reached by von Frisch (1919) in his work with trained bees, and indicate that both these categories of bees behave in a similar manner when seeking food.\n      </p>", "Here, we study distribution of workload and its relationship to colony size among worker ants o\u00ed Temnothorax albipennis, in the context of colony emigrations.

By contrast, in small colonies, a small number of individuals perform most of the work in this task (in one colony, a single ant transported 57% of all items moved in the emigration). Transporters in small colonies carried more items to the new nest per individual and achieved a higher overall efficiency in transport (more items moved per transporter and unit time). Our results suggest that small colonies may be extremely dependent on a few key individuals. In studying colony organisation and division of labour, the amount of work performed by each individual, not just task repertoire (which tasks are performed at all), should be taken into account.\n      </p>", "Certain of Piaget's contentions regarding the development of moralistic judgments were considered in this study.

Maturity of moralistic judgment is found unrelated to personality characteristics as rated by teachers, insignificantly influenced by sex of subject, attendance at Sunday School, or membership in boy or girl scouting organizations, but positively influenced by children's attendance of ungraded classrooms.\n      </p>", "Nascent research on the profitability of site-specific weed management has focused on reduced herbicide use, ignoring significant information costs for scouting, making treatment maps, and patch herbicide application. Including these information costs results in few, if any, studies, fully covering added costs with herbicide savings. Real-time, sensor-driven site-specific herbicide management promises to overcome many of the scouting and map-making costs so long as weed species recognition accuracy continues to improve and commercial capital costs to decline. Two means to increase revenues are possible from site-specific weed management: value-added crop products (e.g., herbicide-free, nontransgenic crops) and environmental stewardship payments from government programs. Site-specific ecological weed management offers a more fruitful means to garner both higher prices from \"green\" consumers and revenues for sound environmental stewardship. It entails using spatial tools to enhance habitat for weed predators and diseases and their vectors, as well as to grow crops that are better able to compete with weeds.
