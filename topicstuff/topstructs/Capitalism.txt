{"total_words": 1306, "documents": ["This article analyzes the rise and diffusion of the new order of regulatory capitalism. It offers an analytical and historical analysis of relations between capitalism and regulation and suggests that change in the governance of capitalist economy is best captured by reference to (1) a new division of labor between state and society (e.g., privatization), (2) an increase in delegation, (3) proliferation of new technologies of regulation, (4) formalization of interinstitutional and intrainstitutional arrangements of regulation, and (5) growth in the influence of experts in general, and of international networks of experts in particular. Regulation, though not necessarily directly by the state, seems to be on the increase despite efforts to redraw the boundaries between state and society.\n      </p>", "In this article, we will outline the principles of stakeholder capitalism and describe how this view rejects problematic assumptions in the current narratives of capitalism. Traditional narratives of capitalism rely upon the assumptions of competition, limited resources, and a winner-take-all mentality as fundamental to business and economic activity. These approaches leave little room for ethical analysis, have a simplistic view of human beings, and focus on value-capture rather than value-creation. We argue these assumptions about capitalism are inadequate and leave four problems in their wake. We wish to reframe the narrative of capitalism around the reinforcing concepts of stakeholders coupled with value creation and trade. If we think about how a society can sustain a system of voluntary value creation and trade, then capitalism can once more become a useful concept.\n      </p>", "This article challenges the currently fashionable periodization of history since the eighteenth century into two major phases, 'modernity' and 'postmodernity'. Questioning the conception of 'modernity' itself, Wood emphasizes the specificity of capitalism in opposition to other aspects of modernity with which it is conventionally associated, and argues that if we are now witnessing an epochal shift, it is not a transition from 'modernity' to 'postmodernity' but the maturation and universalization of capitalism. The 'universalization' of capitalism is then distinguished from 'globalization', a concept which, she argues, obscures more than it reveals.\n      </p>", "Some interpretations restrict the applicability of the \"General Theory\" to modern capitalism because of the financial institutions assumed by Keynes. Although acknowledging some evidence in support of these interpretations, the paper argues that Keynes also developed the fundamental elements of a general theory of unemployment and potential instability under capitalism, without having clearly disentangled these elements from more institutionally specific ideas. Such a general theory applies to all types of capitalist economy, but still is institutionally specific, referring to capitalism. The paper extracts this more general message, which was partly obscured by Keynes's emphasis on modern financial institutions.\n      </p>", "This dialogue engages with the ethics of politics of capitalism, and enacts a debate between two participants who have divergent views on these matters. Beginning with a discussion concerning definitions of capitalism, it moves on to cover issues concerning our different understandings of the costs and benefits of global capitalist systems. This then leads into a debate about the nature and purposes of regulation, in terms of whether regulation is intended to make competition work better for consumers, or to prevent negative outcomes for citizens. The conclusion speculates about the usefulness or otherwise of this Socratic method of dialogue.\n      </p>", "This note is a response to Rajendra Sisodia's commentary on my article on the topic of Conscious Capitalism (in this issue of California Management Review). First, it raises new concerns based on Sisodia's commentary and challenges the scientific status of the Conscious Capitalism theory. It focuses on refutability, consistency, and generality, as these three characteristics are essential features of any scientific theory. Second, it responds to Sisodia's various comments.\n      </p>", "This article proposes a classification of capitalist forms on the basis of two concepts, 'property rights regimes' (PRRs) and 'accumulation governance structures' (AGSs). The former defines the way in which the ownership of wealth and surplus value is distributed, the latter the institutional systems governing the uses of surplus value to sustain accumulation. Three PRRs - 'concentrated private property', 'diffused private property' and 'state property' - and four AGSs - 'goods markets', 'companies markets', 'external hierarchies' and 'internal hierarchies' - are defined. Various historical forms of capitalism are described as resulting from particular combinations of PRRs and AGSs. Then a few ideal types are outlined: 'classical capitalism', 'market-oriented corporate capitalism' and 'bank-oriented corporate capitalism'. Finally a hypothesis is advanced as to how capitalism evolves, namely that historical transformations of PRRs and AGSs tend to pave the way for the emergence of 'autonomous capital': accumulation is controlled through complex systems of external hierarchies among firms; the large concerns which are in command of these hierarchical structures are collectively self-owned and formally controlled by their managers through strategic cross-shareholding; no external shareholder exerts effective control.\n      </p>", "Habermas's primary theoretical project is to combine fruitfully the two major approaches to social analysis, hermeneutic theory and systems theory. To this end, he reinterprets the capitalist economy as an economic subsystem that engages certain functional imperatives of material reproduction behind the backs of society's actors. However, Habermas's attempt to distinguish subsystem processes from lifeworld experiences ultimately distorts our understanding of the capitalist economy in that it obscures the structural forms through which capitalism must be actualized. Consequently, his theory diminishes the necessary organizational forms of the economic subsystem, produces inconsistencies in regard to action orientations and subsystem dynamics, and encourages a misleading restrictive notion of the loci of contemporary social conflict.\n      </p>", "An exploratory study of urban entrepreneurs participating in a technical assistance program finds that they focus on the bottom line and often have an explicit wish to improve their community. This integrated combination of economic and social values, a kind of civic-minded capitalism, guides their positioning for growth and yields a business that can best be called a \"civic enterprise.\" A descriptive analysis of qualitative and quantitative research yields propositions for future research on these hybrid business ventures.\n      </p>", "Proponents of the Conscious Capitalism (CC) movement claim that CC firms should demonstrate a lower gross margin, a higher profit margin, a lower SG&amp;A, and a lower marketing expense than their non-CC comparable firms. Using a sample of industry-year-size matched control firms as the CC firms' benchmark, this article shows that empirical evidence largely disagrees with these conjectures. It further shows that in contrast to the implications of the CC movement, CC firms neither demonstrated superior stock performance relative to the S&amp;P 500 in recent years, nor do they respond less to the pressures from the equity market.\n      </p>", "We outline a framework grounded in Marxist political economy for investigating structural change in particular industries as well as the larger economy. Our approach focuses upon processes of capital and labor restructuring that lie behind the geographical manifestations of industrial change. An empirical study of capitalist restructuring in 51 U.S. manufacturing sectors from 1958-77 reveals the emergence of a distinctively new variant of capitalism, termed \"global capitalism,\" and a coincident decline in the monopoly capitalist variant which had previously prevailed. Two statistical analyses identify the existence of restructuring, which is defined as transition between monopoly and global capitalism within a particular sector. The results generated by discriminant analysis, confirmed by a cluster analysis, sustain the hypothesis of structural transition in the U.S. economy. We find that by 1977 sixteen U.S. manufacturing industries had experienced transition to the global variant of capitalism while thirty industries remained unchanged. Many of those recording no change were basic industries in regions experiencing significant economic decline during the 1970s.\n      </p>", "Two views are outlined on the question of how social theory, and specifically the theory of capitalist society, can and should be relevant to political action. For the 'instrumentalist' view the theory cannot provide political actors with ultimate ends, but can only give them a diagram of the social mechanism which they can use in working out means to those ends. By contrast, for the 'formative' view, which is exemplified by Hegel's view of the role of philosophy in historical change, theory should act as a mirror to social subjects, showing them the nature of their own activity and thereby inducing a transformation in their basic ends. Some ways are discussed in which a theory of capitalism could play such a formative role for its subjects. It is then argued that, in order to play this role effectively, a formative theory of capitalism would need to abstract from any of the putative dynamics internal to capitalism, such as those of globalization and progressive commodification, which are discussed in the following articles. Theory that deals with such tendencies must stand in an instrumental relationship to political action.\n      </p>", "The thesis that 'Capitalism does not just happen' is argued with reference to Gramsci, hegemony and the critique of state centrism. This involves a critique of the assumption that ruling classes rule effortlessly, and raises the issue: Does globalization increase the pressures on ruling classes to deliver? Global system theory is outlined in terms of transnational practices in the economic, political, and culture and ideology spheres and the characteristic institutional forms of these, the transnational corporation, transnational capitalist class and the culture-ideology of consumerism. The transnational capitalist class is organized in four overlapping fractions: TNC executives, globalizing bureaucrats, politicians and professionals, consumerist elites (merchants and media). Social movements for global capitalism and elite social movement organizations (ESMOs) are analysed. Each of the four fractions of the TCC has its own distinctive organizations, some of which take on social movement-like characteristics.\n      </p>", "This article examines the type of economic analyses of capitalism presented by leading exponents of the neoclassical, marxian, Austrian and institutionalist schools of economic thought. Although each school has something to offer, it is argued that all except the institutionalist school are largely insensitive to different types of structure within capitalism and are blind to the cultures and institutions which characterize different kinds of capitalism. This conclusion is reached by addressing three issues: the problem of universal and specific assumptions in economic analysis; the question of 'necessary impurities' in an economic system; and the relationship between actor and structure. It is concluded that institutional economics is most sensitive to the immense actual and potential variety within capitalism itself, and recognizes that the development of different capitalist systems can be divergent rather than convergent.\n      </p>", "The links between the production of sexual subjectivity and commodity consumption exemplify how capitalism thrives through the production of plurality and difference. Tupperware-style sex-toy parties organized by and for women provide the ethnographic ground for exploring the question of how sex toys marketed in this venue incite consumer desires and reshape sexual practices. Using an interpretative approach to understanding the effects of the home-based parties as well as in-depth interviews with participants, this article demonstrates how marketing practices encourage the proliferation of multiple sexualities.\n      </p>", "The article relates capitalism's distinctive dynamic to the nature of the wage relation and self-valorization of capital. Capitalism has no final telos: its future remains open in the face of structural changes and social struggles. This source of capitalist dynamism also opens it to external influence. Some key changes in the 'government and governance' of economics and politics are also discussed. These include: the denationalization of state-hood, a partial de-statization of politics, and the internationalization of policy regimes. Among counter-trends are the survival of the national state as an instance of meta-governance.\n      </p>", "Starting from the premise that the proper foundation for the historicisation of international systems lies in the delineation of the prevailing social property relations of an epoch, my paper seeks to conceptualise the international relations of capitalist modernity. This endeavour, however, runs into problems when no conceptual basis in capitalist social relations can be spelled out that would specify clearly why capitalism needs an interstate system. Turning to history, I find that the emergence of territorial statehood in fact preceded the rise of capitalism. This then leads me to ask in what way the transition to capitalism in the 19th century transformed the content of international relations - but also, conversely, what the reproduction of the territorial form in this transition means for the development of capitalist societies. Finally, I will ask whether the current process of globalisation entails the restructuring of political space in line with the inherently global nature of capital. Has capitalism, in other words, 'worked its way through' to the international system and finally, after a 200-year long transitional period, subsumed 'the international' under its own global logic?\n      </p>", "In terms of anthropology's past interests, the study of family firms seems a \"natural\" way into the ethnography of contemporary capitalism. True, but as Sylvia Yanagisako's rich and sensitive study demonstrates, this is so by productively frustrating central ideas in anthropology like \"culture\" and \"kinship\" without resolution in alternative concepts.\n      </p>", "No one would deny that sustainability is necessary for individual, business, and national survival. How this goal is to be accomplished is a matter of great debate. In this article I will show that the United States and other developed countries have a duty to create sustainable cities, even if that is against a notion of private property rights considered as an absolute. Through eminent domain and regulation, developed countries can fulfill their obligations to current and future generations. To do so, the governments must reject perfectly competitive free market capitalism and the absolute right to private property, and more fully adopt social welfare capitalism as their economic system. The result will be a sustainable society that balances democracy, individual rights and individual flourishing with the community's flourishing.\n      </p>", "Drawing from the varieties of capitalism theoretical framework, the study explores the home country influences of multinational corporations (MNCs) on their corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices when they operate outside their national/regional institutional contexts. The study focusses on a particular CSR practice (i.e. corporate expressions of code of conducts) of seven MNCs from three varieties of capitalism \u2013 coordinated (2), mixed (2) and liberal (3) market economies \u2013 operating in the oil and gas sector of the Nigerian economy. The study concludes that the corporate codes of conduct of these MNCs operating in Nigeria, to a large extent, reflect the characteristics of their home countries' model of capitalism, respectively, albeit with certain degree of modifications. The home countries' model of capitalism is also found to have implications for the degree of adaptability of these MNCs' CSR practices to the Nigerian institutional context \u2013 with the mixed market economy model of capitalism adapting more flexibly than the liberal and coordinated market economies, respectively. The findings of this study will contribute to the emerging literature on the institutional embeddedness of CSR practices in transnational social spaces, understanding of varieties of capitalism, and CSR in developing economies.\n      </p>", "California presents an important case of regional capitalism grounded in the wealth of nature. It belies the received wisdom that natural resource extraction is an anachronistic and inferior road to economic development. Prior to World War II, California's economy rested squarely on minerals, agriculture, timber, and fisheries, yet this was consonant with high income, capital accumulation, development of manufacturing, and a high rate of technical innovation. Indeed, the latter were crucial to an extraordinarily rapid rate of discovery and plunder of resources for over a century. With due regard to the gifts of nature, the secret of California's success is to be found in its social relations of production, especially open property rights and a syncretic class system, rapid capital accumulation, and a redoubtable state based firmly on the capitalist society that crafted it.\n      </p>", "The article starts with a definition of the concept feminization of labour. It aims to signal how, at both the Italian and the global level, precarity, together with certain qualitative characteristics historically present in female work, have become decisive factors for current productive processes, to the point of progressively transforming women into a strategic pool of labour. Since the early 1990s, Italy has seen a massive increase in the employment of women, within the wave of legislation that has introduced various flexible contracts - so-called atypical work. I show how cognitive capitalism tends to prioritize extracting value from relational and emotional elements, which are more likely to be part of women's experiential baggage. The results of a study conducted in November 2006 among freelance workers of the Rizzoli Corriere della sera group, the largest publishing group in Italy, will be used to show how women are able to move more easily on the shifting sands of precarity, within the context of cognitive work.\n      </p>", "Many current literacy campaigns intended for indigenous peoples in Third World countries are reconceptualizations of earlier colonial projects and conform to the needs of late-modern capitalism. Early anthropology may have influenced the discourses surrounding literacy, but current anthropologists have charted important cultural and linguistic territories that provide vital information to use when conceptualizing indigenous literacy education. Anthropology can also play a role in supporting indigenizing modernities through literacy programs.\n      </p>", "There are two non-mutually exclusive theories of individual variations in pro-capitalism opinions. The first theory views pro-capitalism opinions as self-serving: Individuals are opposed to market forces when they threaten their economic rents. The second theory views differences in such opinions as reflecting genuine disagreement on the efficiency of various economic systems. Using individual data, we investigate the validity of both theories, focusing on attitudes toward private ownership, private profit and competition. We find evidence that the first theory explains some of the variations in attitudes. However, consistent with the second theory, we also find evidence of individual learning about the comparative virtues of economic systems. The learning is slow, home-biased and path-dependent. Long-run cultural and historical determinants of pro-market attitudes, such as religion and legal origins, explain more than 40% of the cross-country variations in capitalism aversion. Last, we provide tentative evidence that at the country level, pro-market opinions affect the nature of economic institutions. Our results suggest that the feasibility of economic reform does not depend solely on its impact on the distribution of rents; ideological a-prioris are likely to be important as well.\n      </p>", "Si la sup\u00e9riorit\u00e9 du capitalisme en tant que syst\u00e8me \u00e9conomique produisant de la croissance a fascin\u00e9 les \u00e9conomistes depuis des si\u00e8cles, tel n'est pas le cas des sociologues qui se sont principalement int\u00e9ress\u00e9s \u00e0 ses cons\u00e9quences sociales.

La dimension \"\u00e9conomique\" vient de l'attention accord\u00e9e \u00e0 la dimension \u00e9conomique du capitalisme, tandis que la dimension \"sociologique\" vient de la mani\u00e8re d'\u00e9tudier cette dimension \u00e9conomique. Le point de d\u00e9part analytique consiste dans la proposition selon laquelle les int\u00e9r\u00eats d\u00e9terminent les actions des individus et que ces int\u00e9r\u00eats prennent une forme sociale particuli\u00e8re, forme que nous appelons \"capitalisme\".

While the superiority of capitalism as an economic system and growth machine has fascinated economists for centuries, this has not been the case with sociologists, who have mainly been concerned with its social consequences. In this article an effort is made to present an agenda for a sociological study of the economic institutions that make up capitalism that can be called \"an economic sociology of capitalism\". The \"economic\" in this approach comes from the emphasis on the economic dimension of capitalism; and the \"sociology\" from the way this economic dimension should be studied. The analytical point of departure for an economic sociology of capitalism consists of the proposition that interests drive the actions of the individuals, and that interests come together in a very specific\u2014and social\u2014way that we call \"capitalism\". This study is devoted to an attempt to spell out what it would mean for economic sociology to set this model of capitalism at its center. It is clear, for one thing, that this would have important consequences for what will then be seen as the central task of economic sociology\u2014namely, to produce studies of production, distribution, consumption and profit-making. Added to this are the following three topics: the impact on the economic process by law, politics and culture. For all of these latter topics it is imperative to investigate how they can speed up, slow down or block economic growth.\n      </p>", "The anti-capitalist debate has traditionally drawn up battle lines between oppressed individuals on the one hand, and an oppressive system on the other. While this has high rhetorical value, it is based on imprecise use of language. The language confuses an amoral system with im/moral agents but at the same time uses anthropomorphic language to lend capitalism moral agency. This inevitably leads to a confused debate. Given that all opponents of capitalism want the reformation of what they see as a flawed system, precision in the use of the language employed would move the debate into arenas of action, and thus the debate is more likely to generate change.\n      </p>", "Libertarian theories of the normative core of the corporation hold in common the view that is the responsibility of publicity held corporations to return profits to shareholders within the bounds of certain moral side-constraints. Side-constraints may be either weak (grounded in the rules of the game) or strong (grounded in rights). This essay considers libertarian arguments regarding the normative core of the corporation in the context of global capitalism and in the light of actual corporate behavior. First, it is argued the weak side-constraints view is conceptually incoherent when applied in a global context. Second, it is argued that proponents of the libertarian strong side-constraints view lack an adequate theory of rights. Third, both the weak side-constraints view and the strong side-constraints view are shown to be unsatisfactory insofar as they fail to adequately address the coercive power of corporations. The main conclusion of this essay is that a viable libertarian theory of the corporation has yet to be articulated.\n      </p>", "This paper offers a reinterpretation of what critical theorist Moishe Postone calls 'the fundamental core of capitalism'. In so doing, it seeks to lay a set of theoretical foundations for a renewed Marxian political economy in geography, at a time when Marxism has been eclipsed as a leading critical paradigm within the discipline. The argument works on two fronts simultaneously. On the one hand, the ongoing hegemony of economic and political neo-conservatism is occluding the violent realities of a capitalist world economy behind the anodyne logics of free-market theory. These realities suggest the continued relevance of, and need for, a strong Marxian critique of political economy. But on the other hand, Marxism has been reprimanded by its erstwhile allies on the Left of geography for being too 'modern' and too capital- and class-centred. In light of this double challenge, the paper seeks to develop a 'both/and' Marxism for geography that can chart a third way between the antinomies of modern and after-modern modes of theorizing capitalism and class. A project of 'envisioning capitalism' is suggested on this basis, which combines the 'power' of modern theory with the epistemological reflexivity of after-modern theory. At the same time, capitalism and class are rethought at an ontological level and shown still to be essential features of the fin-de-millennium world, but far less closed and hegemonic than is suggested by modern modes of Marxism. Finally, a return to a class politics of redistribution is suggested, but in a way that draws in more recent Left geographical concerns with identity, difference and recognition.\n      </p>", "Friedrich A. von Hayek influenced many areas of inquiry including economics, psychology and political theory. This article will offer one possible interpretation of the ethical foundation of Hayek's political and social contributions to libertarianism and free market capitalism by analyzing several of his important non-economic publications, primarily The Road to Serfdom, The Fatal Conceit, The Constitution of Liberty and Law, Legislation and Liberty. While Hayek did not offer a particular ethical foundation for free market capitalism, he argued consistently that free markets are liberating and, for the markets to be truly free and for individuals to participate freely in markets, they should be subject to little control. Beyond some very basic principles, such as the protection of private property, that enable the free market to function properly, individuals are both free to and required to determine their own ethical compass. The central question, then, is what are the ethical principles that underlie Hayek's view of the successful organization and operation of a free market? If formal rules and regulations must be kept to a minimum, then ethical behavior is an individual choice as well as an important foundation for the self-regulating free market. This article will argue that one possible ethical foundation underlying Hayek's libertarian justification for free market capitalism are Friedrich Nietzsche's \"will to power\" and noble/slave ethics. This article will rely primarily on Nietzsche's On The Genealogy of Morals, Beyond Good and Evil, Zarathustra, and the Will to Power\n      </p>", "In this article, basic income (BI) will not be considered as a measure to raise living standards and social well-being. Rather, it will be presented as an indispensable structural policy for achieving a healthier social order governed by a more equitable compromise between capital and labor. Embracing the French Regulation School approach, we maintain that such a compromise is founded on the redistribution of productivity gains. Describing the dynamics of productivity enables a better understanding of the main features and development of contemporary capitalism. In advancing our argument, we focus on the socioeconomic transformation that has overtaken the Fordist paradigm within Western countries and propose the term \"cognitive capitalism\" to describe the new economic system. We argue that BI can be seen as a viable economic policy able to contrast the instability generated by the present form(s) of accumulation, as it increases productivity through network and learning processes.\n      </p>", "Despite some important similarities, capitalism's informal economy and socialism's second economy are not functional equivalents or structural counterparts. An informal economy is the product of efforts to circumvent accountability to the explicit rationalizations of regulatory bureaucratization. It operates according to principles disparate from those of the rules of internal labor markets but congruent with the market principles that coordinate the formal economy. In the centrally planned economies of state socialism where informalization responds to the contradictions of redistributive bureaucratization, the embryonic market relations of the second economy are incongruent with the bureaucratic principles that coordinate the formal economy, and in fact, stimulate the institutionalization of transactive market relations and the expansion of property rights inside the socialist enterprise. As a sphere of activity relatively autonomous from the state, the second economy is a source of fundamental change remaking the economic institutions of socialism.\n      </p>", "During recent years universities have engaged increasingly in academic capitalism as a response to the decrease in budget funding and the external push towards entrepreneurial activities. This paper explores on the micro level what impacts the changing funding patterns have on university research, how the changes are responded to in different research units, and how researchers experience them. Based on focused interviews with senior researchers in three different types of research settings in Finland, the paper argues that engaging in academic capitalism is everyday reality in all units but takes a diversity of forms depending on how close or distant the field is from the market. In addition the disciplinary and institutional cultures shape the process of adaptation to the changing environmental conditions. It is concluded that increasing market-orientation does not displace traditional academic practices, values and ideals as researchers try to accommodate them to entrepreneurial activities. However, especially due to the growth and intensification of project work on short-term contracts, achieving a balance between the two value-sets is at present felt to be increasingly difficult, thus generating a variety of tensions in the daily work of the researchers and even endangering the quality of research.\n      </p>", "Recent conceptualizations of trends in the structure of U.S. industry have focused on the relative importance of markets, hierarchies, and hybrid intermediate forms. This paper advances the discussion by distinguishing three ideal-typical forms of organization and their corresponding coordination mechanisms: market/price, hierarchy/authority, and community/trust. Different institutions combine the three forms/mechanisms in different proportions. Economic and organizational theory have shown that, compared to trust, price and authority are relatively ineffective means of dealing with knowledge-based assets. Therefore, as knowledge becomes increasingly important in our economy, we should expect high-trust institutional forms to proliferate. A review of trends in employment relations, interdivisional relations, and interfirm relations finds evidence suggesting that the effect of growing knowledge-intensity may indeed be a trend toward greater reliance on trust. There is also reason to believe that the form of trust most effective in this context is a distinctively modern kind-\"reflective trust\"-as opposed to traditionalistic, \"blind\" trust. Such a trend to reflective trust appears to threaten the privileges of currently dominant social actors, and these actors' resistance, in combination with the complex interdependencies between price, authority, and trust mechanisms, imparts a halting character to the trend. But the momentum of this trend nevertheless appears to be self-reinforcing, which suggests that it may ultimately challenge the foundations of our capitalist form of society while simultaneously creating the foundations of a new, postcapitalist form.\n      </p>", "That 'Another World is Possible' has become the ensign of the left's common sense. For lack of having been thought through, and for want to take it all in, the new reasonableness has given itself a hollow name with a ring to it: altermondialisme. Notwithstanding fashionable certainties, everything about it needs to be problematized, both because, in carrying on the century-old internationalist drive for programmatic coherence, altermondialisme rather stands at the rearguard of the movement than at its forefront, and because in its relationship to it, it reproduces rather than challenges attempts by the World Bank et al. to contain contemporary anti-capitalism and empty it of political possibilities. The text is divided into three parts. In the first, I identify what I take to be an essential political dynamic of contemporary world order: the attempt by regulatory agencies of global capitalism to invent a functional, civil and perfectly apolitical global subject that could serve as an ideal social companion to global-neo-liberalism. In the second part of the text, I work from concepts that originated with the Internationale Situationniste to begin making political sense of contemporary anti-capitalist praxis. In the third part of the article, I extract from the first two principles of articulation that may allow us to understand contemporary anti-capitalism for what it is, without containing or reifying it.\n      </p>", "When we think of theories that attempt to root capitalism in nature, the one that comes most readily to mind is Social Darwinism. In this theory, nature - driven by Darwinian natural selection (the struggle for existence and the survival of the fittest) - is interpreted to imply, when applied to human activities, that extreme competition will allow the most \"fit\" competitors to rise to the top and to survive in this \"struggle for existence,\" and this process of dog-eat-dog competition leads to both material and social progress. Not only has this theory been shown to be seriously flawed, the putative social implications of Darwinian natural selection do not accord with the findings of contemporary neoDarwinists who maintain, for example, that the behavior of monkeys and apes reveals a blend of competition and cooperation and, generally, a close connection to human moral behavior. Adam Smith provides a more helpful view of the connection between nature and capitalism. He maintains that nature's wisdom, as seen in its harmony and balance, is displayed in economics and human nature. Competitive free enterprise, as a vehicle for exchange, functions within a cooperative context and exhibits virtues and values such as mutual help and benefit, trust, harmony, and friendship. I shall show that neoDarwinists agree with Smith's view that nature supports a connection between competition and cooperation, and they maintain that moral activity, rather than destructive dog-eat-dog competition, is necessary to achieve the goals of natural selection.\n      </p>", "This article discusses the impact of neoliberal capitalism on women and reviews the promises of Beijing against the realities of women's lives in Africa. The focus is on South Africa post-1994, the impact of Growth Employment and Redistribution, and the neoliberal discourses contained in the New Partnership for Africa's Development. Against this contemporary analysis, the article calls for radical structural changes, a move towards social democracy, and for consciousness-raising among both men and women so that they understand the dynamics of power imbalances and how structural factors impact their lives. Given the devastatingly poor and marginalised positions of the majority of women, and the current lack of labour absorption capacity, the article advocates for comprehensive social security in the form of a basic income grant to positively impact the lives of women in South Africa.\n      </p>", "The piecemeal development of capitalist socioeconomic systems in the colonial Chesapeake was deeply intertwined with projects of white ethnogenesis. Crafting a sense of \"groupness\" along lines perceived as racial required free \"whites\" to remain economically and socially interdependent. A variety of strategies and material forms--including reciprocal exchanges, hall-parlor house plans, and earthfast construction--facilitated this cohesion. Such integrative tactics coexisted in colonists' behavioral repertoires with more \"capitalistic\" strategies that prioritized private profit over social obligation. Colonists' deployment of diverse social strategies reflects a complex calculus assessing the benefits of economic autonomy against the benefits of ethnic (\"white\") solidarity. These dynamics can be illustrated through an 18th-century archaeological site at Flowerdew Hundred in the Chesapeake.\n      </p>", "The classical conception of the development of capitalism in agriculture maintains that, as in industry, the agrarian class-structure will tend to polarize, the petty commodity producer will tend to disappear, and a capitalist relation of production will develop between an agrarian bourgeoisie and a rural proletariat. Farms will be big estates, managed by capitalist farmers, run with machinery and landless labourers. This conception has proved to be unjustified. The classics of Marxism are discussed in order to find out the assumptions underlying this conception of agricultural development. The findings are used in a discussion of the prospects of a development in accordance with the classical conception in contemporary peripheral agriculture.\n      </p>", "Globalization is widely held to circumscribe the parameters of political and economic choice in contemporary Europe, just as it has come to circumscribe the parameters of debate on the future of European models of capitalism. Yet opinions on the question of convergence nonetheless vary markedly, with proponents of the hyperglobalization thesis pointing to a simple and inexorable process of neoliberal convergence while an increasingly influential school of neo-institutionalists point to a rather more complex process of 'dual' or 'co-convergence', reinforcing the distinctiveness of liberal and coordinated market economies. In both accounts, the exhibited pattern of convergence (dual or otherwise) is seen to be driven by globalization. In this paper I provide a theoretical and empirical critique of this important literature, challenging the contextualization of the question of convergence with respect to globalization which both perspectives share. I advance a distinctive variant of the new institutionalism which emphasizes: (i) the contingency of any process of convergence observed; (ii) the frequently political as opposed to economic nature of convergent tendencies; (iii) the countertendencies which might be mobilized to such tendencies; and (iv) the invariably far greater significance, in the establishment of common trajectories, of regional rather than genuinely global processes of integration. Though common trajectories are discernible within contemporary Europe, associated in particular with the institutional architecture of EMU and an accelerating process of European economic integration, they have been embraced more or less enthusiastically and at variable paces, leading not to convergent but to divergent outcomes.\n      </p>", "Recent decades have witnessed an upsurge in activism around labor issues in global production networks. A particularly prominent example is the antisweatshop movement, a diverse collection of efforts to promote labor rights and improve working conditions in international supply chains for apparel and footwear products. Much of the literature on the antisweatshop movement emphasizes its global nature and the reliance of activists on transnational advocacy networks involving coalitions of Northern (usually U.S.-based) consumers and Southern workers. Drawing theoretical inspiration from the varieties of capitalism literature, we examine instead the emergence and institutionalization of antisweatshop politics within the global North. Based on interviews with groups in eight countries, we analyze the trajectories of antisweatshop activism in Western Europe, the United States, and Canada, finding marked variation in the leadership and composition of the movement across regions. Antisweatshop politics were particularly contentious in the United States, where labor leaders were active in framing the sweatshop scourge as a domestic as well as an international social problem. In Europe and Canada, the key role was played not by organized labor, but by other civil society groups that encouraged a multistakeholder approach to what was perceived primarily as an issue of social and economic development in the global South. Overall, our analysis highlights how national institutions and political cultures shape the way that actors assess a social problem and evaluate the possibilities available to effect meaningful change.\n      </p>", "A major debate neglected by accounting historians is the importance of landlords in the English agricultural revolution. The paper uses accounting evidence from the historical literature to test Marx's theory that, from around 1750, England's landlords played a pivotal role by adopting and then spreading the capitalist mentality and social relations by enclosures and changes in the management of their estates and tenants. It gives an accounting interpretation of Marx's theory of rent and argues that the available evidence supports his view that the conversion of English landlords to capitalism underlay the later stages of the agricultural revolution. The conclusion explains the linkages in Marx's theory between the agricultural and industrial revolutions, and calls on accounting historians to conduct archival research into the agricultural roots of modern capitalism.\n      </p>", "Swedish wage-earner funds (WEFs) represented a distinctive form of socialization of investment intended to counter the dynamic inefficiency of capitalism and facilitate Post Keynesian economic policy. This paper reviews the theoretical arguments for the socialization of investment, before evaluating its performance. It found that WEFs performed creditably in relation to financial targets, but less effectively regarding demorcratic objectives, while macroeconomic influence was ultimately constrained by the limited size of the scheme and shocks arising from financial deregulation. The paper concludes that WEFs have, however imperfectly, contributed toward the legitimization of the concept of collective investment funds as an economic policy instrument.\n      </p>", "China's rapid economic growth since 1978 has occurred precisely because it has not followed the strategy of parallel partial progression and financial liberalization advocated by Fan and Woo. However, China missed an historic opportunity to build welfare capitalism in the 1980s and 1990s, choosing instead to dismantle its rural health care and educational systems and\u2014as Philip Huang rightly argues\u2014failing to secure workers' right in the burgeoning informal sector. In these respects, China's transition path has been far inferior to that of Britain in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Nevertheless, the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 has discredited Anglo-Saxon capitalism and presents a renewed opportunity for China to build a form of xiaokang socialism modeled on the Rheinish capitalism that was so successful in countries such as France, Germany, and Japan before 1989.\n      </p>", "In this article, I explore what a critical environmental perspective would look like in Melanesia, where the distinction between nature and culture, and the expectation that science interprets the former in terms of the latter, may not apply. I consider changes in scientific knowledge production and the shift from cultural ecology to political ecology in Melanesian anthropology, including the argument that Melanesians are neither conservationists nor environmentalists. In contrast, I show how people exposed to pollution from the Ok Tedi copper and gold mine in Papua New Guinea mobilize their understandings of difference in a green critique of capitalism. I examine a strategy session of local activists, a public meeting about their campaign against the mine, and a sorcery tribunal. Finally, I suggest that Melanesian ideas about social relations provide a useful ethnographic analogy for thinking about the mobility and short temporal horizons of contemporary capitalism.\n      </p>", "This article explores the concept of state autonomy with respect to the domestic class forces and the global economy.

We are increasingly a culture that looks neither to the past nor to the future, but only to the next \"quarter,\" or to the next Delphic pronouncement by Alan Greenspan. This cultural construction of time has given rise to social, political and personal problems of unprecedented magnitude. The short-term focus of contemporary American capitalism is causing us to behave, both individually and collectively, in an increasingly irrational and thus self-destructive manner. Ours is now the most violent, crime-ridden society in the industrialized world. Capitalism is sometimes blamed for this, yet there are other capitalist societies that do not suffer the same evils we suffer. I argue that we can learn from these societies how to correct some of the ills of our own system and in this way construct a new paradigm of the market, a paradigm for the new millennium, a more mature, rational version of capitalism that would focus on the long rather than the short term.\n      </p>", "This article advances the concept of \"time-space intensification\" as an alternative to existing notions of time-space distanciation, compression and embedding that attempt to capture the restructuring of time and space in contemporary advanced capitalism. This concept suggests time and space are intensified in the contemporary period the social experience of time and space becomes more explicit and more crucial to socioeconomic actors' lives, time and space are mobilized more explicitly in individual and corporate action, and the institutionalization of time and space becomes more politicized. Drawing on Polanyi's concepts of fictitious commodities and the double movement, and developing them through an analysis of work organization and economic development in the Irish software industry, the article argues that the concept of time-space intensification can add significantly to our understanding of key features of the restructuring of the temporal and spatial basis of economic development and work organization.\n      </p>", "This is a response to Runciman's reply to my critique of his 1993 article. I argue that although the First World War brought about many changes in British society, it did not initiate a new stage in its development, for these changes were largely an acceleration of existing tendencies. Runciman's argument that the similarities between the 1930s and the 1980s show that British capitalism was essentially the same in both periods does not allow for the different directions in which British society was moving in the 1930s and in the 1980s. His treatment of the 1980s changes as another phase in the political cycle fails to grasp what was new about the 1980s or locate these changes in their wider economic and global context.\n      </p>", "Karl Marx sought virtue through suffering. His need to seek it in some form of social rebellion was a product of his early life experiences. However, his reaction to his Jewish origin determined the direction of that rebellion: the field of economics. His first paper on the Jewish question described the Jew as a greedy manipulator of money. A few years later he was still attacking greedy manipulators of money, but his target had changed from the Jew to the capitalist. Marx never disavowed his early paper on the Jewish question, but he no longer used anti-Semitism as a basic element in his attack on the rich. In his final version of the materialist theory of history and the concept of capitalism, the Jew plays no part, nor does anti-Semitism. Marx's early work on the Jewish question has often been resurrected to try to prove just the opposite, namely that the communism of Marx is an anti-Semitic doctrine.\n      </p>", "A decline in imperial power is not necessarily accompanied by \"an equal and concomitant decline in racial ideas and ideologies\" (Rich 1990:1). In this article, I examine this thesis in the context of contemporary Japan, which lost its empire with its unconditional surrender to the Allied powers in 1945. The protagonists of this article are the Japanese farmers who colonized northeast China during Japan's imperial expansion. Although the former colonists have been repatriating to Japan since 1946, their \"Japaneseness\" in postcolonial Japan has been contested not only by the Japanese state but also by the repatriates themselves. In contemporary Japan, the returning colonists are joined by an increasing number of Chinese immigrants, whom Japanese mainstream society identifies as \"economic refugees.\" On the basis of long-term ethnographic research, I follow two generations of repatriates from China to Japan. I argue that to understand a resurgence of racism against Chinese immigrants in contemporary Japan, one should not only investigate the identity politics of the repatriates but also historicize such politics through repatriates' memories.\n      </p>", "During the 1920s, the Garvey movement challenged Black intellectualism, which at the time was in the midst of a renaissance. Influenced by the philosophy of Booker T. Washington and considered irreparably idealistic, Garveyism, nevertheless, remains the largest sociopolitical race movement in history. Throughout his legal quandaries, Garvey accurately articulated that the American legal system was highly bureaucratized and that the efficient processing of legal matters was the system's paramount concern. Garvey's ideology eerily resembles the law and economics paradigm of contemporary American justice, and his embrace of social justice over social equality is now realized in the rational choice framework of the American legal system. Consequently, Garvey remains relevant because he correctly surmised that capitalism is the cornerstone of righteousness and thus social justice should be evaluated by a capitalistic yardstick rather than by a social justice paradigm.\n      </p>", "In \"The Mad Man\" (1994), which is concerned, among many other things, with the sexual encounters of a young black male philosophy PhD candidate with black, white, and Latino homeless men, Samuel Delany explores the ambiguous relation between the erotics of urban life and postmodern capitalism. To an important extent, the novel suggests, certain modes of urban queer eroticism might be seen as utopian alternatives to dominant modes of late capitalist sociality. This tendency of the novel is, however, offset by its countervailing (though less emphatic) attention to the antisocial, anti-utopian elements within both sexual desire and the contemporary urban environment-elements that the novel collects together under the sign of apocalypse. Taken together, the novel's deployment of utopian and apocalyptic elements provides a powerfully dialectical account of the intertwined operations of commodity culture and eroticism within the postmodern metropolitan context.\n      </p>", "Many New Orleans residents who were displaced in 2005 by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the subsequent levee failures and floods are still displaced. Living with long-term stress related to loss of family, community, jobs, and social security as well as the continuous struggle for a decent life in unsettled life circumstances, they manifest what we are calling \"chronic disaster syndrome.\" The term refers not only to the physiological and psychological effects generated at the individual level by ongoing social disruption but also to the nexus of socioeconomic and political conditions that produce this situation as a long-term and intractable problem. Chronic disaster syndrome emerges from the convergence of three phenomena that create displacement: long-term effects of personal trauma (including near loss of life and loss of family members, homes, jobs, community, financial security, and well-being); the social arrangements that enable the smooth functioning of what Naomi Klein calls \"disaster capitalism,\" in which \"disaster\" is prolonged as a way of life; and the permanent displacement of the most vulnerable populations from the social landscape as a perceived remedy that actually exacerbates the syndrome.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Pension fund capitalism is a new, albeit evolving, stage of Anglo-American capital market development. It is marked by the ability of pension funds to aggregate the widely disbursed ownership of beneficiaries and therefore act as single entities with a unified voice. Pension funds within their investment portfolios are increasingly using this voice to engage companies. Such corporate engagement in its broadest definition is the use of one's ownership position to influence company management decision making. Corporate engagement brings together four distinct underlying currents: first, the increased use of passive index funds; second, the corporate governance movement; third, the growing impact of socially responsible investing; and, finally, the impact of new global standards. At its best corporate engagement offers a long-term view of value that both promotes higher corporate, social and environmental standards and adds share value, thus providing long-term benefits to future pension beneficiaries.

However, in the mid-1980s the golden age of multiculturalism came to an end. Neo-conservative political forces attacked multicultural policies and progressively a neo-liberal discourse pervaded economic and social policies, also affecting national education systems. In contrast, multicultural approaches have emerged with tremendous vigour in the field of business management. Juxtaposing cognitive, emotional and socio-communicative multiculturalism found in organisational studies onto multiculturalism in the International Baccalaureate (IB) curriculum indicates whether multiculturalism in international schools aims to respond to the needs of global capitalism. The findings show that emotional, cognitive and socio-communicative multiculturalism are seen as essential traits for good performance in transnational corporations, and they are strongly encouraged in the IB curriculum. The relevance of multicultural skills in global management alongside the decay of multiculturalism in public education systems entails a growing educational disparity between lower class and higher class children.

Through empirical case studies, the authors refine and even subvert the homogenization narrative of globalization and capitalist history, and the concomitant assertion of the inevitability of the unilinear integration of local 'tradition'-bound communities into the global space-time of modernity. However, through combined recourse to a historical sociology of actions and methodological individualism, certain authors fail to address sufficiently the theoretical quandary raised by the relationship between culturally constituted subject-positions (agency) and socio-economic or political organizations (structure). The problem of positing 'culture' as an autonomous--and hence potentially overdetermining-category remains. Furthermore, while taking issue with the 'disenchantment' reading of capitalist history, these critiques of standard approaches to local capitalisms in terms of their correspondance to the founding model of Western capitalism ignore recent, critical reappraisals of the narrative of the very history of capitalim in the West. Increased attention to historical regimes of value and truth, as opposed to culturally inspired complexes of meaning, redirects analysis to the question of how power is involved in the construction of efficacious historical referents. /// Dans cet article les trois ouvrages analys\u00e9s offrent, chacun \u00e0 sa mani\u00e8re, une critique aigu\u00eb du capitalisme en termes de cat\u00e9gorie universelle. \u00c0 travers des \u00e9tudes de cas, les auteurs remettent en question les conceptions qui font de l'histoire du capitalisme \u00e0 la fois une entreprise globalisante du monde et un processus d'int\u00e9gration in\u00e9luctable, dans une modernit\u00e9 englobante, des diff\u00e9rentes communaut\u00e9s traditionnelles.

Outside a small group of rich countries, heavy regulation of business, leftist rhetoric, and interventionist beliefs flourish. We relate these phenomena to the presence of corruption, with causality running in both directions. The paper presents evidence that, within a country, those who perceive widespread corruption also tend to demand more regulation. As regulation is held constant within a country, this finding is hard to explain if one assumes that causality runs only from regulation to corruption. We also find that over time, increases in corruption in a country precede increases in left-wing voting. To explain our findings, we present a model where corrupt capitalists are disliked, and voting for left-wing policies is a form of punishment available to voters even in weak judicial systems. Evidence on emotions supports this explanation: the frequency with which people report experiencing anger is positively correlated with perceived corruption, but this relationship is significantly weaker when business is heavily regulated.\n      </p>", "This article investigates the ideological content of punk cuisine, a subcultural food system with its own grammar, logic, exclusions, and symbolism.

This transformation enabled masses of people to obtain credit without moral opprobrium or social subordination. Classical 18th century economics had the ethical concepts to appreciate these facts. Ironically, contemporary economic theory cannot. I trace this fault to its abstract representations of freedom, efficiency, and markets. The virtues of capitalism lie in the concrete social relations and social meanings through which capital and commodities are exchanged. Contrary to laissez faire capitalism, the conditions for sustaining these concrete capitalist formations require limits on freedom of contract and the scope of private property rights.\n      </p>", "Adam Smith argued in The Wealth of Nations and The Theory of Moral Sentiments that in order to create an effective and productive capitalist system, individuals must pursue interests of both the self and society. Despite this assertion, modern economic theory has become tightly focused on the pursuit of economic self-interests at the expense of other, higher order motives. This paper will argue that the tendency to employ such an egocentric strategy often generates externalities and inequalities that serve to detract from the greater welfare of society. However, by tempering these economic self-interests with non-economically motivated considerations, this paper will suggest that individuals may create tremendous benefits to society, precisely as Smith outlined more than two centuries ago. In defense of this assertion, this paper will review an array of theoretical arguments and empirical findings that suggest that today's entrepreneurs are not only seeking to satisfy both selfish and ethical motivations, but in so doing they are also contributing substantially to the overall welfare of society through job creation, wealth redistribution, and a lack of discrimination. As such, it appears that spirit and impact of the capitalist system that Smith envisioned is being realized through entrepreneurship.\n      </p>", "This essay explores the continuing relevance of Marx's work in anthropological theory by examining three dimensions of his thought, concentrating on a central text in each: historical materialism (The German Ideology), the analysis of capitalism (Volume 1 of Capital), and political analysis (The Eighteenth Brumaire).

The paper traces the roots of Japan's regulation strategy for the Asian region to a historical logic of ideological, political and institutional responses of Japanese capitalism to structural change in the world order. At three successive moments in the history of Japanese capitalism, the strategic competence, conscious compromises and 'sense of direction' of administrators played a critical role.

Conversely, does the market give rise to a distinctive set of beliefs, habits, and social bonds? These questions are certainly as old as social science itself.

We begin with Hirschman's characterization of the three rival views of the market as civilizing, destructive, or feeble in its effects on society. We review recent work at the intersection of sociology, economics, and political economy and show that these views persist both as theories of market society and moral arguments about it. We then argue that a fourth view, which we call moralized markets, has become increasingly prominent in economic sociology.

Against this background, the following questions call for answers: What new disconnections can we expect in the short and medium term? How is the United States preparing to block, prevent, or abort these disconnections? Will future disconnections require an imperialist war? Is the polycentric world envisioned by Samir Amin, with its multiple coexisting cultures, a viable alternative?\n      </p>", "This paper examines the geographical transfer of economic knowledge and practices from centres of neoliberalism in North America and Western Europe to post-soviet Ukraine. The paper argues that a 'transition industry' emerged in the wake of the disintegration of the soviet system whose purpose was to realize economic transition in central and eastern Europe. The paper discusses the emergence of a community of academic and professional economists affiliated to international financial institutions and academic and professional economic research organizations in Kyiv engaged in promoting the Washington consensus. This community identified the coal industry, located in the Ukrainian Donbas, as a barrier to structural economic reform and the political re-alignment of the country. The paper then examines the way the World Bank unsuccessfully attempted to force the coal industry to conform to its own policy prescriptions. The example points to the articulation not only of extra-local and internal processes of neoliberalization, but also with indigenous informal marketization. In this instance the World Bank's vision failed to materialize because state power could not be allied to its neoliberal project.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "The mix of old and new in the United State's role as world leader creates ambiguity and confusion. The United States is looking for ways to regain its lost economic punch and to consolidate its world hegemony. At present, however, with no true enemy on the horizon, it is being dragged down by the Soviet collapse. The twentieth century was a period of transition but not from capitalism to socialism. The nonmarket alternative or challenge represented by the Soviet Union gave capitalism the means to overcome many obstacles to its reproduction and raise profits to new levels. The United States occupied a privileged position in that process. However, the twenty-first century demands new solutions for capitalism's inherent contradictions, and as a result the United States is apparently still trying to invent a new Soviet Union.\n      </p>", "This article reviews neo-Weberian, neo-institutionalist economic, and neo-Marxian approaches to the analysis of capitalism in late modern societies. It argues that all make important contributions to the understanding of the increasing economic variability reported in capitalist societies. The approaches also may be profitably combined to assess the degree to which specific cases identified deviate in significant ways from current hegemonic patterns of capitalist development. Finally, consumption theory is assessed for its value in revising standard capitalist development theory.\n      </p>", "In this article, I examine the relationships between new concepts of human activity in the environment and several prevention strategies used to plot a course toward sustainable use. Natural capitalism and industrial ecology are relatively new concepts that provide a framework for environmental management. Although the precautionary principle puts into policy a determination to prevent environmental damage before it occurs, natural capitalism and industrial ecology go beyond the prevention of environmental damage to the optimization of environmental interactions. The risk assessment tools necessary for preventive management continue to be essential. However, additional tools are needed to go beyond prevention to optimization. A holistic, scientific approach to the human place within the environment is needed, including both interdisciplinary and large-scale research.\n      </p>", "In this article, I argue that hateful practices that are prevalent in society are, for the most part linked to our excessive quest for materialism. To demonstrate this, I discuss different ways John Newton, author of the popular hymn, Amazing Grace, justified why he became a slaver in Granfield's non fiction picture book, Amazing Grace: The Story of the Hymn. Knowing fully well that slavery was wrong, Newton willingly participated in the triangular trade business, because he believed it was truly the only he could make a living.\n      </p>", "This paper is an analysis of the relationship of indigenous and western systems of education in lower Zaire during the period of the transformation of the lineage mode of production prevailing in precolonial times to a form of dependent capitalism. The paper also explores the relationship of these two educational systems to the religion, social structure, and patterns of social stratification of populations of lower Zaire placing special emphasis on the Bakongo.\n      </p>", "What is the future of American capitalism in this century? To answer this question we ask-and attempt to answer-a series of other questions. How has American capitalism changed during the past fifty years? Do the greatest economists say anything that sheds any light on the future of contemporary capitalism? And, what will the future of American capitalism be if any of the following systems is dominant during the rest of the century: market capitalism; regulated capitalism; planned capitalism; and command capitalism. The final conclusion here suggests that both democracy and bureaucratic capitalism will survive this century in the United States\u2014 but will do so in few other places in the world.\n      </p>", "This article investigates the geography of finance through a study of the behavior of large equity investors who are key actors in capitalism. The main argument is based on their expectations in \"finance-driven\" capitalism: large equity investors require high returns on invested capital in a shorter time and are said to be impatient. The article focuses on their portfolio turnover in relation to geographic factors and their attachment to a specific model of capitalism. The U.S. \"market-based\" model is presented as a benchmark, since U.S. investors trade securities most frequently relative to other international equity investors. Our empirical findings on the proximity of investors in various models of capitalism with U.S. \"impatient\" investors contribute to a growing literature on the economic importance of geography in understanding global finance.\n      </p>", "Max Weber descended from Anglo-German merchant families with world-wide connections. This helped make him a \"cosmopolitan nationalist.\" Fittingly Weber at first tried to pursue a career in international commercial law. Family connections informed his understanding of South American wheat exports and North American railroad capitalism and of the tariff issues resulting therefrom. This in turn influenced his critique of the Prussian agrarian capitalists, especially of their opposition to trading in grain futures. Weber championed a strong capital market and efficient exchanges. His economic policies remain of exemplary interest insofar as they link the presumptive, if contested, national interest with an unsentimental acceptance of the world economy.\n      </p>", "The alliance in the United States today between cowboy capitalism and evangelical Christianity cannot be understood sufficiently through the categories of efficient causality or ideological analysis. The constituencies fold similar spiritual dispositions into somewhat different ideologies and creeds. Each party then amplifies these dispositions in the other through the media politics of resonance. The ethos infusing the resonance machine is expressed without being articulated. The inability to grasp this political economy separate from the spiritualities infusing it may carry implications for the form a successful countermovement could assume.\n      </p>", "Drawing on ethnographic research conducted in Las Vegas among game developers and machine gamblers, I correlate a set of digitally enhanced game features with phenomenological aspects of gamblers' experience, demonstrating the intimate connection between extreme states of subjective absorption in play and design elements that manipulate space and time to accelerate the extraction of money from players. The case of the digital gambling interface exemplifies the tendency of modern capitalism to bring space, time, and money into intensified relation and sheds light on the question of what might or might not be distinctive about the rationalities and libidinal investments of the \"digital age.\"\n      </p>", "Selectorate theory posits that leader accountability increases with the size of the winning coalition. Recent research contends that capitalism also increases leader accountability because leaders are more dependent on the public for revenue in more capitalist economies. The authors argue that extant tests of accountability arguments of interstate conflict initiation and targeting are flawed. Accountability theories of foreign policy expect leaders to selectively initiate disputes based on their probability of winning. Accountability arguments, then, expect a conditional relationship between the accountability mechanism and the balance of power. For example, if capitalism produces peace through accountability, then more capitalist states should be less likely to initiate militarized disputes as their power advantage decreases. The authors find that this is not the case. At the same time, the authors find robust support for selectorate theory's contention that larger winning coalitions are more selective about using military force. Political institutions induce accountability; capitalism does not.\n      </p>", "This essay explores the political theory of the so-called early Walter Benjamin in light of James Martel\u2019s two recent books on the subject. The essay asks whether Max Weber would qualify as a \u201cplotter\u201d in the \u201cBenjaminian conspiracy\u201d that, for Martel, is at the heart of his anarchist politics. It does so by close reading Benjamin\u2019s posthumously published fragment \u201cCapitalism as Religion\u201d from 1921 that specifically draws on Weber. A theoretical kinship is identified between Benjamin\u2019s idea of pure means, which Agamben also considers as a key element in the redefinition of politics, and Weber\u2019s notion of capital and violence as \u201cends in themselves\u201d in economic and political action, respectively. Violence as the \u201cend in itself\u201d or the Selbstzweck of politics represents the Nietzschean undercurrent of Weber\u2019s politics, to which Benjamin may well have felt an affinity.\n      </p>", "The distribution of the world's population is now more urban than rural. Contemporary and historical urban patterns are identified and their causes are evaluated. Urban development was largely confined to developed countries before mid-century but has spread to developing countries since. Both outcomes are seen as interdependent consequences of the growth and geographical extension of capitalism. The merits of the interdependency theory are assessed. Recent urbanization in Africa and Asia is a locational response to the new global economic order. Cities have grown because of the influx of manufacturing and service jobs from the developed economies, and the in-migration of workers displaced by agricultural adjustment. The prospects for further urbanization are considered.\n      </p>", "A conception of money as a 'neutral veil' masking a 'real' economy was adopted by orthodox economic theory after the Methodenstreit, and is also to be found, in a different form, in Marxian political economy. Both derive from an erroneous functionalist and anachronistic 'commodity' theory of money which, as Post-Keynesian economists argue, cannot explain the distinctive form of capitalist credit-money. Orthodox economic theory and classic Marxism have tacitly informed and flawed historical sociology's understanding of money's role in capitalist development. Mann and Runciman, for example, consider the 'economy' exclusively in terms of the social relations of production and imply that money is epiphenomenal and is to be explained as a response to the needs of the 'real' economy. They do not recognize the structural specificity of capitalist money and banking nor its importance. An alternative account of the autonomous historical conditions of existence of the specifically capitalist form of bank and state credit-money and its role in capitalist development is outlined.\n      </p>", "The assumption that technological innovation constitutes an inevitable facet of something called 'globalisation' is called into question by comparative historical investigation. In the areas of biotechnology and genome research, for instance, the United States and Germany - two advanced industrial states - have demonstrated remarkably differnt historical trajectories. While the US was a driving force behind the explosion of biotechnology as an industrial sector, Germany was unable to muster much effort until the late 1990s. Explaining this difference, this article utilizes historical political economy to characterize these states and their relationship to capitalism. The lag in German efforts is understood as a function of the pre-capitalist vestiges of the state and their peculiar effects on capitalist social relations.\n      </p>", "Just as the availability of new ideas can drive the development of new institutions, the unavailability of ideas also has powerful political effects. The article demonstrates the paradoxical absence of class discourse in postcommunist Polish political debates\u2014paradoxical because the same actors who eschewed class discourse believed that postcommunist class formation and inequalities were the central problems shaping the country and driving the political agenda. The paper documents the early thinking about class and politics on the part of key political activists. It traces their fear of class discourse to their limited knowledge of postwar European capitalisms and the role played by strong labor movements in stabilizing those systems. Ironically, Poles understood capitalism in too Marxist a way, as a perennially raging struggle between classes. Knowing that workers would lose out in the new system, they feared that speaking about class would empower workers as a class and thus weaken the market economy they were determined to build. Not generally aware how class compromise in the post-World War II era worked to stabilize capitalism, Polish (and most other eastern European) oppositionists did their best to thwart the emergence of class identities on the part of those left behind, even at the cost, for liberals, of reconciling themselves to political defeat. The result of the refusal to countenance class discourse was not a block on the emergence of class anger, but a displacement of that anger from class \"others\" to identity-based others, and thus a weakening of the liberal politics that most postcommunist liberals had wished to reinforce. A final section explores recent Polish thinking about class in the context of reactions to the Polish edition of my Defeat of Solidarity book showing continued mainstream reluctance to talk about class but new interest in this category among youth.\n      </p>", "During the 1960s, social scientists tended to view the young people who comprised the new left as part of a liberated or postmaterialist generation which was likely to bring about a far better world. These young people were favorably contrasted with their more \"Authoritarian\" peers in study after study. In the 1970s this image was partially replaced by one which suggested that \"late capitalism\" was producing a generation of narcissists. Following a critique of both views, I report on a series of studies which throw a rather different light on developments in those two decades. Our data indicate that the \"liberated\" young people so praised in the 1960s were, in fact, the narcissists who were so disparaged in the 1970s. After discussing our findings, I attempt to place them in a broader historical and theoretical context.\n      </p>", "Production regime theory has been one of the most innovative and influential recent contributions to neo-institutional debates about the varieties of capitalism. This review takes issue with its claim that there are major differences in the quality of work between the two principal regime types that are held to characterize European societies\u2014coordinated market economies and liberal market economies\u2014by examining the evidence for Denmark, Finland, Germany, Sweden, and the UK. Although the broad pattern of skill differences corresponds reasonably well to the arguments of the theory, the evidence does not confirm the other claims about work and employment conditions, in particular with respect to employee job control, autonomous work teams, organizational participation, and job security. Rather, it points to the distinctiveness of the Scandinavian countries and hence to the importance of factors that lie outside the explanatory framework of the thesis.\n      </p>", "Indigenous knowledge (IK), experienced in development, is a product of a set of institutions often external to where they are located. The results of the use of IK in sustainable development are another example of capitalism's capacity to configure development according to its own imperatives. Rather than being an instrument of sustainable development, IK has become a means through which the diversity of knowledge systems and the embedded cultures in which they exist are disciplined and managed according to capital's need to expand. The collaborative role played by the nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in this process is obscured by their use of the seductive language of empowerment of marginalized social groups. NGOs' interventions run counter to the interests of the people they claim to serve. The challenge to work towards an alternative institutional environment that could liberate the use of IK from being determined by the ideology and institutions of capitalisms.\n      </p>", "Van Zanden's thesis that, in merchant capitalism, the remuneration of labor power is less than the reproduction costs of labor is correct It is correct, however, not just for a period called merchant capitalism but for all of historical capitalism. Indeed, to the extent that this statement ceases to be descriptive of the capitalist world-economy, capitalism as a system will no longer be able to survive. The commentary gives a number of examples of how van Zanden's complex and detailed treatment of the historical data concerning Holland (and its colonial appendages) would have been enriched and changed had he taken into account the patterns of the overall capitalist world-economy. A counter theory to his theory of merchant capitalism is presented, as well as a different account of Dutch history.\n      </p>", "The global corporate scandals such as Enron, Worldcom and Global Crossing have raised fundamental issues of business ethics as well as economic, social and anthropological questions concerning the nature of business competition and global capitalism. The purpose of this conceptual paper is to introduce the concept of \"welfare exchange\" to the existing notions of economic, social and anthropological notions of business and exchange in markets and society in the 21st century. Global competition and business success in the 21st century continue to raise the nature of economic value and the interaction among diverse actors in international markets, institutions and society. We believe that the nature of such exchange between consumers and organizations, which can also be termed social marketing, need to increasingly take into account a welfare and ethical component. In this paper, we introduce our concept of welfare exchange to emphasize the importance of such welfare and ethical issues in the global business environment of the 21st century.\n      </p>", "Cuba's history subsequent to Spanish colonization can be divided into 50 years of republican capitalist government and 50 years of socialist revolutionary government, with an intervening 7 years of dictatorship. The revolutionary period was the result of and grew from the first, capitalist, period, including the Batista dictatorship, within the larger context of the cold war. Immediately after coming to power, the revolution met a determined reaction from the United States, setting the stage for 50 years of struggle for its survival, with and without the support of the former Soviet bloc. Far from representing a static tableau of abstract capitalism versus socialism, relations between the two countries followed a tortuous map of events and changes around the world in which both were protagonists, each with victories and defeats. The essential merit of the revolution is to have survived for the past half century.\n      </p>"], "words": {"essay": {"number": 3, "prob": 2.4843794641193497e-05}, "concept": {"number": 3, "prob":
