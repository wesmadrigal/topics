Specifically, the paper describes the design and implementation of a model and computer system to address the complex short-term planning and operational issues associated with the supply, distribution, and marketing of refined petroleum products. This system has been successfully implemented at Citgo Petroleum Corporation. The benefits include a $116 million reduction (based on historical inventory-to-sales ratios) in product inventories resulting in a $14 million per year reduction in working capital costs and an additional $2.5 million per year estimated contribution to bottom line profits due to multiple supply, distribution, and marketing insights provided by the system.\n      </p>", "Nine refinery streams were tested in both chronic and initiation/promotion (I/P) skin bioassays. In the chronic bioassay, groups of 50 C3H/HeJ mice received twice weekly applications of 50 pli of test article for at least 2 years. In the initiation phase of the I/P bioassay, groups of CD-1 mice received an initiating dose of 50 \u03bcl of test article for 5 consecutive days, followed by promotion with 50 \u03bcl of phorbol-12-myristate-13- acetate (0.01% w/v in acetone) for 25 weeks. In the promotion phase of the I/P bioassay, CD-1 mice were initiated with 50 \u03bcl of 7,12- dimethylbenzanthracene (0.1% w/v in acetone) or acetone, followed by promotion with 50 \u03bcl of test article twice weekly for 25 weeks. The most volatile of the streams, sweetened naphtha, and the least volatile, vacuum residuum, were noncarcinogenic in both assays. Middle distillates, with a boiling range of 150\u00b0-370\u00b0C, demonstrated carcinogenic activity in the chronic bioassay and acted as promoters but not initiators in the I/P bioassay. Untreated mineral oil streams displayed initiating activity and were carcinogenic in the chronic bioassay, presumably due to the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons of requisite size and structure. A highly solvent-refined mineral oil stream lacked initiating activity. These results indicate that the I/P bioassay, which takes 6 months to complete, may be a good qualitative predictor of the results of a chronic bioassay, at least for petroleum streams. Furthermore, the I/P bioassay can provide insight into possible mechanisms of tumor development.\n      </p>", "Present and potential petroleum development in Alaska is directly related to public-policy issues. The Prudhoe Bay oil discovery signaled the need for determination of a transportation route to market. Pipeline location became a function of political boundaries, with an all-American route preferred. Actual pipeline construction was dependent on settlement of land claims with Alaska's indigenous peoples and the development of environmental safeguards. However, implicit in the U.S. Congressional decision to build the pipeline was acceptance that expanded human activity would impinge on northern Alaska's pristine wilderness and that there was probable risk of environmental damage. Another major public-policy decision was to allow construction of a pipeline for Prudhoe Bay natural gas. The problem that remains is uncertain economics; thus no Alaskan construction has occurred to date. Public policy also was advanced in windfall-profit taxation, and towards exploration and development of new petroleum areas. Each policy has generated conflict between state and federal governments and private groups, but overall public-policy decisions and related judicial actions continue to favor a development stance. This is likely to persist as long as U.S. national attention is drawn to the uncertainty of foreign sources for petroleum /// Le d\u00e9veloppement actuel et futur de l'industrie p\u00e9trolif\u00e8re en Alaska est directement reli\u00e9 \u00e0 questions de politique publique.

Cependant, la d\u00e9cision du Congr\u00e8s am\u00e9ricain ayant trait \u00e0 la construction du pipe-line acceptait le fait que la croissance dans l'activit\u00e9 humaine affecterait la nature vierge de l'Alaska et causerait sans doute quelque dommage \u00e0 l'environnement. Une autre d\u00e9cision majeure de politique publique entra\u00eenait la construction d'un gazoduc pour le gaz naturel de la baie Prudhoe.

The relative abundance of these acids suggests animal fats and vegetable oils as their sources. Concentrations of fatty acids ranged from 0.73 to 43.05 mg/l. Gas chromatographic analyses of hydrocarbons isolated from lipid extracts of effluents by column chromatography and thin layer chromatography indicate that petroleum hydrocarbons are discharged by two of the treatment plants studied. Hydrocarbon concentrations ranged from none detected for the effluent of one treatment plant to 16.2 mg/l for the effluent of another. These results confirm suggestions that significant amounts of petroleum hydrocarbons are discharged in effluents.\n      </p>", "Objectives\u2014To update mortality for 34 560 employees from diverse operating segments of a Canadian petroleum company; and to investigate potential relations with occupational factors. Methods\u2014Employees from 1964\u201383 were linked to the Canadian mortality data base to provide 11 years additional follow up. There were 6760 deaths and 750 683 person-years of follow up compared with 3909 and 428 190, respectively, in the earlier study. Analyses used standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) to compare worker cause specific mortality with the Canadian general population. Duration of employment and latency analyses were performed for causes previously found to be increased in this and other petroleum cohorts, as well as any findings of interest. Results\u2014For the period 1964\u201394, employees experienced significantly low overall mortality (SMR=0.86 men, SMR=0.80 women). Kidney cancer, which has been increased in some studies of petroleum workers, was not increased. Acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia in exposed operating segments was consistent with the expected or only slightly, non-significantly increased. The most notable finding was increased deaths from mesothelioma among refinery and petrochemical workers (SMR 8.68; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 5.51 to 13.03), most of whom were long term employees in jobs with presumed exposure to asbestos (mechanical and pipefitters). Deaths from multiple myeloma among marketing and distribution workers, which were previously increased, remained increased (SMR 2.08; 95% CI 0.95 to 3.95) in the update period 1984\u201394; however, there was no clear pattern by duration of employment or latency. Aortic aneurysms, which also were previously significantly increased among marketing and distribution workers approached the expected in the update period (SMR 1.18; 95% CI 0.65\u20131.98). Analyses by duration of employment showed suggestive trends for aortic aneurysms, but earlier studies of this cohort have not found a relation between aortic aneurysms and exposure to hydrocarbons. Conclusion\u2014The additional 2851 deaths and 322 493 person-years of follow up strengthened the assessment of mortality patterns relative to occupational factors. With the exception of mesothelioma, no clear work related increases in disease were identified.\n      </p>", "Municipal regulations often limit industrial fat, oil, and grease discharges to 100 mg/l without recognizing the difference between edible and petroleum oils. To document differences in biodegradability, the authors analyzed by direct measurement certain edible and petroleum oils. Various oils were then compared using the parameters thus derived for 5-day and ultimate biochemical oxygen demand $({\\rm BOD}_{5},{\\rm BOD}_{u})$ , chemical oxygen demand (COD), and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) rate constant (k). The experimental results also were compared to literature values used as indicators of biodegradability. The data generated demonstrate that edible oils are considerably more biodegradable than the literature previously had indicated.\n      </p>", "Petroleum products are distributed worldwide from refineries and lube plants to retail outlets and industrial customers. Proper dispatching of shipments of such products, packaged and in bulk, may result in significant transportation and inventory cost savings. This work examines the variety of operational environments which exist in dispatching petroleum products, and the operations research tools used by oil companies to dispatch such products. In addition, it identifies gaps where additional research is needed.\n      </p>", "During 1984 and 1985, Citgo Petroleum Corporation invested in management science applications that involve (1) a comprehensive combination of mathematical programming, statistics, forecasting, expert systems, artificial intelligence, organizational theory, and cognitive psychology; (2) the support of top management and operational managers; (3) the involvement of diverse business areas, including acquisitions, refining, supply and distribution, market planning, accounts receivable and payable, inventory control, and individual performance objectives; (4) timely project development and implementation; and (5) integration of information systems and management science technologies, multiplying the potentials of each. These applications have changed the way Citgo does business and resulted in approximately $70 million per year profit improvement.\n      </p>", "Much of the rapid increases in the price of crude oil during two of the last three supply shocks has been attributed to increased private inventory demand stimulated by the expectation of speculative profits. Government intervention in any future disruption is likely to take the form of releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). Given that the SPR accounts for but a small fraction of U.S. oil inventories, the reaction of the private sector is critical in evaluating its impact. We incorporate inventory behavior in a model of the world oil market, which is then linked to a short-run macroeconometric model of the U.S. economy. Our model simulations support the view that substantial inventory accumulation accompanies a supply disruption. In the debate over whether the SPR is potentially a potent or impotent resource in an emergency, we lean toward potency. Our model suggests that public releases will not be absorbed in private stockpiles; indeed, their dampening price effects will serve, albeit slightly, to discourage speculative stock build.\n      </p>", "Background: Few studies have examined the association between home use of solvents and paint and the risk of childhood leukemia. Objectives: In this case-control study, we examined whether the use of paint and petroleum solvents at home before birth and in early childhood influenced the risk of leukemia in children. Methods: We based our analyses on 550 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 100 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and one or two controls per case individually matched for sex, age, Hispanic status, and race. We conducted further analyses by cytogenetic subtype. We used conditional logistic regression techniques to adjust for income. Results: ALL risk was significantly associated with paint exposure [odds ratio (OR) = 1.65; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.26-2.15], with a higher risk observed when paint was used postnatally, by a person other than the mother, or frequently. The association was restricted to leukemia with translocations between chromosomes 12 and 21 (OR = 4.16; 95% CI, 1.66-10.4). We found no significant association between solvent use and ALL risk overall (OR = 1.15; 95% CI, 0.87-1.51) or for various cytogenetic subtypes, but we observed a significant association in the 2.0- to 5.9-year age group (OR = 1.55; 95% CI, 1.07-2.25). In contrast, a significant increased risk for AML was associated with solvent (OR = 2.54; 95% CI, 1.19-5.42) but not with paint exposure (OR = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.32-1.25). Conclusions: The association of ALL risk with paint exposure was strong, consistent with a causal relationship, but further studies are needed to confirm the association of ALL and AML risk with solvent exposure.\n      </p>", "Determining the complete molecular composition of petroleum and its refined products is not feasible with current analytical techniques because of the astronomical number of molecular components. Modeling the composition and behavior of such complex mixtures in refinery processes has accordingly evolved along a simplifying concept called lumping. Lumping reduces the complexity of the problem to a manageable form by grouping the entire set of molecular components into a handful of lumps. This traditional approach does not have a molecular basis and therefore excludes important aspects of process chemistry and molecular property fundamentals from the model's formulation. A new approach called structure-oriented lumping has been developed to model the composition and chemistry of complex mixtures at a molecular level. The central concept is to represent an individual molecule or a set of closely related isomers as a mathematical construct of certain specific and repeating structural groups. A complex mixture such as petroleum can then be represented as thousands of distinct molecular components, each having a mathematical identity. This enables the automated construction of large complex reaction networks with tens of thousands of specific reactions for simulating the chemistry of complex mixtures. Further, the method provides a convenient framework for incorporating molecular physical property correlations, existing group contribution methods, molecular thermodynamic properties, and the structure-activity relationships of chemical kinetics in the development of models.\n      </p>", "Storm runoff effluent from a shopping mall parking lot was monitored for petroleum hydrocarbons and suspended solids during six storms over a 10-month period. The load of suspended solids (SS) and petroleum hydrocarbons in urban runoff varies widely during the progress of a storm. The highest concentrations and loads of SS and hydrocarbons in each storm are associated with the first major peak in flow rate, the first flush. Upon integration of the loads over time, a total hydrocarbon and SS load was calculated for each storm. The loading relationship was essentially linear with total rainfall, implying that the supply of solids available for incorporation in the runoff had not been exhausted in storms up to 4.06 cm (1.60 in.). There are indications, however, that the supply of hydrocarbons may be approaching a limit in storms greater than 4.82 cm (1.90 in.) of rainfall. The petroleum hydrocarbons were largely associated with particulate material, and the particulate fraction of the hydrocarbons accounted for 83 to 93% of the total. Hydrocarbons associated with these particles accounted for 1.7 to 3.3% of the total mass of the solids.\n      </p>", "Petroleum refinery wastewaters vary in characteristics and may present numerous treating problems depending on the types of refining units involved. Seldom will two refineries present identical problems. For this reason, complete package treatment units are impractical and each refinery will require a custom-designed wastewater treatment system. To design such a system, the problems must first be defined and evaluated before an approach to a solution can be made. Definition can be accomplished by surveys which produce significant data which may be used not only for problem definition but for problem evaluation as well. Results of these surveys will point to an approach to the solution of the problems and usually indicate the successful treatment process to be employed. A case history of one petroleum refinery is presented, describing the methods used to define, evaluate and resolve the problems encountered in designing and fabricating the wastewater treating system.\n      </p>", "Objectives\u2014To investigate the risk of leukaemia in workers in the petroleum distribution industry who were exposed to low levels of benzene. Methods\u2014From the cohort of distribution workers, 91 cases were identified as having leukaemia on either a death certificate or on cancer registration. These cases were compared with controls (four per case) randomly selected from the cohort, who were from the same company as the respective case, matched for age, and alive and under follow up at the time of case occurrence. Work histories were collected for the cases and controls, together with information about the terminals at which they had worked, fuel compositions, and occupational hygiene measurements of benzene. These data were used to derive quantitative estimates of personal exposure to benzene. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated conditional on the matching, to identify those variables in the study which were associated with risk of leukaemia. Examination of the potential effects of confounding and other variables was carried out with conditional logistic regression. Analyses were carried out for all leukaemia and separately for acute lymphoblastic, chronic lymphocytic, acute myeloid and monocytic, and chronic myeloid leukaemias. Results\u2014There was no significant increase in the overall risk of all leukaemias with higher cumulative exposure to benzene or with intensity of exposure, but risk was consistently doubled in subjects employed in the industry for &gt; 10 years. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia tended to occur in workers employed after 1950, who started work after the age of 30, worked for a short duration, and experienced low cumulative exposure with few peaks. The ORs did not increase with increasing cumulative exposure. The risk of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia seemed to be related most closely to duration of employment and the highest risk occurred in white collar workers with long service. These workers had only background levels of benzene exposure. There was no evidence of an association of risk with any exposure variables, and no evidence of an increasing risk with increasing cumulative exposure, mean intensity, or maximum intensity of exposure. The patterns of risk for acute myeloid and monocytic leukaemia were different from those of the lymphoid subgroups, in which duration of employment was the variable most closely related to risk. Risk was increased to an OR of 2\u00b78 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0\u00b78 to 9\u00b74) for a cumulative exposure between 4\u00b75 and 45 ppm-years compared with &lt; 0\u00b745 ppm-years. For mean intensity between 0\u00b72 and 0\u00b74 ppm an OR of 2\u00b78 (95% CI 0\u00b79 to 8\u00b75) was found compared with &lt; 0\u00b702 ppm. Risk did not increase with cumulative exposure, maximum intensity, or mean intensity of exposure when treated as continuous variables. Cases of acute myeloid and monocytic leukaemia were more often classified as having peaked exposures than controls, and when variables characterising peaks, particularly daily and weekly peaks, were included in the analysis these tended to dominate the other exposure variables. However, because of the small numbers it is not possible to distinguish the relative influence of peaked and unpeaked exposures on risk of acute myeloid and monocytic leukaemia. There was no evidence of an increased risk of chronic myeloid leukaemia with increases in cumulative exposure, maximum intensity, mean intensity, and duration of employment, either as continuous or categorical variables. Analyses exploring the sensitivity of the results to the source and quality of the work histories showed similar patterns in general. However, no increases in ORs for categories of cumulative exposure were found for acute myeloid and monocytic leukaemia in the data set which included work histories obtained from personnel records still in existence, although numbers were reduced. Analyses excluding the last five and 10 years of exposure showed a tendency for ORs to reduce for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and chronic myeloid leukaemia, and to increase for acute myeloid and monocytic leukaemia. Limitations of the study include uncertainties and gaps in the information collected, and small numbers in subcategories of exposure which can lead to wide CIs around the risk estimates and poor fit of the mathematical models. Conclusions\u2014There is no evidence in this study of an association between exposure to benzene and lymphoid leukaemia, either acute or chronic. There is some suggestion of a relation between exposure to benzene and myeloid leukaemia, in particular for acute myeloid and monocytic leukaemia. Peaked exposures seemed to be experienced for this disease. However, in view of the limitations of the study, doubt remains as to whether the risk of acute myeloid and monocytic leukaemia is increased by cumulative exposures of &lt; 45 ppm-years. Further work is recommended to review the work histories and redefine their quality, to explore the discrepancies between results for categorical and continuous variables, and to develop ranges around the exposure estimates to enable further sensitivity analyses to be carried out.\n      </p>", "Weekly samples from four wastewater treatment facilities discharging into Jamaica Bay were analyzed for the presence of waste crankcase petroleum products. Two novel ultraviolet-fluorescence spectroscopic techniques were utilized to exhibit qualitatively the presence of waste automotive petroleum hydrocarbons in each of the final effluents of water pollution control plants by comparison of sample \"profiles\" to \"profiles\" generated by standard oils. The surface waters and a benthic organism (Mya arenaria) residing in Jamaica Bay were also analyzed for petroleum hydrocarbons using these techniques. Ultraviolet-fluorescence spectroscopic analyses furnished dramatic evidence for the presence of a significant quantity of hydrocarbons associated with waste petroleum products in all samples collected. Gas chromatographic and mass spectroscopic analyses indicate petroleum contamination of mollusks.\n      </p>", "Mobil Oil Corporation consolidates and dispatches truck shipments of heavy petroleum products-lubricants in packages and in bulk-from 10 lubricant plants nationwide. It dispatches hundreds of orders daily either individually or as consolidated truckloads, using a very nonhomogeneous fleet of Mobil-controlled and contract vehicles and common carriers. Shipment schedules may span several days and include stops to pick up returned drums or entire trailers. Shipping costs depend upon the vehicle used, the shipment size, the locations of the stops, and the route distance and time. Candidate consolidations are generated automatically or with dispatcher assistance. Then, the dispatcher uses optimization to select a minimal-cost set of schedules. Mobil has been using this system for three years, reducing annual transportation costs by about $1 million (US).\n      </p>", "This study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between leukemia occurrence and long-term, low-level benzene exposures in petroleum distribution workers. Fourteen cases were identified among a previously studied cohort [Schnatter et al., Environ Health Perspect 101(Suppl 6):85-99 (1993)]. Four controls per case were selected from the same cohort, controlling for birth year and time at risk. Industrial hygienists estimated workplace exposures for benzene, without knowledge of case-control status. Average benzene concentrations ranged from 0.01 to 6.2 ppm. Company medical records were used to abstract information on other potential confounders such as cigarette smoking. Odds ratios were calculated for several exposure metrics. Conditional logistic regression modeling was used to control for potential confounders. The risk of leukemia was not associated with increasing cumulative exposure to benzene for these exposure levels. Duration of benzene exposure was more closely associated with leukemia risk than other exposure metrics, although results were not statistically significant. A family history of cancer and cigarette smoking were the two strongest risk factors for leukemia, with cumulative benzene exposure showing no additional risk when considered in the same models. This study is consistent with other data in that it was unable to demonstrate a relationship between leukemia and long-term, low-level benzene exposures. The power of the study was limited. Thus, further study on benzene exposures in this concentration range are warranted.\n      </p>", "Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and petroleum products are ubiquitous groundwater contaminants. Petroleum products, for example, diesel fuel, contain a wide array of volatile, semivolatile, and large-chain hydrocarbon compounds. This research sought to determine whether air stripping can provide a site-specific treatment solution for petroleum-contaminated groundwaters and to document the abilities and limitations of tray-type (ShallowTray\u2122) air-stripping technology. Full factorial experimental trials were conducted to determine the influence of inlet water flow rate and temperature on trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE), and total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) removal. As expected, TPH removal controlled air stripper performance, and liquid temperature affected removal more than flow rate. The mass-transfer rate of TCE and PCE from water to air was controlled by the compound's volatility, whereas the TPH mass-transfer rate was controlled by the compound's concentration gradient. Results indicate that economical air stripping of VOC and TPH compounds can be achieved using low liquid flow rates (20 to 75 L/min), high air/water ratios (225 to 898), and medium liquid temperatures (16\u00b0C to 28\u00b0C) in tray-type air strippers.\n      </p>", "Petroleum exploration managers must allocate scarce resources across a set of risky and uncertain investment alternatives. We developed a decision analysis software package, DISCOVERY, that provided an exploration division of Phillips Petroleum Company an alternative means of evaluating a mix of risky investments and selecting participation levels consistent with the firm's risk propensity. Managers at Phillips use the software to (1) evaluate projects with a consistent risk-taking policy, (2) rank projects in terms of overall preference, (3) identify the firm's appropriate level of participation, and (4) stay within their division budgets. This approach increased management's awareness of risk and risk tolerance and provided insight into the relative financial risks associated with its available investment opportunities. As a result of this project, the company has developed consistent methods of risk analysis that include companywide analysis of all exploration projects.\n      </p>", "As part of Turkey's efforts to position itself to join the European Economic Community before the end of the century, the Turkish Petroleum Refineries Corporation (TUPRAS) is seeking to upgrade the specifications of her domestically refined petroleum products to approach and ultimately match the specifications that will be in effect throughout Europe. TUPRAS also seeks to increase production of refined products to try to keep pace with increasing domestic demand. Significant capital investment over the next 15 years will be required to attain these goals. TUPRAS senior management commissioned us to develop mathematical programming models for studying their strategic investment options, to exercise the models in performing an extensive analysis of the options, and to transfer to TUPRAS a decision support system based on the models for continuing analysis. The system is used by TUPRAS to analyze capital investments worth tens of millions of dollars.\n      </p>", "We investigated the population dynamics of the endangered San Joaquin kit fox (Vulpes macrotis mutica) and factors that influence kit fox demographics at the Naval Petroleum Reserves in California (NPRC) during 1980-95. Kit fox abundance varied widely during this period and population estimates on a $216\\text{-}{\\rm km}^{2}$ study area ranged from 46 ( $0.21/{\\rm km}^{2}$ ) in 1991 to 363 ( $1.68/{\\rm km}^{2}$ ) in 1994. The finite rate of increase (\u03bb) ranged from 0.37 in 1995 to 2.22 in 1993. Of 341 adult and 184 juvenile foxes radiocollared, we recovered 225 and 142 dead, respectively. Mean annual survival rate for adults was 0.44 (range = 0.20-0.81) and the mean rate for juveniles from 1 May to 15 February (age 1) was 0.14 (range = &lt;0.01-0.31). Coyotes (Canis latrans) and other predators were the primary source of mortality for adult and juvenile foxes, and vehicles were a secondary source. Mean annual reproductive success (proportion of females observed with pups in Apr-May) was 61% (range = 20-100%) for adults and 18% (range = 0-100%) for juveniles. Mean annual litter size was 3.8 and varied from 2.0 to 4.8. Population growth rates varied positively with reproductive success (P = 0.041), and both juvenile reproductive success and the proportion of new individuals were higher (P = 0.001 and P = 0.100) when the fox population was increasing. Leporids and kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spp.) were important foods for kit foxes, and annual use of foods by kit foxes varied markedly during the study. Kit fox density was positively related to both current and previous year's composite prey indices (P = 0.001 and P = 0.067). Finite growth rates were positively related to rodent indices (P = 0.085) and current year's composite prey indices (P = 0.084). Rodent abundance and composite prey indices were strongly related to previous year's effective (Oct-Mar) precipitation (P = 0.002 and P = 0.003), as were kit fox density (P = 0.021) and \u03bb estimates (P = 0.002). A step-wise multiple regression model that included precipitation totals from the previous 3 years as independent variables explained 79% (P &lt; 0.001) of the annual variation in fox abundance. Survival of adult kit foxes was negatively related to abundance of both coyotes (P = 0.046) and leporids (the primary prey of coyotes; P = 0.031). However, fox and coyote abundance generally tracked each other, and neither kit fox abundance nor survival increased during a coyote control program conducted during 1985-90. We did not find strong evidence that oilfield activities were impacting kit foxes at NPRC. Fox abundance was significantly lower in oil-developed areas than in undeveloped areas during 6 of 13 years (P &lt; 0.006). However, population trends of foxes appeared to be affected more by natural factors (e.g., food availability, competitor abundance) than oilfield activities. Kit fox population trends on NPRC appeared to be driven by precipitation-mediated prey abundance. Variation in prey availability, particularly kangaroo rats, produced significant and sometimes rapid changes in kit fox demographics and abundance. Kit fox abundance in the southern San Joaquin Valley is highly dynamic, warranting (1) conservation of sufficient habitat to maintain viable populations of foxes through population lows, and (2) research on management strategies to optimize habitat quality, particularly prey abundance.\n      </p>", "This paper demonstrates the feasibility of applying generalized reduced gradient nonlinear programming methods to solve optimal control models for petroleum reservoir development planning and management. The objective of the models is to maximize present value of profits, and their decision variables are how many wells to drill in each time period, the production rates, abandonment time, and platform size. The analysis uses tank-type reservoir models to describe the reservoir dynamics, and models both a gas reservoir with water drive, and a three phase oil reservoir. Results of several case studies on each model are presented. Extensions that consider spatial variation in the reservoir and use grid reservoir models are being investigated.\n      </p>", "After the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 mandated early retirement for all large single-hulled vessels that carry petroleum and petroleum products, Maritrans' stock lost 80 percent of its value. Through a sequence of studies, Maritrans improved its understanding of its market and developed a strategy for rebuilding its single-hulled fleet and dealing with a further threat to its profitability from a government program of loan guarantees to build new ships. We demonstrated to the US Maritime Administration that giving out loan guarantees would lead to excess capacity and depressed rates and to government expenditures to cover loan losses. Maritrans backed off from operating petroleum-product terminals after we showed that it would not gain synergies with marine transportation. Combining the models for these two studies, we modeled the marine-transportation market for the eastern United States and developed an integrated strategy for rebuilding the Gulf Coast fleet. Maritrans announced its new strategy in 1997 and its stock almost doubled, reaching levels not seen since the Oil Pollution Act was passed.\n      </p>", "A highly automated, real-time dispatch system is described which uses embedded optimization routines to replace extensive manual operations and to reduce substantially operating costs for a nation-wide fleet of petroleum tank trucks. The system is currently used in daily operations by the Order Entry and Dispatch segment of the Chevron U.S.A. Marketing System. Refined petroleum products valued at several billion dollars per year are dispatched from more than 80 bulk terminals on a fleet exceeding 300 vehicles in approximately 2600 loads per day. Centralized use of the dispatch system required its design and implementation as a set of transaction modules within a large management information system. This environment presents special challenges for the optimization methods; an heuristic sequential network assignment was developed for certified performance on these dispatch models in lieu of their solution as integer programs. Objectives include minimizing transportation costs (approaching $100 million annually) while maintaining equitable man and equipment workload distribution, safety standards, and customer service, and satisfying equipment compatibility restrictions.\n      </p>", "The effects of a petroleum slick and chemically dispersed petroleum on bacterial numbers and microheterotrophic activity (uptake of glutamic acid by heterotrophic microorganisms) were monitored in the water column and sediments of selected bays at Cape Hatt, Northwest Territories. Observations were made between 1980 and 1983 as a component study of the Baffin Island Oil Spill(BIOS)Project. These data were augmented by measurements ofchlorophyll a, particulate and dissolved organic carbon and inorganic nutrients in the water column, while total organic carbon(TOC)was measured in the sediments in some years.Petroleum was released on two occasions in 1981. In the first release, nondispersed petroleum moved across the surface of test Bay 11 and adhered to the intertidal sediments atlow tide. No significant effects were seen in chemical or microbiological variables measured in 1981 or 1982. During the second release in 1981, dispersed petroleum was carriedby the current through the water of test Bays 9 and 10 and into the channel beyond. Measurements of $V_{\\max } $ (maximum velocity) of glutamic acid uptakein water samples taken in these bays during the release showed a transient decrease in $V_{\\max } $ compared with control Bay 7. Bacterial numbers were unaffected, as were variables measured in the sediment of test Bays 9 and 10 during and after the release. In vitro experiments with water samples demonstrated that a combinationof petroleum and dispersant or dispersant alone reduced the $V_{\\max } $ of glutamic acid uptake to a greater extent than petroleum alone. A bay-year analysis of variance between 1981 and 1982 demonstrated that TOC and bacterial numbers increased in the sediments of test Bay 9 over 1981, while the $V_{\\max } $of glutamic acid uptake remained constant. In control Bay 7 and test Bay 11, all variables decreased over 1981 except TOC in Bay 11. In 1983, trends in the sediments of Bay 9 were similar to those of Bay 7. In test Bay 11, petroleum beached on the intertidal zone in 1981 was observed entering subtidal sediments between 1981 and 1983 and forming a decreasing gradation of petroleum concentrations from nearshore to offshore areas. TOC increased between 1982 and 1983. Microheterotrophic activity remained constant in Bay 11, although it decreased in Bays 9 and 7. Bacterial numbers increased in Bay 11 but decreasedin Bays 9 and 7. It was concluded that the changes in Bay 9 in 1982 and in Bay 11 in 1983 were a consequence of perturbations by petroleum. Effects on the benthic macrofauna and flora increased the levels of detritus, and hence TOC, in the sediments. This caused changes in bacterial numbers and microheterotrophic activity. /// A Cape Hatt, T.N.-O., certaines baies ont \u00e9t\u00e9 choisies pour y mesurer les effets produits par une nappe de p\u00e9trole ou du p\u00e9trole dispers\u00e9 chimiquement, sur le nombre de bact\u00e9ries et l'activit\u00e9 microh\u00e9t\u00e9rotrophe (incorporation de l'acide glutamique par les microorganismes), dans la colonne d'eau et les s\u00e9diments.

Des exp\u00e9riences effectu\u00e9es in vitro sur des \u00e9chantillons d'eau, ont montr\u00e9 qu'un m\u00e9lange de p\u00e9trole et de dispersant ou le dispersant seul, r\u00e9duisaient davantage le $V_{\\max } $ d'incorporation de l'acide glutamique que le p\u00e9trole seul. Une analyse de variance baie-ann\u00e9e effectu\u00e9e sur les donn\u00e9es de 1981 et 1982 a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le TOC et le nombre de bact\u00e9ries ont augment\u00e9 par rapport \u00e0 l'ann\u00e9e 1981 dans les s\u00e9diments de la baie exp\u00e9rimentale 9 alors que le $V_{\\max } $ d'incorporation de l'acide glutamique est demeur\u00e9 constant. Dans la baie de contr\u00f4le 7 et dans la baie exp\u00e9rimentale 11, tous les param\u00e8tres, sauf le TOC dans la baie 11, ont diminu\u00e9 comparativement \u00e0 l'ann\u00e9e 1981. En 1983, les tendances dans les s\u00e9diments de la baie 9 \u00e9taient semblables \u00e0 celles observ\u00e9es dans la baie 7. Entre 1981 et 1983, on a pu observer que le p\u00e9trole, \u00e9chou\u00e9 sur la zone intertidale de la baie exp\u00e9rimentale 11 en 1981, p\u00e9n\u00e9trait les s\u00e9diments de la zone infratidale et formait un gradient d\u00e9croissant de concentrations de p\u00e9trole de la c\u00f4te vers le large. Dans la baie exp\u00e9rimentale 11, le TOC s'est accru entre 1982 et 1983.

Addition of various culture medium ingredients can be optimized to produce maximum cell yield or maximum acid production. The addition of the thiolignin Indulin C has been found to make kerosene more readily available to the organism, and thus the organism growth rate and acid production can be plotted as a function of kerosene concentration. Addition of Indulin C creates a stable emulsion that overcomes the problem of continuous removal of a two-phase system from the fermenter. Use of lignin to improve the rate of hydrocarbon utilization in petroleum waste treatment is suggested.\n      </p>", "In 1920, a drilling team funded by Imperial Oil discovered a petroleum deposit along the shore of the Mackenzie River north of the settlement of Fort Norman. This wilderness site later became the community of Norman Wells and its growth has been directly attributable to petroleum. The current expansion of production at Norman Wells is aimed at southern Canadian markets and a pipeline is being constructed from Norman Wells to existing pipelines in northern Alberta. As the focal point of this major resource expansion, the character, size, and functions of the community are changing. These changes are transforming Norman Wells into an important regional center. /// En 1920, une \u00e9quipe de forage financ\u00e9e par Imperial Oil d\u00e9couvrit un gisement p\u00e9trolif\u00e8re le long de la c\u00f4te de la rivi\u00e8re Mackenzie au nord du village de Fort Norman.

Global petroleum production is expected to reach a maximum in the near future and to decline thereafter, a phenomenon known as \"peak petroleum.\" This article reviews petroleum geology and uses, describes the phenomenon of peak petroleum, and reviews the scientific literature on the timing of this transition. It then discusses how peak petroleum may affect public health and health care, by reference to four areas: medical supplies and equipment, transportation, energy generation, and food production. Finally, it suggests strategies for anticipating and preparing for peak petroleum, both general public health preparedness strategies and actions specific to the four expected health system impacts.\n      </p>", "This paper presents some of the results from the Commission of the European Communities collaborative research program (contract number EV5V-CT92-0221), whose aim is to investigate the relationship between exposure to petroleum emissions, benzene, and induction of genetic damage in human cells. Twenty-four workers from petroleum plants in Poland and 35 unexposed controls were examined for cytogenetic effects and ras oncoprotein levels and their relationship to confounding factors (e.g., smoking habit, sex, family cancer history, and seasonal influence). Preliminary data of chromosome aberrations (CA) and sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) showed differences among sampling subgroups. In this present study, the levels of ras p21 proteins were determined and further analyses of CA, SCE, high frequency cells (HFC), and proliferative rate index (PRI) have been undertaken. Results show that the exposed group has statistically significant increases in CA, and percent of aberrant cells. There were no differences between exposed and unexposed groups in SCE, HFC, PRI, or the levels of ras p21 proteins. Smoking was found to statistically significantly affect levels of CA, percent of aberrant cells, SCE, HFC, and ras proteins. Sister chromatid exchanges were also statistically significantly sex dependent (7.5 breaks/cell for females and 6.8 breaks/cell for males). There were no statistically significant differences for CA, percent aberrant cells, SCE, HFC, or ras p21 protein levels in subgroups characterized according to cancer cases reported in the immediate family. A seasonal variability was shown with statistically significant increases in various biomarkers in the winter. Unexposed groups also showed increases due to smoking and season. The nonsmoking group individuals also showed statistically significant increases in cytogenetic damage with exposure.\n      </p>", "We developed a simple model to help Transport Canada identify promising avenues for R&amp;D projects to make rail or truck transport of liquefied petroleum gases (LPGs) safer and to determine the economic merits of proposals submitted to the department for funding under its Energy Transport R&amp;D Program. The model computes expected net benefits for proposed R&amp;D projects from estimates of R&amp;D costs, potential effects on LPG release rates and consequences, and unit costs of incorporating the R&amp;D results in new and existing rail tank cars and tank trucks. The model accounts for the possibility that the R&amp;D effort may be unsuccessful, and that if successful, the results may not be adopted. The methodology demonstrated that funding for two suggested R&amp;D areas was not economically justified and narrowed attention to two categories of R&amp;D projects.\n      </p>", "This paper considers the regulation of pricing of liquid petroleum gas in Mexico. We construct a model that incorporates all information essential to the pricing question and derive relationships that should hold between prices in Mexico and prices in world markets. Prices in Mexico can be tied to the readily observable prices in the United States by a netback rule. However, this rule can lead to incentives to increase the price of domestic liquid petroleum gas by diverting production from the regulated market.\n      </p>", "Woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) in northeastern Alberta apparently have declined and are classified as endangered. Petroleum exploration has been implicated as a possible cause. We examined the effects of simulated petroleum exploration (i.e., loud noise) on caribou movement and behavior. We monitored 5 (1993) and 20 (1994) radiocollared caribou during 3 periods (pretest, test, and post-test) over 2 treatments (exposed and control). Exposed caribou moved significantly faster than control caribou (2.3 \u00b1 0.2 SE vs. 1.6 km/hr \u00b1 0.1), but not significantly farther. Exposed caribou crossed habitat boundaries significantly more than did controls (0.53 \u00b1 0.16 vs. 0.27 changes/period \u00b1 0.14). Disturbance did not affect significantly the proportion of time allocated to feeding. Treatment caribou demonstrated higher overall movement rates in 1993 than 1994 (2.7 \u00b1 0.2 vs. 1.7 km/hr \u00b1 0.1), displacement (3.5 \u00b1 1.3 vs. 2.3 km \u00b1 0.6), and more time allocated to feeding (27.5 \u00b1 2.9 vs. 9.0% \u00b1 1.7). Habitat boundaries crossed did not differ significantly between years. We suggest that increased movement may result in higher energy expenditure during winter, and that disturbed caribou may switch habitat type for cover or escape terrain. We believe that differences in movement between years resulted from higher snow depths in 1994. We also suggest that land-use managers should limit total disturbance during winter rather than mitigate industrial activity with timing restrictions.\n      </p>", "Powdered activated carbon (PAC) can be added to activated sludge processes with a variety of potential benefits. Improved ammonia removal is an unexpected benefit because ammonia is normally not adsorbed by activated carbon. To investigate the mechanism of improved ammonia removal, a series of batch and continuous experiments were conducted on synthetic and petroleum refinery wastewaters. Petroleum refinery wastewater was selected because it is often difficult to nitrify. Results suggest that adsorption of nitrification-inhibiting compounds is the primary mechanism; no evidence of improved nitrifier growth caused by the presence of increased suspended solids was found. The results also suggest that heterotrophic acclimation to the nitrification inhibitors, resulting in improved inhibitor removal, is as important to continued high nitrification efficiency as PAC addition in low concentration.\n      </p>", "This paper describes basic principles underlying the methodology for obtaining quantitative estimates of benzene exposure in the petroleum marketing and distribution industry. Work histories for 91 cases of leukemia and 364 matched controls (4 per case) identified for a cohort of oil distribution workers up to the end of 1992 were obtained, primarily from personnel records. Information on the distribution sites, more than 90% of which were closed at the time of data collection, was obtained from site visits and archive material. Industrial hygiene measurements measured under known conditions were assembled for different tasks. These were adjusted for conditions where measured data were not available using variables known to influence exposure, such as temperature, technology, percentage of benzene in fuel handled, products handled, number of loads, and job activity. A quantitative estimate of dermal contact and peak exposure was also made.\n      </p>", "Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) collected in the Houston Ship Channel, Texas, USA, in November shortly after their fall migration contained residues of several industrial, agricultural, and petroleum contaminants including polychlorinated styrenes (PCS's), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's), DDE, and petroleum hydrocarbons. PCS concentrations in over-wintering birds collected in late February were three times higher than those in birds collected in November. PCB and petroleum concentrations remained at about the same level throughout the 3-month winter period. Petroleum hydrocarbons were present in all cormorants and residues in some individuals exceeded 25 ppm (wet weight). Mean DDE residues in samples collected in November and February were less than 1 ppm. Low concentrations of five other organochlorine compounds, not detected in cormorants collected in November, were recovered in birds collected in February. The frequency of occurrence of dieldrin and HCB increased from November to February although maximum levels remained below 0.3 ppm. All cormorants collected in fall had moderate amounts of fat, but only 3 of 10 birds collected in spring had similar fat reserves.\n      </p>", "The petroleum recovery process has two potential phases: primary recovery, during which the natural drive forces the oil to the well bore, and secondary recovery, during which a producer uses artificial means to recover the resource. A producer may choose to switch from primary to secondary recovery if the desired ultimate output is more than can be obtained by exploiting the natural drive, or when the desired current extraction rate is larger than can be obtained by the natural drive. These decisions are affected by the interaction between geological, technical and market conditions. We formulate an investment and production model that incorporates the relationships between extraction rates, investment decisions and cumulative recovery, and investigate a two-phase dynamic optimization problem. We do so by defining and analyzing a more general optimization problem and applying the results to our model. The major findings relate to the timing and size of investment, the rate and duration of secondary recovery, and the optimal switching policies from primary to secondary recovery. We discuss each of these issues in detail, and outline and explain quantitative policy recommendations.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Consequently, American petroleum companies have made substantial investments in Middle Eastern countries. This investment has been faced with many uncertainties, but it has averaged a return of 65.6 percent. U.S. investment in the Middle East averaged only 2.5 percent of worldwide investments, but it has generated 19.7 percent of income during the period under study.

Sethoxydim responses to salts have not been consistent, and the inconsistency is not completely understood. Experiments were conducted in the greenhouse to determine sethoxydim phytotoxicity to oat as influenced by salts in the spray carrier and by air temperature at and immediately after application as they alter the spray deposit characteristics. Thick amorphous spray deposits were related to ineffective sethoxydim-petroleum oil adjuvant treatments applied alone at 10 C or with bentazon at 10 or 25 C. Also, thin deposits with salt residues were related to ineffective sethoxydim treatments, as when sodium bicarbonate was present. Ammonium sulfate reduced or overcame antagonism of sethoxydim phytotoxicity caused by low temperature, bentazon, and sodium bicarbonate and gave thin deposits having close contact with the leaf epicuticular surface but without obvious salt deposits. UV light antagonism of sethoxydim phytotoxicity was different depending on temperature at and shortly after application and depending on salts in the spray mixture. The results indicate that salts in a bentazon spray carrier are in part antagonistic because of their effect on final spray deposit.\n      </p>", "Studies on the effects of anthropogenic contamination on wildlife have largely been focused at the individual level. Biomarkers have been used to monitor changes in the health of individuals exposed to contaminants; however, little attention has been given to the effects of chronic exposure at the population or community levels. We studied rodent assemblages from uncontaminated (reference) sites (n = 5) and abandoned petrochemical landfarms (n = 5) in Oklahoma to investigate potential alterations in community structure and composition. Rodent assemblages inhabiting landfarms had lower species diversity, lower richness, and a more even distribution of individuals across species. Reference sites showed typical rodent assemblage structure dominated by hispid cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) and fulvous harvest mice (Reithrodontomys fulvescens). Assemblages inhabiting landfarms also were dominated by cotton rats; however, harvest mice were replaced by deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) on two landfarms. Contaminated sites also were characterized by an increase in house mice (Mus musculus) and an absence of voles (Microtus spp.). Although landfarms tended to have lower cotton rat densities, we could not separate the effects of contamination from increased bare ground associated with landfarms. The results of this study suggest that rodent assemblages were different on landfarms, when compared with reference sites.

Methods\u2014Work histories were obtained for cases and controls together with detailed information on the distribution sites. For each job in the work hisotry, an estimate of exposure (parts per million (ppm)) was obtained by multiplying a measure derived from exposure data by modifying factors to reflect the differences between the conditions that existed at the time of measurement and those at the time of interest. The modifying factors used related to job activity, the number of road tankers loaded, the benzene content of the gasoline, the mixture of products handled, temperature, and loading technology. Cumulative exposures for each case and control were obtained by multiplying the exposure estimates for each job by the duration of time in the respective jobs, and summing these over all jobs in the work history. Peak exposure and exposure through dermal contact were quantitatively classified for each job. Results\u2014Measured exposures were obtained for 30 job categories, and ranged from 0\u00b7003 to 8\u00b720 ppm. 40% of work histories were assigned background exposures, with a further 34% assigned the exposure estimate for a driver carrying out top submerged loading of motor fuel into road tankers. Cumulative exposures ranged from &lt;1 to &gt;200 ppm-years, although 81% were &lt;5 ppm-years. Comparison of the exposure estimates for selected jobs with data from sources not used in the study showed similar results. Conclusion\u2014The estimates of exposure to benzene in this study provide a sound basis for the epidemiological analyses.\n      </p>", "Contamination of individual wells in rural areas from leaking petroleum storage tanks poses unique problems for regulatory agencies, utilities, and potentially responsible parties. A potential solution is the use of point-of-entry (POE) treatment techniques. Results indicate POE systems using aeration followed by granular activated carbon (GAC) are a viable, cost effective, short-term solution while ground water remediation is performed or an alternate drinking water supply is secured. Selection and design of POE systems should consider variations in water usage and contaminant concentrations. Iron and manganese did not affect POE system performance at the ten sites studied. However, iron precipitation was observed and may pose problems in some POE applications. Increased concentrations of nonpurgeable dissolved organic carbon consisting primarily of methy-t-butyl ether (MTBE) and hydrophilic petroleum hydrocarbons were found in the raw waters but did not affect volatile organic chemical (VOC) removals by aeration or GAC. Microbial activity as measured by heterotrophic plate count significantly increased through four of the ten POE systems studied. Reliability of the POE systems will best be achieved by specifying top quality system components, educating POE users, and providing routine maintenance and VOC monitoring.\n      </p>", "From a human ecological perspective, research was undertaken on interactions between Lake Erie fisheries and offshore petroleum (gas) development from 1913 to summer, 1981. In an attempt to integrate biophysical and human information, the research was based on a four part analytical framework consisting of ecological, cultural, technological, and policy and institutional components. Policies and institutional arrangements were of special concern and were analysed through a management assessment framework which focused on agencies or actors, planning, implementation, research, and other guiding processes in management. Interviews with fishermen, petroleum operators and government officials were the main research method, although comparative information was derived from literature on the offshore oil and gas experience in the North Sea, the United States east coast, and other parts of the world. Research findings indicated that fishermen perceived substantial conflict due to factors such as fishing gear damage and lost access to fishing resources. However, employment and related conflicts of the type experienced in the North Sea were generally not reported by Lake Erie fishermen, with most seeing the overall economic effect of the petroleum industry as beneficial. Industry and government representatives indicated that the two industries were fundamentally compatible and that minor problems could be resolved by existing compensation schemes and reasonable compromise. Research showed that the management of these two resources had been ad hoc and reactive with, among other things, no strategic planning, limitations in research and inadequate review processes, notably from the fishermen's standpoint. Recommendations to improve management include the establishment of: 1) a five year strategic plan; 2) a formal government, petroleum, and fisheries management body; 3) a compensation policy and fund; and 4) the development of new technology and/or alterations in petroleum operations to accommodate fishing activities and reduce potential damage to petroleum equipment.\n      </p>", "Two areas of Chesapeake Bay, Colgate Creek in Baltimore Harbor and Eastern Bay, are presently under study, with routine sampling of water and sediment for petroleum-degrading microorganisms (bacteria, yeasts, and fungi) by direct plating and enrichment culture. Selected physical and chemical parameters are recorded for each sampling site, and water and sediment samples are extracted for hydrocarbons. Numbers of petroleum-degrading microorganisms enumerated by direct plating were found to correlate with the concentration of benzene-extractable material and were higher for the Colgate Creek than for the Eastern Bay site. Petroleum-degrading microorganisms were isolated from water and sediment samples at environmental temperatures of 0\u00b0, 5\u00b0, and 10\u00b0C. A salts medium supplemented with nitrate and phosphate was used to provide optimum conditions for petroleum degradation, whereas Chesapeake Bay water was used to simulate natural environmental conditions. Use of a model petroleum permitted quantitative measurement of utilization of individual hydrocarbons ranging in complexity from simple alkanes to polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons. Higher growth yields and maximum hydrocarbon degradation was observed for microorganisms in the salts medium at 0\u00b0, 5\u00b0, and 10\u00b0C, although significant quantities of hydrocarbons were utilized in some samples grown in a medium for which Chesapeake Bay water was the diluent. Bacterial hydrocarbon degradation accounted for most of the model petroleum utilization at 0\u00b0 and 5\u00b0C. However, oscillations of bacterial populations, with significant growth of yeasts, was observed at 10\u00b0C. Photomicroscopy and scanning electron microscopy revealed aggregates of bacteria, yeasts, and fungi associated with oil globules. From preliminary identification and classification of the hydrocarbon-utilizing bacteria, members of the genera Vibrio, Aeromonas, Pseudomonas, and Acinetobacter were present in the enrichment cultures. From results of this study, it is concluded that utilization of model petroleum at low temperatures is a function of the types and numbers of microorganisms present in an original inoculum taken from the natural environment.\n      </p>", "Workers in the petroleum industry are potentially exposed to a variety of petrochemicals, including benzene or benzene-containing liquids. Although a large number of studies of petroleum workers have been conducted to examine leukemia and other cancer risks, few existing studies have investigated cell-type-specific leukemias. One of the major reasons for the lack of cell-type-specific analysis was the small number of deaths by cell type in individual studies. In the present investigation, all cohort studies of petroleum workers in the United States and the United Kingdom were combined into a single database for cell-type-specific leukemia analysis. The majority of these workers were petroleum refinery employees, but production, pipeline, and distribution workers in the petroleum industry were also included. The combined cohort consisted of more than 208,000 petroleum workers, who contributed more than 4.6 million person-years of observation. Based on a meta-analysis of the combined data, cell-type-specific leukemia risks were expressed in terms of standardized mortality ratios (meta-SMRs). The meta-SMR for acute myeloid leukemia was 0.96. The lack of an increase of acute myeloid leukemia was attributed to the low levels of benzene exposure in the petroleum industry, particularly in comparison to benzene exposure levels in some previous studies of workers in other industries, who had been found to experience an increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia. Similarly, no increase in chronic myeloid, acute lymphocytic, or chronic lymphocytic leukemias was found in petroleum workers (meta-SMRs of 0.89, 1.16, and 0.84, respectively). Stratified meta-analyses restricted to refinery studies or to studies with at least 15 years of follow-up yielded similar results. The findings of the present investigation are consistent with those from several recent case-control studies of cell-type-specific leukemia. Patterns and levels of benzene exposure in the petroleum industry are reviewed. The results of the present epidemiologic investigation are discussed in conjunction with recent advances in leukemogenesis from other scientific disciplines.\n      </p>", "Geologic reasons indicate that the dominant position of die Middle East as a source of conventional petroleum will not be changed by new discoveries elsewhere. The share of world crude oil production coming from the Middle East could increase, within 10 to 20 years, to exceed 50 percent, under even modest increases in world consumption. Nonconventional resources of oil exist in large quantities, but because of their low production rates they can at best only mitigate: extant trends. Increased production of natural gas outside the United States, however, offers an opportunity for geographically diversified energy supplies in the near future.\n      </p>", "Static bioassays were conducted to determine the relationship between odor of petroleum refinery wastewaters and taste-flavor in rainbow trout in connection with the occurrence of objectionable \"oily\" taste in fish in the Bow River downstream from the city of Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

Cooked fish tasted by a series of panelists acquired an oily taste within 6 hr at TON's of 2.0 and 1.0. An oily taste was not detected at a TON below 0.1. After 24 hr, panelists detected an oily taste for a TON of 0.25.

Methods: A total of 25 292 employees hired between 1964 and 1994 were linked to the Canadian tumour registry and national mortality database. Exposure-response trends were assessed for hydrocarbon solvents/fuels, hydrocarbon lubricants, petroleum coke/spent catalyst, and hydrogen sulphide (H2S). Results: External comparison analyses (mortality and incidence) showed deficits for all causes and all malignant neoplasms combined and were consistent with expectation for most malignant and non-malignant sites analysed. Gall bladder cancer mortality was increased among males based on four deaths, but cases had no common job assignments and the increase was focused in workers employed &lt;10 years. Mesothelioma incidence was increased. Most exposure-specific analyses were compromised by small numbers. Statistically significant increases were observed for H2S exposure and a subgroup of accidental deaths as well as for petroleum coke/spent catalyst exposure and lung cancer. While both findings have a degree of biologic plausibility, the H2S association, which exhibited a clearer exposure-response pattern, could be subject to unmeasured confounders. Additionally, interpretation was complicated by the high correlation between hydrocarbon and H2S exposures. With regard to lung cancer, the analysis could not adequately control for smoking, was based on small numbers, and exhibited a tenuous exposure-response pattern. Conclusion: The findings for mesothelioma suggest the need for continued attention to asbestos in the petroleum industry. The relation between accidental deaths and H2S exposure deserves closer scrutiny in similarly, exposed populations. Further analyses of lung cancer are underway and will be reported separately.\n      </p>", "Past experience has shown that restoration of an aquifer to drinking water quality by groundwater extraction and surface treatment may require many years of pumping. In this research, a mathematical model of hydrocarbon dissolution is developed to aid in the evaluation of groundwater remediation systems. The model assumes that residual hydrocarbon is distributed between two fractions: (1) a fast fraction in equilibrium with the aqueous phase and (2) a slow fraction in which mass transfer is limited. Relationships for simulating equilibrium partitioning are based on classical liquid-liquid equilibrium theory. Column experiments were performed to test the model and examine the kinetics of aromatic hydrocarbon dissolution as residual hydrocarbon ages. The hydrocarbon dissolution process included an initial equilibrium period during which dissolved hydrocarbon concentrations were high and roughly constant followed by a rapid drop-off period and an asymptotic period during which dissolved hydrocarbon concentrations were low and declined slowly. After passing more than 700 pore volumes of water through the column, between 8 and 10% of the original toluene and xylene isomers remained in the column. Model simulations were conducted to evaluate the effect of pulsed pumping on groundwater cleanup time.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The treatment plant performance evaluation was conducted during three separate periods: Summer 1978, Winter 1979, and Summer 1979. It was found that the plant is generally effective in reducing the petroleum content of the ballast water. On the average, the oil content of incoming ballast water (ranging between 7 000 and 10 000 mg/l is reduced to an organic load equal to 10 mg C/l in the final effluent. The bulk of the organic content reduction takes place in the gravity separator, where approximately 99.8% petroleum is removed. Typically, the final treated effluent contains 45 to 50% volatile aromatic hydrocarbons and 35 to 40% dissolved nonvolatile organics. The remaining 10 to 20% suspended organic matter, which is composed of aliphatic hydrocarbons and other water-insoluble fractions of petroleum, may properly be defined as \"the oil.\" Based on plant discharge records and experimental data generated by this study, the estimated average daily discharge of aromatic hydrocarbons is 265 l (70 gal).\n      </p>", "1. Remnants from oil spills can persist for decades within anoxic coastal sediments affecting local flora and fauna, but few studies have examined the long-term impacts of the residual petroleum on these valuable coastal ecosystems. 2. The Wild Harbor salt marsh (Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts, USA) still harbours residual petroleum from a 1969 oil spill, which released 700 000 L of No. 2. fuel oil. Previous effects have been noted in fiddler crabs and ribbed mussels inhabiting the oiled marsh. 3. Spartina alterniflora biomass was sampled above- and below-ground in elevational transects through areas with different total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) content. Further, elevational differences were mapped in oiled and non-oiled locations. 4. Stem density and above- and below-ground biomass decreased in oiled areas. The decreased vegetation biomass led to unconsolidated sediments, increased topographical variation and, ultimately, loss of salt marsh habitat. 5. Four decades after the Florida spill, with only 100 kg of the original 595 000 kg of spilt oil persisting in salt marsh sediment, the effects on large-scale ecosystem functions are still evident. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrate specific impacts of residual petroleum on S. alterniflora biomass and coastal erosion. Further, we have defined TPH content thresholds at which to expect long-term ecosystem impacts. The recalcitrant nature of these contaminants and their chronic large-scale ecosystem effects leads to the potential demand for alternative compensation, such as preservation of coastal systems at risk elsewhere.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "Oil deposits occur in deep sediments, and appear to be organic matter that has been transformed through the action of geothermal heat and pressure.

Methods: Eight experts individually assessed the likelihood of exposure for combinations of 17 carcinogens, 27 job categories and four time periods (1970\u20131979, 1980\u20131989, 1990\u20131999 and 2000\u20132005). Each rater assessed 1836 combinations based on summary documents on carcinogenic agents, which included descriptions of sources of exposure and products, descriptions of work processes carried out within the different job categories, and monitoring data. Inter-rater agreement was calculated using Cohen's kappa index and single and average score intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) (ICC(2,1) and ICC(2,8), respectively). Differences in inter-rater agreement for time periods, raters, International Agency for Research on Cancer groups and the amount of information provided were consequently studied. Results: Overall, 18% of the combinations were denoted as possible exposure, and 14% scored probable exposure. Stratified by the 17 carcinogenic agents, the probable exposure prevalence ranged from 3.8% for refractory ceramic fibres to 30% for crude oil. Overall mean kappa was 0.42 (ICC(2,1)=0.62 and ICC(2,8)=0.93). Providing limited quantitative measurement data was associated with less agreement than for equally well described carcinogens without sampling data. Conclusion: The overall \u039a and single-score ICC indicate that the raters agree on exposure estimates well above the chance level. The levels of inter-rater agreement were higher than in other comparable studies. The average score ICC indicates reliable mean estimates and implies that sufficient raters were involved. The raters seemed to have enough documentation on which to base their estimates, but provision of limited monitoring data leads to more incongruence among raters.

Some simulations are based on a petroleum market model, the residue supply estimate, and adoption of the new ethanol processing technology; results suggest a petroleum price reduction. The benefit-cost analysis for this technology accounts for the oligopoly-offsetting effect of additional supplies and the option value for loss reductions in the event of an embargo. Substantial underestimates of the technology benefit will occur unless the chance of embargo and oligopoly pricing are taken into account.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

These in-plant methods are preventive in nature and should form an important part of any plant's system. Five preventive measures are discussed-design, process modification, recovery and utilization, local pretreatment or disposal, and operation control. Each measure is discussed from the petroleum industry's viewpoint. Some popular methods for each measure are included. The dilemma confronting those agencies concerned with making a pollution-loading charge vs. raw material consumed (or unit of production) is presented. The vast number of plants and different products, processes, etc., make this type of comparison impossible.\n      </p>", "The U.S. case against Iran is based on Iran's deceptions regarding nuclear weapons development. This case is buttressed by assertions that a state so petroleum-rich cannot need nuclear power to preserve exports, as Iran claims. The U.S. infers, therefore, that Iran's entire nuclear technology program must pertain to weapons development. However, some industry analysts project an Irani oil export decline [e.g., Clark JR (2005) Oil Gas J 103(18):34-39]. If such a decline is occurring, Iran's claim to need nuclear power could be genuine. Because Iran's government relies on monopoly proceeds from oil exports for most revenue, it could become politically vulnerable if exports decline. Here, we survey the political economy of Irani petroleum for evidence of this decline. We define Iran's export decline rate (edr) as its summed rates of depletion and domestic demand growth, which we find equals 10-12%. We estimate marginal cost per barrel for additions to Irani production capacity, from which we derive the \"standstill\" investment required to offset edr. We then compare the standstill investment to actual investment, which has been inadequate to offset edr. Even if a relatively optimistic schedule of future capacity addition is met, the ratio of 2011 to 2006 exports will be only 0.40-0.52. A more probable scenario is that, absent some change in Irani policy, this ratio will be 0.33-0.46 with exports declining to zero by 2014-2015. Energy subsidies, hostility to foreign investment, and inefficiencies of its state-planned economy underlie Iran's problem, which has no relation to \"peak oil.\"\n      </p>", "Larvae of the brachyuran crab Hemigrapsus oregonensis were raised in the laboratory from broods obtained from egg-bearing females collected at a site previously contaminated by a spill of crude petroleum hydrocarbons and from a site not recently contaminated. Larvae from both sites were raised throughout development on 2 diets of the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis, one in which the rotifer was cultured on the green alga Dunaliella tertiolecta, the other cultured on the brown alga Isochrysis galbana. Percentage mortality per stage for larvae from the contaminated site was equal to or lower than for larvae from the clean site. There was no difference in duration of zoeal development nor for megalopal weight for larvae from either site on either diet. Larvae raised on rotifers fed Dunaliella showed higher mortality during the fifth zoeal stage, longer zoeal duration for stages II-V, and lower megalopal weight than did those raised on rotifers fed Isochrysis. Results indicate that previous exposure to petroleum hydrocarbon contamination during brooding has no effect on subsequent zoeal development when larvae are not directly exposed to contamination. Differences in larval response to diet demonstrate that the nutritional value of heterotrophic prey will depend upon what the prey has previously fed upon, either in the laboratory or in nature.\n      </p>", "Contestable market theory has been advanced in recent years by several authors, the most thorough treatment being the book by Baum\u00f6l, Panzar, and Willig (1982) (BPW). Although several applications of the theory have appeared in the literature, few (if any) follow the step-by-step procedure set forth in Chapter 16 of BPW. This paper represents one of the first attempts to follow the general procedure in investigating the contestability and sustainability of an industry. The long-run cost structure of petroleum refining is first estimated using a translog multiproduct cost function and company refining data from the Financial Reporting System maintained by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). The estimated cost function is then used to approximate the optimal (cost-minimizing) industry structure for petroleum refining. Given that the existing structure is significantly different than the optimal structure, the principles of contestable market theory are used in evaluating the contestability and sustainability of the industry in light of adjustments in industry structure and the performance of various classes of refining companies between 1981 and 1987.\n      </p>", "This study examines whether petroleum refineries that violate environmental laws in Black, Hispanic, and low-income communities tend to receive smaller fines than those refineries in White and affluent communities. The sample consists of all petroleum refinery facilities fined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) between 1998 and 1999 for violating the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and/or the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (N = 60). The mean penalty for noncompliance is much lower in Black than in White census tracts ($108,563 vs. $341,590) and in low-income than in high-income census tracts ($259,784 vs. $334,267). Multivariate analysis suggests that these disparities are not due to factors such as the seriousness of violation, the number of past violations, the facility inspection history, the facility production, or the EPA region in which the violating refinery is situated. It is concluded that the government does a poor job of providing equal protection to racially and economically diverse communities.\n      </p>", "Microorganisms play an important natural role in removing polluting petroleum hydrocarbons from contaminated ecosystems.

Organisms capable of utilizing benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, alkanes, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have been isolated and described. In addition, the mechanisms of degradation for these compounds have been elucidated. This basic research has led to the development of methods for detecting in situ biodegradation of petroleum-related pollutants in anoxic groundwater. Knowledge of the metabolic pathways used by anaerobic bacteria to break down hydrocarbons has allowed us to identify unique intermediate compounds that can be used as biomarkers for in situ activity. One of these unique intermediates is 2-methylbenzylsuccinate, the product of fumarate addition to o-xylene by the enzyme responsible for toluene utilization. We have carried out laboratory studies to show that this compound can be used as a reliable indicator of anaerobic toluene degradation. Field studies confirmed that the biomarker is detectable in field samples and its distribution corresponds to areas where active biodegradation is predicted. For naphthalene, three biomarkers were identified [2-naphthoic acid (2-NA), tetrahydro-2-NA, and hexahydro-2-NA] that can be used in the field to identify areas of active in situ degradation.\n      </p>", "Objectives\u2014To update information on workers in the petroleum industry engaged in the production of crude oil to determine whether the patterns of mortality have changed with 14 additional years of follow up. Methods\u2014All workers were employed at company production and pipeline locations sometime during 1946\u201394. The cohort now consists of 24 124 employees with an average of 22 years of follow up. Results\u2014The overall mortality, and most cause specific mortalities were lower than or similar to those for the general United States population. For white men (81% of the cohort), there were 4361 observed deaths and 5945 expected, resulting in a significantly lower standardised mortality ratio (SMR) of 73. There were significant deficits for all the leading causes of death in the United States including all cancers, cancer of the lung, stroke, heart disease, respiratory disease, and accidents. Slightly increased mortality was found for cancer of the prostate, cancer of the brain and central nervous system, and cancer of other lymphatic tissue. For benign and unspecified neoplasms, the SMR was 152 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 95 to 230). There was a significant increase for acute myelogenous leukaemia that was restricted to people who were first employed before 1940 and who were employed in production and pipeline jobs for &gt;30 years. Overall mortality patterns for non-white men and women were similar to those for white men. Mortality patterns for white men were also examined by duration of employment, time first employed, and by job group. Conclusions\u2014The results of the updated study showed a favourable mortality experience for crude oil production workers compared with the United States population.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "The paper presents an econometric analysis of India's petroleum imports. For this purpose, demand functions have been estimated for various petroleum products, and an import function has been estimated for petroleum. The results of the analysis indicate that the gap between domestic demand for petroleum products and domestic production of crude oil is the main determinant of petroleum imports. International price of petroleum and the foreign exchange availability also exert some influence on the government's decision to import petroleum. An important finding of the study is that both domestic demand for petroleum products and import demand for petroleum are not much responsive to price changes.\n      </p>", "Citgo Petroleum Corporation has recently realized a reduction in petroleum products inventory of $116 million (based on historical inventory-to-sales ratios), resulting in annual interest savings of $14 million, as well as improvements in coordination, pricing, and purchasing decisions estimated at $2.5 million annually.
