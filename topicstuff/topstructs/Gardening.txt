The main country in which this study is based is Spain. However, other countries in the Western Mediterranean Basin also form part of it. These are Portugal, France, Italy and Morocco. Three percentages were calculated. Firstly, the percentage of alien flora was calculated. Then, we calculated the percentages of species introduced as either a consequence of gardening or of agriculture. The figures were based on thirty-four floristic studies carried out in the western Mediterranean Basin between 1904 and 2006. A regression model, in which the explanatory variable is time and the dependent variables are the three percentages mentioned above, was drawn up with the data obtained. The results show the existence of positive correlation between time and the percentages of total exotic flora and the species introduced through gardening (R = 0.64 and 0.56, respectively) and the negative correlation between time and the percentage of alien species introduced through agriculture (R = -0.43). During the last century, the roles of agriculture and gardening as sources of the introduction of exotic flora to the western Mediterranean Basin were reversed. However, in the areas where the socioeconomic scene is more predominantly agrarian, the role of gardening is still limited.\n      </p>", "Children in the \u201cblack belt\u201d region of the southern United States grow up in counties characterized by persistent poverty, low incomes, and low educational performance, including low scores by K-12 students on science and math achievement tests. In Macon County, a black belt county in Alabama with an 83 percent African-American population and 44 percent of its youth in poverty, a partnership evolved in 2004 between Tuskegee University social work students and children aged 5 through 13 years from low-income communities that resulted in after-school and summer programs to enhance K-7 student learning. In 2007, the Youth Garden Project was initiated to focus student interest and learning on science, agriculture, and the environment. The children, with support from their college student mentors learned to plant, water, weed, and harvest vegetables and fruits, emphasizing connections between land, food, and the environment. Student learning and perceptions were captured through artwork and discussions with their mentors. The response of the children and student mentors indicates that gardening activities positively influenced the children's behavior, learning, and academic performance and interest in science, agriculture, and the environment.\n      </p>", "Canadian subarctic agriculture has not been a widespread practice. Because of increasing northern populations associated with industrial development, and the high cost of fresh produce, the practicality and success of subarctic gardening are examined. Dawson City was chosen for study because of its long history of gardening. In 1980 there were 50 domestic gardens, 56 greenhouses, and three commercial gardens which supplied produce both locally and to Whitehorse and Inuvik. The study documents the following crops: cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, carrots, turnips, kohlrabi, radish, beans, peas, potatoes, lettuce, kale, beetroot, Swiss chard, celery, onions, cucumber, tomatoes, zucchini, corn, peppers, leeks, squash, sunflowers and a large variety of herbs.

I am not aware of any work that treats this subject systematically, and although this article will not analyse the subject exhaustively, the most striking changes in the perception of gardening as art will be illustrated by means of quotations.

This is approximately twenty percent of the average amount spent on vegetables in 1977 by nongardening households.

Immigrants and refugees from the Low Countries brought their know-how and eating habits with them. Their arrival in the late-sixteenth and early-seventeenth centuries coincided with the beginning of commercial market gardening in England. Dutch and Flemish immigrants were the first to grow them on a commercial scale.\n         The skill of Dutch and Flemish gardeners did much to alter the English landscape. Many varieties of flowers now considered native to England were brought over from the Low Countries, not to mention the cultivation of bulbs. The tulip became an object of insane speculation. Paintings were often cheaper than the flowers they depicted. Dutch flower painter Simon Pieterszoon Verelst (1644\u20131721?) became the best-paid artist in London after he settled there.\n         Immigrants from the Low Countries also engineered some of the most fertile areas of Britain today. Cornelius Vermuyden (1590\u20131677) was responsible for the draining the Fens (Cambridgeshire) which gave an enormous boost to England's agricultural development. In summary: the English agricultural revolution coincided with an influx of immigrants from the Low Countries who enriched almost every aspect of British agriculture.\n      </p>", "Suburban maintenance gardening is one service sector that has grown in the United States, and in many parts of the country it has become a gendered occupational niche for Mexican immigrant men. What is the social organization of this occupation and to what extent are Mexican immigrant gardeners following in the footsteps of Japanese gardeners, achieving socioeconomic mobility through gardening? Based on interviews conducted with 47 Mexican immigrant maintenance gardeners in Los Angeles, this article examines the occupational structure of this informal sector job, the social context in which it has developed, the mix of informal and formal economic transactions involved, and the strategic challenges that gardeners negotiate. The data show that there is occupational differentiation and mobility within the gardening occupation, and that mobility in the job remains dependent on combining both ethnic entrepreneurship and subjugated service work. Gendered social and human capital, together with financial and legal capital are necessary for occupational mobility. Jardineria, or suburban maintenance gardening, is analogous to the longstanding labor incorporation of female immigrant domestic workers into affluent households, but it is also indicative of a new trend: the proliferation of hybrid forms of entrepreneurship and service work and the incorporation of masculine \"dirty work\" service jobs into affluent households.\n      </p>", "At a time of economic crisis and sharply rising food prices, urban farming is increasingly helping to sustain households. Gender is generally thought to be a key variable in this but studies are still in their infancy. Looking at the phenomenon from a livelihood perspective and based on a survey carried out in Buea, Cameroon, this paper deals with a number of key issues related to gender and urban gardening, including access to resources, division of labour and the benefits and challenges encountered. An additional variable, namely the marital status of the gardener, is also considered. There appear to be important differences between male and female gardeners in various respects, and marital status plays a role not only among female gardeners but to some extent among male gardeners too.\n      </p>", "Collectives and bureaucracies differ not only in structure and values, but interpret the social world and engage in actions based on quite different themes, symbols, and meanings. These diverse patterns of symbolic discourse, or organizational cultures, are assessed in the case of the recent urban gardening movement. Although government agencies assisted the movement by providing resources to movement collectives and by establishing thousands of urban gardening projects, collectives and bureaucracies had different meanings for what appeared to be the same experience. A comparison of how each described the benefits of urban gardening and structured the gardening experience for participants show serious underlying differences between these organizational cultures and a source of potential bureaucratic/ collectivist conflict. Implications for understanding apparent official opposition to collectivist movements are also assessed.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

If these fine-sounding principles accompanying the newly emerging environmental movement are to have a permanent cultural impact, it is argued that children (future consumers and participants in democracy) must interact daily with an educational environment containing a diversity of living ecosystems. Gardening in the primary grades is proposed as one of the most feasible pedagogical approaches for ensuring this type of daily learning experience, and for reversing a worrisome trend in the opposite direction. A case example of children's gardening is presented that was documented during the 1970s and early 1980s as part of a larger regenerative design project implemented on an urban schoolyard in the California Bay Area. In this case, gardening became a common thread in the process of regeneration and evolution of the habitat over many years. It was the most popular component with the teachers and the one aspect of the environmental education program that survived over the years, as the dwindling resources in public education forced the reduction or elimination of many others.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "The Master Gardener Classroom Garden Project provides many inner-city children in the San Antonio Independent School District with an experiential way of learning about horticulture, gardening, themselves, and their relationships with their peers. To evaluate the benefits of participation in the Classroom Garden Project, data was collected on 52 second and third grade students. Qualitative interviews indicate that participation in the gardening project has had many positive effects on the school children. The children have gained pleasure from watching the products of their labor flourish, and have had the chance to increase interactions with their parents and other adults. In addition, the children have learned the anger and frustration that occur when things of value are harmed out of neglect or violence.\n      </p>", "Surveys of leucocoprinaceous fungi (Lepiotaceae, Agaricales, Basidiomycota) in the rain-forests of Panama and Brazil revealed several free-living counterparts of fungi cultivated by primitive attine ants (the lower Attini, Formicidae, Hymenoptera), adding to two such collections identified in a survey by Mueller et al (1998). The accumulated evidence supports the hypothesis that perhaps all fungi of lower attine ants have close free-living relatives. Free-living counterparts of ant-cultivated fungi are collected most readily during the early rainy season; in particular these are free-living mushrooms of fungal counterparts that are cultivated as yeasts in gardens of ants in the Cyphomyrmex rimosus group. Free-living and symbiotic fungi of these yeast-cultivating ant species might represent a promising study system to compare the biology of sympatric, conspecific fungi existing outside versus inside the attine symbiosis.\n      </p>", "What is the normative significance of school gardening for environmental activism and activists today? Philosophical treatments generally highlight gardening's importance for human well-being, aesthetic theory, and urban landscape design. Several accounts of John Dewey's educational philosophy draw attention to the school gardens tended by students at the University of Chicago's Experimental School. However, these typically neglect the social and political significance of Dewey's writings on school gardening. One way to bring the normative dimension of school gardening to the fore is to compare Dewey's work on the topic with more recent scholarship on the politics of gardening movements. In this paper, the object of comparison is an essay by the Community Studies scholar Mary Beth Pudup. While Pudup's and Dewey's approaches are not identical, the comparison proves fruitful in so far as it exposes the political reasons for gardening education, relates school gardening to contemporary gardening movements and gives the call for creating more school garden projects greater normative force\u2014or so I argue.\n      </p>", "Sedentary species face a trade-off between the benefits of exploiting food close to their homes and the cost of defending it. In aquatic systems, it has been suggested that some sedentary grazers can increase the range of circumstances under which they are at an advantage over mobile grazers by enhancing food resources within their feeding territories through 'gardening'. We examined this for the retreat-building sedentary larvae of the caddis Tinodes waeneri, which are often dominant in the littoral of lakes. We hypothesised that T. waeneri gardens by fertilising its retreat (a fixed 'gallery' on which algae and other microorganisms grow), and that gardening would be more important in lower productivity lakes. We tested this by analysing the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of larvae, their galleries and the general background epilithon, collected from rocks in the littoral zones of six lakes spread across a natural nutrient gradient. We found evidence of nutrient recycling within the Tinodes gallery community in all lakes. Galleries were \u00b9\u2075N-depleted compared to the epilithon, suggesting that algae on galleries preferentially assimilated \u00b9\u2074N from larval excretions that were themselves \u00b9\u2075N-depleted relative to the larval food source. Mixing model results indicate that galleries formed an important larval carbon and nitrogen source, with mean gallery dietary contributions of over 40% in at least one sample period in all lakes studied. Gallery contributions were greater between April and October than in January and, contrary to our initial hypothesis, greater in the more productive lakes of those surveyed. Nevertheless, T. waeneri galleries do act as a fertilised garden. 'Gardening' appears to be widespread in this species, and may affect productivity and patterns of nitrogen retention within the stony littoral of lakes.\n      </p>", "Mark Laird has already published the seminal work on the design of flower gardens and shrubberies in the second half of the eighteenth century, The Flowering of the Landscape Garden: English Pleasure Grounds 1720\u20131800 (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999). This paper re-examines his central thesis that garden design was led by the introduction of new exotic species and by the adoption of graduated planting as a means of showing off these plants. It emphasizes instead the persistence of medieval gardening traditions which were not compatible with exotics or graduated planting.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "Larra bicolor (F.) (Hymenoptera: Sphecidae) is an introduced biological control agent of pest Scapteriscus mole crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllotalpidae) in northern Florida. The pests are of southern South American origin. Larra bicolor is widespread in South America; the imported stock is from Bolivia. Its adults seem to require nectar sources. In South America, Puerto Rico (where it was also introduced from Brazil), and southern Florida (a separate introduction from Puerto Rico), the neotropical wildflower Spermacoce verticillata L. (Rubiaceae) has been observed to be a favored nectar source. In northern Florida (29\u00b0N) this wildflower is uncommon, freezes to the ground at first winter frost, and does not flower again until April-May. Nevertheless, where it has been planted in northern Florida, the wasps feed on it throughout the warmer months. Wasps were observed to feed at nectaries of 10 other plant species in northern Florida. Four of these other plants were compared experimentally with S. verticillata, but all received fewer visits from the wasps. Known disadvantages to the use of S. verticillata to augment L. bicolor are that it is not native to Florida, and that it grows vigorously in full sun when its roots are not immersed in water. It has been reported as a minor weed in southern Florida. However, it is the best alternative to attract L. bicolor to places where mole cricket control is needed. /// Larra bicolor (F.)

Cuatro de estas plantas fueron experimentalmente comparadas con S. verticillata, pero todas recibieron menos visitas de esta avispa. Algunos argumentos en contra del uso de S. verticillata para aumentar las poblaciones de L. bicolor son: la planta no es nativa a la Florida, crece vigorosamente bajo exposici\u00f3n total al sol siempre y cuando las ra\u00edces no se encuentren bajo el agua y se ha reportado como una maleza menor en el sur de la Florida.

Six types of dooryard gardens, ranging from folk to contemporary, are identified. Variations in style are explained by the origin, background, and content of the gardening decision-making process. The family decision maker influences the design of the dooryard garden through personal needs, motives, and drives: a desire to raise the standard of living, food, curiosity, personal satisfaction, social recognition, aesthetics, and the mysteries of nature.

Early spare, simple foods reflected strict monastic practices inherited from the nuns\u2019 enclosed European order, but physical labor and bishops\u2019 insistence on outside service soon necessitated a more rich and balanced diet. After Vatican II, new mealtime practices that allowed sisters to converse during meals and choose dining companions (versus sitting in rank order in silence) helped them adjust to a new ethos of cooperative community. As the convent added a retreat ministry and mature professional women joined, mealtime options proliferated and old foodways were challenged. A contemporary emphasis on social justice and land stewardship is reflected in commitment to organic gardening and to purchasing food local, seasonal, fair-trade food. Cultivating the convent's extensive raspberry garden, in particular, invites these modern nuns to simultaneously affirm their continuing commitment to core Benedictine values and to the spirit of their patron, St. Gertrude of Helfta, and also to contemporary priorities.\n      </p>", "American horticultural and domestic literature of the 1840s through the 1870s represented parlour gardening as a form of sentimental parenting. In these sources, professional writers and amateur gardeners recast the gardener's relationship to the plant so that gardeners were parents to anthropomorphized plants. The gardener-parent relationship with the plant-child was interpreted through domestic sentimentalism's parenting model, which idealized an effortless and empathetic 'mother-love' that worked through invisible influence rather than conscientious, skilled, or strained labour. By extension, gardening was also imagined to be an effortless affective relationship between the gardener-parent and plant-child. I place this metaphor within the contexts of domestic sentimentalism and transatlantic pastoralism, in order to show the combined power of these traditions to naturalize, aestheticize, and misrepresent labour as leisure.\n      </p>", "This investigation was conducted to test the hypothesis that exposure of pregnant women to chemicals increases the risk of spontaneous abortion. The chemical risk factors under study to which dental assistants, factory workers, painters, and gardening workers were exposed were nitrous oxide, inorganic mercury, organic solvents, and pesticides. The study was carried out within the Danish county of Funen. It included all dental assistants employed in private or public dentistry. A comparable reference group was made up by employees less exposed to chemicals. Further study groups included all women painters within the county, women factory workers from selected factories, and about 50% of the women gardening workers within the county. Shop assistants and packers formed their control group. Information was obtained through a postal questionnaire study in May 1980 and from hospital records. Only among factory workers and painters was the odds ratio of spontaneous abortion found to be significantly increased. Neither among these women nor among dental assistants and gardening workers, however, was the reported exposure to any single chemical during pregnancy associated with a significantly increased odds ratio of spontaneous abortion.\n      </p>", "Jola women farmers in the Casamance region of southern Senegal use their \"traditional\" knowledge and farming skills to shift crop repertoires and techniques so as to embark on market-gardening, thus innovating in response to new needs and perceived opportunities.

It finds dependence on food purchases widespread and revenue from the own-account activities of nonhousehold heads essential to food security. Gender and the wealth of households are found to influence some, but not all, income generating activities and expenditures. Three household food procurement profiles are identified: investment in cattle, market gardens and bush extraction, and remittances. The case study village has agroecological characteristics and market proximity, which set it and other urban hinterland villages apart from the more cotton- and cattle-based zones of southern Mali. Own-account income generating activities may be able to increase revenue for women and junior men through a reallocation of household resources without entirely undermining the basis for a larger subsistence-oriented household.\n      </p>", "The development of Taiwan's agricultural sector contributed significantly to the country's transformation from virtual poverty after World War II to a modern industrial nation. Success resulted from the use of appropriate technologies, developed through an exceptionally close working relationship between government, research and development institutions, extension services and farmers in Taiwan. As part of their overseas development aid programme, the Republic of China on Taiwan has established Technical Missions in those developing countries where it receives political recognition. Among these is The Gambia, West Africa, where one focus of Taiwan's current Technical Mission is the development of women's market gardens. Although the gardens have proved successful, there is doubt as to whether their achievements will be sustained once Taiwan's Technical Mission in The Gambia has ended. Field research in Taiwan and in The Gambia, based largely on participatory techniques, has revealed that the low-tech methods introduced from Taiwan are appropriate for the Gambian environment. However, much depends on whether women participating in the schemes can commit sufficient time and energy to the gardens, as at present this is a limiting factor. The potential of the gardens may also be constrained by a lack of appropriate institutional infrastructure, particularly the scope for profitable disposal of garden produce. A major conclusion of the article is that successful transfer of appropriate technology to The Gambia is likely to be impeded by poorly developed coordination between groups that proved to be key 'players' in the development of agriculture in Taiwan: government, research and development institutions, extension services and producers.\n      </p>", "Fundamental change in an organization's configuration is often a highly contentious process as different stakeholders, both internal and external, jockey to gain or protect privileges. Success requires that the change agent take a strategic approach to the change process, identifying the means by which the different stakeholders can either be brought on board or their resistance mitigated. This article evaluates and compares the change strategies employed in two major federal agencies, first by disaggregating them into their component features and then by contrasting the broader dynamics created by each according to two metaphors, gardening versus engineering.\n      </p>", "The addition and expansion of gardening to the economies of Early Woodland societies in the Midwest was a significant component in the formation of tribal societies. Here we analyze archaeobotanical data from the Boudinot #4 site (33AT521), an Early Woodland (Adena) hamlet in the Hocking River valley, southeastern Ohio. The data document patterns of forest management, nut exploitation, and seed and cultigen use. These data further indicate that indigenous plant species were being tended and grown in proximity to this increasingly sedentary community beginning ca. 500 B.C.\n      </p>", "A middle-class woman wanting to train as a gardener between 1900 and 1940 could choose to attend a private gardening school instead of a horticultural college. The importance of these schools to women's horticultural education has been obscured by the fragmentary nature of the archival sources, yet they provided an important source of horticultural education. The years leading up to the First World War (began 1914) saw a number of schools open. However, numbers declined in the interwar period (1919-38) until only a handful remained. The schools, however, were an integral part of women's horticultural education as shown by the history of Aldersey Hall, near Chester, Cheshire. The school run by the Misses Cornelius Wheeler trained women in horticulture from the early years of the twentieth century to the early days of the Second World War.\n      </p>", "A case-control study was performed in South Australia to determine if L. longbeachae infection was associated with recent handling of commercial potting mix and to examine possible modes of transmission. Twenty-five laboratory-confirmed cases and 75 matched controls were enrolled between April 1997 and March 1999. Information on underlying illness, smoking, gardening exposures and behaviours was obtained by telephone interviews. Recent use of potting mix was associated with illness (OR 4.74, 95% CI 1.65-13.55, P = 0.004) in bivariate analysis only. Better predictors of illness in multivariate analysis included poor hand-washing practices after gardening, long-term smoking and being near dripping hanging flower pots. Awareness of a possible health risk with potting mix protected against illness. Results are consistent with inhalation and ingestion as possible modes of transmission. Exposure to aerosolized organisms and poor gardening hygiene may be important predisposing factors to L. longbeachae infection.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

By farming, they demonstrate agency and self-determination in their efforts to build a sense of community. Using an ecofeminist perspective, this article examines the relationship between women's resistance and the environment. By focusing on women's urban gardening, the article broadens the definition to include less formal, but no less important, forms of resistance.\n         The article is divided into two parts. The first deals with the implementation of the project launched by the members of the Detroit Black Community Food Security Network (DBCFSN). Government statistics and secondary research provide the backdrop to the economic problems in the City of Detroit that triggered the community response. The second part presents women farmers' attempts to transform vacant land to create a community-based food system. These activists construct the farm as a community safe space, which operates as a creative, public outdoor classroom where they nurture activism and challenge the racial and class-based barriers to accessing healthy food. In addition to improving access to healthy food by repurposing vacant land, they are transforming their communities into safe and green spaces.\n      </p>", "For decades many local development and community leaders have been questioning the effectiveness of business attraction to create new jobs and expand local economies. At the same time, there has been growing interest among some professional planners and citizen groups in the concept of sustainable development, which suggests replacing short-sighted development plans which convey limited benefits with future-thinking strategies that improve and preserve the quality of life for the entire community. And yet, many local governments continue to rely on business attraction as a key component of their economic development strategies. This paper attempts to explain why these governments are resistant to more progressive economic development strategies. It first examines how and why traditional strategies are ineffective. It then argues that, by contrast, the more recent \"economic gardening\" approach, which centers on the cultivation of local entrepreneurship, is more effective, particularly with regard to long-term sustainability issues. The paper concludes by discussing economic gardening's prospects of becoming the dominant approach to economic development, and the key role coordinating agencies play in helping communities build the capacity to meet this challenge.\n      </p>", "Despite the contemporary importance of the Ridge forest to the city of Delhi as its most important 'green lung', the concept of urban forestry has been explored neither by urban historians studying Delhi nor by environmental historians. This article places the colonial efforts to plant a forest on the Delhi Ridge from 1883 to 1913 within the context of the gradual deforestation of the countryside around Delhi and the local colonial administration's preoccupation with encouraging arboriculture. This project of colonial forestry prioritized the needs of the white colonizers living in Delhi, while coming into conflict repeatedly with indigenous peasants. With the decision to transfer the capital to Delhi in 1911, the afforestation of the Delhi Ridge received a further stimulus. Town planners' visions of a building the capital city of New Delhi were meant to assert the grandeur of British rule through imposing buildings, with the permanence of the British in India being emphasised by the strategic location of the ruins of earlier empires within the city. The principles of English landscape gardening inspired the planning of New Delhi, with the afforestation of the Delhi Ridge being undertaken to provide a verdant backdrop for--the Government House and the Secretariat--the administrative centre of British government in India. Imperial notions of landscaping, which were central to the afforestation of the Delhi Ridge epitomised colonial rule and marginalized Indians.\n      </p>", "Fungus gardening ants make clear choices among fungal substrates (food for their fungus). It has been proposed, but never demonstrated, that these ants are collecting the best for their symbiotic fungus and the production of ant biomass (fitness). The goal of this study was to determine whether preferred substrates lead to higher fitness in the attine, Trachymyrmex septentrionalis. Preferences exhibited by foragers were established. Colonies were fed a single substrate or a mixture of substrates during the entire course of the experiment, which ended when sexual offspring appeared in the nest. The response variables were numbers and weights of ant offspring and the chitin content of fungus gardens. Preference was not strongly related to fitness. The preferred oak catkins produced the highest amounts of ant and fungal biomass, but the ants collected much more material than needed, which indicates that forager activity is decoupled from fitness. The preferred caterpillar feces were rejected shortly after the feedings began. The unpreferred oak leaves were just as effective at producing ant and fungal biomass as catkins. Leaves are possibly unpreferred because they are expensive to cut. The unpreferred huckleberry flowers were inferior but did not cause rejection behavior. The mixed diet was just as productive as catkins or leaves. This study indicates that foragers possess a default mechanism to prefer catkins and frass, which can be quickly changed if substrates are bad. In contrast, there does not appear to be a similar mechanism causing substrates to become preferred quickly.\n      </p>", "This article presents lessons learned from an evaluation of Greener Voices, an approach developed to enhance the participation of children and youth in school-and community-based gardening projects at six sites throughout New York and Pennsylvania. The sites included rural, suburban, and urban settings and engaged children from 3 to 18 years of age. Over a two-year period, Greener Voices provided the sites with consultation, written materials, a website, and an opportunity to attend a workshop and conference related to participation and gardening. Interviews with site leaders revealed key themes regarding the usefulness of activities, ongoing challenges, and progress made in increasing participation. Of particular interest was the usefulness of Hart's ladder of children's participation in raising awareness about participation. Ongoing efforts are needed to assist site leaders, particularly with ways to engage younger children.\n      </p>", "Urban settlement in the western lower Papaloapan River basin in the Gulf lowlands was dispersed and likely employed intensive gardening near domiciles. Land surrounding homes also may have played a symbolic role in these agrarian societies. Water works-formal ponds associated with temple platforms and other prominent structures as well as with many residential mounds-support the idea of symbolic as well as practical functions in land use around buildings. Dispersed occupation occurs in low elevations suited to recessional planting, a technique that takes advantage of dry season ground moisture in low areas where rain and flood waters recede as the water table drops. We analyze elevational zones to show greater settlement density in the low-lying Blanco River delta than in higher elevations upriver. Analysis of distances between archaeological residences and wetlands and drainages shows that residences generally were close to seasonally flooded areas. We also highlight anthropogenic qualities in the alluvial landscape, offering a land use perspective distinct from other views of agricultural intensification. The settlement pattern is compatible with Mesoamerican forms of urbanism. /// Los asentamientos urbanos en la cuenca oeste del bajo R\u00edo Papaloapan en la planicie del golfo eran dispersos y probablemente con horticultura residencial intensiva; siendo probable que los terrenos cercanos a las casas tuvieron adem\u00e1s un papel simb\u00f3lico. Elementos para el manejo del agua-los aljibes adyacentes a las plataformas de templos y otras estructuras prominentes, como a mont\u00edculos residenciales-apoyan la interpretaci\u00f3n tanto simb\u00f3lica como pr\u00e1ctica del uso de la tierra alrededor de los edificios. La ocupaci\u00f3n dispersa ocurre en lugares de poca elevaci\u00f3n favorables para las siembras de retroceso, una t\u00e9cnica que utiliza la tierra h\u00fameda de terrenos bajos cuando las lluvias y las inundaciones estacionales disminuyen y el nivel fre\u00e1tico desciende. Nuestro estudio de elevaciones revela mayor densidad de asentamientos en los terrenos bajos del delta del r\u00edo Blanco que r\u00edo arriba. Y el de las distancias entre las residencias y los bajos y drenajes que las primeras est\u00e1n generalmente m\u00e1s cerca de los zonas estacionalmente inundables. Tambi\u00e9n destacamos las cualidades antropog\u00e9nicas del paisaje aluvional, presentando una perspectiva distinta de la intensificaci\u00f3n agr\u00edcola.

However, it has not seriously challenged a core assumption of these narratives: that the \"natural\" environment (that is, the environment containing natural resources) is the rural. This article argues for a critical analysis of human-environment relations in and around Africa's cities, not simply because environmental problems in these areas have been for too long neglected. Such an inquiry also offers insights into the dynamic relationship between local ecological and economic change and the geographically and historically constructed social institutions governing daily production, exchange, and decision making processes. Drawing on research conducted in two market gardening villages outside of Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, the article examines how a combination of economic austerity and certain kinds of natural resource deterioration have transformed both the meanings and practices of daily work, thereby undermining potentially useful relations of collaboration and trust, both within and beyond the village. More broadly, this article argues that any analysis of how people cope with increasingly difficult material conditions in Africa's peri-urban areas must consider how local social institutions have been shaped by a history of close urban contact.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "", "", "", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "Using the unusually well-documented butterfly fauna of Davis, Yolo County, California, it is shown that the mainly native species commonly observed in gardens breed mostly or entirely on alien plants, especially naturalized weeds. Over 40% of the fauna has no known native hosts in the urban-suburban environment. Were certain alien weeds to be eradicated or their abundance greatly reduced, the urban-suburban butterfly fauna would disappear. This might be regarded as an unfortunate, and perhaps intolerable, side-effect of such programs.\n      </p>", "1. The fungus-gardening ants and their fungi represent a highly co-evolved, vertically transmitted mutualism. Mutualisms such as these are thought to be reciprocal antagonisms, so that the ants and the fungus can be expected to have some conflicting interests. 2. This paper reports the results from a cultivar switch experiment that documented the effects of switching the native cultivar from the basal 'higher-attine' Trachymyrmex septentrionalis with a derived cultivar from the leaf-cutting ant, Atta texana. If the cultivars have been modified significantly during the adaptive radiation of this clade, then they should differ in their ability to produce ant and fungal biomass. If the ants can perceive differences in cultivar performance, then their food preference may also change as a result of the switch. Lastly, if conflict is present in this mutualism, then the sex ratio in the switched colonies should be male biased. 3. Our results showed that food preference was not altered by the new cultivar. The A. texana cultivar did not change the performance of T septentrionalis colonies relative to colonies that were cultivating conspecific fungal cultivars. Foragers preferred insect faeces and oak staminate flowers over fresh leaves or flowers. Most variation in colony performance was attributable to substrate type. Sex ratio of offspring was not affected by fungal cultivar. With respect to fungal growth, the A. texana cultivar appeared to be more of a generalist, while the T septentrionalis cultivar performed better on substrates preferred by the ants than those unpreferred. 4. The results of this study indicate that cooperation and not conflict has been more important in shaping the evolutionary ecology of this mutualism. Although the cultivars were certainly genetically and physiologically distinct, these differences did not account for variation in the production of ant biomass or ant behaviour. The emerging picture thus indicates that this mutualism should be viewed as a highly integrated superorganism that is more than the sum of its parts.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Arboretums were innovative and important developments in British and, ultimately, global landscape gardening during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Inspired by British and European traditions of landscape gardening, horticulture, agricultural improvement and botany, they were imbued with symbolism and meaning according to the circumstances of their creation, character and usage. For some nineteenth-century landscape gardeners and horticulturists they offered global excursions in microcosm, providing rational recreation, aesthetic enjoyment and botanical experimentation. Their systematic planting promoted an image of rational, objective science and appropriate behavioural responses, helping to differentiate and shape Victorian middle-class identity. However, the complex relationships between designs, management, botanical displays, organic agencies, and consumption ensured contested and contingent responses and appropriations.\n      </p>"],
