The authors of 'Standards for ecologically successful restoration' (Palmer et al. 2005) are commended for clearly articulating and discussing the nuances of establishing ecological standards in river restoration practice. We agree that there is a need for better and more thoughtful standards to elevate the practice of river restoration to a science of restoration. As practitioners of fluvial restoration, and students of the sciences of geomorphology, hydrology, ecology and plant sciences, we offer our experiences and observations, noting that the desire to achieve ecologically effective project outcomes is not new. We agree that there are valid questions regarding the application of the term 'restoration' to projects with minimal ecological benefits. 2. We also concur that guiding image development is critical to project success. However, we note that well-intentioned projects often drift from having initially sound restoration objectives to ultimately providing reduced ecological benefit. Our observations suggest that this phenomenon can be attributed to risk aversion and the progressive incorporation of rigid engineered elements. We term this project hardening, where natural channel boundary evolution and change (deformability) is progressively sacrificed. This artificially constrains natural fluvial dynamics and associated ecological function. 3. We agree that meaningful pre- and post-monitoring programmes are essential to understanding project success. We encourage the academic community to make relevant data sets available to facilitate the evolution of restoration science. It is appropriate for sponsoring agencies to require the collection of these data. 4. Synthesis and applications. As practitioners we suggest that more interaction with ecologists and the larger academic community is necessary so that practical experience is communicated and integrated into the emerging science of restoration. While this interaction will advance the common goal of implementing more ecologically effective projects, we also note that project participants outside the scientific community must also appreciate the challenges a project faces in meeting higher standards. These challenges are not insignificant and include convincing project sponsors, practitioners and regulators of the need for standards in project generation, implementation and monitoring on a project-by-project basis.\n      </p>", "1. Increasingly, river managers are turning from hard engineering solutions to ecologically based restoration activities in order to improve degraded waterways. River restoration projects aim to maintain or increase ecosystem goods and services while protecting downstream and coastal ecosystems. There is growing interest in applying river restoration techniques to solve environmental problems, yet little agreement exists on what constitutes a successful river restoration effort. 2. We propose five criteria for measuring success, with emphasis on an ecological perspective. First, the design of an ecological river restoration project should be based on a specified guiding image of a more dynamic, healthy river that could exist at the site. Secondly, the river's ecological condition must be measurably improved. Thirdly, the river system must be more self-sustaining and resilient to external perturbations so that only minimal follow-up maintenance is needed. Fourthly, during the construction phase, no lasting harm should be inflicted on the ecosystem. Fifthly, both pre- and post-assessment must be completed and data made publicly available. 3. Determining if these five criteria have been met for a particular project requires development of an assessment protocol. We suggest standards of evaluation for each of the five criteria and provide examples of suitable indicators. 4. Synthesis and applications. Billions of dollars are currently spent restoring streams and rivers, yet to date there are no agreed upon standards for what constitutes ecologically beneficial stream and river restoration. We propose five criteria that must be met for a river restoration project to be considered ecologically successful. It is critical that the broad restoration community, including funding agencies, practitioners and citizen restoration groups, adopt criteria for defining and assessing ecological success in restoration. Standards are needed because progress in the science and practice of river restoration has been hampered by the lack of agreed upon criteria for judging ecological success. Without well-accepted criteria that are ultimately supported by funding and implementing agencies, there is little incentive for practitioners to assess and report restoration outcomes. Improving methods and weighing the ecological benefits of various restoration approaches require organized national-level reporting systems.\n      </p>", "This paper is concerned with development and application of a conceptual model of the river restoration process and, through a specific case study, a demonstration of the challenges that arise when combining ecological and geomorphological principles with social and economic issues. Thus, it demonstrates the difference between the ideal goals of river restoration and the practical determinants of the nature of a river restoration that derive from individual and community goals. It begins by exploring theoretically what a river restoration project might involve. It then introduces the options developed for restoration of a particular case study river and the associated decisionmaking process. As a result of strong community involvement, institutional and financial regulations, the location of the restoration site in a National Park, and the influence of governmental and non-governmental organizations, the actual decisionmaking process resulted in a practical river restoration that departed significantly from the idealized goals of a restoration defined in purely scientific terms. It is argued that these practical limitations are likely to remain the dominant influence upon the nature and scope of river restoration projects.\n      </p>", "This paper provides a new discussion of how people learn through deliberative processes, drawing upon empirical analysis of a novel public engagement process for urban river restoration. Such critical evaluation is rare and yet will be crucial to both theoretical development and learning about engagement practice, not least in a policy area subject to strong regulatory drivers for public participation. The analysis supports two important learning mechanisms - the use of 'gatekeepers' of knowledge, interests and values, and the privileging of narrative. It provides new evidence of instrumental and communicative learning about shared priorities and criteria for effective river restoration that evolved through the deliberative process and directly informed the restoration scheme. It is important to question whether and how such site or context-specific learning might inform other restoration schemes. Finally, the paper questions the often ignored issue of expert learning, not least the issue of the link between individual and organizational learning.\n      </p>", "Few sources exist to draw generalizations about the incredibly diverse international river restoration community. Generalizations in the restoration literature tend to be grounded on individual experiences or logical conjecture. To fill this perceived gap, an international web-based survey was launched. Over 500 respondents from 37 different countries participated. The results, posted on the web, act as a database of perceptions and individual experiences, from which the restoration community can make their own interpretations. With three examples, we contrast scientific conjecture with the perceptions of the restoration community who participated in this survey.\n      </p>", "In the past half century, many waterbird populations in Chesapeake Bay have declined or shifted ranges, indicating major ecological changes have occurred. While many studies have focused on the problems associated with environmental degradation such as the losses of coastal wetlands and submerged vegetation, a number of restoration efforts have been launched in the past few decades to reverse the \"sea of despair.\" Most pertinent to waterbirds, restoration of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) beds, tidal wetland restoration, oyster reef restoration, and island creation/restoration have benefited a number of species. State and federal agencies and nongovernment agencies have formed partnerships to spawn many projects ranging in size from less than 0.5 ha to ca. 1,000 ha. While most SAV, wetland, and oyster reef projects have struggled to different degrees over the past ten to twenty years with inconsistent methods, irregular monitoring, and unknown reasons for failures, recent improvements in techniques and application of adaptive management have been made. The large dredge-material island projects at Hart-Miller Island near Baltimore, Poplar Island west of Tilghman Island, Maryland, and Craney Island in Portsmouth, Virginia have provided large outdoor \"laboratories\" for wildlife, fishery, and wetland habitat creation. All three have proven to be important for nesting waterbirds and migrant shorebirds and waterfowl; however nesting populations at all three islands have been compromised to different degrees by predators. Restoration success for waterbirds and other natural resources depends on: (1) establishing realistic, quantifiable objectives and performance criteria, (2) continued monitoring and management (e.g., predator control), (3) targeted research to determine causality, and (4) careful evaluation under an adaptive management regime.\n      </p>", "The purpose of this paper is to promote a broad and flexible perspective on ecological restoration of Southwestern (U.S.) ponderosa pine forests. Ponderosa pine forests in the region have been radically altered by Euro-American land uses, including livestock grazing, fire suppression, and logging. Dense thickets of young trees now abound, old-growth and biodiversity have declined, and human and ecological communities are increasingly vulnerable to destructive crown fires. A consensus has emerged that it is urgent to restore more natural conditions to these forests. Efforts to restore Southwestern forests will require extensive projects employing varying combinations of young-tree thinning and reintroduction of low-intensity fires. Treatments must be flexible enough to recognize and accommodate: high levels of natural heterogeneity; dynamic ecosystems; wildlife and other biodiversity considerations; scientific uncertainty; and the challenges of on-the-ground implementation. Ecological restoration should reset ecosystem trends toward an envelope of \"natural variability,\" including the reestablishment of natural processes. Reconstructed historic reference conditions are best used as general guides rather than rigid restoration prescriptions. In the long term, the best way to align forest conditions to track ongoing climate changes is to restore fire, which naturally correlates with current climate. Some stands need substantial structural manipulation (thinning) before fire can safely be reintroduced. In other areas, such as large wilderness and roadless areas, fire alone may suffice as the main tool of ecological restoration, recreating the natural interaction of structure and process. Impatience, overreaction to crown fire risks, extractive economics, or hubris could lead to widespread application of highly intrusive treatments that may further damage forest ecosystems. Investments in research and monitoring of restoration treatments are essential to refine restoration methods. We support the development and implementation of a diverse range of scientifically viable restoration approaches in these forests, suggest principles for ecologically sound restoration that immediately reduce crown fire risk and incrementally return natural variability and resilience to Southwestern forests, and present ecological perspectives on several forest restoration approaches.\n      </p>", "We conducted a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) study using larval digeneans infecting the California horn snail, Cerithidea californica, to evaluate the success of an ecological restoration project at Carpinteria Salt Marsh in California, USA. Digenean trematodes are parasites with complex life cycles requiring birds and other vertebrates as final hosts. We tested two hypotheses for prevalence and species richness of larval trematodes in C. californica: (1) prior to the restoration, sites to be restored would have lower trematode prevalence and species richness relative to unimpacted control sites, and (2) that these differences would diminish after restoration. The sites to be restored were initially degraded for trematode species. They had a mean trematode prevalence (12%) and species richness (4.5 species) that were lower than control sites (28% trematode prevalence and 7 species). Despite the differences in prevalence, the proportional representation of each trematode species in the total community was similar between sites to be restored and control sites. Over the six years following restoration, trematode prevalence nearly quadrupled at restored sites (43%) while the prevalence at control sites (26%) remained unchanged. In addition, species richness at restored sites doubled (9 species), while species richness at the control sites (7.8 species) did not change. Immediately after restoration, the relative abundance of trematode species using fishes as second intermediate hosts declined while those using molluscs as second intermediate hosts increased. Trematode communities at restored and control sites gradually returned to being similar. We interpret the increase in trematode prevalence and species richness at restored sites to be a direct consequence of changes in bird use of the restored habitat. This study demonstrates a new comparative technique for assessing wetlands, and while it does not supplant biotic surveys, it informs such taxonomic lists. Most importantly, it provides a synthetic quantification of the linkages among species in wetland food webs.\n      </p>", "Understanding human attitudes often is vital to the success of restoration projects, especially those involving controversial species such as carnivores. Support for restoration activities may differ depending on residence location of the respondent; thus, understanding the spatial distribution of attitudes is important when selecting suitable restoration sites. We used black bear (Ursus americanus) restoration as an example of how to calculate and use a spatially explicit model of human attitudes based on demographic variables to select restoration sites in Mississippi, USA. We sampled 2 populations (5,975 landowners adjacent to 10 public land areas and a random sample of 490 Mississippians) to determine human attitudes toward black bear reintroduction in Mississippi. We chose a series of reintroduction and demographic questions to develop 2 logistic regression models to predict support for reintroduction, and we validated the models. One model was developed on all demographic variables (how many acres respondents owned in Mississippi and for how long, as well as their age, sex, education, income, community size, and race) to determine the relationship between support for reintroduction and demographic variables. The second model used only age, race, and sex demographic variables. Age, community size, race, sex, and number of years of landownership were significant predictors of support for bear restoration for the first model; and age, race, and sex were significant predictors for the second model. Using the second model and the U.S. Census Bureau (1990) block group data, we predicted the proportion of each block group supporting restoration. Most of Mississippi had block groups with &gt;50% support for bear restoration. We were able to determine a statewide distribution of attitudes. Additionally, we documented that attitudes of landowners immediately adjacent to public land may differ from those of residents of the area surrounding the public land (both adjacent and not). We suggest using our approach for other restoration projects to better integrate human attitudes into the restoration program.\n      </p>", "1. Wood is increasingly used in restoration projects to improve the hydromorphological and ecological status of streams and rivers. However, despite their growing importance, only a few of these projects are described in the open literature. To aid practitioners, we conducted a postal mail survey to summarize the experiences gained in central Europe and compile data on 50 projects. 2. Our results indicated the potential for improvement from an ecological point of view, as the number and total wood volume, and the median volume of single wood structures placed in the streams per project, were low compared with the potential natural state. Moreover, many wood structures were placed nearly parallel to the water flow, reducing their beneficial effect on stream hydraulics and morphology. 3. Restoration success has been monitored in only 58% of the projects. General conclusions drawn include the following. (i) The potential effects of wood placement must be evaluated within a watershed and reach-scale context. (ii) Wood measures are most successful if they mimic natural wood. (iii) Effects of wood structures on stream morphology are strongly dependent on conditions such as stream size and hydrology. (iv) Wood placement has positive effects on several fish species. (v) Most projects revealed a rapid improvement of the hydromorphological status. 4. Most of the wood structures have been fixed, called 'hard engineering'. However, soft engineering methods (use of non-fixed wood structures) are known to result in more natural channel features for individual stream types, sizes and sites, and are significantly more cost-effective. 5. Synthesis and applications. Large wood has been used successfully in several projects in central Europe, predominantly to increase the general structural complexity using fixed wood structures. Our results recommend the use of less costly soft engineering techniques (non-fixed wood structures), higher amounts of wood, larger wood structures and improved monitoring programmes for future restoration projects comparable with those in this study. We recommend the use of 'passive restoration' methods (restoring the process of wood recruitment on large scales) rather than 'active restoration' (placement of wood structures on a reach scale), as passive restoration avoids the risk of non-natural amounts or diversity of wood loading developing within streams. Local, active placement of wood structures must be considered as an interim measure until passive restoration methods have increased recruitment sufficiently.\n      </p>", "In response to catastrophic wildfires, wide-reaching forest management policies have been enacted in recent years, most notably the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003. A key premise underlying these policies is that fire suppression has resulted in denser forests than were present historically in some western forest types. Therefore, although reducing the threat of wildfire is the primary goal, forest managers commonly view fuel treatments as a means to restore historic forest structure in those forest types that are outside of their historic range of variation. This study evaluates where both wildfire mitigation and restoration of historic forest structure are potentially needed in the ponderosa pine-dominated montane forest zone of Boulder County, Colorado. Two spatial models were overlain: a model of potential fireline intensity and a model of historic fire frequency. The overlay was then aggregated by land management classes. Contrary to current assumptions, results of this study indicate that both wildfire mitigation and restoration of historic forest structure are needed in only a small part of the study area, primarily at low elevations. Furthermore, little of this land is located on Forest Service land where most of the current thinning projects are taking place. We question the validity of thinning as a means both to reduce the threat of wildfire and to restore historic forest structure in the absence of site-specific data collection on past and present landscape conditions.\n      </p>", "Aspects of northern Gulf of Mexico (NGOM) (Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida panhandle) processes and barrier islands that are pertinent to their geomorphologic response are contrasted with the broader knowledge base summarized by Schwartz (1973) and Leatherman (1979, 1985). Salient findings from studies documenting the short-term (storm-induced; timescales of hours, days, and weeks) and long-term (timescales of years, decades, and centuries) response of barrier island systems in the NGOM are synthesized into a conceptual model. The conceptual model illustrates the hypothetical evolution of three barrier island morphologies as they evolve through a typical Category 1-2 hurricane, including poststorm recovery (days to weeks) and long-term evolution (years to decades). Primary factors in barrier island geomorphologic response to storms, regardless of location, are the elevation of the island relative to storm (surge plus setup) elevation, and duration of the storm. Unique aspects of the NGOM barrier islands, compared with knowledge summarized for other barrier types, include (1) storm paths, wind speed, and large bays that create the potential for both Gulf and bayshore erosion and (2) in Louisiana and Mississippi, the potential for loading of the underlying substrate by the barrier island, which, through time, increases consolidation, relative sea level rise, overwash, morphologic change, and migration. We recommend that design of large-scale beach restoration projects incorporate the potential for (1) time-dependent consolidation of the underlying sediment due to project loading and future migration, (2) Gulf and bayshore erosion and overwash, and (3) eolian transport toward the Gulf from north winds.\n      </p>", "1. We do not know which aspects of community structure and ecosystem processes are restorable for most ecosystems, yet this information is crucial for achieving successful restoration. 2. We quantified three success criteria for 8-10-year-old grassland plantings in large-scale tallgrass prairie restoration (reconstruction) sites relative to three nearby prairie remnant sites. The restoration sites included management of native ungulates and fire, important regulators of diversity and patchiness in intact grasslands. These have not been incorporated simultaneously into previous studies of restoration success. 3. We used the additive partitioning model of diversity, where \u03b1 is neighbourhood (quadrat) scale diversity, \u03b2 is accumulation of species diversity across neighbourhoods, and \u03b3 is total diversity. We decomposed \u03b1 into richness and evenness to determine if both were equally restored. 4. The proportion of exotic biomass was similar between the restoration and remnant sites, but the proportion of exotic species and above-ground net primary productivity remained between two and four times higher in the restoration sites. 5. Alpha diversity (Simpson's 1/D) and richness (S) values were exceptionally high in remnant sites, and approximately twice those of the restoration sites. Alpha evenness was similar between the restoration and remnant sites. 6. Distance per se between quadrats was not related to diversity after accumulated quadrat area was taken into account. Therefore, we may be able to use the additive partitioning model of diversity in areas that differ in size, at least at the scale of this study. 7. Contrary to our original predictions, the proportion of \u03b2 diversity (1 - D) was approximately twice as high in the restoration sites than in remnant sites, possibly because patches of individual species were larger in the restoration. 8. Synthesis and applications. We have shown that current restoration methods are unable to restore plant diversity in tallgrass prairie. Grassland restoration will be improved if the number of species that co-exist can be increased. New, local-scale restoration techniques are needed to replicate the high levels of diversity observed in tallgrass prairie remnant sites.\n      </p>", "Over the last 60 years changes to the management of species-rich mesotrophic grasslands have resulted in the large-scale loss and degradation of this habitat across Europe. Restoration of such grasslands on agriculturally improved pastures provides a potentially valuable approach to the conservation of these threatened areas. Over a four-year period a replicated block design was used to test the effects of seed addition (green hay spreading and brush harvest collection) and soil disturbance on the restoration of phytophagous beetle and plant communities. Patterns of increasing restoration success, particularly where hay spreading and soil disturbance were used in combination, were identified for the phytophagous beetles. In the case of the plants, however, initial differences in restoration success in response to these same treatments were not followed by subsequent temporal changes in plant community similarity to target mesotrophic grassland. It is possible that the long-term consequences of the management treatments would not be the establishment of beetle and plant communities characteristic of the targets for restoration. Restoration management to enhance plant establishment using hay spreading and soil disturbance techniques would, however, still increase community similarity in both taxa to that of species-rich mesotrophic grasslands, and so raise their conservation value.\n      </p>", "The Everglades system has suffered drastic changes to its life-blood, water. Dramatic population increases and intensive drainage efforts have significantly altered water quantity, quality, timing, and distribution through the system. This paper reviews water management alterations to the Everglades system and changes in the region's population and demography documenting the interconnectivity of the human and natural system. Specific ramifications of population and economic growth on land use, water use, and flood control are examined as a backdrop for discussion of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration efforts now underway. Through discussion of these ramifications and restoration efforts, challenges and opportunities for successful Everglades restoration are identified.\n      </p>", "Rapid exchange of stream water and groundwater in streambeds creates hotspots of biogeochemical cycling of redox-sensitive solutes. Although stream-groundwater interaction can be increased through stream restoration, there are few detailed studies of the increased heterogeneity of water and solute fluxes through the streambed and associated patterns of biogeochemical processes around stream restoration structures. In this study, we examined the seasonal patterns of water and solute fluxes through the streambed around a stream restoration structure to relate patterns of water flux through the streambed to morphology of the channel and biogeochemical processes occurring in the bed. We characterized different biogeochemical zones in the streambed using principal component analysis (PCA) and examined the change in spatial patterns of these zones during different seasons. The PCA results show that two principal components summarized 83% of the variance in the original data set. Streambed pore water was characterized as oxic (indicating production of nitrate), anoxic (indicating sulfate, iron and manganese reduction), or stream-like (indicating there was minimal change in the stream water chemistry in the bed). Regardless of season of the year, anoxic zones were predominantly located upstream of the structure, in a low-velocity pool, and oxic zones were predominantly located downstream of the structure, in a turbulent riffle. We expect structures that span the full channel, are impermeable, and permanent, such as those installed in natural channel design restoration will similarly impact biogeochemical processing in the streambed. The installation of these types of restoration structures may be a way to increase the degree of biogeochemical cycling in stream ecosystems.\n      </p>", "In this study, we examine complex responses by macrobenthic assemblages to extensive beach restoration affecting 7 km of open shoreline at Perdido Key, Florida. Beach restoration consisted of two phases, beach nourishment and profile nourishment, each phase lasting roughly one year. We examined macro-benthic responses using an optimal impact study design incorporating ten macrobenthic surveys completed over a three-year period. This study is important because of its geographical region, its relatively large spatial scale, its long duration, and its consideration of both nearshore assemblages from high energy sandy beaches and diverse assemblages from stable offshore habitats. The physical environment was altered by beach restoration through changes in depth profiles and sediment composition as well as through sediment dynamics. Various macrobenthic responses attributable to beach restoration included: decreased species richness and total density, enhanced fluctuations in those indices, variation in abundances of key indicator taxa, and shifts in macrobenthic assemblage structure. One long-term impact of beach nourishment at nearshore stations included the development of macrobenthic assemblages characteristic of steep depth profiles. Two long-term negative impacts of beach restoration at offshore stations included one from beach nourishment and another from profile nourishment. After beach nourishment, the macrobenthic assemblage structure changed markedly across a considerable offshore area in concert with increased silt/clay loading. Macrobenthic impacts from silt/clay loading were still evident at the end of the study, more than two years after beach nourishment. Macrobenthic populations fluctuated widely at the farthest seaward stations from apparent sediment disturbance, both during and after profile nourishment. These fluctuations involved total densities, species richness, and densities of key indicator taxa. Macrobenthic fluctuations continued through the end of the study, although profile nourishment was completed for more than one year prior to that time. Considerable macrobenthic recovery was apparent during the study, although macrobenthic recovery remained indeterminate in some places. Long-term macrobenthic impacts at several offshore stations supported the hypothesis that diverse offshore assemblages may be less resilient than contiguous nearshore sandy-beach assemblages.\n      </p>", "Two outstanding papers on restoration and succession are briefly discussed as model papers for the type of research papers Appl. Veg. Sci. should publish. The paper on restoration concentrates on the introduction of hay to a site in order to speed up the introduction of target species. The paper on succession discusses the importance of plant colonization 'windows' opened by extreme weather events for succession and for offering optimum periods for intervention in restoration practice. Some remarks are also made on the electronic availability of ecology papers.\n      </p>", "River floodplains have the potential to remove nitrate from water through denitrification, the anaerobic microbial conversion of nitrate to nitrogen gas. An important factor in this process is the interaction of river water with floodplain soil; however, many rivers have been disconnected from their historic floodplains by levees. To test the effect of reflooding a degraded floodplain on nitrate removal, we studied changes in soil denitrification rates on the Baraboo River floodplain in Wisconsin, USA, as it underwent restoration. Prior to this study, the site had been leveed, drained, and farmed for more than 50 years. In late fall 2002, the field drainage system was removed, and a gate structure was installed to allow controlled flooding of this site with river water. Soil moisture was extremely variable among zones and months and reflected local weather. Soil organic matter was stable over the study period with differences occurring along the elevation gradient. High soil nitrate concentrations occurred in dry, relatively organic-poor soil samples and, conversely, all samples with high moisture soils characterized by low nitrate. We measured denitrification in static cores and potential denitrification in bulk samples amended with carbon and nitrogen, one year before and two years following the manipulation. Denitrification rates showed high temporal and spatial variability. Static core rates of individual sites ranged widely (from 0.00 to 16.7 ug N\u2082O-N[kg soiir]\u207b\u00b9.h\u207b\u00b9, mean \u00b1 SD = 1.10 \u00b1 3.02), and denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) rates were similar with a slightly higher mean (from 0.00 to 15.0 micrograms N\u2082O-N[kg soil]\u207b\u00b9.h\u207b\u00b9, 1.41 \u00b1 1.98). Denitrification was not well-correlated with soil nitrate, organic matter content, or moisture levels, the three parameters typically thought to control denitrification. Static core denitrification rates were not significantly different across years, and DEA rates decreased slightly the second year after restoration. These results demonstrate that restored agricultural soil has the potential for denitrification, but that floodplain restoration did not immediately improve this potential. Future floodplain restorations should be designed to test alternative methods of increasing denitrification.\n      </p>", "Question: Which restoration measures (introduction of donor diaspore material, application of straw mulch, alteration of residual peat depths) contribute to the establishment of a fen plant community on minerotrophic surfaces after peat mining? Location: Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup peatland, southern Qu\u00e9bec, Canada at 100 m a.s.l. Methods: The effectiveness of introducing fen plants with the application of donor diaspore material was tested. The donor diaspore material, containing seeds, rhizomes, moss fragments, and other plant propagules, was collected from two different types of natural fens. We tested whether the application of straw mulch would increase fen species cover and biodiversity compared to control plots without straw mulch. Terrace levels of different peat depths (15 cm, 40 cm, and 56 cm) were created to test the effects of different environmental site conditions on the success of re-vegetation. Results: Applying donor seed bank from natural fens was found to significantly increase fen plant cover and richness after the two growing seasons. Straw mulch proved to significantly increase fen plant richness. The intermediate terrace level (40 cm) had the highest fen plant establishment. Compared to reference sites, the low terrace level (15 cm) was richer in base cations, whereas the high terrace level (56 cm) was much drier. Conclusions: The application of donor diaspore material was demonstrated as an effective technique for establishing vascular fen plants. Further rewetting measures are considered necessary at the restoration site to create a fen ecosystem rather than simply restoring some fen species.\n      </p>", "This paper addresses some of the practical and aesthetic decisions made during the restoration of a number of Danish silent films, including whether or not to retain the authenticity of a specific film print (in the case of multiple copies with individual variances), electronic distribution priorities, access, and colour duplication technique (Desmet, colour stock, etc). The restoration of the 1913 Danish feature Atlantis, which was restored in colour in high definition for DVD, and in black and white for 35mm prints, provides a case study for understanding how curatorial interpretation and laboratory intervention impact the restoration process.\n      </p>", "Increased delivery of nitrogen due to urbanization and stream ecosystem degradation is contributing to eutrophication in coastal regions of the eastern United States. We tested whether geomorphic restoration involving hydrologic \"reconnection\" of a stream to its floodplain could increase rates of denitrification at the riparian-zone-stream interface of an urban stream in Baltimore, Maryland. Rates of denitrification measured using in situ \u00b9\u2075N tracer additions were spatially variable across sites and years and ranged from undetectable to &gt;200 micrograms N\u00b7(kg sediment)\u207b\u00b9\u00b7d\u207b\u00b9. Mean rates of denitrification were significantly greater in the restored reach of the stream at 77.4 \u00b1 12.6 micrograms N\u00b7kg\u207b\u00b9\u00b7d\u207b\u00b9(mean \u00b1 SE) as compared to the unrestored reach at 34.8 \u00b1 8.0 micrograms N\u00b7kg\u207b\u00b9\u00b7d\u207b\u00b9. Concentrations of nitrate-N in groundwater and stream water in the restored reach were also significantly lower than in the unrestored reach, but this may have also been associated with differences in sources and hydrologic flow paths. Riparian areas with low, hydrologically \"connected\" streambanks designed to promote flooding and dissipation of erosive force for storm water management had substantially higher rates of denitrification than restored high \"nonconnected\" banks and both unrestored low and high banks. Coupled measurements of hyporheic groundwater flow and in situ denitrification rates indicated that up to 1.16 mg &lt;tex-math&gt;${\\rm{NO}}_{\\rm{3}} ^{\\rm{ - }} {\\rm{ - N}}$&lt;/tex-math&gt; could be removed per liter of groundwater flow through one cubic meter of sediment at the riparian-zone-stream interface over a mean residence time of 4.97 d in the unrestored reach, and estimates of mass removal of nitrate-N in the restored reach were also considerable. Mass removal of nitrate-N appeared to be strongly influenced by hydrologic residence time in unrestored and restored reaches. Our results suggest that stream restoration designed to \"reconnect\" stream channels with floodplains can increase denitrification rates, that there can be substantial variability in the efficacy of stream restoration designs, and that more work is necessary to elucidate which designs can be effective in conjunction with watershed strategies to reduce nitrate-N sources to streams.\n      </p>", "This paper is a test of two widely held assumptions in the practice of riparian restoration: (1) if physical processes are restored, plant communities will naturally reassemble themselves, and (2) restored communities will resemble reference sites. Seasonal flooding was restored to two interconnected floodplains in the Central Valley of California (USA), and plant community establishment was studied for six years at 300 permanent vegetation plots. If these two assumptions are valid, then the two floodplains should end up with similar plant assemblages, and they should both have followed a similar trajectory. Then, once the relevant physical processes are restored, (1) plots with similar environmental conditions should have increasingly similar species compositions, (2) plant communities should become more stable and cohesive, (3) both species distributions and plant communities should respond to changes in environmental conditions, (4) plot diversity should decrease, and (5) perennial species should replace annuals. The plots were classified into communities using TWINSPAN, and these communities differed significantly with respect to the main environmental gradient (inundation). Braycurtis similarities were calculated for each pair of plots. Patterns in similarity were used to test the strength of communities and the relative importance of proximity and inundation. On the northern floodplain, there was a trend of increasing similarity for plots with similar environmental conditions over the course of the study; plant communities became more stable and clearly responded to changes in environmental conditions. Plot diversity decreased, and the proportion of perennial species increased. On the southern floodplain, however, plots with similar environmental conditions became less similar, while plots that were close together became more similar; plant communities did not become more stable though they did shift in response to changes in environmental conditions. Taken together, this evidence suggests that assembly of communities is more stochastic than deterministic.\n      </p>", "Southwestern ponderosa pine forests were dramatically altered by fire regime disruption that accompanied Euro-American settlement in the 1800s. Major changes include increased tree density, diminished herbaceous cover, and a shift from a frequent low-intensity fire regime to a stand-replacing fire regime. Ecological restoration via thinning and prescribed burning is being widely applied to return forests to the pre-settlement condition, but the effects of restoration on ecosystem function are unknown. We measured carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) fluxes during the first two years after the implementation of a replicated field experiment comparing thinning and composite (thinning, forest floor fuel reduction, and prescribed burning) restoration treatments to untreated controls in a ponderosa pine forest in northern Arizona, USA. Total net primary productivity ( $260 g C\\cdot m^{-2}\\cdot yr^{-1}$ ) was similar among treatments because a 30-50% decrease in pine foliage and fine-root production in restored ecosystems was balanced by greater wood, coarse root, and herbaceous production. Herbaceous plants accounted for &lt;20% of total plant C, N, and P uptake in the controls but from 25% to 70% in restored plots. Total plant N uptake was $\\sim 3 g N\\cdot m^{-2}\\cdot yr^{-1}$ in all treatments, but net N mineralization was just one-half and two-thirds of this value in the control and composite restoration, respectively. Element flux rates in controls generally declined more in a drought year than rates in restoration treatments. In this ponderosa pine forest, ecological restoration that emulated pre-settlement stand structure and fire characteristics had a small effect on plant C, N, and P fluxes at the whole ecosystem level because lower pine foliage and fine-root fluxes in treated plots (compared to controls) were approximately balanced by higher fluxes in wood and herbaceous plants.\n      </p>", "We used spatial data to identify potential areas for elk (Cervus elaphus) restoration in Arkansas. To assess habitat, we used locations of 239 elk groups collected from helicopter surveys in the Buffalo National River area of northwestern Arkansas, USA, from 1992 to 2002. We calculated the Mahalanobis distance (D\u00b2) statistic based on the relationship between those elk-group locations and a suite of 9 landscape variables to evaluate winter habitat in Arkansas. We tested model performance in the Buffalo National River area by comparing the D\u00b2 values of pixels representing areas with and without elk pellets along 19 fixed-width transects surveyed in March 2002. Pixels with elk scat had lower D\u00b2 values than pixels in which we found no pellets (logistic regression: Wald \u03c7\u00b2 = 24.37, P &lt; 0.001), indicating that habitat characteristics were similar to those selected by the aerially surveyed elk. Our D\u00b2 model indicated that the best elk habitat primarily occurred in northern and western Arkansas and was associated with areas of high landscape heterogeneity, heavy forest cover, gently sloping ridge tops and valleys, low human population density, and low road densities. To assess the potential for elk-human conflicts in Arkansas, we used the analytical hierarchy process to rank the importance of 8 criteria based on expert opinion from biologists involved in elk management. The biologists ranked availability of forage on public lands as having the strongest influence on the potential for elk-human conflict (33%), followed by human population growth rate (22%) and the amount of private land in row crops (18%). We then applied those rankings in a weighted linear summation to map the relative potential for elk-human conflict. Finally, we used white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) densities to identify areas where success of elk restoration may be hampered due to meningeal worm (Parelaphostrongylus tenuis) transmission. By combining results of the 3 spatial data layers (i.e., habitat model, elk-human conflict model, deer density), our model indicated that restoration sites located in west-central and north-central Arkansas were most favorable for reintroduction.\n      </p>", "1. Many grasslands in north-west Europe are productive but species-poor communities resulting from intensive agriculture. Reducing the intensity of management under agri-environment schemes has often failed to increase botanical diversity. We investigated biotic and abiotic constraints on diversification by manipulating seed and microsite availability, soil fertility, resource competition, herbivory and deficiencies in the soil microbial community. 2. The effectiveness of 13 restoration treatments was investigated over 4 years in a randomized block experiment established in two productive grasslands in central-east and south-west England. 3. Severe disturbance involving turf removal followed by seed addition was the most effective and reliable means of increasing grassland diversity. Disturbance by multiple harrowing was moderately effective but was enhanced by molluscicide application to reduce seedling herbivory and by sowing the hemiparasite Rhinanthus to reduce competition from grasses. 4. Low-level disturbance by grazing or slot-seeding was ineffective in increasing diversity. Inoculation with soil microbial communities from species-rich grasslands had no effect on botanical diversity. Nitrogen and potassium fertilizer addition accelerated off-take of phosphorus in cut herbage but did not cause a reduction in soil phosphorus or increase botanical diversity. 5. Different grazing management regimes had little impact on diversity. This may reflect the constraining effect of the July hay cut on species dispersal and colonization. 6. Synthesis and applications. Three alternative approaches to grassland diversification, with different outcomes, are recommended. (i) High intervention deturfing, which would create patches with low competitive conditions for rapid and reliable establishment of the target community. For reasons of cost and practicality this can only be done over small areas but will form source populations for subsequent spread. (ii) Moderate intervention (harrowing or slot-seeding) over large areas, which would establish a limited number of desirable, generalist species that perform well in restoration. This method is low cost and rapid but the increases in biodiversity are less predictable. (iii) Phased restoration, which would complement the above approaches. Productivity and competition are reduced over 3-5 years using Rhinanthus or fertilizers to accelerate phosphorus off-take. After this time harrowing and seeding should allow a wide range of more specialist species to establish. However, further research is required to determine the long-term effectiveness of these approaches.\n      </p>", "1. Conversion of established forests of undesirable species composition or structure to a multi-age, native forest community is a common restoration goal. However, for some ecosystems, the complexity of multiple disturbances and biotic factors requires unique approaches to advance community development. We use the longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Miller) ecosystem as a model of such a restoration paradigm with an approach that utilizes the undesirable species as a functional or structural bridge to foster ecological processes. 2. In the conversion of adult slash pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm.) plantations to the biologically diverse longleaf pine forests that once dominated the south-eastern US Coastal Plain, we examine techniques for restoring and maintaining critical structural and functional components. Through partial and variable retention of the undesirable slash pine canopy, establishment of longleaf pine seedlings is facilitated, while maintaining fuels essential for prescribed fire, a necessary management practice for longleaf pine. Furthermore, we project that with subsequent fires, fine fuels and species richness will be encouraged in the ground cover, and with future slash canopy harvest, established longleaf pine seedlings will be released. 3. In this study, we present a statistical approach that examines the compositional movement of vegetation in restoration sites over time relative to the reference conditions that are also changing through time. 4. Synthesis and applications. Restoration efforts that remove undesirable species initially may actually hinder rather than facilitate restoration. Restoration of fire-maintained ecosystems in which the production of adequate fuels is an important consideration may require the retention of a portion of the existing canopy to provide fuels during the restoration process, even if the canopy is comprised of less preferred species. Individual species often provide similar structural features and influences on function within an ecosystem; thus, systems other than longleaf pine may also benefit from retention of the undesirable species through the restoration process. We conclude that a gradual approach to restoration may be advantageous when legacies of past management have altered complex ecological dynamics and promoted development along a successional pathway strongly differing from that of the reference conditions.\n      </p>", "We develop both mathematical models and computational algorithms for variational denoising and restoration of nonflat image features. Nonflat image features are those that live on Riemannian manifolds, instead of on the Euclidean spaces. Familiar examples include the orientation feature (from optical flows or gradient flows) that lives on the unit circle S1, the alignment feature (from fingerprint waves or certain texture images) that lives on the real projective line RP1, and the chromaticity feature (from color images) that lives on the unit sphere S2. In this paper, we apply the variational method to denoise and restore general nonflat image features. Mathematical models for both continuous image domains and discrete domains (or graphs) are constructed. Riemannian objects such as metric, distance and Levi-Civita connection play important roles in the models. Computational algorithms are also developed for the resulting nonlinear equations. The mathematical framework can be applied to restoring general nonflat data outside the scope of image processing and computer vision.\n      </p>", "Fluvial processes such as flooding and sediment deposition play a crucial role in structuring riparian plant communities. In rivers throughout the world, these processes have been altered by channelization and other anthropogenic stresses. Yet despite increasing awareness of the need to restore natural flow regimes for the preservation of riparian biodiversity, few studies have examined the effects of river restoration on riparian ecosystems. In this study, we examined the effects of restoration in the Ume River system, northern Sweden, where tributaries were channelized to facilitate timber floating in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Restoration at these sites involved the use of heavy machinery to replace instream boulders and remove floatway structures that had previously lined stream banks and cut off secondary channels. We compared riparian plant communities along channelized stream reaches with those along reaches that had been restored 3-10 years prior to observation. Species richness and evenness were significantly increased at restored sites, as were floodplain inundation frequencies. These findings demonstrate how river restoration and associated changes in fluvial disturbance regimes can enhance riparian biodiversity. Given that riparian ecosystems tend to support a disproportionate share of regional species pools, these findings have potentially broad implications for biodiversity conservation at regional or landscape scales.\n      </p>", "The Society for Ecological Restoration Primer on Ecological Restoration (SERPER) states, \"Ecological restoration is an intentional activity that initiates or accelerates the recovery of an ecosystem with respect to its health, integrity, and sustainability\" and attempts to return an ecosystem to its historic condition. There are questions, however, about whether changing environmental conditions such as global climate change, invasive species (including pests and diseases), human-altered disturbance regimes, and widespread land-use changes will allow return to historic conditions, what constitutes naturalness, and whether restoration should incorporate continuing management. Active, intentional management (AIM) is a conservation approach that emphasizes a full range of active and passive management techniques to manage important ecological and hydrologic processes to conserve biodiversity; reconcile conflicts over management of natural resources; and provide various goods, ecological services, and recreational and spiritual opportunities to people over the long term. AIM includes intangibles such as knowing that rare species exist, that \"wild\" places are deliberately in place, and that ecological services important to the biosphere are maintained. How does AIM compare to restoration? Can AIM meet restoration goals? Specifically, can AIM reproduce the 10 traits of pristine ecosystems identified by SERPER? Measures can be used to evaluate success. For ecosystems, diversity of vascular plants, composition of functional groups of soil organisms, biotic integrity of vertebrate communities, and biocomplexity can be measured. For landscapes, simulations can project values: 1) capacity to support vertebrate diversity; 2) forest-floor function as measured by biotic integrity; 3) ecological productivity and ability to support medium-size predators as evidenced by biomass of mammalian frugivores; 4) ecological productivity and ability to sustain large predators, subsistence hunting by Native Americans, and sport hunting, as measured by production of corvids; 5) production of wood; 6) revenues; and 7) employment, which are measures of social, economic, and environmental sustainability. Would such forests seem natural? Perhaps what is needed are experiential comparisons of the abstract purity of pristine nature with contemplative experience of wildness in an intentionally managed mosaic... to immerse oneself in an AIM forest to experience aloneness as night falls, the moon rises, and the wolf howls.\n      </p>", "The resource heterogeneity hypothesis (RHH) is frequently cited in the ecological literature as an important mechanism for maintaining species diversity. The RHH has rarely been evaluated in the context of restoration ecology in which a commonly cited goal is to restore diversity. In this study we focused on the spatial heterogeneity of total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) following restoration treatments in a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)/Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forest in western Montana, USA. Our objective was to evaluate relationships between understory species richness and TIN heterogeneity following mechanical thinning (thin-only), prescribed burning (burn-only), and mechanical thinning with prescribed burning (thin/burn) to discern the ecological and management implications of these restoration approaches. We employed a randomized block design, with three 9-ha replicates of each treatment and an untreated control. Within each treatment, we randomly established a 20 * 50 m (1000 m\u00b2) plot in which we measured species richness across the entire plot and in 12 1-m\u00b2 quadrats randomly placed within each larger plot. Additionally, we measured TIN from a grid consisting of 112 soil samples (0-5 cm) in each plot and computed standard deviations as a measure of heterogeneity. We found a correlation between the net increase in species richness and the TIN standard deviations one and two years following restoration treatments, supporting RHH. Using nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination and chisquared analysis, we found that high and low TIN quadrats contained different understory communities in 2003 and 2004, further supporting RHH. A comparison of restoration treatments demonstrated that thin/burn and burn-only treatments created higher N heterogeneity relative to the control. We also found that within prescribed burn treatments, TIN heterogeneity was positively correlated with finefuel consumption, a variable reflecting burn severity. These findings may lead to more informed restoration decisions that consider treatment effects on understory diversity in ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir ecosystems.\n      </p>", "Present tropical peat deposits are the outcome of net carbon removal from the atmosphere and form one of the largest terrestrial organic carbon stores on the Earth. Reclamation of pristine tropical peatland areas in Southeast Asia increased strikingly during the last half of the 20th century. Drainage due to land-use change is one of the main driving factors accelerating carbon loss from the ecosystem. Dams were built in drainage-affected peatland area canals in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, in order to evaluate major patterns in gaseous carbon dioxide and methane fluxes and in peat hydrology immediately before and after hydrologic restoration. The sites included peat swamp forest and deforested burned area, both affected by drainage for nearly 10 years. Higher annual minimum soil water table levels prevailed on both sites after restoration; the deforested site water table level prevailed considerably longer near the peat surface, and the forest water table level remained for a longer period in the topmost 30 cm peat profile after restoration. Forest soil gas fluxes were clearly higher in comparison to the deforested area. Cumulative forest floor CO2 emissions (7305\u20147444 g.m-2.yr-1; 166.0\u2014169.2 mol CO2.m-2.yr-1) and the deforested site CO2 emissions (2781\u20142608 g.m-2.yr-1; 63.2\u201459.3 mol CO2.m-2.yr-1) did not markedly reflect the notably differing hydrological conditions the year before and after restoration. The forest floor was a weak CH\u2084 sink (-0.208 to -0.368 g.m-2.yr-1; -13.0 to -22.9 mmol CH\u2084.m-2.yr-1) and the deforested site a comparable CH\u2084 source (0.197\u20140.275 g.m-2.yr-1; 12.3\u201417.1 mmol CH\u2084.m-2.yr-1) in the study period. In general, higher soil water table levels had a relatively small effect on the annual CH\u2084 emission budgets. In the two site types the gas flux response into hydrological conditions in degraded tropical peat can be attributed to differing CO2 and CH\u2084 dynamics, peat physical characteristics, and vegetation.\n      </p>", "1. To encourage more project assessment and reporting of restoration outcomes, Palmer et al. (2005) propose five criteria for assessing the ecological success of river restoration. They also suggest that these criteria should help to clarify which activities should qualify for ecological restoration funding and facilitate consistency about what constitutes an ecologically successful restoration project. 2. We critique the five criteria and agree they all merit inclusion in an assessment of successful river restoration. However, the practical application of measuring self-sustainability (resilience) following restoration is potentially problematic and an explicit timeframe is needed to evaluate the results of the restoration. 3. A sixth criterion is proposed that encourages specific hypotheses and/or a conceptual model of the ecological mechanisms by which the proposed activities will achieve their target. This would enhance our understanding of the mechanisms at play for successful river restoration, and provide a more powerful deductive framework likely to lead to appropriate practices that can be applied across rivers. To explore the potential practical applicability of these six criteria, we applied them to a recently published example of river restoration to ascertain its ecological success. 4. Synthesis and applications. We agree with the criteria proposed by Palmer et al. (2005), although the problems of measuring resilience and defining a timeline for recovery should be addressed. We suggest strengthening the deductive framework of restoration projects by formulating some sort of conceptual model. This step could involve scientists, and be a useful way of involving science more explicitly in restoration activities. Agreed-upon criteria for successful restoration will greatly facilitate evaluation of river ecosystem recovery at the critical broader scales where our knowledge is still limited.\n      </p>", "'Back-to-the-future' (BTF) is an integrative approach to a restoration ecology of the oceans that attempts to solve the fisheries crisis. To this end, it harnesses the latest understanding of ecosystem processes, developments in whole ecosystem simulation modelling, and insight into the human dimension of fisheries management. BTF includes new methods for describing past ecosystems, designing fisheries that meet criteria for sustainability and responsibility, and evaluating the costs and benefits of fisheries in restored ecosystems. Evaluation of alternative policy choices, involving trade-offs between conservation and economic values, employs a range of economic, social and ecological measures. Automated searches maximize values of objective functions, and the methodology includes analyses of model parameter uncertainty. Participatory workshops attempt to maximize compliance by fostering a sense of ownership among all stakeholders. Some challenges that have still to be met include improving methods for quantitatively describing the past, reducing uncertainty in ecosystem simulation techniques and in making policy choices robust against climate change. Critical issues include whether past ecosystems make viable policy goals, and whether desirable goals may be reached from today's ecosystem. Examples from case studies in British Columbia, Newfoundland and elsewhere are presented.\n      </p>", "Soil nitrogen enrichment and consequent vigorous weed growth are thought to hinder the restoration of tallgrass prairie. Adding carbon to the soil may facilitate prairie restoration by inducing immobilization of plant-available nitrogen. Early attempts to use this method, however, have had mixed results. Success of C addition depends on three conditions: weeds must suppress prairie species in the absence of C addition, weeds must be nitrophilic relative to prairie species, and C addition must result in a large enough decrease in N to alter the balance of competition among weeds and prairie species. We examined these conditions by comparing productivity of 10 weeds and 11 tallgrass prairie species under 14 levels of C addition, ranging from 84 to 3346 g C/m2. Carbon was tilled into the soil prior to planting. To control for non-N effects of C addition, N was added to a subset of plots. Relative to untreated plots, the highest level of C addition resulted in an 86% decrease in available NO3-N, a 14 x increase in early season light availability, a 54% decrease in weed biomass, and a sevenfold increase in prairie biomass. Nitrogen addition significantly reduced or reversed all of these effects. Significant species-specific responses to C addition included decreased biomass for six annual weeds and increased biomass for six prairie species, one annual weed, and three perennial weeds. These results suggest that C addition may be a useful tool for restoring N-limited plant communities.\n      </p>", "Changes in the plant community and ecosystem properties that follow the conversion of agriculture to restored tallgrass prairies are poorly understood. Beginning in 1995, we established a species-rich, restored prairie chronosequence where ~3 ha of agricultural land have been converted to tallgrass prairie each year. Our goals were to examine differences in ecosystem properties between these restored prairies and adjacent agricultural fields and to determine changes in, and potential interactions between, the plant community and ecosystem properties that occur over time in the restored prairies. During the summers of 2000-2002, we examined species cover, soil C and N, potential net C and N mineralization, litter mass, soil texture, and bulk density across the 6- to 8-year-old prairie chronosequence and adjacent agricultural fields in southern Minnesota. We also established experimentally fertilized, watered, and control plots in the prairie chronosequence to examine the degree of nitrogen limitation on aboveground and belowground net primary production (ANPP and BNPP). Large shifts in functional diversity occurred within three growing seasons. First-year prairies were dominated by annuals and biennials. By the second growing season, perennial native composites had become dominant, followed by a significant shift to warm-season C4 grasses in prairies $\\geq 3 yr$ old. Ecosystem properties that changed with the rise of C4 grasses included increased BNPP, litter mass, and C mineralization rates and decreased N mineralization rates. ANPP increased significantly with N fertilization but did not vary between young and old prairies with dramatically different plant community composition. Total soil C and N were not significantly different between prairie and agricultural soils in the depths examined (0-10, 10-20, 20-35, 35-50, 50-65 cm). We compared the results from our species-rich prairie restoration to published data on ecosystem function in other restored grasslands, such as Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and old-field successional sites. Results suggest that rapid changes in functional diversity can have large impacts on ecosystem-level properties, causing community- and system-level dynamics in species-rich prairie restorations to converge with those from low-diversity managed grasslands.\n      </p>", "1. Mycorrhizae form a critical link between above-ground plants and the soil system by influencing plant nutrition, nutrient cycling and soil structure. Understanding how mycorrhizae respond to disturbances may lead to important advances in interpreting above-ground plant recovery. 2. The inoculum potential for arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi was investigated in thinned-only, thinned and prescribed burned (both restoration treatments) and unthinned and unburned control stands in northern Arizona ponderosa pine forests. The relationships between mycorrhizal fungal propagule densities and plant community and soil properties were quantified. 3. The relative amount of infective propagules of AM fungi was significantly higher in samples collected from both restoration treatments than their paired controls (unthinned and unburned stands). In contrast, the same restoration treatments had no significant effect on the relative amount of infective propagules of EM fungi. 4. The relative amount of infective propagules of AM fungi was significantly positively correlated with graminoid cover and herbaceous understorey species richness and negatively correlated with overstorey tree canopy cover and litter cover. 5. Synthesis and applications. These results indicate that population densities of AM fungi can rapidly increase following restoration treatments in northern Arizona ponderosa pine forests. This has important implications for restoring the herbaceous understorey of these forests because most understorey plants depend on AM associations for normal growth. These results also can be applied to other ecosystems that are in a state of restoration or where the role of fire is just beginning to be understood.\n      </p>", "1. In the face of continuing anthropogenic stressors to freshwater systems world-wide, the natural resilience and resistance of the freshwater ecosystems that enables them to cope with or recover rapidly from certain levels of perturbation is under significant threat. In many systems, the changes brought about through human activities have significantly altered the physical habitat and ecological functioning of the natural systems. 2. Given the importance of freshwater systems in the provision of ecological services and diverse habitats for a huge range of species, there is a clear need for restoration that can maintain sustainable ecological services whilst reinstating ecosystem function and habitat range. 3. While restoration has been attracting huge financial investment in recent times, to date there has been little or no consensus as to what constitutes successful ecological restoration. The studies highlighted in this Special Profile attempt to meet this challenge. The Forum paper establishes a set of criteria or standards against which restoration projects can be evaluated, and these criteria are discussed by both practitioners and researchers in two Comment papers. 4. The five criteria proposed in the Forum paper include the establishment of a dynamic ecological endpoint to the restoration, providing for a 'guiding image' of a healthier river, and an improvement in the river's ecological condition, that ideally leads to a more self-sustaining and resilient system. No lasting harm should be inflicted on the system during the restoration, and pre- and post-assessment and monitoring must be incorporated into the overall restoration project. An additional sixth criterion is proposed in one of the Comment papers whereby a description or prediction of the ecological mechanisms should be determined through which the intended restoration strategy will achieve its goals 5. The kinds of mechanisms that might be involved are explored in three research articles in the Special Profile, centred on river systems that have been subject to regulation or channelization. The mitigation of the effects of river regulation measures and the successful restoration of floodplain ecosystems has a focus on re-establishing river flow dynamics (temporal heterogeneity) and connectivity of the river with the floodplain. Restoration of channelized systems is centred on increasing the structural (spatial) heterogeneity of the system. 6. Synthesis and applications. River restoration is a world-wide phenomenon of growing importance as we attempt to redress the problems that have arisen from our use and misuse of freshwater habitats and resources. The adoption of standards for ecologically successful river restoration promoted by Palmer et al. (2005), along with the clarifications raised in the Comment papers, will go a long way towards meeting this objective. There is a clear responsibility for funding agencies to undertake meaningful monitoring of restoration projects, not only to provide information on the effectiveness of the restoration in ecological terms, but also to provide much needed data to help establish further the science of restoration. The objective of this significant initiative is eventually to achieve approval of the standards by the sponsoring/funding agencies of restoration, by the practitioner community that carries out the restoration, and by the scientific research community. This will require much greater interaction between ecologists, the larger academic community and the practitioners, with the common goal of implementing more ecologically effective restoration projects, a goal that must also be embraced by the restoration project sponsors and regulators.\n      </p>", "1. Adaptive management approaches to ecological restoration are current best practice. The usefulness of such an approach was tested in this study by implementing repeated experiments that examined restoration options for derelict sand mine sites dominated by Imperata cylindrica. Reclamation of degraded land that is dominated by I. cylindrica is a common problem throughout the tropics. 2. Initially, the hypothesized barrier to regeneration was limited seedling establishment because of I. cylindrica competition. After burning the grassland, woody weed control and planting of seedlings were implemented in factorial combination. 3. Seedling survival 28 months after planting averaged 26%, with &lt; 1% of all seedlings establishing to a height &gt; 1 m. The hypothesis that a transition barrier comprising solely biotic interactions restricted regeneration of native woody cover was rejected after seedlings and natural regeneration failed to thrive in this experiment. 4. A revised hypothesis, that the transition barrier comprised a combination of abiotic limitations (soil deficiencies) and biotic interactions (Wallabia bicolor browsing and I. cylindrica competition), was developed. A second experiment tested this hypothesis by removing W. bicolor (fencing), slashing the I. cylindrica, adding organic mulch and planting a mixture of native pioneer and secondary successional woody species in factorial combination. 5. Seedling survival was 61% in the second experiment and mulching significantly enhanced the survival and growth of all planted species. Planting alone reduced the regeneration of I. cylindrica after slashing. Native woody cover establishment was maximized by planting seedlings in mulched treatments. 6. Synthesis and applications. Taken together, these experiments support the hypothesis that there is a barrier restricting regeneration of native woody cover, and the barrier probably comprises both abiotic and biotic components. By adopting an adaptive management approach to the ecological restoration of sites, significant insights into their management requirements have been gained, supporting the current best practice restoration framework. Insights gained through monitoring and adaptation will be used to update the reserve plan of management, enhancing restoration of this severely degraded area and promoting connectivity of native woody cover within the conservation estate.\n      </p>", "1. Active restoration to rehabilitate degraded tropical lands often involves planting tree seedlings, an effective but expensive approach if large areas are planted. Planting small patches of vegetation (tens to a few hundred square metres) has recently been suggested as a more economical restoration technique that mimics natural regeneration processes. However, few studies have examined the consequences of restoration patch size on animals, whose presence and activities are often key to successful ecosystem recovery. 2. We examined the effects of patch size on the foraging behaviour of four resident tropical bird species in a replicated forest restoration experiment in southern Costa Rica. We also measured arthropod abundance and anti-predator vigilance behaviour to assess whether variation in food availability or predation risk could explain patch size effects on foraging behaviour. 3. Prey attack rates were highest, and the effort required to find prey was lowest, in larger patches for three of the four bird species. Arthropod density was approximately twice as great in larger patches (&gt; 3500 m\u00b2) compared with smaller patches (&lt; 350 m\u00b2). Evidence for patch size differences in predation risk was more limited but risk may be higher in smaller patches. The results indicate that food availability is the primary mechanism driving patch size effects on foraging behaviour, with predation risk being an additional influence for some species in some years. 4. Synthesis and applications. As demonstrated in this study, patches of tens to a few hundreds of metres squared are likely to provide fewer food resources and potentially less cover from predators for vertebrates that use woody habitat, compared with patches of a few thousand square metres. The more limited resources in smaller patches are likely to have short-term and, potentially, long-term consequences for the fitness of organisms. When considering restoration project design, the potential economic and other benefits of planting in smaller patches must be weighed with the potentially negative ecological effects on some taxonomic groups. To increase the probability that patches provide adequate habitat for the largest number of species, we recommend that when financial resources are available, patches of at least a few thousand square metres be planted.\n      </p>", "1. This paper investigates the effects of disturbing the bracken-litter layer on the re-establishment of heathland vegetation after spraying with asulam at a grass and a Calluna heath in Breckland. Three litter disturbance treatments were applied: (i) raking and removal of the litter; (ii) incorporating the litter by rotovation; (iii) burning. All treatments were done with and without sowing seed of heathland species. 2. At both sites, litter disturbance increased the speed of colonization and subsequent development of the sown heathland species. At the Calluna site, litter removal was the most effective treatment. 3. At both sites the rapid establishment of the sown species reduced natural colonization of other species. 4. After 11 years, bracken reinvasion was reduced 15-20 m away from surrounding dense bracken edges at the grass heath. 5. The implications of these results for conservation management and heathland restoration are discussed.\n      </p>", "1. Floodplains are species-rich environments often strongly impacted by human activities. In particular, the negative effects of progressive and rapid disconnection of secondary channels have led to restoration programmes and a growing interest in restoration ecology. 2. Current restoration strategies in large river floodplains focus on the macroinvertebrate response related to the increases in lateral connectivity of the secondary channels. We constructed a framework to assess a gradient of hydrological connectivity among 13 secondary channels and the main channel of a large river, and we modelled the response of a set of macroinvertebrate metrics to this gradient. Comparisons between predicted and observed metrics in restored channels allowed us to measure the effect of an increase in the hydrological connectivity on the biological characteristics of macroinvertebrate assemblages. 3. The pre-restoration framework enabled a clear ordering of channels into three types according to levels of hydrological connectivity. Rarefied richness and species traits, responding to the connectivity gradient, showed a net difference between disconnected channels and the main river channel. We were able to highlight a predation colonization trade-off along the gradient of hydrological connectivity with a maximum colonization potential in the most connected channels. 4. Post-restoration sampling showed deviations of the restored channels from their expected ecological state. A large proportion of colonizers were favoured by the restoration operations and non-native species occurred in the restored channels. 5. Synthesis and applications. Macroinvertebrate biodiversity in large river floodplains is shaped by lateral hydrological connectivity. Increasing hydrological connectivity led to an increase in colonization rate. One year after restoration, the increase in lateral connectivity had shifted the restored sites away from the predicted state. This unpredictability is, in part, a consequence of the rapid colonization by non-native species of new habitats created by the restoration measures. We recommend that floodplain-scale restoration should focus on diversification of the hydrological connectivity of channels, thereby conserving a maximum of functional characteristics in macroinvertebrate communities.\n      </p>", "1. This paper describes the effectiveness of a range of bracken control and heathland restoration treatments (cutting, spraying with asulam, and seed sowing, in factorial combination) at a Calluna and a grass heath in Breckland over 10 years. 2. In the grass heath, 13 species were recorded during the 10 years, although in most plots two species were dominant: Festuca ovina which was sown, and Deschampsia flexuosa which colonized naturally. Festuca ovina rapidly colonized the seeded plots, but Deschampsia flexuosa appeared 5 years later. After 10 years D. flexuosa was co-dominant on many plots. 3. On the Calluna heath, 13 vascular and three bryophyte species were found. The sown species Calluna was found mainly on seeded plots, especially where the bracken was cut. Agrostis capillaris, Dicranum scoparium and Galium saxatile were most abundant on plots where the bracken was cut twice yearly. Other species appeared independent of treatment, reflecting low abundance, ubiquitous distributions, or clumped distributions. Two clonal species, Carex arenaria and Calamagrostis epigejos, invaded in large patches where cover of other heath species was negligible. 4. Most of the species colonizing the restored areas had higher Ellenberg nitrogen-indicator values than the dominant heathland species, indicating that soil fertility may be too high for successful heathland restoration. 5. The results are discussed in relation to practical conservation management and vegetation dynamics.\n      </p>", "Effective rewetting is the most important prerequisite for the short-term regeneration of cut-over bog sites, and numerous investigations have been carried out on this aspect of mire restoration in the last two decades. Despite rewetting, the spontaneous recovery of large post-harvested fields can be delayed because of (1) the absence of viable diaspores, (2) the lack of nutrients necessary for seedling establishment, (3) inhospitable microclimatic conditions. Several experiments were carried out in a cut-over bog in southern Germany to develop methods how to accelerate and/or how to direct the establishment of plants and their succession. Results show that (1) depending on the peat quality, simple ditch blocking and terracing do not always guarantee the retention of rain water on the restoration site; (2) accelerated vegetation establishment can be effected by planting (introduced species) or by sowing; (3) covering the seeds with fibre mats or mulch increases seed germination but not the establishment of seedlings; (4) rapid revegetation of bare peat can be achieved using the mulch of diaspore-rich hay; (5) initial fertilization with phosphorus ensures effective seedling establishment; (6) Sphagnum re-introduction is only efficient after vascular pioneer species have been established on the site.\n      </p>", "The areas targeted for restoration are often the modified ecosystems that are rapidly becoming the planetary norm, and when ecosystem modification has been extensive, local genotypes may not be the most effective for repair. Here, local has value is presented as a paradigm for the restoration of such systems as a corollary to local is best for systems that have sustained less modification. In many cases, adaptation may be enhanced through genetic variation or applying artificial selection, particularly for generalist species. Ecologically appropriate plant materials are those that exhibit ecological fitness for their intended site, display compatibility with other members of the plant community, and demonstrate no invasive tendencies. They may address specific environmental challenges, rejuvenate ecosystem function, and improve the delivery of ecosystem services. Furthermore, they may be improved over time, thereby serving to ameliorate the increasingly challenging environments that typify many restoration sites.\n      </p>", "1. Water extraction from arid-zone rivers increases the time between floods across their floodplain wetlands. Less frequent flooding in Australian arid-zone rivers has impaired waterbird and fish breeding, killed riparian vegetation and diminished invertebrate and macrophyte communities. Restoration currently focuses on reinstating floods to rejuvenate floodplain wetlands, yet indicators to measure the success of this are poorly developed. 2. We explored the application of criteria for ecologically successful river restoration to potential restoration of floodplain wetlands on the Darling River, arid-zone Australia. Using emergence of micro-invertebrates from resting eggs as an indicator, we compared responses of taxa richness, densities and community composition in floodplain lakes with different inundation histories. 3. Increased drying of floodplain lakes reduced the number of micro-invertebrate taxa. Several key taxa were absent and faunal densities (particularly cladocerans) were reduced when the duration of drying increased from 6 to 20 years. 4. A conceptual model of the ecological mechanisms by which restoration of flooding regime could achieve the target of preserving micro-invertebrate community resilience predicts that reducing the dry period between floods will minimize losses of viable resting eggs. Protection of this 'egg bank' permits a boom in micro-invertebrates after flooding, promoting successful recruitment by native fish and waterbirds. 5. Synthesis and applications. In arid-zone rivers, micro-invertebrate densities and community composition are useful indicators of the impact of reduced flooding as a result of water extraction. Critical to successful native fish recruitment as their first feed and as prey for waterbirds, micro-invertebrates are a potential early indicator of responses by higher trophic levels. Taxon richness, density and key taxa present after flooding, all indicators of resilience, can be incorporated into targets for arid-zone river restoration. For example, one restoration target may be microcrustacean densities between 100 and $1000 L^{-1}$ within 2-3 weeks after spring flooding. These criteria can be applied to measure the ecological success of restoration projects seeking to recover natural flood regimes. Given the high economic cost of water in arid zones, convincing demonstrations of the ecological success of environmental water allocations are crucial.\n      </p>", "1. Restoration of salt marshes on previously reclaimed land provides an excellent opportunity to study plant colonization and subsequent development of salt-marsh vegetation. Insight into the process of salt-marsh development can guide the design, implementation and evaluation of salt-marsh restoration schemes and help determine appropriate management strategies. 2. We evaluated the process of salt-marsh restoration at a species- and plant-community level and investigated how the sequence of species establishment is related to site suitability, availability of the target species in the local and regional species pools and dispersal traits. 3. It took approximately 5 years for species diversity in the restoration site to become similar to a local reference marsh. The annual species Salicornia spp. and Suaeda maritima colonized and reached maximum abundance first. Perennial species (Puccinellia maritima, Aster tripolium, Spartina anglica, Spergularia media, Atriplex portulacoides and Limonium vulgare) only started to colonize or increase notably in abundance after 3 years of restoration. 4. Plant composition at the highest elevation of the restoration site developed from an annual Salicornia community into a Puccinellia maritima salt marsh, which was similar to the local reference marsh. After 8 years, the lower elevations were still covered by annual Salicornia salt marsh despite the potential for the development of a Puccinellia community. 5. Salt tolerance appeared to be much more important in explaining the sequence of species establishment than the availability of the species in the local or regional species pools or dispersal traits. 6. Synthesis and applications. The prospect of salt-marsh restoration after de-embankment is good, with target species establishing spontaneously and vegetation succession taking place. Because most salt-marsh species are dispersed over short distances, it is important that a well-developed salt marsh is adjacent to the restoration site. The rate of salt-marsh development and species diversity appears to be affected mainly by surface elevation. Proper elevation in relation to tidal inundation is therefore a prerequisite for the successful restoration of salt-marsh vegetation after de-embankment.\n      </p>", "There is growing recognition that opportunities exist to use physiology as part of the conservation and management of populations and ecosystems. However, this idea has rarely been extended to the field of restoration ecology. Physiological metrics (e.g., gas exchange, energy transfer and metabolism, stress response, nutritional condition, gene expression) from a range of taxa can be used to understand the function of ecosystems as well as the factors that influence their structure. Such knowledge can assist the development and implementation of effective restoration strategies that recognize the role of habitat quality on organismal performance. Furthermore, physiological tools can be used to monitor the success of restoration projects during their implementation and as part of postproject monitoring. The often rapid response of physiological metrics provides more immediate information, enabling an adaptive approach to restoration, than can usually be obtained if the focus is solely on population- or ecosystem-level metrics. Greater integration of physiological responses into ecological restoration will provide practitioners with fundamental scientific information needed to design, implement, and monitor restoration activities to aid in repairing ecosystems around the globe.\n      </p>", "\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n         For individual subscriptions, please contact the <a href=\"https://aibs.site-ym.com/?page=IndMem\">AIBS</a>\r\n         .\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p />    \r\n         To buy individual copies, please contact <a\thref=\"http://www.ucpressjournals.com/journalBuy.asp?j=bio\">University of California Press</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n         .\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n         For individual subscriptions, please contact the <a href=\"https://aibs.site-ym.com/?page=IndMem\">AIBS</a>\r\n         .\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p />    \r\n         To buy individual copies, please contact <a\thref=\"http://www.ucpressjournals.com/journalBuy.asp?j=bio\">University of California Press</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n         .\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n         For individual subscriptions, please contact the <a href=\"https://aibs.site-ym.com/?page=IndMem\">AIBS</a>\r\n         .\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p />    \r\n         To buy individual copies, please contact <a\thref=\"http://www.ucpressjournals.com/journalBuy.asp?j=bio\">University of California Press</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n         .\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "1. Soil microbiological and physico-chemical data were obtained from former opencast coalmine sites restored to grassland and woodland, and from comparable undisturbed habitats. Total soil microbial activity was estimated by measuring soil dehydrogenase activity. Soil adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content was measured as an indicator of soil microbial biomass and ergosterol as a measure of the size of the fungal component. Physico-chemical analysis included total organic carbon and total nitrogen contents, moisture content, bulk density, pH and textural analysis. 2. Multiple range tests enabled statistically homogeneous groups of sites to be identified for individual variables, but these were not sufficient to characterize the habitats alone. 3. Principal component analysis resulted in &gt;90% of the variance being accounted for by the first five components, for the total data set. Classification by means of cluster analysis, based on the principal components, discriminated between some of the habitat types. 4. Clustering based on the three microbiological indices (soil dehydrogenase activity, ATP and ergosterol) discriminated between different types of habitat, which was not possible using soil physical and chemical characteristics alone. 5. A method of habitat classification based on a three-dimensional ordination of soil microbiological properties is therefore suggested, which could be used to assess the restoration potential and progress of reclaimed soils.\n      </p>", "Ecological restoration treatments are widely applied in southwestern ponderosa pine forests to convert them to an open canopy structure similar to that found at the time of Euro-American settlement. An experiment was initiated in northern Arizona in 1994 to evaluate long-term ecosystem responses to 3 restoration treatments: 1) thinning from below (thinning), 2) thinning from below plus forest floor manipulation with periodic prescribed burning (composite), and 3) an untreated control. Results focus on total herbaceous and functional-group standing crop response to these restoration treatments. Pretreatment data were collected in 1992 and posttreatment responses were measured from 1994 through 2004. Total herbaceous standing crop was significantly higher on the 2 treated areas than on the control over the entire posttreatment period, but did not differ between the thinning and composite treatments. Plant functional groups responded differently to treatments and to drought. In general, the graminoid standing crop responded within several years after the initial treatments and continued to increase through time, until a series of severe droughts reduced standing crop to pretreatment levels. C3 graminoids dominated the standing-crop response, of which bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus elymoides (Raf.) Swezey ssp. elymoides) was the primary contributor. C4 graminoids had a minimal response to restoration treatments, possibly because they were less abundant before the experiment began or because they were adversely affected by autumn burning. Legumes and forbs exhibited a 4-5 year lag before responding to the thinning and composite treatments. Annual and biennial plants showed a large biomass increase approximately 5 years after implementation of the composite treatment. The restoration goal of optimizing herbaceous standing crop must be weighed against the competing goals of increasing the abundance of specific functional groups, increasing biodiversity or rare plants, and managing invasive plant species. /// Los tratamientos de restauraci\u00f3n ecol\u00f3gica son ampliamente aplicados en los bosques de \"Ponderosa pine\" del sudoeste para convertirlos en una estructura de cobertura abierta similar a la que se encontr\u00f3 en el tiempo de la colonizaci\u00f3n Euroamericana.

Las gram\u00edneas C3 dominaron la respuesta de la biomasa, de las cuales el \"Bottlebrush squirreltail\" (Elymus elymoides (Raf.) Swezey ssp. elymoides) fue el principal contribuyente. Las gram\u00edneas C4 tuvieron una m\u00ednima respuesta a los tratamientos de restauraci\u00f3n, posiblemente porque ellas fueron menos abundantes antes de que el experimento comenzar\u00e1 o porque ellas fueron afectadas adversamente por la quema de oto\u00f1o.

An amateur scientist operating in the shadow of the great fellows of the early Royal Society, Vincent's involvement ranged from investigating the work of Denis Papin to presenting a manuscript of Isaac Newton's \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\". However, his greatest contribution to the intellectual history of the Restoration is located in his 1685 translation of Confucius's 'Great Learning', which seems to be the first time that a Confucian book began to be printed in the English language. Hitherto unnoticed, hidden away in an appendix to a court sermon, it nonetheless presented part of the interest in Chinese culture in the circles of the early Royal Society. This paper places Vincent in the context of the activities of the early Royal Society and offers an overview of this interest in sinology. It then considers how Vincent gained access to Confucian texts, how he was able to 'translate' from them, and what ramifications the philosophy had for an Anglican divine in Restoration England.\n      </p>", "Although habitat restoration can play a key role in the conservation of imperiled species, for animals that demonstrate long migrations and complex life histories, reliance on physical restoration of isolated habitat patches comes with considerable uncertainty. Nevertheless, within freshwater ecosystems, stream restoration has become a major conservation focus, with millions of dollars spent annually on efforts aimed at recovering degraded habitat and imperiled riverine species. Within this context, we addressed fundamental uncertainties of the focus on tributary restoration for recovery of salmon: (1) Is there potential for improving habitat in tributaries? (2) What magnitude of early survival improvement can be expected based on stream restoration? and (3) Will incremental increases in early survival be sufficient to ensure viability overall? We combined simple mechanistic habitat models, population viability measures, and categorical filters to quantify \"restoration potential,\" expressed as increased total life-cycle survival in response to restored tributary condition, across 32 populations composing five major population groups (MPG). A wide gap remains between how much survival improvement is needed vs. what is likely to occur; restoration potential meets the necessary minimum increase needed for only four populations within one MPG. The remaining populations (84%, 4 MPG) still fall far below the survival increase needed for future viability. In addition, across all populations and groups, a 171% increase (on average) in total life-cycle survival is needed; only ~106% appears possible. A recovery strategy for these salmon that relies largely on tributary restoration to mitigate for known mortality imposed at other life stages (e.g., migration through hydropower dams) is risky with a low probability of success. We demonstrate an approach for completing an a priori evaluation of restoration potential linked to population viability, such that habitat restoration efforts can be biologically prioritized and scarce resources can be allocated to efforts with the greatest potential and the least amount of risk, in terms of meeting conservation and recovery goals.\n      </p>", "It is difficult to measure the success of wildlife community restoration when the restoration goal concerns a relatively broad geographic area, rather than a particular piece of land, since many restored sites need to be compared to many reference sites simultaneously. A review of the methods used to measure success in previous restoration efforts indicated the potential value of multimetric methods to make the comparison. We designed a new method that retains some of the advantages of multimetric methods but also removes some of the associated problems. The new method was applied to data from 30 restored sites (phosphate-mined land) and 30 reference sites in central Florida (USA), and it showed the difference in wildlife composition between restored and reference sites to be large, relative to the maximum possible difference. Alternative methods were applied to the same data. Multivariate methods were unable to measure success adequately. Percentage similarity analysis yielded results seemingly comparable to those derived with the new method, but the new method possesses advantages over percentage similarity analysis. The advantages derive largely from the first step of the new method, which is ranking species according to the magnitude of the difference between distributions at restored and reference sites. Species ranking clearly reveals which species contribute most to the distance between the restored system and the target; enables well-founded decision-making about which species can be excluded, if necessary, without seriously compromising the restoration goal; promotes rigor in the subsequent steps of the model; and overcomes the problem that a single species may inordinately influence the result.\n      </p>", "The ecological effectiveness of widespread and costly aquatic restoration efforts is often unknown. We reviewed studies incorporating electronic-tagging techniques (including radio, acoustic, satellite, biologging, and passive integrated transponder tags) into restoration-monitoring programs and discuss novel uses of these technologies and experimental design considerations. We found 25 studies, mostly published after 2005. Most were focused on salmonids or monitored the residency of species at artificial reefs. Few studies used site-level replication or data collected prior to restoration or at control sites, which limits the usefulness of their results for evaluating restoration effectiveness. The use of electronic tags and related sensors (e.g., temperature, depth) can reveal how habitats are used and their associated bioenergetic costs or benefits. These technologies are focused on individual- and population-level responses and complement traditional methods of assessing abundance, richness, and community composition but must be deployed in conjunction with well-designed experiments to truly better inform evaluations of restoration effectiveness.\n      </p>", "We study the problem of the influence and of the choice of the regularization parameter \u03b2 in the Bayesian image restoration framework. Binary and geometrically regular images are examined. The noise degradation process which leads to the observed record can be either additive Gaussian or a binary symmetric channel noise of transmission. MAP is not robust with respect to \u03b2, MPM and ICM are more robust. For the three methods, a good choice of \u03b2 depends strongly on the noise level. On the basis of the observed record, two possible choices of \u03b2 are examined: if the statistical one seems reasonable at a low noise level, it isn't the case for higher noise for which the cross-validation criterion still gives good results.\n      </p>", "We consider the problem of binary-image restoration. The image being restored is not random, and we make no assumption about the nature of its contents. The estimate of the colour at each site is a fixed (the same for all sites) function of the data available in a neighbourhood of that site. Under this restriction, the estimate minimizing the overall mean squared error of prediction is the conditional expectation of the true colour given the observations in the neighbourhood of a site. The computation of this conditional expectation leads to the formal definition of the local characteristics of an image, namely, the frequency with which each pattern appears in the true unobserved image. When the \"true\" distribution of the patterns is unknown, it can be estimated from the records. The conditional expectation described above can then be evaluated using the estimated distribution of the patterns, and this procedure leads to a very natural estimate of the colour at each site. We propose two unbiased and consistent estimates for the distribution of patterns when the noise is a Gaussian white noise. Since the size of realistic images is very large, the estimated pattern distribution is usually close to the true one. This suggests that the estimated conditional expectation can be expected to be nearly optimal. An interesting feature of the proposed restoration methods is that they do not require prior knowledge of the local or global properties of the true underlying image. Several examples based on synthetic images show that the new methods perform fairly well for a variety of images with different degrees of colour continuity or textures. /// Nous examinons dans cet article le probl\u00e8me de la restauration d'image binaire.

Restoring biologically appropriate habitat networks is fundamental to the persistence and connectivity of at-risk species surviving in highly fragmented environments. For many at-risk species, this landscape planning problem requires combining detailed biological information about the species with the landscape, economic and social realities of the restoration effort. 2. Here, we assess the ability of potential restored landscapes to create persistent and connected populations of the federally endangered Fender's blue butterfly (Icaricia icarioides fenderi) in Oregon's Willamette Valley. Like many other at-risk species, a very small amount (0.5%) of historic habitat remains and much of this habitat is highly degraded. 3. To do this, we combine extensive demography and behaviour data from prior studies of Fender's blue with landscape maps of potential restoration sites by building and running a spatially explicit landscape model. We chose a simulation approach because previous attempts using more traditional population modelling did not provide sufficiently informative answers for this restoration problem. 4. From our simulations, we: (a) provide a solution to the general landscape restoration problem of determining whether patches that are available according to social, economic and ecological realities are sufficient to restore persistence and connectivity; (b) supported our predictions from our previous models about persistence of our large patches and expanded our inference to include connectivity and persistence of small patches; and (c) found several emergent properties of our system, including identifying stepping-stone patches, observing asymmetric connectivity and uncovering reciprocal effects of connectivity and population dynamics. 5. Synthesis and applications. Assuming no large disturbances, and relying on our 14 years of data collection and models, restoring all currently degraded and potentially available habitat patches to high quality native prairie would be sufficient for long-term persistence of Fender's blue butterfly in the West Eugene area, Oregon. This conclusion resolves many of the shortcomings of our previous population and metapopulation models that were not able to combine the necessary landscape complexity with species behaviour to address this restoration problem.\n      </p>", "The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, enacted in 2000, is a $7.8 billion federal/state investment in restoring the Florida Everglades ecosystem. The plan is a negotiated compromise between divergent interests in south Florida and promises to provide water and flood control for urban and agricultural users while maintaining a priority commitment to the natural system when allocating water \"produced\" by the 30-year project. The environmental community calls for independent scientific review of un-tested technologies, early and substantial hydrologic benefits to the remaining Everglades, including Everglades National Park, and strong programmatic regulations of the federal project to ensure that ecological restoration remains its primary purpose in spite of inherently conflicting interests at the state and local level.\n      </p>", "1. Amid signs that estuarine ecosystems are increasingly degraded and may reach new thresholds of irreversible decline, restoration ecologists and coastal managers world-wide have joined the debate on how best to reverse the trends of the recent past. 2. Any meaningful effort at reversal must, however, recognize that humans are an integral part of the landscape, particularly in urban estuarine settings, and that natural resource baselines have permanently shifted. Consequently, the human dimensions component of sustainability science has become an integral part of ecological restoration/rehabilitation planning, and new schema evolving out of coastal governance and management are not only increasingly underpinned by transdisciplinary science, but are beginning to address the sacrifices and compromises that will be necessary to achieve a balance between human uses of estuarine resources and biotic integrity. 3. The challenge will be to preserve ecosystem functions and use natural capital at a variety of scales while simultaneously sustaining local communities, social and formal institutions, economies and markets at the highest levels of system organization. 4. How we manage competing uses while at the same time preserving the dynamic properties and resilience of ecosystems will be a significant test. Current ecosystem management and restoration goals appear to be weighted towards returning and/or preserving natural functions decoupled from system reliability. In human-dominated systems, however, they should be redirected towards goals and mandates to rehabilitate the functions associated with service reliability. 5. Synthesis and applications. If we are to avoid the harsh lessons of the utilization of terrestrial resources, scientists, practitioners and coastal managers will have to find a middle ground between continued economic growth and preservation/conservation of coastal resources. Success will require broad acceptance that humans are as coastally dependent as any part of the biota, and that future plans for managing, restoring and/or rehabilitating estuarine ecosystems must recognize that humans occupy the highest level of the ecological-cultural landscape.\n      </p>", "Sustainable agricultural practices in conjunction with ecological restoration methods can reduce the detrimental effects of agriculture. The Society for Ecological Restoration International has produced generic guidelines for conceiving, organizing, conducting and assessing ecological restoration projects. Additionally, there are now good conceptual frameworks, guidelines and practical methods for developing ecological restoration programmes that are based on sound ecological principles and supported by empirical evidence and modelling approaches. Restoration methods must also be technically achievable and socially acceptable and spread over a range of locations. It is important to reconcile differences between methods that favour conservation and those that favour economic returns, to ensure that conservation efforts are beneficial for both landowners and biodiversity. One option for this type of mutual benefit is the use of agri-environmental schemes to provide financial incentives to landholders in exchange for providing conservation services and other benefits. However, further work is required to define and measure the effectiveness of agri-environmental schemes. The broader potential for ecological restoration to improve the sustainability of agricultural production while conserving biodiversity in farmscapes and reducing external costs is high, but there is still much to learn, particularly for the most efficient use of agri-environmental schemes to change land use practice.\n      </p>", "The problem is considered of restoring a blurred and/or noisy image using various regularization prescriptions. Preliminary work concerns the invertibility of point spread functions and the construction of a stochastic model for images. A simple linear regularization procedure is introduced, as well as the special cases of constrained deconvolution, maximum entropy restoration and least-squares filtering. Optimal choices for the degree of smoothing are obtained for the case of low noise-to-signal ratios. Certain techniques, prevalent in the image-restoration literature for choosing the degree of smoothing, are shown to oversmooth, in a well-defined sense.\n      </p>", "Ecological restoration of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in the southwestern United States is a relatively new, adaptive management practice that potentially alters wildlife habitat during and immediately after restoration treatments. To determine whether restoration treatments affected Merriam's wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo merriami) use of roost sites, we relocated 91 of 120 turkey roost sites that originally had been mapped in 1985 in the Uinkaret Mountains of northern Arizona. We compared current turkey use of historical roost sites in stands that had been thinned and burned between 1995 and 2002 to adjacent (&lt;800 m away) and distant (&gt;800 m) stands. In 2002, 23 historical roosts were still in use, and in 2003, 13 were still in use, 5 of which had not been used in 2002. The number of historical roost sites still in use among treated, adjacent, and distant stands did not differ from that expected based on the total number of historical roosts in each stand type. We also searched for new roosts while traveling between historical roost sites and found 2.2 new roosts per hour searched in treated stands, 1.5 in adjacent stands, and 1.0 in distant stands. As expected, active roost sites in treated stands had significantly lower basal area, fewer stems, and less canopy cover compared to roost sites in untreated areas. However, roost trees in treated and untreated stands did not differ in diameter at breast height, height, or distance to the lower limb, indicating that treatment did not affect these characteristics. Several factors unique to our study site may have influenced our results: treated areas represented only 5% of total habitat available, treatments occurred primarily on flat areas and not on ridges or slopes, and treatments were implemented over several years.\n      </p>", "National Park Service policy directs that more natural conditions be restored to giant sequoia groves, which have been altered by a century of fire exclusion. Efforts to find a reasonable and practical definition of \"natural\" have helped drive scientists and land managers to use past grove conditions as reference conditions for restoration. Extensive research aimed at determining reference conditions has demonstrated that past fire regimes can be characterized with greater precision than past grove structures. Difficulty and imprecision in determining past grove structure has helped fuel a debate between \"structural restorationists,\" who believe that forest structure should be restored mechanically before fire is reintroduced, and \"process restorationists,\" who believe that simple reintroduction of fire is appropriate. I evaluate old and new studies from sequoia groves to show that some of the arguments of both groups have been flawed. Importantly, it appears that restoration of fire without a preceding mechanical restoration may restore the pre-Euro-American structure of sequoia groves, at least within the bounds of our imprecise knowledge of past grove structure. However, the same may not be true for all forest types that have experienced lengthy fire exclusion. Our ability to draw robust generalizations about fire's role in forest restoration will depend heavily on a thorough understanding of past and present interactions among climate, fire, and forest structure. Use of reference conditions will be central to developing this understanding.\n      </p>", "Intraspecific genetic variation in plants is frequently associated with adaptation to local environments. Detection of ecotypic differentiation can promote an understanding of a species' distribution and be an important consideration in restoration efforts. We performed a classical reciprocal transplant study using four natural populations of Hydrastis canadensis to test for localized adaptation. Hydrastis canadensis exhibited plasticity in response to site quality variation, and at the site level there was no evidence of local genetic adaptation or differential performance of plants derived from distinct source populations. However, the four H. canadensis sources responded differentially to microsites within the transplant site. A second study examined the importance of including multiple sources when introducing new populations for restoration purposes by comparing H. canadensis performance in populations that were mixtures of three natural sources versus populations that were monocultures of each natural source. We found that populations established with plant material from single sources performed better than those established with multiple sources. Collectively, our findings indicate that restoration efforts should involve multiple sources dispersed over multiple sites as a bet-hedging strategy to increase the likelihood of suitable source-site compatibility. However, within a given restoration site, these sources should be spatially separated, such that numerous populations are introduced, each comprised of only a single source.\n      </p>", "We studied the foraging behavior of insectivorous songbirds during the breeding season at four sites in Illinois, each with restored open-canopy savanna habitat (65% mean canopy closure) and closed-canopy forests (89% mean canopy closure). We sampled and compared apparent tree species preference, foliage layer preference, and proportional use of different prey-attack maneuvers in the two habitats. In closed-canopy forests, three of nine songbird species foraged in black oak (Quercus velutina) and white oak (Q. alba) more than expected based on availability, and foraged less than expected in shade-tolerant trees such as sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and red elm (Ulmus rubra). Four species also displayed apparent preferences for black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) and hackberry (Celtis occidentalis). In contrast, songbirds used tree species according to availability in open-canopy habitat. We observed apparent preferences for the shrub and subcanopy vegetation layers (0-5 m and 6-10 m) in open-canopy habitat and apparent preferences for the sub-canopy and lower canopy vegetation layers (6-10 m and 11-15 m) in closed-canopy forests. Relative use of prey-attack maneuvers in open versus closed-canopy habitat was significantly different for the Eastern Wood-Pewee (Contopus virens) and the Great Crested Fly catcher (Myiarchus crinitus), but not for foliage-gleaning species. These results suggest that restoration of oak savannas has important effects on the habitat use and foraging ecology of selected insectivorous birds. /// Estudiamos el comportamiento de forrajeo de aves canoras insect\u00edvoras durante la \u00e9poca reproductiva en cuatro sitios en Illinois. Cada sitio contaba con h\u00e1bitat restaurado de sabana de dosel abierto (65% de cobertura de dosel promedio) y con bosque de dosel cerrado (89% de cobertura de dosel promedio). Muestreamos y comparamos la preferencia aparente de especies de \u00e1rboles, preferencia de estratos del follaje y uso proporcional de diferentes maniobras de ataque de presas por parte de las aves en los dos h\u00e1bitats. En el bosque de dosel cerrado, tres de nueve especies de aves canoras forrajearon en Quercus velutina y en Q. alba en mayor proporci\u00f3n de lo esperado de acuerdo a su disponibilidad en el h\u00e1bitat, y forrajearon menos de lo esperado en \u00e1rboles tolerantes a la sombra como Acer saccharum y Ulmus rubra. Cuatro especies tambi\u00e9n mostraron una preferencia aparente por Robinia pseudoacacia y Celtis occidentalis. De modo contrastante, en el h\u00e1bitat de dosel abierto, las aves utilizaron las especies de \u00e1rboles de acuerdo a su disponibilidad. Observamos preferencias aparentes por los estratos de vegetacion arbustivo y de subdosel (0-5 m y 6-10 m) en el habitat de dosel abierto y preferencia aparente por los estratos de vegetaci\u00f3n del subdosel y dosel bajo (6-10 m y 11-15 m) en el bosque de dosel cerrado. El uso relativo de maniobras de ataque de presas fue significativamente diferente entre h\u00e1bitats de dosel abierto y dosel cerrado para Contopus virens y Myiarchus crinitus, pero no para las especies que forrajean recogiendo insectos de las hojas. Estos resultados sugieren que la restauracion de sabanas de Quercus tiene efectos importantes sobre el uso del h\u00e1bitat y la ecolog\u00eda de forrajeo de algunas especies de aves insect\u00edvoras.\n      </p>", "Forest paths are characterised by a zonation in vegetation composition as a result of gradients in abiotical conditions and continued recreational impact. Little is known about how much seed bank composition is affected by recreation and the existing path structure. As it is difficult to assess the contribution of seed banks to vegetation restoration, this study imparts relevant knowledge to restore vegetation on paths which are closed for recreational use. We surveyed seed bank and field layer vegetation composition in transects across path ecotones in deciduous forest. Analysis concentrated on seed bank characteristics and similarities of the seed bank and field layer vegetation in terms of ecological and seed size groups. A total of 74 species and 9,815 seedlings germinated out of the seed bank samples. The total seed density does not differ between path zones, but significant differences exist in the depth distribution and composition of the seed bank throughout transects. There is a large discrepancy between the composition of the seed bank and the vegetation. Small seeded species of disturbed environments dominate in each path zone. Typical forest species dominate in the vegetation while their contribution to the seed bank is low. Only with reference to the proportion of species of forest edges and clearings, the seed bank and vegetation do not differ significantly. Similarity between the seed bank on the path centre and the vegetation in the respective path zones decreases towards the undisturbed forest vegetation. Some competitive species like Urtica dioica and Lythrum salicaria are excessively represented in the seed bank and efficiently may obstruct further visitor use. However, these early successional species may not contribute to the conservation values of forests. Therefore management should carefully consider alternative amendments (e.g. soil scarification and seeding) to stimulate vegetation restoration.\n      </p>", "Many procedures in statistical image restoration can be regarded as regularization techniques involving a scalar smoothing parameter. The paper collates several methods for choosing the smoothing parameter, including model-based maximum likelihood. Minimum risk, generalized cross-validation, choice based on fit to the data, and \"equivalent degrees of freedom\" choice. Some theoretical and empirical comparisons are summarized.\n      </p>", "The present investigation focused on the reevaluations of \"competency to stand trial\" (CST) of 75 criminal defendants with mental retardation (MR) who were originally found incompetent and who were referred for treatment. The effect of competency restoration training was examined. Site of training was also investigated. Because habilitation facilities are specially designed to help individuals with MR, it was suspected that training at habilitation centers would have a greater effect on restoration of defendants with MR than the training at state hospitals. Results showed that significantly more defendants did not gain competency following training than those who did. Analysis revealed that (a) higher IQ and (b) being African American rather than Caucasian American were predictive of restoration. When discriminating factors were held constant, site of training did not significantly affect competency restoration. Possible explanations for this finding were discussed.\n      </p>", "Since the early 1990s managed realignment, where formerly reclaimed land is re-exposed to tidal inundation through breaching of coastal embankments, has been increasingly used throughout Northern Europe as a cost effective and sustainable response to biodiversity loss and flood management. This study aimed to evaluate the success of managed realignment schemes that resulted in salt-marsh development for the restoration of spider assemblages. Restoration of salt-marsh fauna was studied by comparing ground-active spiders between recently inundated land (3-14 years old) and pair-matched, adjacent natural salt marshes. Natural reference salt marshes were characterized by a relatively low species richness, the dominance of late-successional stage species such as Pirata piraticus (Clerck 1757), and the presence of species preferring a closed vegetation canopy like Arctosa fulvolineata (Lucas 1846) and Pardosa nigriceps (Thorell 1856). Restored habitats were characterized by greater species richness than in reference habitat and by the presence of halophilic species (Enoplognatha mordax (Thorell 1875) and Erigone longipalpis (Sundevall 1830)) and abundance of Pardosa purbeckensis (Westring 1861). These preliminary results argue for maintaining a maximum of successional stages in salt marshes, as they increase the diversity of halophilic spiders.\n      </p>", "We study a functional with variable exponent, 1 \u2264 p(x) \u2264 2, which provides a model for image denoising, enhancement, and restoration.

We compared physical-habitat variables, taxonomic and functional-trait diversities, taxonomic composition, and functional-trait abundances between 24 pairs of upstream (control) and downstream reconfigured (restored) reaches in 3 catchment land uses (urban, agricultural, rural) across the North Carolina Piedmont. We asked how environmental filters and functional species traits might provide insight to biological responses to restoration. Taxonomic and functional-trait differences between control and restored reaches suggest that restoration affected aquatic assemblages only in agricultural and rural catchments. Our results highlight 2 important aspects of channel reconfiguration as a restoration practice. First, responses to restoration differ between agricultural/rural and urban catchments, possibly because of modified hydrological regimes caused by urbanization. Second, we find evidence that channel reconfiguration disturbs food and habitat resources in stream ecosystems. Taxa sensitive to disturbance were characteristic of control reaches, whereas insensitive taxa were characteristic of restored reaches. Abundances of traits related to reproduction (voltinism, development, synchronization of emergence, adult life span), mobility (occurrence in drift, maximum crawling rate, swimming ability), and use of resources (trophic and habitat preferences) differed significantly between control and recently restored reaches. Our results suggest that taxa in restored habitats are environmentally selected for traits favored in disturbed environments. Our work suggests how functional-trait approaches could benefit the practice of river restoration when used to target restoration activities and to develop informed expectations regarding recovery following restoration activities.\n      </p>", "Question: Does the overstorey of pine savannas influence plant species biodiversity in the ground cover? Location: Camp Whispering Pines (30\u00b041\u00b4 N; 90029' W), eastern Louisiana (USA). Methods: We used ecologically sensitive restoration logging to remove patches of Pinus palustris (longleaf pine) in a second-growth loess plain Pinus palustris savanna managed using frequent lightning season fires. Five years later, we measured numbers of vascular plant species and transmitted light in replicated 100-m\u00b2 plots. Treatments involved three different overstorey conditions: no overstorey for 5 years, no overstorey for several decades, and overstorey pines present for decades. Results: Both recent and long-term openings contained, on average, about 100 vascular plant species per 100 m\u00b2, 20% more than in similar-sized areas beneath overstorey trees. Responses varied with life form; more herbaceous species occurred in recent and older overstorey openings than beneath overstorey trees. Total numbers of all species and of less abundant forb species were positively and linearly related to light transmitted to ground level. Those species responding to openings in the overstorey and positively associated with increased transmitted light levels were monocarpic and shortlived perennial forb and grass species with a seed bank in the soil. In addition, community structure, as reflected in species composition and abundances, appeared to vary with canopy condition. Conclusions: Restoration involving ecologically sensitive removal of patches of overstorey pines in frequently burned pine savannas should benefit the ground cover and increase plant species biodiversity as a result of increased abundance of seed bank species.\n      </p>", "1. Freshwater ecosystems have long been affected by numerous types of human interventions that have a negative impact on their water quality and ecological state. Fortunately, in most western countries the input of sewage to freshwater systems has been reduced, but hydromorphological alterations, eutrophication-related turbidity and loss of biodiversity remain major problems in many parts of the world. Such impacts prevent the achievement of a high or good ecological state, as defined by the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) or other standards. 2. This paper synthesizes and links the findings presented in the seven papers of this special profile, focusing on the effects of anthropogenic stressors on freshwater ecosystems and on how to maintain and restore ecological quality. The papers cover a broad range of research areas and methods, but are all centred on the relationship between dispersal barriers, the connectivity of waterways and the restoration of rivers and lakes. 3. The construction of dams and reservoirs disturbs the natural functioning of many streams and rivers and shore-line development around lakes may reduce habitat complexity. New methods demonstrate how reservoirs may have a severe impact on the distribution and connectivity of fish populations, and new techniques illustrate the potential of using graph theory and connectivity models to illustrate the ecological implications. Hydromorphologically degraded rivers and streams can be restored by addition of wood debris, but 'passive' restoration via natural wood recruitment may be preferable. The most cost-effective way to restore streams may also include information campaigns to farmers on best management practices. Removal of zooplanktivorous fish often has marked positive effects on trophic structure in lakes, but there is a tendency to return to turbid conditions after 8-10 years or less unless fish removal is repeated. 4. Synthesis and applications. Development of new methods, as well as derivation of more general conclusions from reviewing the effects of previous restoration efforts, are crucial to achieve progress in applied freshwater research. The papers contained in this Special Profile contribute on both counts, as well as illustrating the importance of well-designed research projects and monitoring programmes to record the effects of the interventions. Such efforts are vital if we are to improve our knowledge of freshwater systems and to elaborate the best and most cost-effective recommendations. They may also help in achieving a good ecological state or potential in water bodies by 2015, as demanded by the European WFD.\n      </p>", "1. Many restoration projects aim to transform degraded vegetation into mature native plant communities. The recovery of the structure and properties of reference native plant communities is acknowledged as a landmark of restoration, and the success of restoration practices is measured in terms of community metrics. Nurse-assisted planting has been proposed as a promising technique for the restoration of Mediterranean and arid vegetation based on its success at seedling establishment rather than on the recovery of reference community properties. We investigate the adequacy of this restoration practice by shifting the focus of restoration from the species to the community level. 2. In contrast to previous studies in the Mediterranean region, we assessed the efficacy of several management techniques, including nurse-based planting, in the recovery of the structure and properties of mature native reference communities. In a burned area of southern Spain, we applied widely used community analysis tools (rarefaction and species accumulation curves, Chao 2 richness estimator, species evenness and beta diversity) to compare the profiles of a reference native community and the community achieved through different management practices: traditional planting, nurse-based planting and controls where natural regeneration was allowed to occur. 3. Our results showed that post-fire establishment of planted seedlings was higher under the canopy of nurses than in open ground. More importantly, nurse-based restoration increased the species richness and evenness of tall-shrubs and trees as well as the life-form diversity, with the restored community approaching the reference community in terms of both composition and structure of the bank of juveniles. 4. Synthesis and applications. We conclude that in contrast to traditional reforestation, where diversity is constrained by the elimination of pioneer and regenerated tall-shrubs, nurse-based restoration contributes to accelerated recovery of important community structure and properties. Thus, it should be used preferentially over traditional reforestation in Mediterranean mountains where restoration of native communities, and not merely tree establishment, is dictated under current habitat directives.\n      </p>", "Increased population pressure and human activities have significantly altered the effectiveness of functions of ecosystems (\"ecosystem services\") at the local and regional scale. Of primary importance is the decrease in water quality due to urban storm water runoff. A number of communities have initiated restoration strategies to improve water quality standards. One such strategy is the incorporation of riparian walkways with native flora. As a result of such restoration efforts, habitats for native fauna have improved, and the number and diversity of wildlife have increased in urban settings. Restoration of urban habitats also provides social and economic benefits to the surrounding community. Efforts to mitigate the loss of ecological resources by restoring native habitats on lots that cannot be developed or on abandoned lots hold a high, unrealized potential. Habitat restoration not only provides natural diversions to urban surroundings, but also enlightens and educates individual citizens about the importance of balanced ecosystems and the role of humans within ecosystems. Education is the primary step toward creating ecologically sustainable communities.\n      </p>", "Perhaps no species elicits more polarized opinions in the United States than the gray wolf (Canis lupus). Both proponents and opponents of wolf recovery use symbolic language in an attempt to persuade others to change their attitudes and values. We used structured phone interviews with 1,300 registered voters to examine the attitudes of people living in Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico toward a proposed restoration of the gray wolf to the southern Rocky Mountains, and to examine the ability of persuasive arguments to change these attitudes. We found a high level of support for wolf restoration by residents of all 3 states; 64% of respondents favored reestablishing wolves in the southern Rockies, whereas 33% expressed opposition. Support was general across almost all demographic and other groups sampled, the exception being ranchers (44% in favor, 53% opposed). Persuasive arguments had little impact on respondents' attitudes toward wolves and their proposed restoration. Overall support for wolf reestablishment remained high and increased slightly after respondents heard persuasive arguments for and against wolf restoration. Yet most respondents (63.3%) did not change their level of support or opposition to the idea of reestablishing wolves after hearing persuasive arguments. Most people who did change their opinion increased the extremity of their responses, supporting attitudinal theory that predicts that people with strongly held attitudes will increase the extremity of their opinions after receiving more information. The attitudes people hold are critically important to the success of wolf restoration efforts. Although most of the public supports wolf restoration, polarization of the issue remains strong. This polarization poses a significant challenge to wildlife managers. If management agencies decide to pursue wolf restoration in the southern Rockies, efforts to mitigate strongly polarized positions should be given a high priority. Alternatively, if those agencies choose not to restore wolves, they likely will face significant controversy as unsatisfied wolf proponents make their feelings known.\n      </p>", "The absence of top-level predators in many natural areas in North America has resulted in overabundant ungulate populations, cascading negative impacts on plant communities, and the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem processes. Meanwhile, distinct population segments of the gray wolf (Canis lupus) have been removed from the list of endangered and threatened species, implying an end to wolf recovery and reintroductions. We propose another paradigm for wolf conservation, one that emphasizes ecosystem recovery instead of wolf recovery. Improvements in technology, an enhanced understanding of the ecological role of wolves, lessons from other countries, and changing public attitudes provide a new context and opportunity for wolf conservation and ecosystem restoration. Under this new paradigm, small populations of wolves, even single packs, could be restored to relatively small natural areas for purposes of ecosystem restoration and stewardship. We acknowledge the complications and challenges involved in such an effort, but assert that the benefits could be substantial.\n      </p>", "The key factors determining the ecology of large rivers and their adjacent floodplains are extent, duration and dynamics of the hydrological connectivity between the two compartments, both via surface flow and groundwater flow. This hydrological connectivity has been strongly reduced in all large European rivers due to regulation and damming. The present paper discusses the scientific background in planning a restoration strategy for the free-flowing stretch of the Danube in Austria. As a first step in this conservation strategy, which is within the framework of the `Alluvium Zone National Park', a large-scale pilot project has been developed to restore the hydrological and ecological integrity of the river-floodplain system. In order to assess the progress towards the project's ecological objectives, various limnological variables (functional descriptors) are to be monitored.\n      </p>", "The well-documented decline of the Pinus palustris ecosystem has resulted from several anthropogenic influences, such as forest clearing (e.g. pine plantation forestry, agriculture) and urban development, both of which are closely related to increases in human populations. Other impacts have arisen from alterations in disturbance regimes responsible for maintaining the structure and function of these ecosystems. Restoration and management of degraded pine savanna ecosystems is critical. Identification of ecological processes that determine the structure and function of the intact system are important because successful restoration efforts should be based on sound scientific understanding. In this paper, we introduce this special issue on the ecology, conservation, and restoration of the Pinus palustris ecosystem. Some global climate change scenarios have suggested that future changes may occur that alter frequency and severity of disturbances such as fires and hurricanes. Such changes may have large effects on pine stands, and ultimately entire Pinus palustris savanna ecosystems, thus presenting further challenges to their sustainable management.\n      </p>", "Eleven years of abandonment of a species-rich fenmeadow under undisturbed environmental conditions resulted in transformation into areas with tall herb-, sedge- and rushdominated communities and areas with Alnus thicket. Species cover was measured in permanent plots in both community types and succession was monitored during 14 yr of restoration following reintroduction of management. The annual increase in accumulated species number followed a log-log-time linear regression during 10 yr of grazing management. The expected number of years taken before this annual rate was equal to annual extinction, i.e. a stable situation according to species density, was up to six. The response of 64 species to management was evaluated through paired statistical tests of changes in cover and frequency over time. In total, 55 species could each be allocated to one unique response model (monotone or non-monotone, concave models) independently of the importance value used (cover or frequency) and type of management (grazing following felling or mowing and mowing without grazing). Species which increased in response to grazing had the most persistent seed banks and CR-strategies, while species decreasing in response to grazing had less persistent seed banks and CS-strategies. Some of the species which increased due to grazing followed a model with a local maximum in cover and frequency. The results are discussed in relation to management of species with high cover value during restoration succession.\n      </p>", "Reestablishing native plant communities is an important focus of ecosystem restoration. In complex landscapes containing a diversity of ecosystem types, restoration requires a set of reference vegetation conditions for the ecosystems of concern, and a predictive model to relate plant community composition to physical variables. Restoration also requires an approach for prioritizing efforts, to facilitate allocation of limited institutional resources. Hierarchy theory provides a conceptual approach for predicting plant communities of disturbed ecosystems and, ultimately, for prioritizing restoration efforts. We demonstrate this approach using a landscape in southwestern Georgia, USA. Specifically, we used an existing hierarchical ecosystem classification, based on geomorphology, soil, and vegetation, to identify reference plant communities for each type of ecosystem in the landscape. We demonstrate that ecosystem identity is highly predictable using only geomorphic and soil variables, because these upper hierarchical levels control the development of vegetation, a lower hierarchical level. We mapped the potential distribution of reference ecosystems in the landscape and used GIS (geographic information systems) to determine relative abundance of each ecosystem, as a measure of its historical rarity. We joined the reference ecosystem map with a current cover map to determine current abundance of each reference ecosystem, and percentage conversion to different disturbance classes. We show that over half of the landscape supports something other than reference plant communities, but degree of rarity varies widely among ecosystems. Finally, we present an index that integrates information on historical and current rarity of ecosystems, and disturbance levels of individual polygons, to prioritize restoration efforts. The premise of the index is that highest priority be given to restoring (1) currently rare ecosystems that were also historically rare and (2) the least disturbed examples of these ecosystems, as these will require the least effort to restore. We found that 80% of high-priority sites occur within just three (of 21) ecosystems. Moreover, the high-priority ecosystems all occur within stream valleys. Our approach provides managers with a straightforward methodology for determining potential distribution of reference ecosystems and for allocating efforts and resources for restoration in complex landscapes. Development of a priority index for a specific landscape requires an understanding of the hierarchical relationships among geomorphology, soil characteristics, and plant communities, in addition to well-defined restoration objectives.\n      </p>", "Fen meadows (Cirsio dissecti-Molinietum) are seriously threatened by desiccation, acidification and eutrophication. In The Netherlands several projects were launched to restore damaged fen meadows. This review describes how successes and failures of these restoration projects depend on hydrological systems. Six hydrological systems have been distinguished, which all provide the site conditions required by this community. Nowadays, the best developed fen meadows are found in the higher Pleistocene landscape of The Netherlands, where they depend on base-rich groundwater discharging from local or large groundwater systems. Fen meadows of the lower Holocene landscape usually occur in man-made surface water systems. Almost all stands have been severely deteriorated. Restoration of fen meadows in the Pleistocene landscape is promising when the hydrology is only slightly disturbed or when hydrological measures are taken in combination with sod cutting. Restoration prospects of fen meadows in the Holocene landscape are low. Until now a complete regeneration of Cirsio-Molinietum meadows has not been realized. Restoration measures failed to restore high pH values in the top soil. It is hypothesized that viable seeds of many target species lack in the soil seed bank. In addition, the dispersal capacities of these species seem to be limited.\n      </p>", "Question: How does the relationship between the viable soil seed bank species composition and the above-ground vegetation in northern Arizona Pinus ponderosa forests differ under varying historical land use disturbances (low, intermediate, high)? Is above-ground vegetation correlated to the viable soil seed bank immediately following soil disturbance from restoration thinning treatments? Location: Northern Arizona, USA. Methods: Soil seed bank samples were taken along replicated transects and collected with a 5-cm diameter bulk density hammer. Samples included a 5 -cm diameter O-horizon sample (at varying depths) plus the underlying mineral soil to a depth of 5 c m. The seedling emergent method was used to quantify seed bank species composition and density. The herbaceous and shrub plant community was quantified along the same transects using the point intercept method. Results: Early-successional or ruderal species were common in the soil seed bank at all three disturbance sites. Non-native species, notably Verbascum thapsus, were more numerous (up to 940 seeds/m\u00b2) under high disturbance with overgrazing and logging, and less common or absent under low disturbance. Most viable seeds were found in the O-horizon and the upper 5 cm of mineral soil; there was little correlation between species in the soil seed bank and the above-ground vegetation. Conclusions: We recommend that restoration plans be geared toward minimizing activities, such as severe soil disturbance, that may promote the spread of non-native invasive species, and that manual seeding be explored as an option to restore plant species diversity and abundance.\n      </p>", "Perennial pepperweed is an invasive noxious weed spreading rapidly throughout a wide range of habitats in the western United States. Shoots form dense monotypic stands with high initial leaf area, dense inflorescences, and deep litter layers that inhibit the establishment of other plant species. Roots store large amounts of carbohydrates for future growth, establish deep into the soil, and are responsible for clonal expansion of populations. In sodic soils, increases in N, Mg, and Ca were observed in invaded compared with noninvaded areas. Several management methods are effective in controlling perennial pepperweed, but success is dependent on age and density of infestations. Knowledge of many factors, including perennial pepperweed's biology and specific characteristics of the infested area, will help in the development of the most appropriate, site-specific management and restoration plans.\n      </p>", "Native oyster reefs once dominated many estuaries, ecologically and economically. Centuries of resource extraction exacerbated by coastal degradation have pushed oyster reefs to the brink of functional extinction worldwide. We examined the condition of oyster reefs across 144 bays and 44 ecoregions; our comparisons of past with present abundances indicate that more than 90% of them have been lost in bays (70%) and ecoregions (63%). In many bays, more than 99% of oyster reefs have been lost and are functionally extinct. Overall, we estimate that 85% of oyster reefs have been lost globally. Most of the world's remaining wild capture of native oysters (&gt; 75%) comes from just five ecoregions in North America, yet the condition of reefs in these ecoregions is poor at best, except in the Gulf of Mexico. We identify many cost-effective solutions for conservation, restoration, and the management of fisheries and nonnative species that could reverse these oyster losses and restore reef ecosystem services.\n      </p>", "The use of in vitro propagated Ruppia maritima for seagrass meadow restoration was evaluated in two experiments. Experiment 1 compared two different planting methods for in vitro propagated plants. In one method, cultured plants were attached to metal staples which were then inserted into the sediment. Almost all of these transplants disappeared within one month at the four different planting sites. For the other method, in vitro propagated plants were first transferred to peat pots and grown in a flowing seawater system for six weeks. These transplants showed 20 to 80% survival. Ruppia maritima was still growing in experimental plots after 11 months at three of the four sites. There was an increase in the number of short shoots m - and the percent cover. After 23 months, there was decreased cover of R. maritima and an increase in Zostera marina. In Experiment 2, R. maritima was propagated in vitro using a modified culture medium. Plants from these cultures were directly rooted ex vitro in peat pots during six weeks growth in a flowing seawater system. These planting units were transplanted to three sites. After 12 months, the experimental plots showed significant coverage of R. maritima at two sites. The other site was a more exposed location and had no R. maritima in the experimental plots from either Experiment 1 or 2, probably due to the severe winter storm of 1993. The increase in shoot numbers and areal coverage in the experimental plots suggests that R. maritima can be propagated in vitro and used successfully for habitat restoration.\n      </p>", "Vegetation development bordering the Middle Rio Grande, as with most major southwestern U.S. tributaries, has historically undergone rapid and dynamic change. The introduction of saltcedar (or Tamarisk, genus Tamarix) and other exotic species into this environment within the 20th century has contributed to this process. These plants are now an integral component of the riparian vegetation mix. Manpower, logistics, and financial resources constrain the degree to which a desired riparian habitat can be restored from saltcedar thickets on the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge near Socorro, NM. Saltcedar clearing is accomplished using a combination of herbicide, burning, and mechanical control techniques costing from $750 to $1,300/ha. Soil salinity and depth to water are the principal physical features limiting revegetation efforts. Cottonwood and black willow plantings and natural regeneration after timed irrigations have produced diverse habitats that support a wide array of faunal species in areas previously occupied by homogeneous saltcedar.\n      </p>", "Common loss functions used for the restoration of grey scale images include the zero-one loss and the sum of squared errors. The corresponding estimators, the posterior mode and the posterior marginal mean, are optimal Bayes estimators with respect to their way of measuring the loss for different error configurations. However, both these loss functions have a fundamental weakness: the loss does not depend on the spatial structure of the errors. This is important because a systematic structure in the errors can lead to misinterpretation of the estimated image. We propose a new loss function that also penalizes strong local sample covariance in the error and we discuss how the optimal Bayes estimator can be estimated using a two-step Markov chain Monte Carlo and simulated annealing algorithm. We present simulation results for some artificial data which show improvement with respect to small structures in the image.\n      </p>", "Although there have been numerous studies of California upland oak regeneration and growth there has been no research investigating oak sapling growth in riparian environments. This study looks at the growth response of young valley oak (Quercus lobata Nee), a dominant late successional riparian species in California, across environmental variation on a floodplain. Growth was measured over the course of three years at four different sites. The sites were chosen to represent the range of successional stages and surface age. Growth was significantly higher on younger, unforested sites. There was no difference in growth rate in the two forested sites (early successional cottonwood willow forest and late successional mature oak forest). Herbivory was highest in the cottonwood willow forest, where density of young oaks was also highest. The impact of flooding was measured on the youngest floodplain surface, an open floodplain restoration site where acorns were planted the year our study began. There was a significant negative impact of flooding on sapling growth in all but the first year of growth. Taken together these results suggest that existing forest trees and flooding both inhibit the growth of valley oaks on the floodplain, and that restoration in open sites may be more successful than restoration under an existing canopy.\n      </p>", "Ecological restoration is a key component of biological conservation. Nevertheless, unlike protection of existing areas, restoration changes existing land use and can therefore be more controversial. Some restoration projects negatively affect surrounding landowners, creating social constraints to restoration success. Just as negative off-site impacts (i.e., negative externalities) flow from industrial areas to natural areas, restoration projects can generate negative externalities for commercial land uses, such as agriculture. Negative externalities from industry have led to government regulation to prevent human health and environmental impacts. Negative externalities from restoration projects have elicited similar legal constraint on at least one large-scale conservation project, riparian restoration in the Sacramento River Conservation Area. The negative externalities of restoration that are perceived to be the direct result of specific goals, such as endangered species management, are likely to be more contentious than externalities arising from unintended phenomena such as weed invasion. Restoration planners should give equal consideration to off-site characteristics as to on-site characteristics when choosing sites for restoration and designing projects. Efforts to control externalities can lead to off-site ecological benefits. /// La restauraci\u00f3n ecol\u00f3gica es un componente clave de la conservaci\u00f3n biol\u00f3gica.

Las externalidades negativas de la industria han conducido a la regulaci\u00f3n gubernamental para prevenir impactos ambientales y sobre la salud humana.

In most parts of the world, riparian zones are highly modified. Changes caused by alien plants - or environmental changes that facilitate shifts in dominance creating novel ecosystems - are often important agents of perturbation in these systems. Many restoration projects are underway. Objective frameworks based on an understanding of biogeographical processes at different spatial scales (reach, segment, catchment), the specific relationships between invasive plants and resilience and ecosystem functioning, and realistic endpoints are needed to guide sustainable restoration initiatives. This paper examines the biogeography and the determinants of composition and structure of riparian vegetation in temperate and subtropical regions and conceptualizes the components of resilience in these systems. We consider changes to structure and functioning caused by, or associated with, alien plant invasions, in particular those that lead to breached abiotic- or biotic thresholds. These pose challenges when formulating restoration programmes. Pervasive and escalating human-mediated changes to multiple factors and at a range of scales in riparian environments demand innovative and pragmatic approaches to restoration. The application of a new framework accommodating such complexity is demonstrated with reference to a hypothetical riparian ecosystem under three scenarios: (1) system unaffected by invasive plants; (2) system initially uninvaded, but with flood-generated incursion of alien plants and escalating invasion-driven alteration; and (3) system affected by both invasions and engineering interventions. The scheme has been used to derive a decision-making framework for restoring riparian zones in South Africa and could guide similar initiatives in other parts of the world.\n      </p>", "Although studies have shown that peatland drainage and harvesting alter local hydrology, microclimate, and peat characteristics, little is known about the effects of these changes on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rates. This study examines the different factors affecting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production from natural and cutover peatlands. Laboratory peat incubations were performed under aerobic and anaerobic conditions to determine the influence of temperature, soil moisture, and peat depth on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rates from peat samples taken from: (1) a natural peatland; (2) a 2-year post-cutover peatland and; (3) a 7-year post-cutover peatland. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rates ranged from 0.21 to 4.87 \u03bcmol g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; d&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; under anaerobic conditions, and from 0.37 to 15.69 \u03bcmol g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; d&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the aerobic trials. While no significant differences were found between the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rates of the two cutover sites, the natural site consistently displayed higher production values. The natural site was also the only site to exhibit strong depth dependent trends, thus indicating the importance of the upper peat layer with respect to substrate quality. Higher production rates were found under aerobic than anaerobic conditions, with the greatest response to oxygen observed at the natural site. Production rates increased with both temperature and soil moisture, with maximum production rates found at 20 \u00b0C and 92% moisture content. Temperature responses were generally greater at the cutover sites, while soil moisture had greater effects on the natural site peat. Results of this work agree with previous studies that suggest that it is essential to begin restoration once a cutover peatland is abandoned. Re-wetting a cutover peatland (through restoration practices) is necessary to prevent an increase in peat temperature and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production since cutover peat has higher Q&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; values than natural peat. A decrease in overall peatland oxidation should reduce the persistent source of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from cutover peatlands and the irreversible changes in peat structure that impede Sphagnum re-establishment.\n      </p>", "We investigated factors at multiple scales that might influence nest predation risk for Spotted Towhees (Pipilo maculatus) along the Sacramento River, California, within the context of large-scale riparian habitat restoration. We used the logistic-exposure method and Akaike's information criterion (AIC) for model selection to compare predator search, predator abundance, restoration, and temporal effects hypotheses. Our candidate models represented restoration, temporal, nest activity, nest concealment, agriculture, and flood effects. Restoration sites did function as breeding habitat, with nest survival comparable to mature forest sites and some young being produced. The best-supported models contained the covariates cowbird young in host nest and calendar date. All supported models contained the covariate cowbird young, the only variable with a strong effect. In contrast to our prediction, nest survival increased with cowbird young in the nest, implicating adult cowbirds in nest predation events. Nest survival declined throughout the breeding season and increased marginally with nest concealment. We calculated the finite rate of population increase (\u03bb), using a model that incorporated nest success estimates for parasitized and unparasitized nests, double brooding, the locally observed cowbird parasitism rate for Spotted Towhees, number of young fledged from successful parasitized and unparasitized nests, adult survival and a range of juvenile survival values, estimated as percentages of adult survival. Values of \u03bb did not approach the replacement level of one, indicating that this population is not self-sustaining. We recommend extensive habitat restoration in the floodplain landscape, ideally in conjunction with cowbird control, to reduce nest predation and parasitism pressures. /// En el contexto de un esfuerzo de restauraci\u00f3n de ambientes ribere\u00f1os de gran escala, investigamos los factores que pueden afectar el riesgo de la depredaci\u00f3n de nidos de Pipilo maculatus a diferentes escalas a lo largo del R\u00edo Sacramento, California.

Nuestros modelos candidatos representaron los efectos de restauraci\u00f3n, temporales, de la actividad de los nidos, de la ocultaci\u00f3n de los nidos, de la agricultura y de las inundaciones. Los sitios de restauraci\u00f3n s\u00ed funcionaron como ambientes de reproducti\u00f3n: la supervivencia de los nidos en \u00e9stos fue comparable a la de sitios ubicados en bosque maduro y se produjeron algunos juveniles. Los modelos m\u00e1s robustos incluyeron las covariables de presencia de polluelos de Molothrus ater en el nido y la fecha. Todos los modelos apoyados incluyeron la covariable presencia de polluelos de M. ater, y \u00e9sta fue la \u00fanica covariable con un efecto grande. En contraste con nuestra predicti\u00f3n, la supervivencia de los nidos fue mayor en nidos con polluelos de M. ater que en nidos sin \u00e9stos, lo que involucra a los adultos de M. ater en los eventos de depredaci\u00f3n de nidos. La supervivencia de los nidos disminuy\u00f3 durante la temporada de nidificaci\u00f3n y se increment\u00f3 marginalmente con la ocultaci\u00f3n de los nidos.

The pH of the various peat substrates was increased by adding different amounts of lime: 0-2 to 4-8 g- CaCO3. kg-1 fresh peat. Both peat type and lime addition were found to affect the buoyancy of the peat substrates. Low nutrient concentrations in the peat, together with a high bulk density, proved to be unfavourable for creating floating peat. Three of the peat types proved to be too acidic (pH &lt; 4.5) to produce sufficient methane (ca. 400 -600 \u03bc mol. L-1), and buoyancy was only achieved if lime was mixed in with the peat. The smallest amount of lime added (2 g. kg-1 fresh peat) was sufficient to maintain buoyancy for at least one year. Lime addition did not stimulate nutrient mobilization by mineralization, although P, N and K concentrations in the peat water were relatively high. It is concluded that floating peat can be initiated by the introduction of poorly humified peat. If the peat substrates are too acidic, lime can be added to stimulate buoyancy of the peat. Results are discussed in relation to restoration prospects.\n      </p>", "The hypothesis of the association between an increase in cytokinin activity and restoration of anther fertility in msm1 cytoplasm was tested. The following barley lines with Hordeum vulgare cv. Adorra nuclear gene background were studied: Adorra cytoplasm without nuclear restorer gene (fertile), Adorra cytoplasm homozygous for nuclear Rfm1a gene (fertile), msm1 cytoplasm without restorer gene (male sterile), msm1 cytoplasm homozygous for nuclear Rfm1a gene (fertile). Ethanolic extracts of root exudate were fractionated and bioassayed for cytokinins. Both the biological activity and the total quantity of cytokinins appeared lowest in the unrestored male sterile line. The total biological activities of cytokinins in the three fertile lines were similar, but the quantities in the restorer gene carriers appeared lower. On the other hand, the restorer gene carriers, independent of the cytoplasm, showed 8-9 times more of a bound cytokinin. Because the bound form is evidently underestimated by the bioassay, the increase in the bound cytokinin fraction may mean even a higher total content in the Rfm1a gene carriers than in Adorra without the gene. The bound cytokinin may be translocated more readily to distal organs (e.g., the anthers) compared with unbound cytokinins. Because cytokinins are associated with various ecophysiological processes, the rise in a particular form may explain the heterogeneous distribution of the restorer gene in wild barley populations in different regions of Israel.\n      </p>", "The abundance and species composition in the seed-bank and extant vegetation were investigated in a lakeshore wetland. The seed-bank in different layers at 5 cm intervals was also studied by using the seedling-emergence method with waterlogged and submerged greenhouse treatments. Thirtyfour species and 1788 seedlings germinated in the seed-bank, with a mean density of 1227 seedlings m\u207b\u00b2 (40\u20132600). Thirty-one species and 22261 individuals were obtained in the extant vegetation with a mean density of 1436 seedlings m\u207b\u00b2 (368-12632). The Margalef species richness index was 4.41 in the seedbank and 2.99 in the extant vegetation. Little overlap (14 taxa, 43%) was found between the seed-bank and the extant vegetation. The total number of species and seedlings that germinated in different layers was significantly different. The number of species that germinated in the surface layer (21 taxa) was not significantly different from that in the second layer (27 taxa). Only 39.2% of the total number of seedlings appeared in the surface layer. Our results indicated that a lakeshore wetland seed-bank with viable seeds and high species richness can be used as a macrophyte pool in degraded wetland restoration. Vegetation produced from such a seed-bank will have species similar to the pre-disturbance assemblage. The large number of viable seeds that we found conserved in deeper layers suggests that the most valuable macrophyte pools are conserved at depth. With disturbance, these seeds could be brought back to the surface, and serve as a reserve in recruiting the extant vegetation. We suggest using the sediment containing rich viable propagules in the actual reconstruction project.\n      </p>", "Ecological restoration is the process of reestablishing the structure and function of native ecosystems and developing mutually beneficial human-wildland interactions that are compatible with the evolutionary history of those systems. Restoration is based on an ecosystem's reference conditions (or natural range of variability); the difference between reference conditions and contemporary conditions is used to assess the need for restorative treatments and to evaluate their success. Since ecosystems are highly complex and dynamic, it is not possible to describe comprehensively all possible attributes of reference conditions. Instead, ecosystem characteristics with essential roles in the evolutionary environment are chosen for detailed study. Key characteristics of structure, function, and disturbance-especially fire regimes in ponderosa pine ecosystems-are quantified as far as possible through dendroecological and paleoecological studies, historical evidence, and comparison to undisrupted sites. Ecological restoration treatments are designed to reverse recent, human-caused ecological degradation. Testing of restoration treatments at four sites in northern Arizona, USA, has shown promise, but the diverse context of management goals and constraints for Southwestern forest ecosystems means that appropriate applications of restoration techniques will probably differ in various settings.\n      </p>", "Wetlands in the central Platte River basin provide numerous ecosystem services but have been diminished and degraded by agricultural practices and development. Wetland restoration is increasingly common in this region, but the success of restorations is virtually unknown. We sampled macroinvertebrates during spring 2003 and 2004 in restored (5-16 y old) and natural slough wetlands to assess restoration success. Simple measures (e.g., total abundance, biomass, diversity) were all similar in restored and natural wetlands. Communities were similar in natural and restored wetlands, but we observed some taxonomic differences. For example, abundances of Helisoma and Pisidium and abundance and biomass of amphipods were higher in natural than in restored wetlands, and leeches were collected only in natural wetlands. These results suggest that dispersal ability is a biotic filter limiting recovery and that these noninsects are good candidates for assessing recovery. Functional structure on the basis of abundance was similar between natural and restored wetlands, but some differences in biomass-based estimates were evident. For example, relative biomass of collector-filterers was higher in natural than in restored wetlands in 2003. Multivariate analyses indicated that factors such as hydroperiod might be more important than restoration status in shaping wetland macroinvertebrate communities. Furthermore, drought conditions constrained our sampling efforts and influenced temporal patterns, thereby underscoring the need for multiyear studies, especially under extreme environmental conditions. Our results indicate that wetland macroinvertebrate communities in this region are resilient and recover rapidly after restoration, but that ongoing restoration and management efforts should focus on hydrology, which might limit recovery in restorations and is a critical factor shaping wetland macroinvertebrate communities.\n      </p>"], "words": {"wetlands": {"number": 1, "prob":
