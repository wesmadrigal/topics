Based on the creation of a community archaeology research project in Quseir, Egypt, a general methodology for facilitating effective community involvement in the study of the archaeological resource is proposed. This strategy involves seven components, including communication and collaboration, employment and training, public presentation, interviews and oral history, educational resources, a photographic and video archive, and community controlled merchandising.\n      </p>", "There is a difference between archaeology that involves local communities and archaeology that is commissioned by and for the community. This paper describes the latter within the contemporary Fijian context of political and economic domination by an urban Fijian chiefly class. It shows how community archaeology provides a strategy by which disenfranchised rural communities in Fiji can reclaim the archaeological resource and use it to establish economic independence. Such projects fall within a Fijian definition of vanua development: a harmonious concept of environmental, social and economic well-being that includes an essential respect for tradition. The benefits extend to archaeology itself. The paper analyses how community projects in Fiji can help conserve the archaeological resource, broaden the pool of people with an active stake in Fiji's past, and thereby raise the profile of archaeology in the national imagination. The subtext is a post-colonial one: the past is a contested and socially structured thing. By relinquishing control over archaeology to the local communities, not only have political and economic relations in Fiji been equalized, so has the balance between local and scientific interpretations of history.\n      </p>", "The Revolution of 1959 brought forth changes in the mission, theoretical orientation, and organization of archaeology in Cuba and created a role for, and constraints on, the profession that are unique in the Western Hemisphere. This paper draws upon examples from substantive field and laboratory research to examine the methods and theoretical perspectives of Cuban archaeology since the Revolution, focusing on the period from 1962 until the collapse of the Soviet Union. Archaeological practice during the Revolutionary period in Cuba has reflected the aims of the Revolutionary government, the influence of Soviet archaeology, the legacy of pre-Revolutionary approaches in North American archaeology, and the Cuban sense of patria.\n      </p>", "At the end of the nineteenth century, the drive to \"professionalize\" anthropology in the United States promoted the development of particular patterns of interaction between archaeologists and their patrons, which had a significant impact on the conduct of research. The expansion of fieldwork and the acquisition of collections required the financial backing of sponsors, whose own ambitions often diverged from those of the scholars whom they supported. This essay explores shifts in patron-professional relationships in southwestern archaeology at the turn of the century, using the case of the Hyde Expedition to Chaco Canyon (1896-1909).\n      </p>", "Community archaeology, understood as a distinctive set of practices within the wider discipline, is a relatively new development. Its most important distinguishing characteristic is the relinquishing of at least partial control of a project to the local community. This introduction takes a preliminary look at where this kind of archaeology is being carried out around the world and outlines what marks it out as different from other kinds of archaeology. In conclusion, it is suggested that community archaeology has a unique, if not critical, contribution to make to the future development of archaeology as a genuinely worldwide discipline.\n      </p>", "Since its infancy, American historical archaeology has maintained a relationship, albeit often a tenuous one, with its anthropological parentage. Given both the history of the field and its practitioners' often-tortured efforts to define their intentions, goals, and perspectives, it is not surprising, perhaps, that many anthropologists may not recognize the important contributions historical archaeology can make to the anthropological project. A multifaceted and wide-ranging examination of the post-Columbian world gives historical archaeology a special ability to investigate modern history and to provide insights into the historical circumstances of today's world.\n      </p>", "\"Mission archaeology\" is a novel conjunction of terms devised to focus attention on an archaeology of mission sites, and thereby on the light that can be shed on the process of the Christianization of the Americas by examining the material culture of missions. Discussion centers on a summary of mission research in the Spanish-occupied territories of North America and Mayan Mesoamerica. I then draw conclusions from these data, and from anthropological and historical analyses of mission encounters, to suggest where mission studies should be headed and the role that archaeology can play in expanding our knowledge of the mission transformation.\n      </p>", "What should students learn through studying archaeology at university in Australia and what key challenges do university staff and students face? This paper presents an analysis of short written responses to these questions from over fifty delegates at a national teaching and learning workshop for archaeologists held in Sydney in September 2003. The most highly valued learning outcomes were generic. Delegates' responses placed major emphasis on students' ability to apply archaeological knowledge and skills in the cultural heritage management workplace. Most delegates were concerned about university funding cuts and government education policies and how to foster better cooperation between universities, consulting companies and government heritage agencies in teaching/training. The paper presents a critique and analysis of these and other responses in the context of the current state of Australian archaeology and attitudes towards teaching on and off campus.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "Symmetry is an epistemological and ethical principle developed in the social study of scientific practice. This essay connects a symmetrical archaeology to major trends in the discipline since the 1960s and to key components of archaeological practice - relational ontologies, mixtures of past and present, people and things, biology and culture, individual and society. Symmetrical archaeology is a culmination of effort in archaeology to undercut these modernist dualities and to recognize the vitality of the present past. Symmetry adds new force to the claim that archaeologists have a unique perspective on human engagements with things, on social agency and constructions of contemporary identity.\n      </p>", "Shipwrecks are the most numerous and distinctive type of site studied by maritime archaeologists. Their uniform characteristics, regardless of date, place and type, mean that virtually all wrecks can be investigated using similar methodologies and research strategies. The contributions to this issue of World Archaeology demonstrate both these common features and the wide variety of archaeological and historical contexts in which wreck data can be placed. They also reflect the truly global nature of underwater archaeology as it has evolved over the past decade, with many sites investigated in previously undeveloped regions and an attendant increase in cultural resource management. This period has also seen significant developments in theory. A distinctive agenda is developing which emphasizes the unusual quality of maritime data and the possibilities of inductive analysis, yet seeks to expand and diversify the contexts in which ships and their material culture are viewed; new approaches have been derived from symbolic, contextual and critical archaeology, and from wide-ranging socio-economic models. Diversifying the contexts in which wreck evidence is interpreted underlines its essential richness and its unique contribution to archaeology.\n      </p>", "I describe a number of student-focused laboratory exercises that are inexpensive, yet show the scientific character of archaeology.

In another exercise, students learn how to reconstruct broken pots.\n      </p>", "Near Eastern archaeology is traditionally characterized by a chronocentric approach, prioritizing the study of chronology and 'culture groups'. Additionally, the sense of vision dominates most archaeological interpretations. Both these factors derive from modern, Western values.

Hanseatic urban settlements in northern Europe shared many things in common. Their cultural 'signature' was articulated physically through a shared vocabulary of step-gabled brick architecture and domestic goods. Although the Hansa remains a monolith in the popular historical imagination, it is rapidly becoming a multidisciplinary field of study juxtaposing often-contradictory material and documentary sources. The redevelopment of towns on the Baltic littoral, particularly of those formerly behind the Iron Curtain, offers archaeological opportunities to create parallel biographies of medieval mercantile communities that avoid tautology but bring a new texturing to the reconstruction of cultural development in the region. The archaeology of the Hansa in the Baltic - as a case study in historical archaeology - offers the prospect of investigating some of the key attributes of pre-industrial European society on the macro-regional scale. Such attributes include the development of mercantile capitalism, Europeanization, colonialism, acculturation and resistance. Ceramic distributions are particularly sensitive to reflecting levels of adoption and resistance to Hanseatic cultural influences among diverse communities, notably in the spheres of dining practice and domestic comfort. The paper begins with a review of historical perceptions of Hansa culture in the region and how rescue excavation is now redefining a sense of identity among local communities in a changing geo-political environment.\n      </p>", "This paper briefly sets the scene for the articles that follow, introducing some key debates that have characterized the recent practice of historical archaeology. The definition of historical archaeology is explored according to parameters of chronology and methodology, drawing a distinction between New World traditions that define the subject as 'post-Columbian' and Old World approaches that establish broader connections with the 'documentary archaeology' of all literate societies. Current issues in European and American historical archaeology are highlighted, including the gradual breakdown of the medieval/post-medieval divide and the call for a global 'modern-world archaeology' to address the 'grand historical narratives' of the period, such as capitalism, economic improvement, and consumerism. The resistance to this global research agenda is explored with reference to archaeologies of diaspora and postcolonialism, which demand local perspectives to explore diversity and meaning. Finally, the innovative use of community archaeology and multivocality is introduced, with particular reference to the experimental narratives pursued by American historical archaeologists, in their new role as 'storytellers'.\n      </p>", "The author describes a hands-on laboratory to use with simulated (teaching) archaeology sites.

Mollusc evidence retrieved from excavations in Bahrain indicates that this might be an unwarranted omission. This evidence is outlined as potentially indicating the former presence of, for example, bilharzia, based upon the recovery of its vector, Bulinus shells. Disease is thus suggested as a possible continual background dynamic of potentially serious consequence in the capital of Early and Middle Islamic Bahrain, Bilad al-Qadim.\n      </p>", "Outside the Antipodes, Australian archaeology is best known as an archaeology of the distant Palaeolithic past. However, where communities have been closely involved in developing and undertaking archaeological research programs, the focus of archaeological research has been radically different, often dealing with the archaeology of the recent, remembered past and crossing disciplinary boundaries between Aboriginal and historical archaeology. Distinguishing between 'community-based archaeology' and reactive or 'consent-based' community involvement in archaeology, this paper reviews the state of archaeology and its engagement with communities in Australia. Through several case studies in both indigenous and post-contact archaeology, it demonstrates the way in which community-based research and practise is changing what it is we think of as 'archaeology' in Australia.\n      </p>", "The client-oriented approach to contract archaeology is a technical service rather than genuine scientific research. Such an approach fails to meet the requirements of the law, fails to satisfy the needs of archaeological science, and frequently fails to protect the client's interests. A client orientation encourages an excessive emphasis on profits from contract work. Profits not only exclude a balance of archaeological, client, and public interests but threaten the scientific future of contract work. Solutions to the problem of client-oriented work include better academic training as researchers, support for government archaeologists, a strong professional consensus on ethical and performance standards, and attention to public interests\n      </p>", "Postprocessual archaeology has placed great importance on individuals and social interaction, though in practice this often proves a difficult project to realize. The rich archaeological and cultural data offered in an Egyptian context suggest that it is possible to identify how specific individuals and groups functioned with a domestic context, taking into account the complex vectors of social inequality-age, sex, class, status, and life experience. In the process, this paper seeks to question the narrow construal of gender as analogous to the domain of women, and show the inadequacies of such an approach. It offers an opportunity to mesh material culture with social theory by linking sociocultural, spatial, and temporal data.\n      </p>", "The rich prehistoric archaeological record in Andean South America has obscured the importance of post-conquest historic sites in the region. Archaeologists researching the former Spanish colonies have long turned to the US 'Borderlands' and the Caribbean for models defining the archaeology of Spanish colonialism. Recently, however, Andean archaeologists have begun to create new emphases on the archaeology of colonialism and archaeologies of the later Andean republics. This region was a core area of Spanish overseas expansion in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, with much of the precious metal wealth of the empire produced in Andean mines. Today archaeologists in the Andean republics of Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina, and the foreign researchers who also work in the region, are overcoming geographic, financial and linguistic barriers to create a unified Andean historical archaeology.\n      </p>", "Social archaeology encounters a fundamental theoretical dilemma. The dynamic flow of social life is speedy. As the study of the past has increasingly shifted away from the elites, towards unravelling the ordinary patterns of everyday living, we are increasingly forced to confront the short-term time scales of lived reality. The aim of this paper is to address the gap between the short-term time scales of lived life and the traditional interpretation of 'the archaeological record'. Time scales for the generation of archaeological data for three historical Greek contexts will be examined: sanctuary sites, permanent structures in rural landscapes and houses. The short-term patterns which led to the formation of these archaeological settings will be contrasted with the long-term patterns which archaeologists have frequently perceived. In conclusion I will outline interpretative strategies by which we might access the past in terms of the temporal processes through which archaeological contexts have originated.\n      </p>", "Relatively new endeavours in the biological and micro-sciences attempt to construct and reconstruct the often diseased, disabled, or otherwise imperfect human body. As such, all bodies, due to their imperfections, may be labelled 'Queer'. Queer archaeology becomes the perspective from which these new sites and their related artefacts may be exposed, assessed, and reconstructed. In this way, the metaphorical use of archaeology yields potential rhetorical and discursive fields by which contemporary - not just 'ancient' - bodies and sites may be 'unearthed'. The simultaneously virtual and real (non)corporeal contexts of biotechnology and genetic engineering enable the development of queer archaeology. This paper is an attempt to open this field of inquiry further, thereby rendering this a substantive, political, and biocultural topic for future excavation.\n      </p>", "The practice of historical archaeology is often interdisciplinary, but the relationships between archaeology and other disciplines are not often explicitly analysed. A characteristic national strand of archaeology, which crosses the boundaries between historical and Aboriginal archaeology, is developing in Australia. So it is timely to consider specific ideas for relating Indigenous oral history and historical archaeology. In our research partnership with Yarrawarra Aboriginal Corporation, which was aimed at understanding Aboriginal place knowledges, we develop the concept of \"conversation\" for analysing the research process between archaeology and oral history. We define coopting conversations as the most usual conversations engaged in between disciplines, research paradigms and between scientific and Indigenous knowledges. We then identify several more productive kinds of conversation that occurred between oral history and archaeology in our research: intersecting, parallel, complementary and contradictory. We found contradictory conversations, usually regarded as failures by other researchers, yielded the most productive analytic understandings. As a result of these different types of conversations we were able to produce a richer understanding of \"placeness\" (sensu Mayne and Lawrence 1998). The richest understandings of place at Yarrawarra develop only through such interdisciplinary conversations.\n      </p>", "An overview of the relationship between archaeology and history is presented as the context in which to situate the argument that a rapprochment between the disciplines can be achieved only if we begin to think of texts and objects as having had efficacy in the past rather than just as evidence about it. Discussions of the meaning of material culture and the power of texts conclude with the suggestion that historical archaeologists need to be more cognizant of the latter. A case-study from the Roman world is used to illustrate the fact that texts can be both instruments of oppression and vehicles for enlightenment and liberation.\n      </p>", "This paper examines middle-range theory (MRT) within processual and postprocessual archaeology. An analysis of the Binford-Schiffer dispute serves as a means of clarifying what MRT in processual archaeology is or is intended to be. Postprocessualists, despite their vigorous criticisms of MRT-based approaches, are found to rely on the same resources and types of reasoning to make their inferences. In their practice they tacitly turn to processualist middle-range principles, and so the justification of postprocessual interpretations is equivalent to that of MRT-based processualist models. If the middle range is functionally defined -- a space within a research program occupied by varying theories that are taken from the body of general theory to which the program is committed and that function as background knowledge in the verification of theories -- MRT bridges the epistemological gap between processual and postprocessual approaches.\n      </p>", "Under the influence of phenomenological approaches, a semiotic perspective on the body is being replaced in archaeology by analysis of the production and experience of lived bodies in the past through the juxtaposition of traces of body practices, idealized representations, and evidence of the effects of habitual gestures, postures, and consumption practices on the corporal body. On the basis of a shared assumption that social understandings of the body were created and reproduced through associations with material culture, archaeology of the body has proceeded from two theoretical positions: the body as the scene of display and the body as artifact. Today, the body as a site of lived experience, a social body, and site of embodied agency, is replacing prior static conceptions of an archaeology of the body as a public, legible surface.\n      </p>", "In the 1960s Indianapolis, Indiana's near-Westside, was transformed by urban renewal projects that carved space for the Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) campus out of a predominantly African-American neighborhood. Within two decades that longstanding community was totally displaced, and today the former neighborhood covering 300 acres is completely effaced and the community is largely forgotten. This paper examines how archaeology on the university campus provides a mechanism to illuminate the processes that remade the near-Westside. Archaeological research conducted along with the displaced community and its descendants provides a powerful tool to rethink the otherwise prosaic campus landscape as a space shaped by racial and class privilege.\n      </p>", "The historic period in the American West retains an infamous reputation because of sensational tales that sold newspapers. Nineteenth-century media audiences were subsequently exposed to a wilder West than the one of reality. This pattern continued into the modern era, as western films and television shows built upon the existing, romanticized imagery. The western story has been told most powerfully on film, providing mass audiences with a surface realism that can be incorrectly taken as actual historical events associated with the region. Historical archaeology can help revise the prevailing mythic understanding of western history by fostering an anthropological research agenda to highlight the West's lesser-known, but cosmopolitan heritage. The archaeology of boomtown saloons, including research at an African-American saloon in Virginia City, Nevada, USA, provides a venue for such an endeavor, using the popular appeal of archaeology in the 'wild West'.\n      </p>", "Migration is frequently invoked as an explanation for pattern in paleolithic archaeology but the credibility of doing so depends almost exclusively upon acceptance of an analogy between historical process and the processes that have combined to create an ancient archaeological record. It is argued here that paleolithic archaeology cannot be treated as an extension of history and that historical processes are therefore inappropriate analogies for the site formation processes manifest in Upper Pleistocene archaeological contexts. The credibility accorded migration as an explanatory concept varies from one national or regional research tradition to the next. Why this should be so is examined in a discussion of the paradigm concept and how it affects construals of the nature and meaning of pattern.\n      </p>", "The modern view of science differs significantly from the narrow stereotype adopted by Processual and Post-Processual schools. Archaeology conforms to this wider view once we separate the aim of the discipline from its social practice. Our basic aim--to improve knowledge about the past--requires that we evaluate competing theories. Following modern scientific methodology, we can evaluate through the use of ampliative criteria. Furthermore, because human reasons cause behavioural regularities, we need to study prehistoric values and ideals. We can study such cognitive aspects in the same way as natural scientists study unobservables, that is, through their material effects.\n      </p>", "The question of multivocality has been much explored and debated in recent archaeological publications. Clearly, the objective of such work is to assure the inclusion of the views of disadvantaged minorities and disenfranchised peoples in the presentation of their own pasts. This objective has not been achieved with much success, however, partly because mainstream archaeologists have had some difficulties in grappling with what appear to be a proliferation of \"alternative\" archaeological theories. Few discussions have approached alternative archaeologies as constituting a definable archaeological paradigm that might be termed \"The Archaeology of the Disenfranchised.\" Four different models within this paradigm are discussed and a strategy for a more widespread inclusion of alternative archaeological discussions and projects is suggested.\n      </p>", "Archaeology students at the University of Sydney answered a questionnaire about what first attracted them to archaeology and any changes in their opinions about the subject following university study. Primary and secondary education, media and visits to overseas archaeological sites were major factors in developing students' interests in archaeology. More students were interested in overseas archaeology and in archaeological processes than Australian archaeology or archaeological knowledge. The main impact of university study was to increase students' awareness of the scope of archaeology, its contemporary relevance, the contingency of archaeological knowledge and the complexity of method and practice. Results are compared with other data about public attitudes to archaeology. The study suggests that potential students, like other members of the public, are attracted to aspects of archaeology which don't reflect realities of professional practice. Stressing archaeology's contemporary relevance and skills training for employability seems unlikely to attract more students. Ways to increase public interest in Australian archaeology include actively embracing archaeology's links with history and palaeontology, more focus on narratives of discovery in public education, and increasing the scope of archaeology taught in schools and shown on television.\n      </p>", "The objective of this paper is twofold. It intends to reformulate the assumptions of interpretive archaeology and within this context to elaborate the framework within which one can study social and symbolic relationships between humans and animals in the prehistoric farming communities of Central Europe. Postprocessual archaeology has failed to provide a satisfactory account of how to judge the credibility of competing issues about the past. In the interpretive approach to animal bone assemblages, it is argued that the results of actualistic studies justify this credibility. The objective of actualistic studies is to establish how, when, and by whom the archaeological record has been produced. Credibility is also provided by the biological characteristics of animals maintained and consumed. The first level of credibility is a prerequisite to a further interpretation of the social dimensions of human action with respect to animals. The second level of interpretation is based on the horizontal distribution of archaeological pasts within and between sites.\n      </p>", "While interdisciplinarity may be an admirable goal many still doubt its benefits. The paper seeks to articulate the methods used to work across disciplines and considers the obstacles that stand in the way of \"inter-\" rather than \"mulit\"-disciplinarity. Sauer's volume is used as a starting point to highlight key concerns in integrating archaeology and ancient history: the assumption that disciplines are determined by evidence type; the encouragement of specialisms to be discipline specific; the lack of differentiation between Mode One and Mode Two collaborative projects. Briefly tracing the development of the two subjects, suggestions are made as to why history is associated with text and archaeology with object. This is followed by proposals for two key areas of integration beyond concerns of evidence type: the struggle of the two disciplines to deal with accessing the past while being products of the present, and explaining patterns of change.\n      </p>", "Concerns with spatial dimensions and social inference have long histories in archaeology. However, the two histories are not always conjoined. This article considers changing understandings of space in archaeology in the last half century, and the variable nature of what \"social\" has denoted and connoted during that same span. The review highlights recurring calls for a social archaeology, and the degree to which, in such instances, social inference has been expressed in spatial terms, especially as these have recognized people's \"decisions and dispositions\" as shaping the archaeological record. Life histories of place receive special attention as ways of discerning the existence and social impact of such decisions and dispositions. These life histories constitute an arena in which archaeologists from diverse theoretical perspectives can offer complementary insights. Moreover, they exemplify ways in which social and spatial inferences in archaeology contribute to wider understanding of human experience.\n      </p>", "How Americans remember the past is often reinforced by landscapes, monuments, commemorative ceremonies, and archaeology. These features and activities often help to create an official public memory that becomes part of a group's heritage. I suggest that public memory can be established by (1) forgetting about or excluding an alternative past, (2) creating and reinforcing patriotism, and/or (3) developing a sense of nostalgia to legitimize a particular heritage. These categories are not mutually exclusive, and the lines that separate these categories may not always be well defined. I show how post - Civil War American landscapes, monuments, and commemorative activities helped to reinforce racist attitudes in the United States that became part of the official memory. African Americans have struggled to revise the official memory of the Civil War, although the power to change this memory has been situational and not always successful.\n      </p>", "The use of oral history as a source in recent historical archaeology is a growing phenomenon. In this paper I advocate a site-based approach to this interdisciplinary work, combining archaeological, historical and memory work on a specific location to create and foster a public discourse of memory. This draws on the popular interest in archaeological work to form a nexus or meeting place for the expression, collection and communication of memory. An experiment to test this theory was carried out on a large community archaeology project on a Blitz site in East London. The results were successful, with stories and memories being volunteered by visitors to the site rather than being actively sought out.\n      </p>", "Citation analyses in archaeology have detected prestige tactics, shifts in research agendas, and patterns of gender differentiation. This paper focuses on self-citation in archaeology and systematically analyzes the factors that affect rates of self-citation. Self-citation rates in archaeology are significantly higher than in sociocultural anthropology but are average for a social science with interdisciplinary ties to the physical sciences. Self-citation correlates weakly with the gender of the citing author and the geographic and thematic focus of research, but correlates strongly with the age of the author. Additional analyses reveal partial evidence for the use of self-citation as a prestige tactic. The paper concludes with a discussion of citations to writers close to the author (mentors, friends).\n      </p>", "This review assesses the development and current status of zooarchaeological research in historical archaeology. Analytical issues in recovery, identification, quantification and interpretation are discussed with particular reference to assemblages from historical sites. The results section summarizes the substantive contributions zooarchaeological studies of historical assemblages have made to our understanding of past diet, food production systems, social and cultural variation, and archaeological interpretations. The last four decades of research has provided a strong basis for future analyses that draw together diverse strands of zooarchaeological, historical, scientific, and anthropological evidence.\n      </p>", "Archaeologists currently studying the African diaspora generally examine three broad issues, in decreasing order of prominence: the material identification of African identity, the archaeology of freedom at maroon sites, and race and racism. While conducting this research, several scholars have learned that many nonarchaeologists are deeply interested in their interpretations. At the present time, the archaeology of the African diaspora is not a truly global pursuit and the New World is overrepresented. This situation should change as archaeologists around the world discover post-Columbian archaeology and take up diasporic investigations.\n      </p>", "Archaeologists began to study slavery more than two decades ago, and since that time this interest has rapidly grown to become one of the most popular research specialties in the archaeology of the post-Columbian period. This essay reviews the interpretation of the archaeological record of slavery directed toward the analysis of four themes: living conditions under slavery, status differences within the plantation community, relationships of planter dominance and slave resistance, and formation of African-American cultural identity. It also discusses the sociopolitical context within which this study has operated and strongly recommends that greater efforts be taken to include African-American perspectives to inform this research.\n      </p>", "This article addresses the issue of race and racism in the archaeology of South America taking into account contemporary contributions in order to analyse and discuss the subtle functioning of racist thinking and ideas. It also provides a theoretical framework of departure for deconstructing and interpreting race and racism as social and cultural phenomena trying to elucidate the powerful effects implied by racist feelings. In a more general sense, this paper attempts to show that race and racism are still vivid in many social and cultural fields - including scientific and academic ones, functioning sometimes as a powerfully rooted belief.\n      </p>", "This paper first explores colonialist traditions in Mediterranean archaeology: it exposes the relationships between representations of ancient colonial situations in the Mediterranean and the recent context of modern (neo-)imperialism in which Classical Archaeology was formed as a discipline and in which many archaeologists have been working. It is argued that dualist representations of colonialism must be abandoned. As an alternative, the postcolonial concept of hybridity is introduced as a useful starting point for examining the more mundane and less polarized dimensions of colonial situations. Such an alternative postcolonial interpretation of Carthaginian colonialism in west central Sardinia during the fifth to third centuries BC is expounded in the second part of the paper.\n      </p>", "The past decade has seen many calls for the development of unified 'world historical archaeologies' of the past 500 years. While the field benefits from growing international exchanges and collaborations, retaining the diversity of regional traditions is a major and emerging challenge. As the field increasingly tests the temporal, geographical and interdisciplinary limits of archaeological perspectives, engaging with the diversity of modern material, these complexities remain little discussed, and the situations and contingencies of disciplinary narratives, priorities and interactions remain unproblematized. Exploring these matters, this paper considers transatlantic interactions between British and North American traditions of historical archaeology over the past two decades, journeying between two garden landscapes - in Annapolis and Bristol. After considering Mark Leone's 1984 study of the William Paca garden in Annapolis, Maryland, and its subsequent reinterpretations, the paper discusses an eighteenth-century 'eclectic' garden at Goldney in Bristol. The paper argues that situational and 'symmetrical', rather than interpretative, approaches to archaeological material would aid the development of multi-vocal and inclusive 'world historical archaeologies', acknowledging and celebrating the archaeological complexities that are encountered in the past and the disciplinary present.\n      </p>", "The relationship between nautical archaeology and biblical archaeology has been apparent since the first ancient shipwreck was excavated in its entirety off Cape Gelidonya, Turkey, in 1970. Artifacts from shipwrecks can help validate or refute findings of archaeologists on land.\n      </p>", "Ecologists have increasingly turned to history, including human history, to explain and manage modern ecosystems and landscapes. The imprint of past land use can persist even in seemingly pristine areas. Archaeology provides a long-term perspective on human actions and their environmental consequences that can contribute to conservation and restoration efforts. Case studies illustrate examples of the human history of seemingly pristine landscapes, forest loss and recovery, and the creation or maintenance of places that today are valued habitats. Finally, as archaeologists become more involved in research directed at contemporary environmental issues, they need to consider the potential uses and abuses of their findings in management and policy debates.\n      </p>", "Having begun graduate work in anthropology and prehistoric archaeology at a time (early 1950s) and place (University of Chicago) where the two were closely linked, I subsequently participated in work devoted to early agricultural economies in Western Asia and Eastern North America; to the relations among archaeology, history, and science; and to the place of anthropological archaeology in the contemporary world. In this article I discuss my personal experiences within each of these areas of endeavor.\n      </p>", "The past, as constructed by the modern power of colonialism and nationalism, has essentialized the ideals of nation-state through the process of homogenizing the polysemous identities of non-Western societies and religions. The power of this imagined past is particularly manifested in the institutionalization of the disciplines of archaeology and history, and has acted to fix communitarian boundaries within the conditions and structures of inequality. The analysis of the part played by archaeological narratives in this process of fixation within the domain of nation-state has not even been initiated in the context of Bangladesh. This paper examines the conditions and processes in and by which the secularized notion of religion and representations of the past have been persuaded and coerced to invoke the 'pure' ideals of nation while simultaneously subordinating other notions of collective identity.\n      </p>", "A questionnaire asked students enrolled in second and third year archaeology subjects at the University of Sydney for their opinions about the wider public benefits of archaeology. Most answers emphasised benefits arising from archaeological knowledge rather than those associated with experiences of archaeology. Possible reasons for this trend and some wider implications are discussed.\n      </p>", "Archaeology has begun to contribute to the history of spirituality in the Eastern Woodlands of North America to complement the perspectives offered by the comparative study of religions and by ethnological, folkloric, art historical, and astronomical research. Support can be found in the forms and types of ritual paraphernalia and in the associated iconography for the thesis that shamanism was a basic form of religious experience that extended back to the earliest material traces. Elaborations upon this foundation became most conspicuous during the Mississippian Period when social hierarchies developed upon an expanded, agriculturally supported population. Animal imagery changed, ancestor cults became elaborated, and cosmography took on increased importance in architecture, site layout, and mortuary rites. The canonical forms of the iconography of this period have become known as the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex. Since European contact, practices and beliefs associated with social hierarchies have disappeared or transformed.\n      </p>", "There is room in public archaeology for \"true acts of inclusion\" that achieve the creative involvement of diverse audiences in projects. Many historical archaeologists are concerned with social responsibility, representation, and the need to reconcile the \"Here\" of archaeology with the \"Out There\" of public education. The practice of African-American archaeology and dissemination of information about this increasingly important aspect of historical archaeology reveal achievements and unfulfilled potentials of public education in archaeology.\n      </p>", "This paper explores how the municipal archaeology programs found in Alexandria, Virginia; St. Augustine, Florida; and Phoenix, Arizona have played a prominent role in developing unique, place-based amenities that integrate local history with other community needs. These cities are unusual in that they maintain archaeologists on city staff and that those archaeologists have used their positions to develop local environments that are extremely supportive of public engagement with history. Using interviews as well as archival and documentary sources, this paper demonstrates how the public's resulting familiarity with archaeology has allowed the interpretation of local history to take a variety of unexpected forms, including public and private open spaces, urban walking and cycling trails, museums, and public art, among many others.\n      </p>", "It is important to be clear as to whether a theory such as evolutionary archaeology pertains to biological evolution, in which acquired change is obliterated at the end of each generation, or cultural change, in which acquired change is retained. In evolutionary archaeology, (1) the population is said to consist of artifacts, yet (2) artifacts are said to be phenotypic. Neither (1) nor (2) is necessarily problematic in and of itself, but the two are inconsistent, as the first pertains to cultural change whereas the second to the biological evolution of humans. A first step to avoiding this problem is to recognize that there is a need for a theory of change specific to human culture. Referring to ongoing work using a related approach to cultural change, it is suggested that the inconsistencies in evolutionary archaeology, though problematic, are not insurmountable.\n      </p>", "Interpretations derived from the study of texts have often determined how material remains have been explained in the historical archaeology of ancient China. Thus, the history of China has been less informed by archaeological knowledge than one would wish. In the case of social transitions in the Ji'nan region in the first millennium B.C., I show how changes in settlement patterns and in mortuary practices enrich our understanding of how the increasingly centralized state impacted the local Ji'nan society. /// Les interpr\u00e9tations provenant de l'\u00e9tude des textes ont souvent d\u00e9termin\u00e9 la mani\u00e8re dont les vestiges mat\u00e9riels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 int\u00e9gr\u00e9s dans l'arch\u00e9ologie historique de la Chine Ancienne.

It is argued that the palace was built circa 1500 as an Islamic palace within which North African political cultural innovations were introduced and given material force. The most important of these were seclusion, massive concubinage, a state council and treasury, and the use of male slaves (including eunuchs) as important state functionaries. These innovations established a new and gendered spatial dynamic of state formation that registered clearly in palace design. Most notably, gender constructions were mediated through spatial oppositions which emphasized the importance of paternity and royal motherhood in increasing the authority of the king. Accordingly \"male\" \"state\" affairs were sited in or near public domains while female \"state-household\" activities were located in the secluded palace interior or \"stomach.\" Only religious scholars or eunuchs could enter the interior, men who offered little reproductive threat to the king, while concubinage allowed for the king to expand and centralize territorial alliances with conquered peoples along agnatic descent lines. Seclusion required the \"outside\" services of nonconcubine slave women through whom royal women's powers extended beyond the palace. I suggest that such powers included administering grain tax collection as part of their massive food-production duties. Seclusion also seems to have provided concubines with a space in which to continue pre-Islamic religious practices. It is hypothesized that development of heteropatriarchal spatial divisions of state and statehousehold labor were tied to gendered struggles over commercial surpluses resulting partly from the Islamization of West Africa and the attendant rise of long-distance trade. This conclusion suggests that Islamic forms of seclusion developed partly and co-evally with the rise of mercantilism in the region.\n      </p>", "Historical archaeology has expanded greatly in the past decade. This essay discusses some of the trends and themes that have become important in historical archaeology in the United States since 1982. The first section briefly assesses the field. The second discusses capitalism as one theme that may serve to unify research. Cross-cultural research, integrative analyses, and the concepts of power and ideology are central to this theme. The third section is a brief case study concerning the historic Cherokee. The conclusion comments on the institutional state of historical archaeology.\n      </p>", "Archaeological research on Overseas Chinese communities has expanded rapidly during the last twenty years, yet the subfield still remains marginal within historical archaeology as a whole. This article argues that a dominance of acculturation theories and methodologies has contributed to this marginal position. Further, a persistent research focus on the ethnic boundary between Chinese and non-Chinese and the portrayal of Overseas Chinese communities as resolutely traditional have curtailed the range of research topics investigated at Overseas Chinese sites. Community-focused collaborative research on the Market Street Chinatown in San Jos\u00e9, California, provides an alternative perspective. Historical and archaeological evidence suggests that the community's residents did not always experience their lives through oppositions between East and West or between tradition and modernity. By embracing a broader research agenda, investigations of Overseas Chinese communities can make significant contributions to archaeological studies of race, ethnicity, gender, immigration, labor and social inequality.\n      </p>", "In this article, I explore the characteristics of global-change archaeology as an emerging field of research. Global-change archaeology seeks to document and apply historical knowledge of past human-environmental interactions to the understanding of contemporary environmental problems and management and planning for future sustainability. It takes place within an interdisciplinary research structure and is situated within the explanatory contexts of historical science and humanistic history with close links to historical and political ecology. Both history and agency play important roles in the practice of global-change archaeology. Past human decision making in the context of cultural attitudes and perceptions also has a significant role in the archaeology of global change.\n      </p>", "This review explores recent research that moves away from conventional preoccupations with origins and independent innovation in African Iron Age archaeology. Critiques of cultural evolutionary formulations and empirically robust case studies combine to shape new concerns with the following: the variable expressions of complexity in time and space; the mosaic quality of social, political economic, and technological landscapes; and the effects of global entanglements over the last millennium. Ongoing research in western and eastern Africa highlights the dynamism of political economic arrangements over the last two millennia and reminds us that configurations enshrined in twentieth-century ethnography represent but a moment in the dynamic history of African societies.\n      </p>", "Pragmatism's anti-essentialist emphasis on contingency and plurality and its notion of truth-as-created (not discovered) have important implications for the interpretation of archaeological data, and for the 'public presentation' of archaeological research. This paper will examine a pragmatically oriented project in Brazoria, Texas, USA, in which archaeologists and local citizens (including site descendants) have collaborated to create an Internet website to discuss the politically and emotionally charged archaeologies and histories of an eighteenth-century sugar plantation. It will discuss ways in which a pragmatic philosophical framework has given archaeologists new ways of approaching and 'conversing' about their data, and new ways of dealing, openly and non-hierarchically, with the communities most affected by their research. It will also discuss ways in which elements of post-processual archaeological theory - multivocality, interactivity, reflexivity and contextuality - were incorporated within both the content and delivery of the website, and will close with a short discussion about whether these strategies were effective in creating an open, relevant, democratic and multivocal discourse about archaeology.\n      </p>", "Until the post-World War II period most of Canada's professional archaeologists and ethnologists were attached to the Anthropological Division of the National Museum in Ottawa, originally founded in 1910 as a branch of the Geological Survey. As they were federal employees, their scientific work was largely dependent on, and ultimately limited by, what politicians and senior bureaucrats deemed to be in the public interest. This paper considers some implications of this arrangement for one aspect of Anthropological Division activity before World War II\u2014its involvement in arctic archaeology. While government personnel made a number of substantive contributions to what was then a developing field of research and scholarship, archival sources suggest that prevailing political and institutional conditions weighed against the division's continuing participation in northern fieldwork during these years. Instead, its role was effectively limited to encouraging and, on occasion, coordinating the research of American, British, and European archaeologists working on problems pertaining to the prehistory of the Canadian Arctic. /// Jusqu' \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode qui a suivi la Deuxi\u00e8me Guerre mondiale, la plupart des arch\u00e9ologues et ethnologues professionnels du Canada \u00e9taient rattach\u00e9s au service d'anthropologie du Mus\u00e9e national du Canada \u00e0 Ottawa, fond\u00e9 \u00e0 l'origine, en 1910, comme une branche de la Commission g\u00e9ologique du Canada.

Through research, exhibitions, and other activities that stress our common demominators and achievements, museums help us to forge and affirm local, ethnic, national, and international identities, unity, and pride. To accomplish such diverse goals, museums require dynamic, dedicated, ethical, and fairly well-educated staff. Museums must also be well-funded and should have local, national, and international support systems. This paper discusses the challenges faced by museum professionals in Africa, especially archaeologists, as they attempt to unearth, and in some cases reinterpret, Africa's cultural history.\n      </p>", "Southeast Asia's earliest states emerged during the first millennium A.D. from the Irawaddy River of Myanmar to the Red River delta of northern Vietnam. Developments during this time laid the groundwork for the florescence of the region's later and better-known civilizations such as Angkor and Pagan. Yet disciplinary and language barriers have thus far precluded an anthropological synthesis of cultural developments during this time. This review uses a landscape focus to synthesize current knowledge of mainland Southeast Asia's earliest states, which emerged in the first millennium A.D. Research from archaeology and history illuminates articulations between physical and social factors in several kinds of Early Southeast Asian landscapes: economic, urban, and political. Social and ideological forces that shaped these first-millennium-A.D. landscapes are discussed as integral aspects of early state formation.\n      </p>", "Nationalism requires the elaboration of a real or invented remote past. This review considers how archaeological data are manipulated for nationalist purposes, and it discusses the development of archaeology during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and the relationship of archaeology to nation-building, particularly in Europe. Contrastive conceptions of nationality and ethnicity are presented, and it is argued that adoption of modern constructivist perspectives is incompatible with attempting to identify ethnic/national groups solely on the basis of archaeological evidence. The political uses of archaeology are also reviewed for the construction of national identities in immigrant and postcolonial states. The problematic nature of nationalistic interpretations of the archaeological record is discussed, and the essay concludes with a consideration of the professional and ethical responsibilities of archaeologists confronted with such interpretations.\n      </p>", "Archaeological conservation has received little support or recognition from some archaeologists in the United States. This paper examines the relationship between archaeology and conservation by looking at the historical development of both fields in Great Britain and the United States. British prehistoric archaeology and American classical archaeology have generally supported conservation, while American anthropological archaeology has had little contact with or interest in the conservation field. Understanding the history and theoretical perspective of each of these fields of archaeology could help in developing better professional interaction between archaeology and conservation.\n
