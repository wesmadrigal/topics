In recent years, the landscape of research synthesis methods has changed rapidly to become inclusive. This article highlights methodologically inclusive advancements in research synthesis methods. Attention is drawn to insights from interpretive, critical and participatory traditions for enhancing trustworthiness, utility, and/or emancipatory potential for research syntheses. Also noted is a paucity of the literature that builds connections between methodologically diverse segments of the literature on research synthesis methods. Salient features of a methodologically inclusive research synthesis (MIRS) framework are described. The MIRS framework has been conceptualized by distilling and synthesizing ideas, theories, and strategies from the extensive literatures on research synthesis methods and primary research methods. Rather than prescribe how a research synthesis should be conducted or evaluated, this article attempts to open spaces, raise questions, explore possibilities, and contest taken-for-granted practices.\n      </p>", "Historically, information systems (IS) researchers have questioned which research paradigms, activities, and methods IS research should follow. In this paper, we argue that different research methods and activities may interact with each other, different research paradigms may complement each other due to such interactions, and therefore, a multimethodological, cross-paradigm research approach may result in better IS research than a singular approach. Three existing multimethodological IS research frameworks are reviewed and summarized into an integrated approach. Two types of interactions between different research methods across system evaluation and theory testing research activities are identified. A three-year research study about a computer-based training system for deception detection (Agent99 Trainer) provides a concrete example to demonstrate the existence and research benefits of these two types of interactions, as well as the benefits of a multimethodological, cross-paradigm IS research approach.\n      </p>", "This report highlights several research areas in operations research likely to produce significant results over the next decade. It is the result of a workshop held between May 31 and June 2, 1987, and sponsored by the Systems Theory and Operations Research (STOR) Program of the Electrical, Communications, and Systems Engineering Division of the National Science Foundation; 24 operations research professionals participated, representing 15 U.S. universities, 1 foreign university, and 3 U.S. companies. After summarizing some significant OR accomplishments, the report sketches some important opportunities in the fields of optimization, stochastic processes, the operations research/artificial intelligence interface, operational and modeling science, and manufacturing and logistics.\n      </p>", "In dialogical action research, the scientific researcher does not \"speak science\" or otherwise attempt to teach scientific theory to the real-world practitioner, but instead attempts to speak the language of the practitioner and accepts him as the expert on his organization and its problems. Recognizing the difficulty that a practitioner and a scientific researcher can have in communicating across the world of science and the world of practice, dialogical action research offers, as its centerpiece, reflective one-on-one dialogues between the practitioner and the scientific researcher, taking place periodically in a setting removed from the practitioner's organization. The dialogue itself serves as the interface between the world of science, marked by theoria and the scientific attitude, and the world of the practitioner, marked by praxis and the natural attitude of everyday life. The dialogue attempts to address knowledge heterogeneity, which refers to the different forms that knowledge takes in the world of science and the world of practice, and knowledge contextuality, which refers to the dependence of the meaning of knowledge, such as a scientific theory or professional expertise, on its context. In successive dialogues, the scientific researcher and the practitioner build a mutual understanding, including an understanding of the organization and its problems. The scientific researcher, based on one or more of the scientific theories in her discipline, formulates and suggests one or more actions for the practitioner to take in order to solve or remedy a problem in his organization. Dialogical action research recognizes that the practitioner's experience, expertise, and tacit knowledge, or praxis, largely shapes how he understands the suggested actions and appropriates them as his own. Upon returning to his organization, he takes one or more of the suggested actions, depending on his reading of the situation at hand. The reactions or responses of the problem to the actions or stimuli of the practitioner would embody, in the practitioner's eyes, success or failure in solving or remedying the problem and, in the scientific researcher's eyes, evidence confirming or disconfirming the theory on which the action was based. The scientific researcher may then suggest, based on her theories, additional actions, hence initiating another cycle of action and learning. To illustrate dialogical action research, this paper reconstructs some dialogues between an information systems researcher and a managing director at a European company called Omega Corporation.\n      </p>", "We advocate a full-cycle approach to conducting organizational behavior research. Full-cycle research begins with the observation of naturally occurring phenomena and proceeds by traveling back and forth between observation and manipulation-based research settings, establishing the power, generality, and conceptual underpinnings of the phenomenon along the way. Compared with more traditional approaches, full-cycle research offers several advantages, such as specifying theoretical models, considering actual and ideal conditions, and promoting interdisciplinary integration. To illustrate these advantages, we provide examples of an implicit approach to conducting full-cycle research and present suggestions for fostering more explicit full-cycle research programs in the future. We encourage individual researchers to adopt this approach rather than to assume the field will naturally avoid the inevitable vulnerabilities that emerge from relying on particular methodological approaches. We conclude by discussing the relevant constraints and opportunities for engaging in full-cycle organizational research.\n      </p>", "Since 1949, when the People's Republic of China was founded, a great deal of researches on the exploitation of shoaly land, which is considered as an important kind of land reserves in China, have been done in China. With reference to the published papers and some conference presentations, almost 52 years' history of shoaly land research in China will be elaborated in the paper. Firstly, an outline of the distribution and exploitation situation on shoaly land is presented. Secondly, based on the analysis of the research progress we have achieved in the past, a systematic research framework in the future for shoaly land is developed from multi-disciplinary point of view. In our opinion, the study of shoaly land in China can be divided into two stages with the separation point of the late 1980's. The earlier period centered on the general investigation of the basic conditions of shoaly land. The latter is a period with many multi-disciplinary researches, during which there has been specialization on theoretical research and technological break-throughs, initiating the public participation in the management of shoaly land development. As to the further research, we propose a two-level research framework on shoaly land in China, namely, basic research and applied research. Basic research includes the research on basic conception, dynamic evolution, and developing theories. Applied research is divided into three categories, social research, economic research, and ecological research. Finally, some priorities of the researches are pointed out which should be given special attention, such as statistical caliber, dynamic monitoring, legislation, administration system, public participation, industrial development policy, resource grading and evaluation, and environmental impact assessment.\n      </p>", "In this paper, the use of systems development as a methodology in information systems (IS) research is described and defended. A framework to explain the nature of systems development as a research methodology in IS research is proposed. Use of this methodology in the engineering field in general is compared with its use specifically in computer science and computer engineering. An integrated program for conducting IS research that incorporates theory building, systems development, experimentation, and observation is proposed. Progress in several application domains is reviewed to provide a basis upon which to argue that systems development is a valid research methodology. A systems development research process is presented from a methodological perspective. Software engineering, which is the basic method of applying the systems development research methodology, is then discussed. It is the authors' belief that systems development and other research methodologies are complementary and that an integrated multi-dimensional and multimethodological approach will generate fruitful IS research results. The premise is that research contributions can result from systems development, experimentation, observation, and performance testing of the systems under development and that all of these research approaches are needed to investigate different aspects of the research question.\n      </p>", "\"Critical Design Ethnography: Designing for Change\" is reviewed in terms of action research under five dimensions: knowledge in practice, participation and democracy, many ways of knowing, emergence, and worthwhile purposes.

It proposes and discusses a model of educational research, showing how reviews relate to small or large-scale primary studies.\n      </p>", "Laws concerning government accountability mandate that agencies weigh constituent interests in setting priorities. This study extends literature on the value of research by considering the public's stated preferences for scientist-effort allocated across an Agricultural Experiment Station's research portfolio. Over 75% of respondents expressed a willingness-to-pay exceeding $20 per household for allocations of at least 139 scientist-months. The mean household is willing to pay about $25 for a 25% increase in effort. Marginal analysis identifies topic areas where an additional scientist-month provides above- or below-average benefits. The distribution of effort across research topics significantly affects respondents' values.\n      </p>", "The authors provide brief information about the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Veterans Health Administration, to establish an understanding of this large, multifaceted organization. They then offer an overview of the VA's Office of Research and Development, with particular emphasis on recent and ongoing efforts to enhance protection of the rights of human participants in clinical research. The authors discuss various policies and regulations intended to protect human participants in any type of VA research. The protection of human research participants must be a major concern for all researchers. Patients should be well informed about the scope of the research and what their participation entails, and there should be no question as to the voluntariness of their consent. Making sure that these standards are met for each and every veteran who participates in VA research is of the utmost importance.\n      </p>", "Survey research is believed to be well understood and applied by management information systems (MIS) scholars. It has been applied for several years and it has precise procedures which, when followed closely, yield valid and easily interpretable data. Our assessment of the use of survey research in the MIS field between 1980 and 1990 indicates that this perception is at odds with reality. Our analysis indicates that survey methodology is often misapplied and is plagued by five important weaknesses: (1) single-method designs where multiple methods are needed, (2) unsystematic and often inadequate sampling procedures, (3) low response rates, (4) weak linkages between units of analysis and respondents, and (5) overreliance on cross-sectional surveys where longitudinal surveys are really needed. Our assessment also shows that the quality of survey research varies considerably among studies of different purposes: explanatory studies are of good quality overall, exploratory and descriptive studies are of moderate to poor quality. This article presents a general framework for classifying and examining survey research and uses this framework to analyze the usage of survey research conducted in the past decade in the MIS field. In an effort to improve the quality of survey research, this article makes specific recommendations that directly address the major problems highlighted in the review.\n      </p>", "\"Basic research\" is often used in science policy. It is commonly thought to refer to research that is directed solely toward acquiring new knowledge rather than any more practical objective. Recently, there has been considerable concern about the future of basic research because of purported changes in the nature of knowledge production and increasing pressures on scientists to demonstrate the social and economic benefits of their work. But is there really something special about basic research? The author argues here that \"basic research\" is a flexible and ambiguous concept that is drawn on by scientists to acquire prestige and resources. She shows that it is used for boundary work and gives examples of the work it does in different situations by drawing on interviews with scientists and policy makers on the category of basic research and the changes they have seen in it over time.\n      </p>", "Faculty members in the natural-mathematical sciences (N = 93) and in the social-behavioral sciences (N = 90) were rated on \"research involvement\" by department heads and on \"teaching outcomes\" by students. Differences in teaching outcomes for members of the two disciplines confirmed several common stereotypes. Those heavily involved in research appeared to establish higher academic standards for students than did the relatively uninvolved, but the two faculty groups generally did not differ on student progress ratings. However, for four of ten criterion measures, a significant interaction occurred. Student ratings were positively related to the degree of research involvement for faculty members in natural-mathematical sciences but negatively related to research involvement on the part of social-behavioral scientists.\n      </p>", "An aggregated trading model is developed for assessing the size and distribution of benefits from research that reduces dark-cutting (DC) beef in Australia. The Australian beef industry has the potential to obtain gross research benefits in the range A$105-133 million per year from a 50% (or 4 percentage point) reduction in the incidence of beef with DC syndrome. The bulk of these benefits accrues to beef producers. The calculated level of benefits gives a guide to the maximum sum that could rationally be spent to obtain the required reduction in DC.\n      </p>", "The purpose of this study is to extend the literature on grounded theory development to incorporate considerations for team-based, interdisciplinary longitudinal research projects in the domain of organizational studies. Every element of the research process is affected if the research questions call for team-based data collection and interpretation over a lengthy period of time. It is unusual for a team of scholars from different disciplines to work together, not because the need doesn't exist, but because the mechanisms for doing so are not well established. We draw from the writings of scholars in the fields of research methodology, team and work-group design, and project management to inform our thinking on the subject. The work presented here is based on the authors' experiences during 1995-1999 as members of the Radical Innovation Research Program (RIRP). The RIRP is an ongoing multidisciplinary study of the development and management of radical innovations in established firms. Here, we do not describe the findings or insights associated with the content of the study, radical innovation, which is surely a complex managerial phenomenon. Rather, we focus on the processes used to conduct the research that were affected by the need for a multidisciplinary research team. A framework is presented for thinking about managing such a project. Challenges that we encountered within this framework are identified. Mechanisms we used (or, in some cases, wish we had used in retrospect) for confronting those challenges are also described. Throughout, we compare our study objectives and resultant methodological design choices with those of other multidisciplinary research teams that are by now well known in the organizational management literature. Our objective is to help researchers who are considering launching interdisciplinary, longitudinal studies of organizational processes as they plan and manage those pursuits.\n      </p>", "This paper reveals the author's theory of method for conducting longitudinal field research on change. The paper also discusses a range of practical problems in carrying out time-series research in organisational settings. The practical problems include dealing with time in longitudinal research; issues of site selection; choices about data collection and degrees of involvement; the importance of clarifying research outputs, audience, and presentation; and finally handling problems of complexity and simplicity associated with longitudinal comparative case study research on change. The paper concludes by discussing some ethical issues of longitudinal research field research, and managing a community of researchers.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "This study explored university students' views of whether they will need research skills in their future work in relation to their approaches to learning, situational orientations on a learning situation of quantitative methods, and difficulties experienced in quantitative research courses. Education and psychology students in both Finland (N = 46) and the USA (N = 122), who thought that they would need research skills in their future work, differed significantly from the students who were not sure whether they would need these skills. The students, who considered research skills important for their future work, were more task-oriented, used a deeper approach to learning and experienced fewer difficulties in the learning of research skills than other students. This finding implies that experiences in learning, learning approaches and situational orientations are related to expectations about future work. For instruction, this means that if we were somehow able to change students' experiences and orientations towards research into a more positive direction, students might be better prepared for their future work.\n      </p>", "STUDENT RESEARCHERS USED ACTION research both to study the relationship between university researchers and the ethics committee, and also to explore the ethics committee's approach to protocols involving action research and other qualitative methods. We review the existing literature on relationships between university faculty and their ethics committees and briefly discuss the basic tenets of action research. We then describe our research process and the specific recommendations that resulted from this work. Finally, we consider the ways in which action research can be used to better understand and address institutional problems through effective collaboration and dialogue.\n      </p>", "This study evaluates the current state of electronic commerce (EC) research by focusing on its diversity. The authors examined 846 EC articles published in six EC specialty journals, 196 in four major IS journals, and 61 in four major marketing journals over the 10 years from 1996 to 2005. The EC specialty and major IS journals show a trend toward multidisciplinary authorship. All three groups of journals display an increasing level of interest in consumer-related issues. The IS and marketing journals prefer mathematical modeling, while the EC specialty journals favor conceptual research. Most important, the major and EC specialty journals play different roles in EC research. EC articles published in the major journals, by and large, display not only more diversified research methods but a growing trend toward economics as a common paradigm. EC specialty journals exhibit great diversity in researchers' backgrounds and units of analysis, expanding and redefining the domain of EC research. The findings summarized in this paper are a roadmap toward better understanding of the dynamics of EC research and for authors seeking to identify the best journal for their EC research.\n      </p>", "The Science Summit reinforced a question upon which many of us in science education are focused: How can we, the science education community of researchers, practitioners, and consumers, lead policy? We include a brief review of the No Child Left Behind Act and its implications for teachers, and elaborate about one ongoing and growing effort to answer the concerns about the paucity of research expressed at the Summit. We describe a unique and growing collaboration across professional science education and science organizations and societies that focuses on the development of a research agenda. The term 'consilience' refers to the \"jumping together of knowledge\" that leads to scientific advancements, progressive, creative, fluid scientific research and intellectual capacity to move a research community toward an enlightened research agenda. A coherent research agenda enables us to specify what we know, what we need to know, and how research can be employed for creating and implementing policy. The use of a dynamic organizer (such as Pasteur's Quadrant) for a research matrix of topics provides a possible structure for organizing and cataloging research questions, designs, findings from past studies, needed areas for research, and policy implications. Through this unique collaboration, the science education community can better focus on needs and priorities and ensure that teachers, policy makers, scientists, and researchers in education at local through national levels have an important stake in research priorities and actions.\n      </p>", "In this paper, a framework is provided which can be used to examine the welfare effects of research and promotion in a market disaggregated into two sectors. Diagrammatic and algebraic approaches are used to investigate the consequences of shifts in supply or demand, induced by research and promotion, for the welfare of producers and consumers in both sectors. The model is used to examine two policy issues: the efficiency of allocation of resources to supply-shifting and demand-shifting activities for traded commodities and the effects of levies on producers or consumers to fund supply-shifting and demand-shifting activities.\n      </p>", "The interactions between ecological research and management decisions about environmental problems are complex. This paper attempts to analyze the different types of research related to environmental decision-making so that their relationships and purposes can become clearer. There are four major types of research, which interact with one another and with management to influence the outcome of decision-making. Category 1 is the available pool of research, the material presented to or used by management agencies when they have defined a problem and need data to use in reaching decisions about what to do to solve it. Ecologists are excessively reactive and responsive to the uses of this research rather than initiating or being proactive in the use of their findings. As a result, managers have always defined the problems and set the agendas for their solution. This causes requests from the research community for information that is chosen by managers. Our responses are therefore often confused and uncertain. Research is not properly used because researchers are not setting the agendas. Many perceived managerial problems could be reframed by better ecological input and a concomitant reduction in the uncertainty associated with inappropriate uses of ecological research. Category 2 is applied and environmental research aimed at specific tests of the results of the decisions made by managers by treating these decisions as testable hypotheses. This is rarely done. It should be a major contribution of ecology to environmental matters. Category 3 is new, basic, and strategic research to develop new theories and understanding when former managerial decisions fail (as revealed by Category 2). Ecologists have not been successful in ensuring that such programs are actively pursued as the mainstay of our ability to provide better research in the future, which will then form the available pool of understanding (as in Category 1) when called on by managerial agencies. We tend to do such research in isolation from the needs of environmental management. We are often compelled into making predictions about ecological processes and outcomes that we do not understand. We need a better understanding by managers about the sorts of research we must do to allow proper predictions. Until then, there must be much more ecological research into the outcomes of managerial decisions, as tests of the predictions and hypotheses made in the formation of the managerial policies. We need novel research programs that arise out of the failures of previous attempts to manage, control, or prevent environmental degradation or to enhance restoration. Category 4 is managerial research designed to investigate the processes of management and the procedures by which decisions are reached using the information provided under Category 1. This is normally not a scientific study and is rarely done in conjunction with ecologists. Yet ecologists should be the people best trained to analyze the procedures used in public management of environmental issues where these relate to decisions based on ecological data. Ecologists should evaluate much more extensively the validity or generality of ecological research in Category 1 for a particular defined problem of environmental management. Otherwise, inappropriate findings, models, and/or opinions become incorporated into a complex mechanism for making decisions. How the results of ecological research are used in decision-making is a crucial area of study that must be investigated by ecologists. This paper attempts to make the strengths and purposes of the research and its limitations more obvious to research scientists, environmental managers, and the public. The ways in which ecologists deal with the management of environmental problems may thereby become increasingly effective.\n      </p>", "Matching production with sales potential is essential for survival in volatile markets. Manufacturing and marketing managers compete for staff, space, cash, and other assets as they struggle both to determine what and how many products ought to be produced, and to actually produce them. We develop an analytical framework to answer one simple question, \"How much marketing research should a firm do when it takes resources away from manufacturing the goods that generate revenue?\" To understand the costs and benefits of marketing research, we account for the lost opportunities to produce these goods. Some analytical findings are striking: firms without initial knowledge of their potential customers should allocate one-third of the firm's resources to marketing research. The model suggests a host of issues to be more deeply studied by management scientists.\n      </p>", "In recent years there has been a growing interest in research approaches that can better inform policy and practice and lead to social action. This article describes four models of action-oriented research: action, participatory, empowerment, and feminist research. The historical roots, epistemological assumptions, agendas, and methodological strategies of each are discussed. Common features and distinguishing characteristics are examined. The article concludes by discussing implications derived from action-oriented research for family researchers and other social scientists interested in making their work more relevant to practice, policy, and social action.\n      </p>", "Case research has commanded respect in the information systems (IS) discipline for at least a decade. Notwithstanding the relevance and potential value of case studies, this methodological approach was once considered to be one of the least systematic. Toward the end of the 1980s, the issue of whether IS case research was rigorously conducted was first raised. Researchers from our field (e.g., Benbasat et al. 1987; Lee 1989) and from other disciplines (e.g., Eisenhardt 1989; Yin 1994) called for more rigor in case research and, through their recommendations, contributed to the advancement of the case study methodology. Considering these contributions, the present study seeks to determine the extent to which the field of IS has advanced in its operational use of case study method. Precisely, it investigates the level of methodological rigor in positivist IS case research conducted over the past decade. To fulfill this objective, we identified and coded 183 case articles from seven major IS journals. Evaluation attributes or criteria considered in the present review focus on three main areas, namely, design issues, data collection, and data analysis. While the level of methodological rigor has experienced modest progress with respect to some specific attributes, the overall assessed rigor is somewhat equivocal and there are still significant areas for improvement. One of the keys is to include better documentation particularly regarding issues related to the data collection and analysis processes.\n      </p>", "The output of agricultural economics research is information, much of it aimed at designing or improving institutions. Bayesian decision theory and economic surplus analysis have been suggested as possible approaches to evaluate that information. This article takes a critical look at the strengths and weaknesses of combining those approaches for empirical evaluation of agricultural economics research. It presents three case studies, utilizing prior and posterior probabilities elicited from key decision makers. Direct application of the probabilities to a simple set of states and actions is best suited to situations involving a single policy-making center, or a consensus decision-making process.\n      </p>", "Concerns about research wrongdoing in biomedical research are growing in developing countries, where research ethics training and research regulatory systems are just emerging. In a first-time study in Africa, medical/dental researchers (N = 132) in two states in Nigeria were interviewed on a wide range of research wrongdoings and potential predictors. Using multivariate logistic regression, significant predictors of research wrongdoing were identified. Some 22.0% admitted to at least one of fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism, the predictors of which were knowledge gaps in research ethics and pressure to publish enough papers for promotion. Acknowledging inadequate knowledge of research ethics was a predictor of admitting a wrongdoing. Systems that support ethical research, including skilled training and funding, are recommended.\n      </p>", "Research wrongdoing undermines scientific integrity, occurs widely, and takes many forms. We interviewed 135 NIH principal investigators who reported witnessing and responding to research wrongdoing. They reported taking a variety of actions, including formal notification of institutional officials, peer shaming, and one-on-one discussions with their peers to address wrongdoing that ranged from improper attribution of authorship to falsification, fabrication, and plagiarism. Unexpectedly, administrative mismanagement in handling allegations appeared more prevalent than any of the other forms of wrongdoing reported. Institutions may lack effective or efficient processes for managing even the most egregious cases of research wrongdoing. To assist institutions in designing effective, nimble programs, we suggest resources from which institutional officials may draw.\n      </p>", "This paper aims to assist those who do qualitative research in the field of marriage and family to reduce the number of rejections received in response to article submissions.

She clarifies issues regarding point of view, authorial surplus, narrative coherence, and the relational qualities of narrative research. She maintains that the relational, the ethical, and the aesthetic are not mutually exclusive.

The authors discuss the design's theoretical, methodological, and pragmatic aspects. They focus on the development of theory and the generation and refinement of artifacts as mutually constitutive in design research. Special attention is paid to making explicit the causal chain of arguments that link theory development, empirical tests of that theory, and product development. They make the case that effective interventions and rigorous theory can be codeveloped in the design paradigm.\n      </p>", "Through historical analysis of the interaction between societal issues, end-user needs and research advances this paper intends to reveal the differences in perception about the usefulness and effectiveness of coastal research that appear to develop during subsequent research programme stages between different stakeholders. These perception differences are the probable reason for the limited scales of lifetime of research programmes. Our historical analysis indicates that both the assessment of the initial contents and the process of research programmes nearly by default lead to a growing divergence between drivers and users of knowledge and developers of knowledge. Making use of these findings a methodology is suggested to avoid or at least postpone this divergence. This might lead to more useful and more effective research programmes with a longer lifetime to the benefit of society, end-users and researchers. /// Historische analyse van de interactie tussen de maatschappelijke problemen, de informatiebehoefte van eindgebruikers van wetenschappelijke kennis en wetenschappelijke ontwikkelingen, legt een verschil in percepties van verschillende belanghebbenden bloot met betrekking tot be bruikbaarheid en de effectiviteit van kust onderzoek. De verschillen nemen toe naarmate de onderzoeksprogramma's langer lopen en zijn waarschijnlijk de reden voor de beperkte levensduur van onderzoeksprogramma's. Onze historische analyse laat zien dat zowel inhoudelijke als procesmatige aspecten bijna onontkoombaar leiden tot groeiende kloof tussen opdrachtgevers en gebruikers van onderzoek en onderzoekers. Op basis van deze bevindingen wordt een methodiek gesuggereerd om het ontstaan van dergelijke perceptieverschillen te voorkomen of tenminste uit te stellen. Dit zou kunnen leiden tot bruikbaardere en effectievere onderzoeksprogramma's met een langere levensduur ten bate van de maatschappij, eind gebruikers en onderzoekers.\n      </p>", "Biomedical ethics require that research subjects be aware that the drugs they take or procedures they undergo are designed to fulfill the conditions of the experiment and not to benefit a subject's health. This apparently straightforward distinction between research and treatment is a source of much controversy and misunderstanding. Ethicists have labeled this problem the \"therapeutic misconception.\" This misconception and, more broadly, informed consent have been studied extensively. Nonetheless, the therapeutic misconception persists among research subjects. This paper argues that one factor overlooked in the persistence of the therapeutic misconception is the effect of the theoretical paradigm that guides the practice and analysis of informed consent. The paradigm poses an idealized model of communication that ignores social context. This paper examines informed consent practices associated with a cancer research trial to demonstrate an alternative approach to studying informed consent to research. Through analysis of informed consent session transcripts, it demonstrates the importance of taking account of not only what is said, but how and by whom it is said.\n      </p>", "It is necessary periodically to identify research priorities so that future research will be directed toward the most pertinent issues in waterfowl ecology and management. To that end, Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center convened a quorum of experts on the ecology of breeding waterfowl, the Waterfowl Working Group, to 1) develop a mission statement, 2) identify waterfowl research priorities in the northern Great Plains, and 3) determine the frequency for re-identifying research needs. Research needs (nonprioritized) identified by the group and described in detail herein included: 1) determine effects of landscape factors on demographics and recruitment of ducks in the Prairie Pothole Region; 2) develop, improve, or update estimates of important parameters used in existing models for management and planning; 3) evaluate waterfowl management activities at broad, regional scales; 4) direct studies at waterfowl species of concern; and 5) evaluate applicability of the bird-conservation-area concept to waterfowl. The Waterfowl Working Group will reconsider research priorities at 2-year intervals.\n      </p>", "Children have been poorly represented in clinical studies and health services research. However, this situation is changing rapidly, and the number of research studies focusing on child outcomes is steadily increasing. The special characteristics of childhood related to health care- developmental change, dependency on adults, different disease epidemiology from adults, and unique demographic characteristics-pose methodologic challenges to researchers. These characteristics also argue for an expanded concept of outcomes research that is centered on a child-specific model of the production of health, its determinants, and its relationship to healthcare services. This article proposes priorities for future inquiry, including developing new measures specific to children; examining the influence of medical, public health, and other community interventions on children's long-term health trajectories; increasing attention to risk behaviors and resiliency factors that influence children's future health status; reconsidering the value of routine child healthcare and pediatric specialty care; examining the financing and organization of children's health care; exploring the importance of family influences on child and adolescent health; and addressing optimal treatment strategies for managing common childhood health problems.\n      </p>", "Throughout its history, the information systems (IS) discipline has engaged in extensive self-examination, particularly with regard to its apparent diversity. Our overall objective in this study is to better understand the diversity in IS research, and the extent to which diversity is universal across journals that publish IS research. We developed a classification system that comprises five key characteristics of diversity (reference discipline, level of analysis, topic, research approach, and research method) based on a review of prior literature. We then examined articles over a fiveyear period, from 1995 to 1999, in five journals acknowledged as the top journals of the field, at least in North America. Analyses reveal considerable diversity in each of the key characteristics. Perhaps not surprisingly, the research approach used is more focused with most studies being conducted using hypothetico-deductive approaches, whereas reference discipline is perhaps the most diverse of the characteristics examined. An interesting finding is that IS itself emerged as a key reference discipline in the late 1990s. The Journal of Management Information Systems and Information Systems Research publish articles displaying the greatest diversity, and MIS Quarterly and Decision Sciences publish articles that focus on subsets of the field. Our research provides a foundation for addressing the direction that diversity in the IS discipline takes over time. In the shorter term, researchers can use our classification system as a guide to writing abstracts and selecting key words, and the findings of our journal analyses to determine the best outlet for their type of research.\n      </p>", "An important aspect of graduate education is learning how to evaluate the quality and validity of research. The study of families presents particular challenges, due in part to the multidisciplinary nature of family research. Three methods designed to teach students how to critique family research are examined. All three methods appear to have promise in teaching students how to evaluate family research, and all three methods sensitized students to pertinent issues in the research literature.\n      </p>", "Two paradigms characterize much of the research in the Information Systems discipline: behavioral science and design science. The behavioral-science paradigm seeks to develop and verify theories that explain or predict human or organizational behavior. The design-science paradigm seeks to extend the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative artifacts. Both paradigms are foundational to the IS discipline, positioned as it is at the confluence of people, organizations, and technology. Our objective is to describe the performance of design-science research in Information Systems via a concise conceptual framework and clear guidelines for understanding, executing, and evaluating the research. In the design-science paradigm, knowledge and understanding of a problem domain and its solution are achieved in the building and application of the designed artifact. Three recent exemplars in the research literature are used to demonstrate the application of these guidelines. We conclude with an analysis of the challenges of performing high-quality design-science research in the context of the broader IS community.\n      </p>", "In this article, we demonstrate how establishment-survey questionnaire design can be improved by using different research methods such as focus groups, document-design analysis, pretests, and response-analysis surveys. We discuss the lack of research on establishment-survey methods in the past, compare the tasks of respondents in establishment and household surveys, and highlight the work of the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the designing establishment-survey questionnaires. As part of this discussion, we outline changes made to the questionnaire to reduce potential errors. The results indicate that each research method improves establishment-survey questionnaire design by identifying various types of errors.\n      </p>", "Narrative research has become part of the landscape of education inquiry, yet its theory and practice are still debated and evolving. This article addresses the construction of narratives using literary elements common to nonfiction and fiction writings. The authors discuss these elements and use four narratives to illustrate them. They address how literary elements intersect with more familiar practices of generating and analyzing evidence to reveal themes, and they relate these intersections with wider issues about what can be known from research and how it can be learned.\n      </p>", "Although the majority of research in gender and education has rightly focused on girls, recent research in the United States and elsewhere has focused much more on the learning, social outcomes, and schooling experiences of boys. This \"boy turn \" has produced a large corpus of theoretically oriented and practice-oriented research alongside popular and rhetorical works and feminist and pro-feminist responses, each of which this article reviews. To answer why boys have become such a concern at this time, this article explores the origins and motivations of the boy turn, examines major critiques of the distress about boys, and suggests possible directions for debates and research.\n      </p>", "Over 10 years ago, the issue of whether IS researchers were rigorously validating their quantitative, positivist instruments was raised (Straub 1989). In the years that have passed since that time, the profession has undergone many changes. Novel technologies and management trends have come and gone. New professional societies have been formed and grown in prominence and new demands have been placed on the field's research and teaching obligations. But the issue of rigor in IS research has persisted throughout all such changes. Without solid validation of the instruments that are used to gather data upon which findings and interpretations are based, the very scientific basis of positivist, quantitative research is threatened. As a retrospective on the Straub article, this research seeks to determine if and how the field has advanced in instrument validation. As evidence of the change, we coded positivist, quantitative research articles in five major journals over a recent three year period for use of validation techniques. Findings suggest that the field has advanced in many areas, but, overall, it appears that a majority of published studies are still not sufficiently validating their instruments. Based on these findings, approaches are suggested for reinvigorating the quest for validation in IS research via content/construct validity, reliability, and manipulation validity.\n      </p>", "Research has a central place in the identification and definition of World Heritage Sites, and increasingly in their ongoing management and conservation. Using the example of Stonehenge in central southern England, attention is drawn to the formulation of a research framework as a means of providing a transparent and structured approach to the planning and execution of high quality research. Ultimately, however, research has to be useful and socially relevant in terms of the outputs produced. In the second part of the paper some of the wider issues of knowledge creation are explored and a scheme proposed for the conceptualization of archaeological knowledge or \"scientia\" as four overlapping fields: narrative knowledge, strategic knowledge, indigenous knowledge and contemplative knowledge. It is suggested that World Heritage Sites should not only be exemplary situations for the pursuit of research but also be closely identified with the creation and maintenance of different kinds of knowledge.\n      </p>", "there has been little empirical research into misconduct and misbehavior among community research workers who recruit and collect data in vulnerable and marginalized health populations and are also members of those same communities. We conducted qualitative interviews with community research workers and traditional research assistants to understand the context and consequences of misbehaviors that pose a threat to research ethics and data integrity. In our sample, more community research workers acknowledged engaging in research wrongdoing than did traditional research assistants. These behaviors were most prevalent among community research workers who were not well-integrated into the research team. We suggest best practices for investigators to promote an environment that supports research integrity in research projects that employ community research workers.\n      </p>", "The aim of this paper is to identify the works that have had the greatest impact on strategic management research and to analyze the changes that have taken place in the intellectual structure of this discipline.

Using concepts suggested by Merton and Hagstrom, this study developed measures of \"recognition\" and \"association\" to assess student awareness of ambient research in their departments. \"Usefulness\" of campus research for the respondent's own work was explored in terms of the kinds of utility and its relative importance compared to other resources. A mailed survey of a sample of Ph.D. recipients in 18 departments from a major research university brought a 68% usable return, 470 subjects. Findings show a high level of research awareness, about 70%. The major utilities of research for doctoral students are identified as the theoretical leads and basic data sources.\n      </p>", "The starting point for this paper is the ongoing debate about the relation between research and policy in education. Recent developments in England and Scotland are reviewed in the context of political and academic arguments about the nature and function of research activity. The defensiveness of the research community in the face of professional and political attacks is examined critically. A case study of the Higher Still programme is used to illustrate the complexity of the relationships between evidence, ideology, values and professional practice. It is argued that the research community needs to become more politically sophisticated and to advance a clearer vision of its social function in advanced democratic societies if its potential contribution to educational development is to be realised. The dangers of a retreat to a narrow empirical role are highlighted.\n      </p>", "Objective: Federal, state, and private research agencies and organizations have faced increasing administrative and public demand for performance measurement. Historically, performance measurement predominantly consisted of near-term outputs measured through bibliometrics. The recent focus is on accountability for investment based on long-term outcomes. Developing measurable outcome-based metrics for research programs has been particularly challenging, because of difficulty linking research results to spatially and temporally distant outcomes. Our objective in this review is to build a logic model and associated metrics through which to measure the contribution of environmental health research programs to improvements in human health, the environment, and the economy. Data sources: We used expert input and literature research on research impact assessment. Data extraction: With these sources, we developed a logic model that defines the components and linkages between extramural environmental health research grant programs and the outputs and outcomes related to health and social welfare, environmental quality and sustainability, economics, and quality of life. Data synthesis: The logic model focuses on the environmental health research portfolio of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) Division of Extramural Research and Training. The model delineates pathways for contributions by five types of institutional partners in the research process: NIEHS, other government (federal, state, and local) agencies, grantee institutions, business and industry, and community partners. Conclusions: The model is being applied to specific NIEHS research applications and the broader research community. We briefly discuss two examples and discuss the strengths and limits of outcome-based evaluation of research programs.\n      </p>", "This article outlines how a theory of narrative can be used to deconstruct qualitative research texts. Although research texts are a distinct genre in comparison with works of fiction, the basic components of literary activity are similar. Researchers structure and emphasize data and participants in various ways to tell a logical story. Narrative analysis offers a specific framework and terminology that researchers can use to construct texts. Ultimately, such tools can prepare qualitative researchers to make intentional choices in regard to writing. The authors define the narratological concepts of character, plot, story, and focalization. They discuss how these concepts can be used to teach qualitative research methods.\n      </p>", "Three issues emanating from the Bulterman-Bos article (2008) form the core of this commentary. First, the issue of relevancy is addressed from the standpoint of action research and other forms of practitioner inquiry. From this perspective, the divisions between the cultures of university and school are addressed both ways: Each can potentially be transformed by research emanating from the other. Second, another view of the role of theory in research is offered, one that builds on the inherently political dimensions of educational practices, whether in universities or elsewhere. Finally, global changes in the nature of knowledge production demand that research enhance its capacity to work for social justice.\n      </p>", "Several studies have been conducted that rank the relative importance of Journals Publishing MIS research. Yet the study of business Computing Systems has grown to encompass not only management information Systems, but other business Computing Systems as well (e. g., decision support Systems and business expert Systems). In a recent study, Journals Publishing business Computing System research were ranked using a citation analysis methodology. This article extends that study by taking into account the number of years each journal has been published. This normalized ranking scheme is then compared with the original ranking.\n      </p>", "This study evaluated the effects of South Korea's Brain Korea 21 (BK 21) project, a special research funding program designed to build world-class research university. The effects were measured by examining the frequency of article publications in SCI Journals during the 1995-2005 period. The results of the analysis indicated that the growth of research publications from Korean research universities was increased significantly following the implementation of the BK 21 project in 1999. In addition, during the period under study, four research universities (Yonsei, Korea, Sungkyunkwan, and Hanyang) were newly emerged. However, the growth rate of research publications was not different from that of the US and Japan, and even less than that of China. Thus, although the BK 21 project contributed to the growth of research publications of Korean universities, the project did not lessen the gap between Korea universities and world-class research universities in the US or Japan in number of publications.\n      </p>", "community engagement is increasingly becoming an integral part of research. \u201cCommunity-engaged research\u201d (CEnR) introduces new stakeholders as well as unique challenges to the protection of participants and the integrity of the research process.

It does so by reporting results from a case study of committed undergraduate teachers at a research university. Having agreed that research was the dominant element in the university's academic reward system, sample members were cross-classified along two dimensions: First, their own adaptation to the reward structure, as indicated by their five-year records of involvement in funded research; second, individuals' stated attitudes and beliefs toward the teaching and research roles. Although the 11 active researchers (ARs) within the sample reported somewhat more positive attitudes towards research than did the 18 less-active researchers (LAs), we found considerable overlap across, and variation within, the two subsamples. Particularly noteworthy were the presence of a strong allegiance to the historic teaching mission of public universities among both groups and, among the LAs, an oppositional cadre of politically adept senior faculty who had achieved some success in preserving or expanding the place of undergraduate teaching in the reward systems of their departments and colleges. The paper concludes by considering the case study findings in light of both recent theoretical work on intrinsic motivation and the future of the teaching role.\n      </p>", "Education research is plagued by skeptics who doubt its quality and relevance. Inhabitants of schools of education have been among the sharpest critics, and internal battles rage over method and rigor. Yet often lacking is research that explains causes or examines the interplay at the heart of educational practice and policy. This article argues for a conception of research in education that deliberately presses into what is called here the instructional dynamic. Using a sample of studies that exemplify this quintessentially educational perspective, the authors unpack key features of research that probes inside education. They discuss how such research complements in essential ways the other kinds of scholarship that examine and inform education.\n      </p>", "Recent ethics guidelines and policies are changing the way health research is understood, governed, and practiced among Aboriginal communities in Canada. This provides a unique opportunity to examine the meanings and uses of such guidelines by Aboriginal communities themselves.

The purpose of this study was to answer the following questions: (1) Why are authentic research relationships important? (2) What is authenticity in research? (3) How do we achieve authenticity in research with Aboriginal peoples? This shift to more wholistic methodologies can be used in various contexts in Canada and internationally. This is the first study by an Aboriginal person to examine the perspectives of Aboriginal people, in an Aboriginal context, using Aboriginal methodologies.\n      </p>", "TEACHERS CONDUCT IN-CLASS ACTION research to solve classroom problems. Cases of K\u201312 classroom action research were examined to determine which of them require ethics review. A variety of action research projects were collected and transformed into fictitious examples that could be systematically examined to answer these questions pertinent to whether ethics review is required. The resulting analysis suggested that much classroom action research is a local curriculum development activity, which solves important problems but does not require ethics review for various reasons. If it is human research, as defined in the U.S. Common Rule, and is funded by an agency covered by the Common Rule, or if it is not funded but is human research conducted within an institution that has agreed to review all human research, ethics review is legally required unless the intervention is normal educational practice. However, since some action research may trigger other legal requirements, such as the U.S. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1979 (FERPA), it may be desirable to have some form of school-based review, but typically not human subjects ethics review.\n      </p>", "A small preliminary study of 15 teachers who had participated in education research in England examined the effects of prior experience as research participants on why they participated and how they perceived the methodology and ethics of the research. Nine participants were research novices, while six were research experienced. The latter group were found to be more perceptive and critical of the ethics of the research and focused on the research purposes and adequacy of the methods. The findings are discussed in the context of how a future research agenda might be informed by an understanding of participants' prior research experience. This study has particular relevance to research where participants are likely to have had prior experience or contact as participants (e.g., subject pools, participants in longitudinal studies).\n      </p>", "This paper has arisen from a concern that much recent policy-related research on markets displays misogynistic tendencies. In both the media and academic accounts it would appear as though the blame for social and educational inequalities can now be laid at the door of women - particularly middle-class mothers. Through examining competing perspectives on how we might understand this attribution of blame, this paper argues that their guilt is best explained not through changes in behaviour but through the conjuncture of shifts in education policy and related research. These shifts have turned the attention of research away from the public domain of the state and the organisational and cultural attributes of schools to focus on the private domain of domestic decision-making. But the representations of these public and private domains are underpinned by unexamined gendered and ideological subtexts which have limited our powers of description and explanation. The paper concludes by suggesting strategies through which we might both address the tacit misogyny in research on markets and develop more sophisticated accounts of contemporary changes.\n      </p>", "The NCTM Research Committee developed this article to address a distinctly important activity that links research and practice: writing research-based articles for practitioner journals.

The findings identify popular research topics, the dominant research perspective, and the relationship between MIS research and practice. The popular research topics consist of: IS management, information systems types and characteristics, and development and operation of systems.

It places the main emphasis on the \"research design,\" which is seen as an important tool for the planning, the substantiation and the practical guidance of research procedures. The explicit discussion and improvement of research designs is proposed to be a major contribution also to concept and theory development in Organization Science. The basic content of the paper is an empirical analysis and evaluation of the status quo in design conceptions for organization studies. For this, some 300 empirical studies (in German and English) have been critically reviewed, 74 of them described in detail. The results show many deficiencies in the elaboration of the research designs, especially the ties between design and theory (or research question) are often weak or unclear. But there are also good examples which can be used as starting points for further improvements. The development over time shows shifts toward more reflection/discussion of available alternatives in the methods of data collection and more critical examinations of the data quality. This also leads to increasing applications of multimethod designs. A comparison between German and US studies show differences along the quantitative-qualitative line, which opens chances of mutual learning processes.\n      </p>", "To date, family scientists have not examined the processes and outcomes of research training. In this study, we present a potential way in which the research-practice gap is sustained by our current forms of research education, and we suggest two improvements. First, graduate and undergraduate programs should improve assessment of their research training. Second, experience with research should be integrated into undergraduate family studies programs, preferably in a capstone research experience for all students. Toward these ends, we present a model of curriculum organization and assessment data across 3 years. Assessment indicated that undergraduate students' confidence and skills changed over the course of their education. These results suggest that graduate and undergraduate family studies programs could benefit from defining outcomes and investigating processes of research education for all students.\n      </p>", "We describe the framework, objectives, and operating procedures of a partnership developed to fund priority research on bats and their habitats in the Pacific Northwest (Idaho, Oregon, Washington). The Northwest Bat Cooperative (NWBC) is an alliance of state and federal agencies, private industry, and nongovernmental organizations that allocates resources to promote priorities in monitoring, research, and management of bats and their habitats. Operating procedures of this cooperative ensure that members have adequate input to planning and implementation of priority research projects and that their respective agency's or organization's needs are being addressed. Since its inception in 1999, 16 agencies and organizations have contributed over $142,000 for the first 2 years of research. The NWBC provides a customer-based framework that treats research as an investment and could serve as a model for cooperative research for other species of wildlife.\n      </p>", "Occupational cancer research methods was identified in 1996 as 1 of 21 priority research areas in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA). To implement NORA, teams of experts from various sectors were formed and given the charge to further define research needs and develop strategies to enhance or augment research in each priority area. This article is a product of that process. Focus on occupational cancer research methods is important both because occupational factors play a significant role in a number of cancers, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality, and also because occupational cohorts (because of higher exposure levels) often provide unique opportunities to evaluate health effects of environmental toxicants and understand the carcinogenic process in humans. Despite an explosion of new methods for cancer research in general, these have not been widely applied to occupational cancer research. In this article we identify needs and gaps in occupational cancer research methods in four broad areas: identification of occupational carcinogens, design of epidemiologic studies, risk assessment, and primary and secondary prevention. Progress in occupational cancer will require interdisciplinary research involving epidemiologists, industrial hygienists, toxicologists, and molecular biologists.\n      </p>", "One common suggestion for reducing the gap between research and practice is for academics to conduct more of their research in real organizational settings. However, there is considerable skepticism among academics about the willingness of organizations to open their doors to researchers, and among both academics and practitioners about the potential value of doing so. The present study examines how 141 successful academic research projects in real organizations proceeded from start to finish. Our results suggest that organizations may be more open to academic research than is commonly believed, and that most researchers experience few problems with participating organizations. On the other hand, most of the examined projects were not heavily collaborative, and only half of the researchers maintained organizational contact after the research was completed. Based on our findings, we offer suggestions for researchers wishing to do organizational research as well as for their organizational partners.\n      </p>", "The \"productivity puzzle,\" or gender gap in research productivity, is often thought to be due, in part, to gendered child care responsibilities. The time, energy, and money devoted to child-rearing can reduce the research productivity of scholars, especially women. However, there is little systematic research on this issue. The present study contributes to the literature by exploring the productivity puzzle in light of the influence of eight age sets of children. Data are from the National Research Council's 1995 Survey of Doctoral Recipients. They refer to 11,231 PhDs, in the sciences and engineering, who are employed in academia. Controlling for children, structural factors and personal characteristics of the PhDs, the present study finds that women still publish significantly less than men. Second, productivity is higher for PhDs with children less than 11. Third, productivity is relatively low for women with young children. Fourth, for the social sciences, the area with the highest proportion of women PhDs, gender is unrelated to productivity, but women in the social sciences who have young children have relatively low productivity. The leading predictors of productivity included location in a research university and effort (hours worked). The full model explains 39% of the variance in productivity. Children are not a strong predictor of productivity, but the influence that they do have followed a gendered pattern.\n      </p>", "A plethora of scholarly research has been conducted on social science: on its organizational and communicative patterns, on the historical development of research standards, and on the diversity of local research practices. But this body of work on the sociology of social research does not hang together in ways that it could, and should, if knowledge is to accumulate. Contributors hail from various fields, subfields, theoretical perspectives, and methodological bents, and there is no extant subfield to join, legitimate, and reinforce their mutual interests. Thus, the aim of this review is not only to summarize themes, identify gaps, and suggest fruitful avenues for future research, but also to serve as a unifying force for scholars interested in studying social science from a sociological perspective. The sociology of social research, far from being a trite exercise in navel-gazing, is critical for the future viability of sociology, for the discipline's legitimacy and autonomy, and for improving social research more generally.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "This article reviews past empirical studies on the use of audio podcast (hereby referred to as podcast) in K-12 and higher education settings. Using the constant comparative method, this review is organized into three major research areas or topics: (a) participants' podcast usage profile, (b) effects of podcast on learners' outcomes, and (b) institutional aspects. Findings suggest that the most common use of podcasting is limited to either instructors distributing podcast recordings of lectures or supplementary materials for students to review subject material at their own time and place. A majority of the previous studies were descriptive, and were conducted in higher education and traditional course settings. Students generally enjoy using podcast, and tend to listen to the podcasts at home using desktop computers, rather than on the move (e. g., commuting to school) with a mobile device. Probably the main benefit of podcasting is that it allows students to listen to specific material that they missed or did not understand multiple times. The availability of podcast does not appear to encourage students to skip classes. We also discuss limitations of previous empirical studies, and provide some directions for future research related to the use of podcast in education settings.\n      </p>", "This paper reports on the research training experiences of Australian doctoral students working in or funded by Cooperative Research Centres (CRCs), notes how their levels of satisfaction compare with those of their counterparts in regular university science and technology disciplines and assesses to what extent the CRC program is achieving its hopes with respect to PhD training. Findings are based on data from a survey of all enrolled PhD students in two research-intensive universities in Australia, together with supplementary data from student and supervisor interviews. Findings indicate that in the main, CRC-related PhD students fare well compared with their counterparts in regular university departments and that on a number of indicators CRC-related students recorded higher levels of satisfaction with their course experience. This situation suggests that CRCs are playing a significant and worthwhile role in research training in Australia.\n      </p>", "In this article we describe a research partnership between the Akwesasne Mohawk Nation and scientists at the University at Albany, State University of New York, initiated to address community and scientific concerns regarding environmental contamination and its health consequences (thyroid hormone function, social adjustment, and school functioning). The investigation focuses on cultural inputs into health disparities. It employs a risk-focusing model of biocultural interaction: behaviors expressing cultural identity and values allocate or focus risk, in this instance the risk of toxicant exposure, which alters health status through the effects of toxicants. As culturally based behaviors and activities fulfill a key role in the model, accurate assessment of subtle cultural and behavioral variables is required and best accomplished through integration of local expert knowledge from the community. As a partnership project, the investigation recognizes the cultural and socioeconomic impacts of research in small communities beyond the production of scientific knowledge. The components of sustainable partnerships are discussed, including strategies that helped promote equity between the partners such as hiring community members as key personnel, integrating local expertise into research design, and developing a local Community Outreach and Education Program. Although challenges arose during the design and implementation of the research project, a collaborative approach has benefited the community and facilitated research.\n      </p>", "This article examines whether and how a particular research practice is overseen and supervised, and by whom. This investigation fills notable gaps in the literature on science, including a lack of emphasis on larger sociopolitical structures, a neglect of regulation, and indifference toward ethics. The author focuses on the oversight of a particular research practice; data editing; which embodies qualities that are intriguing to sociologists of science: invisibility, uncertainty, heterogeneity, and reliance on tacit knowledge. These characteristics pose unique challenges to oversight efforts. An analysis of in-depth interviews with gatekeepers reveals that although the methodological and ethical implications of data editing strategies can be substantial, oversight of such practices falls outside the stages and domains of current gatekeeping activity. These findings serve as the basis for recommendations to ensure data integrity while maintaining the professional autonomy of researchers.\n      </p>", "Teaching and research lie at the heart of higher education. The interaction between teaching and research has therefore attracted the attention of both researchers and policymakers. Much has been written about this relationship, looking in particular at the perceived mutual benefits between teaching and research. This paper presents some findings from a research project which, using a comparative approach, aimed to examine the nature of the teaching:research nexus and, in particular, to consider the response of institutional management. Based on the observations collected through the project, a new model is proposed for institutional management of the teaching:research nexus. This model is based on a range of contextual factors, classified as ideological or environmental, and two contrasting approaches to institutional management of the relationship between teaching and research, active and passive. This model offers a new approach to understanding the operation of the teaching:research nexus within institutions of higher education.\n      </p>", "International openness is essential to science in small modern countries. The modernization of Swiss science and economy in the nineteenth century was promoted largely by foreigners: newly founded Swiss universities were staffed to a large extent by foreign professors, but students also came from abroad. Up to the middle of this century, the development of Swiss universities was marked by distinct successive phases of inviting in or shutting out international influence, depending mainly on changes in the political context. The international landscape of knowledge and science since the 1950s has undergone dynamic change. University structures were installed as a reaction to this dynamism. Patterns of international research orientation emerging in different universities and in the disciplinary fields of business administration, chemistry and history are discussed in a comparative perspective.\n      </p>", "Objectives \u2013 To show that a Local Research Ethics Committee (LREC) can carry out an audit of ethical standards in research.

However, research designs typically do not allow for the most revealing examination of communication feature effects. This paper proposes a methodological framework for conceptualizing and operationalizing electronic communication research, and presents an illustrative study based on the framework. The methodological framework distinguishes among communication media, channels, and features, and emphasizes the importance for theory and research of understanding the effects of communication features both within and across communication media. To demonstrate this framework, subjects in the study participated in a sealed-bid negotiation. Communication of the bids was either paper-and-pencil or computer-mediated. The results revealed a significant main effect for medium (computer-mediated communication yielded lower individual scores), significant main effects for features (documentation and anonymity both yielded lower individual scores), and a significant interaction between a feature (documentation) and medium. For organizations, these results suggest that the accepted effects of a medium should be reexamined in light of the medium's component features; design and adoption decisions should be made with an understanding of the existence of interactions between features and media.\n      </p>", "Graduate and undergraduate students are typically required to become educated consumers of research. Yet, research courses generally focus on how to do research rather than how to evaluate it. Therefore, we propose ways in which faculty can help their students become better consumers of research by presenting a brief list of teaching objectives, texts and readings, and assignments that might be part of a stand-alone course on research evaluation or added to a traditional, \"practice-focused\" research course.\n      </p>", "Better understanding of how research participants with a known condition ascribe meaning to individual genetic results is important to help researchers and institutional review boards evaluate the potential benefits and harms of disclosing results in the context of genotype-driven research recruitment. Based on 29 in-depth interviews with epilepsy patients participating in a genetic study, we found that this population of research subjects anticipated that genetic research results would provide answers to a range of questions about the research process and their condition. Their multi-layered interpretations underscore the need for clear communication about the nature and limitations of results if individual or aggregate genetic results are returned in the process of recruitment for additional research.\n      </p>", "The awareness and attitudes of faculty towards research ethics committees (RECs) and research ethics practices are largely unknown. Accordingly, we conducted a cross-sectional survey study involving various faculties (Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, and Dentistry) from four universities in Egypt. A large majority (&gt; 85%) held positive attitudes towards RECs, but almost a third thought that RECs would delay research. More than half had not received prior training in research or medical ethics, but more than 90% thought that this subject matter should be taught to postgraduates. A large majority recognized the need for informed consent and confidentiality protections in research, but some held attitudes regarding certain research ethics practices that were questionable. We conclude that a curriculum in research ethics should be developed for university faculty and that further qualitative studies should explore the basis of several of the attitudes regarding practices in research ethics.\n      </p>", "BECAUSE OF THE SCARCITY OF PUBLICLY accessible information on West African human research subjects' protections, resources are difficult to find; many of these nations do not have local laws governing human research subjects protections and many of the local regulations are not available online. Without such information, investigators cannot effectively develop acceptable methods and procedures as they plan research in West African countries. This guide is intended for research ethics committee administrators, governmental and commercial regulators, ethicists, those in the legal community, and researchers seeking information regarding human research subjects' protections laws in West Africa. It is assembled in the hope that it will make these resources more widely available and so aid in the review and conduct of research involving human research subjects and stimulate further efforts to update such information as new regulations evolve.\n      </p>", "Between 1989 and 1992, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) awarded funding to 14 special projects known as Patient Outcomes Research Teams (PORTs). These large, complex projects form the centerpiece of the first generation of research under the Medical Treatment Effectiveness Program. In carrying out their individual 5-year research plans, and through collaborative work of six Inter-PORT Work Groups, PORTs have contributed to methodological advances related to their specific clinical focus and to outcomes research in general. Each of the PORTs has followed a standard research model, involving the application of: systematic literature review, measurement of outcomes, analysis of cost and claims data, decision analysis, and strategies for disseminating findings. This article reports what has been learned by individual PORTs, and by AHCPR, regarding the usefulness of each of these methodologies, both for the ongoing projects and for the next generation of effectiveness research. Examples from individual PORTs and work groups illustrate some of the methodological gains that have been made in effectiveness research and provide a glimpse of the work that remains to be done.\n      </p>", "The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) is the leading biomedical research institution in the United States whose mission is to support research that seeks to understand how environmental exposures affect human health. NIEHS possesses a longstanding interest in the health effects of agrochemical and other environmental exposures in rural America, including pesticides, to farmers and their families and to migrant farmworkers and their families. In recent years, NIEHS has begun augmenting traditional basic science investigations with innovative programs that translate findings from the laboratory to affected populations. It is through community-based participatory research that NIEHS strives to advance the public health field by fostering the development of culturally relevant interventions that will reduce exposures to environmental contaminants and the risk of environmentally induced disease. In this article, we describe the translational research program at NIEHS as it relates to the NIEHS mission and highlight activities pertinent to the health of rural communities, especially underserved populations. We provide an overview of NIEHS-supported projects addressing health concerns of Native American and rural African-American communities in addition to farmworkers. We conclude with a discussion of future plans for community-based participatory research at NIEHS.\n      </p>", "Conducting research in the wake of a catastrophic event imposes the dual responsibilities on researchers of protecting the rights of the survivors as research subjects, while also ensuring research quality and the dissemination and application of findings. This article, based partially on the authors' experiences of conducting research in school districts following Hurricane Katrina, examines the ethical issues that arise when working with survivors, reticent organizations, and institutional review boards. Challenges experienced by researchers concerning access, informed consent, confidentiality, subject compensation, and enlisting the assistance of stressed institutions are described.\n      </p>", "Action-oriented research is a methodological approach for doing collaborative research with practitioners and community partners that can inform practice, programs, community development, and policy while contributing to the scientific knowledge base. This article discusses how family scholars can use action-oriented research to work together with community partners to address their need for useful information about their practices and programs. We present some practical strategies that can help guide the action-oriented research process including how to develop collaborative relationships with community partners; suggestions for determining sound, action-oriented research questions; guidelines for selecting and implementing appropriate research designs; and considerations regarding data collection and the dissemination of findings.\n      </p>", "Range scientist members of the Society for Range Management were surveyed to evaluate where research efforts have been concentrated in the recent past relative to current and future allocation of efforts, how research is funded, where it is published, how well the scientists perceive that clientele needs are met, and what obstacles scientists face. Range ecology and range improvements are the topics that were, and continue to be seen as the most important for investigation. Plant improvement, range watershed, range wildlife, and ecophysiology are important future research topics. In-house funding was the most frequent source of funds for all groups of range researchers. University scientists were the most likely to have other sources of funds. There are funding sources that may be underutilized. The 4 most frequently listed clients are livestock producers (73 listings), state and federal agencies (71), other scientists (46), and the private sector (27). Forest Service scientists appear to have the least restricted view of their clientele. Over 25% of the respondents felt that there were no client groups not being adequately served by range research. Others felt that livestock producers and the public were not being adequately served. The Journal of Range Management was the most frequently listed publication outlet followed by conference papers and symposium proceedings. Limited funding was the most frequently listed obstacle to doing research, followed by poor communication between researchers and clients, and the need for more interdisciplinary interaction.\n      </p>", "Educational research in the UK has for some time been criticised in terms of both its relevance and its quality. Indeed, these issues of relevance and quality have been presented by some critics as linked with each other. One way forward that has been suggested is greater political (and thereby user and practitioner) control of research and its funding. This would presumably ensure the immediate practical relevance of future work, encourage flexibility of approach, and remove some responsibility from the 'dead-hand' of academic departments of educational research. This paper considers some of the counter-arguments, and contrary evidence, to this approach. It presents examples of projects by teachers, a large-scale study of teacher effectiveness contracted to consultants by the DfEE (as it then was), and of political self-censorship by intellectual fields. On this basis the paper suggests that the link between quality and relevance in research has been exaggerated, and that increasing political control of academic research alone is unlikely to lead to a marked improvement in quality.\n      </p>", "Advocates of narrative research often contend that it is superior to nonnarrative research, both qualitative and quantitative, because they believe it is better able to represent multiple perspectives and foster multiple interpretations. The author of this comment article on Coulter and Smith (2009) draws on literary theory and an analysis of the cultural expectations of narratives to argue that, although narratives have the capacity to represent multiple perspectives, many do not. As a consequence, he urges narrative researchers to work to reveal the constructedness of their stories so that readers have the information they need to question the researchers' perspectives and construct their own.\n      </p>", "The ethical practices of psychotherapy researchers were surveyed online. A total of 257 completed surveys were received from researchers worldwide. Eighty-nine percent of researchers admitted to at least one of the listed behaviors. The most common faults were related to excessive work demands: 44% of the respondents reported \u201cinadequate monitoring of research projects due to work overload\u201d and 37% reported \u201ccutting corners in a hurry to complete a project.\u201d North America was lower in almost all of the reported behaviors. The results about specific behaviors related to psychotherapy research for which rules are still fuzzy reflect the disagreement among researchers. The high prevalence of misbehavior in psychotherapy research is a warning that cannot be ignored.\n      </p>", "Context is an important component of research design. But too often there is a noticeable gap between what it is that we actually study and the domain of the original problem or phenomenon that we presumably want to learn about. Herein, I examine the context of research, reductionism, and biological emergence. My goal is to encourage improvement in showing evidence that knowledge gained from research will fit within the context of the issue originally used to rationalize the investigation.\n      </p>", "Recent policy recommendations involving the putative primacy of randomized clinical trials in educational settings have reignited research paradigm debates. The authors of this article use the vehicle of strengthening structured journal abstracts to point out the argumentative character of all education research claims. They offer suggestions to authors to help inform academic and policy-oriented consumers of research articles about the various logical and evidentiary limitations that temper research-based claims, whether they emanate from quantitative or qualitative methods.\n      </p>", "this pilot study sought to identify motivators and barriers to participating in a longitudinal survey; we interviewed patients and practitioners at a multidisciplinary primary care clinic where the proposed project would be based. While altruism motivates participation in medical research, we found that for many potential participants, the opportunity to benefit directly was the primary, and sometimes the only motive to participate or encourage participation in the research project. Patients often wanted direct feedback from their individual results, and they expected to provide consent before the results were forwarded to other parties such as their practitioners. Similarly, some practitioners were more likely to support the project if participation benefited patients directly. Other factors were also identified that influenced the acceptability and perceived risks and benefits of participating. More work is needed to understand these motivators and how patients might benefit directly from participating in health services research, especially when direct medical benefit is not possible.\n      </p>", "Research collaborations between academic researchers, regulatory agencies, and pharmaceutical manufacturers have made the drug development process more efficient and have frequently supported the successful documentation of quality, safety, and efficacy of pharmaceuticals (the so-called three hurdles). Over recent years issues of drug cost, access, and utilization have moved to center stage, giving rise to a \"fourth hurdle approval\" process by third-party payers. This requires new forms of collaborative research among new players. This contribution highlights the need for a \"triangular\" relationship in the field of outcomes research between scientists in academia, third-party payer institutions, and pharmaceutical manufacturers. We discuss, and illustrate by case studies, how successful models of collaboration from the drug development process might be relevant to research activities related to the fourth hurdle. Case studies which may provide useful models for collaborative outcomes research include the \"International Conference on Harmonization\" process, the voluntary consultation procedures established by drug regulatory agencies, and the Quebec experience in database sharing.\n      </p>"], "words": {"limited": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "represent": {"number": 1, "prob":
