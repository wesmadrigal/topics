The geography literature has had little to say about such aid chains, especially those founded on faith-based groups. The relationships between three Catholic Church-based donors -referred to as A, B and C -with development personnel of the diocese of the Abuja Ecclesiastical Province (AEP) as well as other Catholic Church structures in Nigeria were analysed. The aim was to explore the forces behind the relationships and how ' patchy' these relationships were in AEP. Respondents were asked to give each of the donors a score in relation to four questions covering their relationship with the donors. Results suggest that the modus operandi of donor 'A' allows it to be perceived as the 'best' partner, while 'B' was scored less favourably because of a perception that it attempts to act independently of existing structures in Nigeria rather than work through them. There was significant variation between diocese in this regard, as well as between the diocese and other structures of the Church (Provinces, Inter-Provinces and National Secretariat). Thus 'partnership' in the Catholic Church aid chain is a highly complex, contested and 'visioned' term and the development of an analytical framework has to take account of these fundamentals.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Parental participation in the control and administration of Catholic schools has often been minimal and wholly dependent on the clergy.

Are Catholics serving in the armed forces therefore required to refuse to serve in unjust wars? Are they entitled--or obligated--to defer to the judgments of others as to whether a war is just? If so, whose judgment? I suggest that there are exceptional characteristics of military service that may factor in the formation of conscience as it is described in Catholic teaching. Specifically, just as the Church sees the indispensable role of the armed forces in protecting society as reconciling the use of force with the Catholic injunction to seek peace, so too may the indispensable role of obedience and deference to authority in the armed forces--while never supplanting the responsibilities of individual discernment--reconcile fighting in an unjust war with the obligations of conscience.\n      </p>", "Northern Catholic refugees who resettled in the Republic of Vietnam during 1954 and 1955 in the aftermath of the Geneva Conference formed an identifiable, largely unassimilated cohort that was eventually (but not immediately) utilized by the government of Ng\u00f4 \u0110inh Di\u1ec7m for nation-building purposes.

It is shown that Centesimus Annus' claim that the purpose of the firm is broader than just profit is consistent with Collins and Porras empirical finding that firms which set a broader objective tend to be more successful than those which pursue only the maximization of profits. It is noted however that a related finding in Collins and Porras, namely that the content of the firm's objective is not as important as internalizing some objective beyond just profit maximization, can lead to ethical myopia. Two examples are provided of this: the Walt Disney Company and Philip Morris.

Because of historical circumstances, Thomas More's critique of the emerging agricultural capitalism of his time was ignored while Catholic Social Teaching inspired by Ketteler's work, endorsed and publicized by Leo, strongly impacted the industrializing world of a century ago. Whereas More defended a church seen as an impediment to economic progress by leading-edge Protestant entrepreneurs, Catholic Social Teaching was propagated at a time when Catholicism was enmeshed in the spread of industrialization. In our current world economy, increasingly dominated by non-Catholic regions of the East and a resurgent liberalism in the West, John Paul's recommendations currently seem more likely to meet the fate of More's critique than of Leo's.

Factor analysis and structural equations are employed to analyze a random sample of faculty members (n = 1,290) and institutional profiles (n = 100) of American Catholic colleges and universities. Catholic faculty show higher support for Catholic identity in latent structures of aspiration for improved Catholic distinctiveness, a desire for more theology or philosophy courses, and longer institutional tenure. Institutions having a majority of Catholic faculty exhibit four properties consistent with stronger Catholic identity: a policy of preferential hiring for Catholics (\"hiring for mission\"), a higher proportion of Catholic students, higher facult aspiration for Catholic identity, and longer faculty tenure in the institution. These latter two characteristics are not due simply to aggregation, but are stronger, on average, for Catholic faculty when they are in the majority. Preferential hiring marks Catholic identity, but is ineffective to increase the proportion of Catholic faculty. I conclude that the prediction of the critical mass thesis is correct.\n      </p>", "The Catholic Church is the largest (and arguably the best organized) single denomination in the United States, and it has extensive holdings in the health care field.

First, against the tendency to find the origin of the rise of occult forces in the invisible hand of capital, I relate the dramatic activation and rise of occult forces in Africa to the large increase in death rates caused by the AIDS epidemic (and to a lesser extent local wars). Although various scholars have shown in detail that in Africa contemporary Christianity has not put an end to witchcraft and the occult, but instead provided a new context in which they make perfect sense, they missed the point that precisely the fight against the occult reproduces and strengthens the 'enemy'. As I try to show, Christian anti-witchcraft movements are instrumental in reinstating the occult powers they fight against.\n      </p>", "The end of the second world war saw the Allied occupation authorities faced by substantial problems of malnutrition, refugees and crime. The military and Allied occupation authorities lacked the resources to resolve these problems, and had to rely on a range of external assistance organizations to cope with malnutrition and the refugee problem. Assistance came from a complicated array of organizations, including international agencies associated with the new United Nations, bilateral assistance from neutral countries, and religious and welfare organizations. While the Allies would have been happier working with organizations that they could exert leverage on, for example, the Red Cross, such was the enormity of the problems that they had to admit a broad range of relief organizations. This article will consider the politics of assistance, as organizations steered a course between the Allied authorities, local Germans and Displaced Persons. In the case of the Roman Catholic Church, the Americans recognized that to maintain the legitimacy of the occupation, it was politic to keep the Vatican and Catholic organizations sympathetically. On the other hand, the Church saw that it could gain support by supporting German dissent and complaints about the inadequacy of provision. I will consider the tense political relations surrounding relief through a number of such case studies.\n      </p>", "Roman Catholic social ethics traditionally has affirmed moral objectivity, universal moral goods, and progressive social reform - premises that guide just war theory. In recent decades these guiding values have been challenged by contemporary critical philosophies, confessional or communitarian religious ethics, and the fact of cultural pluralism. I A the middle of this century, thinkers like John Courtney Murray gave Catholic ethics a more historical turn, while retaining an essentially realist and meliorist approach to morality and politics. Now this confidence and optimism are questioned anew by ethnopolitical violence, the ambiguities of humanitar- ian intervention, and uncertain attempts at reconciliation and restoration. Such developments show that the central quandary of Christian and po- litical ethics is not the achievement of agreement on basic human goods; it is the expansion of the circle of solidarity in which basic goods are shared in practice. I will suggest that Christian symbols can help evoke the sense of human solidarity that is necessary to sustain peace, and that transformative efforts toward peace in violence-torn societies can be successful.\n      </p>", "ms to reverse unenlightened prejudices which have resulted from the lack of intellectual improvement of the people of Ireland.

F. Dearden remarked on the dearth of alternative approaches to that of conceptual analysis which predominated, at least in Anglophone cultures, at that time. One possible avenue of enquiry which he identified as conspicuously absent in this respect was the development of a distinctively Catholic approach to problems of educational philosophy, observing that a work of the mid-war years, Maritain's Education at the Crossroads (1943), appeared to be well nigh the only modern effort in this direction. More than a decade on from this, in a climate no longer exclusively dominated by conceptual analysis - indeed, in which there is unprecedented interest in a wealth of different schools, traditions and approaches to philosophy of education - Dearden's remarks about the absence of a distinctively Catholic perspective still apply. In the following essay, therefore, the authors have undertaken, via a critical analysis of Maritain's educational speculations of half a century ago, to try to discern some of the principal issues and considerations which would need to be addressed in the interests of identifying a distinctively Catholic educational philosophy.\n      </p>", "Adjustment to urban life can be a difficult process, particularly for migrants from a markedly rural background. Their responses constitute a key area of scholarly investigation into the urban experience of both past and contemporary societies. The large and volatile Irish migrant populations which were living in most British urban areas by the middle decades of the nineteenth century provide vivid case studies. This paper discusses how the Irish in Manchester, the first modern industrial city, coped with their new political, social and economic environment. Using a wide range of contemporary sources, it shows how, when faced by an alien socio-economic environment and historic anti-Catholic and anti-Irish sentiments in the native population, they relied heavily upon various forms of communal solidarity, particularly as reflected in residential segregation and the Catholic Church. It also demonstrates that when the pressures of the new environment became most severe then violent, drunken, anti-social behaviour resulted.\n      </p>", "I describe an ethic for business administration based on the social tradition of the Catholic Church. I find that much current thinking about business falters for its conceit of truth.

But, as in all abstractions, this truth comes at the expense of falsehood -namely, that persons are assets to deploy on behalf of owners. This last is \"wrong\" in both senses of the word - it is factually wrong in that persons are far more than business assets, they are supernatural beings, children of God; and it is morally wrong in that it is an injustice to treat them as the former when they are the latter. I draw upon the social tradition of the Catholic Church to recognize that the business of business is not business, but is instead the human person. Following Church teachings, I describe a person-centered ethic of business based upon eight social principles that both correct and enlarge the shareholder-centered ethic of much current business thinking. I discuss implications of this person-centered ethic for business administration.\n      </p>", "Since the transition to democracy in Spain in 1975, both total fertility and rates of church attendance of Catholics have dropped dramatically. In this study the 1985 and 1999 Spanish Fertility Surveys were used to investigate whether the significance of religion for fertility behaviour\u2014current family size and the spacing of births\u2014changed between the survey dates. In the 1985 survey, family size was similar for those Catholics who actively participated in religious activities and those who, though nominally Catholic, were not active participants. By 1999, the family size of the latter was lower and comparable to the family size of those without religious affiliation. These findings accord with the declines in both church attendance and fertility in Spain. The small groups of Protestants and Muslims had the highest fertility.

The present authors, an economist and a moral theologian who identify with one or the other of the two traditions, strive to clarify objectively their similarities and differences with the opposing perspective. Section one focuses on each position's perspective of love of self and love of others. We find both CEL and CST saying that self-love, rightly understood, constitutes a moral good and that the love of others serves as an important principle in the political economy. We find less agreement in section two regarding justice and rights, but even here, we discover a few surprises. Both traditions uphold justice (giving to each party what is due) as essential to the political economy, and recognize some similarity in that type of justice called commutative. We note, however, substantial differences regarding a second type of justice that we call \"public justice.\" First, they differ over the extent to which government should be involved. Here the meaning of rights, especially that of individual freedom, arises. Secondly, the traditions diverge over whether benevolence as a motivator ought to serve as a partner for public justice. Thirdly, CEL in general opposes CST's emphasis on social justice that calls upon institutions to be proactive in helping citizens and groups to become active participants in the economy. We conclude our essay by summarizing our discoveries and by suggesting areas for further dialogue.\n      </p>", "Cet article traite de la refondation de l'enseignement catholique engag\u00e9e depuis les ann\u00e9es 1990 au Burkina Faso.

In American Catholic practice, saints could also serve as intermediaries between two cultures\u2014the minority religious community and the larger Protestant one. This article focuses on two female saints who became popular among American Catholics in the early twentieth century in part because American Catholics believed that devotion to them would help to undermine negative images of Catholicism in American culture. Presenting St. Bridget of Ireland as an antidote to popular stereotypes of Bridget the Irish serving girl, Irish-American Catholics argued that the former\u2019s beauty and wisdom provided a more authentic rendering of Catholic womanhood than the ignorance and coarseness of the latter. Seton\u2019s devotees, meanwhile, highlighted her status as a descendant of the American Protestant elite, offering her as model of Catholicism that was socially, racially, and culturally distant from that presented by recent Catholic immigrants. Taken together, the revival of Bridget and the quest to canonize Seton show how U.S. Catholics looked to the saints not only as models of holiness but also as agents of Americanization. It may seem counterintuitive that Catholics would choose to mediate their Americanness through saintly devotion, the very religious practice that appeared most alien to Protestant observers. There is, however, no question that hagiography took on a decidedly American dimension in the early twentieth century as U.S. Catholics repackaged European saints for a U.S. audience and petitioned for the canonization of one of their own.\n      </p>", "White flight from public school desegregation can result in educational and residential resegregation which defeat the purpose of desegregation programs. One form of white flight is pupil transfer to private schools, which in major metropolitan areas are predominantly Catholic schools. Unlike residential relocation, transfers to Catholic schools do not effect an increase in residential segregation and they constitute a potentially less permanent loss to the public system than that caused by relocation. Nevertheless, empty seats in area Catholic schools pose a threat to the success of any desegregation program. For the Catholic diocese, the white flight issue creates a complex conflict of interests, involving institutional self-interest and competing claims to moral principles and Church teachings. A case study of Boston indicates that approximately 2,000 students transferred to Catholic schools from the public system, accounting for over 20 percent of white pupil loss to the public system. This occurred despite diocesan policies designed to prevent white flight to Catholic schools.

People are constantly testing their principles and values against the question of abortion. Advances in technology, the rise of communitarianism and the rejection of individualism, and the commodification of children are factors in the way in which the abortion debate is being constructed in society. The paper offers solutions to end the ugliness of the abortion debate by suggesting that we would be able to progress further on the issue of abortion if we looked for the good in the opposing viewpoint. The article continues with a discussion of Catholics For a Free Choice's position on abortion, and notes firstly that there is no firm position within the Catholic Church on when the fetus becomes a person; secondly that the principle of probablism in Roman Catholicism holds that where the church cannot speak definitively on a matter of fact (in this case, on the personhood of the fetus), the consciences of individual Catholics must be primary and respected, and thirdly that the absolute prohibition on abortion by the church is not infallible. In conclusion, only the woman herself can make the abortion decision.\n      </p>", "The 18th century German agrarian village system has persisted on the plains of western Kansas as a consequence of a Roman Catholic centered social system.

Additional analyses show that Catholic high school has no significant effect on adult Mass attendance when considering respondents who are currently Catholic. But when analyses include all respondents raised Catholic, Catholic high school produces a positive effect on attendance.

Was there any change in this relationship during the political transition to 1997? Did the prospective return of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China (PRC) affect Catholic educational policies?

Rationalist historian of philosophy Br\u00e9hier objected to the very idea of a Christian philosophy. Other historians like Gilson allowed that a philosophy could be characterized loosely as Christian when it was associated with Christian thought, as in the Middle Ages. But Blondel argued against both of these positions as presupposing a separation between philosophy and religion that allowed only for a false hybridization between the two when they were juxtaposed. His own approach to philosophy had been to show a necessary intersection between the two in the question about the ultimate meaning of human action as it relates to God in his infinite transcendence, as this had long been understood in the Catholic tradition, that is, as relating to something supernatural in the strictest sense, something bound to appear as scandalous and paradoxical to reason alone. The present article examines how he first came to his philosophical method for dealing with this question in the 1890's and how he later used this method in defending the idea of a philosophy that was integrally rational and Catholic in the strict sense of both terms. /// Na d\u00e9cada de 1930, Maurice Blondel desencadeou um importante debate acerca da quest\u00e3o da chamada Filosofia Crist\u00e3 mediante uma s\u00e9rie de artigos sobre Santo Agostinho, os quais insistiam em particular sobre a natureza filos\u00f3fica do pensamento do grande santo. Br\u00e9hier, um historiador da Filosofia de tend\u00eancia racionalista, objectou \u00e0 pr\u00f3pria ideia de uma Filosofia Crist\u00e3. Outros historiadores, tais como E. Gilson, concediam que uma Filosofia poderia ser vagamente caracterizada como Crist\u00e3 quando a mesma esteja associada com o pensamento crist\u00e3o, como era o caso na Idade M\u00e9dia. Mas Blondel argumentava contra estas duas posi\u00e7\u00f5es na medida em que achava que as mesmas pressuponham a separa\u00e7\u00e3o entre Filosofia e Religi\u00e3o, separa\u00e7\u00e3o esta que permitia apenas uma falsa hibridiza\u00e7\u00e3o entre as duas quando as mesmas eram justapostas.

We used the 2000 Brazil Census to examine differentials in fertility and family formation among adolescents living in Rio de Janeiro by the following religious denominations: Catholic; Baptist; other mainline Protestant; Assembly of God Church; Universal Church of the Kingdom of God; other Pentecostal Protestant; and no religion. Results from logistic regression models show that the majority of the Protestants are at a lower risk of adolescent fertility than Catholics, and that among adolescents who have had a child, most Protestants are more likely than Catholics to be in a committed union. Our findings offer some support for the hypothesis that Protestant churches are more effective than the Catholic Church in discouraging premarital sexual relations and childbearing among adolescents.\n      </p>", "Several previous studies have relied on religious affiliation and the proximity to Catholic schools as exogenous sources of variation for identifying the effect of Catholic schooling on a wide variety of outcomes. Using three separate approaches, we examine the validity of these instrumental variables. We find that none of the candidate instruments is a useful source of identification in currently available data sets. We also investigate the role of exclusion restrictions versus nonlinearity as the source of identification in bivariate probit models. The analysis may be useful as a template for the assessment of instrumental variables strategies in other applications.\n      </p>", "Much of the political and public debate about faith-based schooling is conducted at the level of generalised assertion and counterassertion, with little reference to educational scholarship or research. There is a tendency in these debates to draw upon historical images of faith schooling (idealised and critical); to use ideological advocacy (both for and against) and to deploy strong claims about the effects of faith-based schooling upon personal and intellectual autonomy and the wider consequences of such schooling for social harmony, race relations and the common good of society. This paper will attempt to review some of these controversies in the light of recent educational and research studies. Particular attention will be given to research investigations of Catholic schooling systems in various cultural and political contexts, studies which are largely unknown outside the Catholic community. In addition to reviewing educational studies of faith-based schooling, the paper will offer critical appraisal of the main arguments in the debate and it will also outline a possible research agenda for future inquiry in this sector of educational studies.\n      </p>", "God and politics have nothing to do with each other. So one would conclude from many sociological and anthropological studies that present systems of meaning sui generis. No mention is made of the power processes that generate and change them.

Religious regimes and states have much in common, but also remarkable differences. Systematic comparison of them may improve our insight into the interrelationship of fields of inquiry that have drifted apart.\n      </p>", "In this research we use a feminist perspective and data from the 1994 International Social Survey Program (ISSP) surveys in Poland and the U.S. to examine the influence of Catholicism on women's attitudes and behaviors involving work and family. Traditional notions about the influence of the Catholic church on women in these two countries often suggest a continued strong and patriarchal influence in Poland and a declining and increasingly questioned influence in the U.S. Recent research suggests that the relation between religion, country, and women's attitudes and behaviors is more complex than this. Our comparisons of Catholic and non-Catholic women in the U.S. and Catholic women in Poland and the U.S. support this notion of complexity. Results show some convergence between Catholic and non-Catholic women in the U.S. but continued differences on a number of attitudes and behaviors. And differences are not always in the direction of Catholic women being more conservative. Similarly, differences between Catholic women in Poland and the U.S. emerge -and the Polish women are not always more conservative. Some of these differences are reduced when factors such as age and frequency of church attendance are taken into account. In addition, Catholic women in Poland and the U.S. do share some perspectives and behaviors that are not seen among non-Catholic U.S. women. Conclusions suggest that we can speak of \"Catholic women\" but that there is considerable diversity in this group.\n      </p>", "Some of the social factors governing the incidence of religious intermarriage in Northern ireland are reviewed before setting out data from a special tabulation of the 1971 census of Northern Ireland. According to the tabulation only some 2% of married couples enumerated declared themselves to be in Catholic-Protestant marriages, a figure which is almost certainly an underestimate. The tabulation suggests that the likelihood of marriage across the Catholic-Protestant divide is no greater for manual workers than for nonmanual workers when controls are introduced for relative group size. Though care needs to be taken in interpretation in the absence of data on conversion patterns, there are indications that Catholic women marry out more often than Catholic men and that Catholics marry Anglicans more frequently than they do members of other denominations. There are indications that the incidence of Catholic-Protestant marriage was rising in Northern Ireland in the late 1960s.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ms to reverse unenlightened prejudices which have resulted from the lack of intellectual improvement of the people of Ireland.

This New State thus developed an instrumental relation with the Vatican instead of simply entering its \"service\". The Church was, nonetheless, a significant block in building the colonial state. Government support enabled it to make much progress, but not enough to impede advances by Protestant and dissident African churches and by Islam. For this reason, a new policy for religiously diversifying the state's relations started emerging in the 1950s: it aimed at making Portugalization succeed thanks to the help of non-Catholics.\n      </p>", "Despite there being significant numbers of state maintained Catholic schools in England, they have until recently proved to be of interest only to a minority of researchers, usually those directly involved in their promotion.

Standards of academic attainment at Key Stage 4 in Catholic schools compare favourably with national norms.

An interesting case in point is \"Catholic Alpinism\" in the Italian Alps. This popular movement began around the mid-19th century, when some curates, based in upland communities, some educators and some urban priests identified the mountains as a place for wholesome enjoyment and austere education. It was not that the Catholic world had totally lacked an interest in the mountains before. But in order to create a new way of mountaineering, it was necessary, first of all, to change the negative image of mountains which had taken root in European culture and had been codified during the early modern period. After the change occurred, the number of priest-scientists exploring the Alps increased steadily. Yet for \"Catholic Alpinism\" to take off, other meanings had to be read into the mountains. Crucial was the challenge by the British: Catholic Alpinism set in as an alternative to the expansion of British sporting alpinism (based more on Protestant creeds), and later, to increasingly extreme forms of physical effort and political nationalism. The Catholic form represented a different way of using the mountains. \"The rocks should be a path to virtue,\" stated one Italian theologian in 1921. Seventy years later, and against the background of a completely changed ideological and political situation, another theologian maintained that alpinism would only have a future if \"a return to spirit\" occurred.\n      </p>", "While some anti-war activist groups faded during the latter part of the cold war, the Los Angeles Catholic Worker organization continued its commitment to world peace through nonviolent resistance.

Various factors account for this in both the state (President Houphouet Boigny's religious policy and the devoted work of missionaries) and the Catholic Church (the 1974 \"school convention\" and the bishops, desire to save a network of schools despite advice from certain missionaires). This look back on history, using an original periodization, sheds light on issues in the current trend toward privatizing religious schools private. This trend has set off new conflicts between the Church and political leaders and between new actors in Catholic schools (pupils, parents, unions) and the Church. Depending on the context, many, sometimes opposite, tendencies are modifying the framework and contents of exchanges between public and private actors interested in the future of the country's religious schools.\n      </p>", "This study explores the differences between active Newman Club members and other Catholic students in non-Catholic colleges with regard to reasons for selecting such a college, academic and vocational aspirations, involvement in campus life, attitudes toward dating and intermarriage, reactions upon misrepresentations of Catholicism, adherence to religious practices, and maintenance or change of religious attitudes. Active Newman Club members had more previous Catholic schooling; they lived up more to Catholic expectations in all respect but where significantly different from their counterpart only with regard to reasons for studying at a non-Catholic college, additional devotions, and positive changed in religious interests. On the whole, the study allows to discern a tendency toward adaptation to general American middle-class patterns.\n      </p>", "The declining dissent among Catholic clergy since the 1970s has consistently been attributed to cohort replacement, indicated by age differences, as a result of changes in Catholic religious culture, despite a recognition in recent sociology of religion of the importance of institutional agency. I test (1) whether changes in priest's beliefs and values are due to cultural trends (indicated by birth cohort) or institutional selection (indicated by ordination cohort); and (2) whether they are related to liberalism/conservatism generally or to specific conformity to Catholic moral positions. Data are from the 2002 Los Angeles Times priest survey (N = 1,854). Results are mixed: I find support for the thesis of institutional selection for conformity since 1969, but not before. Prior to the 1960s, clergy (and lay) Catholic dissent increased linearly by birth cohort; since 1969, institutional selection, not cultural change, accounts for declining clergy dissent (while lay dissent has continued to increase). Implications for understanding changes in the Catholic Church and for religious theory are discussed.\n      </p>", "This paper examines the influence of ethnic background on organizational status attainment. The data are taken from a national sample of 2,755 Roman Catholic diocesan priests and bishops. The sample is divided into seven ethnic categories: Irish, German, French, Italian, Anglo-Saxon, Polish, and other. Controlling for the overall distribution of status positions within the diocese and the individual's age/seniority, a \"non-preferential\" model of status attainment is constructed. Average expected status on the basis of this non-preferential model for these ethnic groups in seven different regions of the country is compared to average actual status. Although we found three isolated cases of particular ethnic groups in specific regions doing significantly poorer in status attainment than predicted by the non-preferential model, the only consistent effect of ethnicity found across the entire sample is a slight advantage enjoyed by Irish clergy. No significant effect was associated with belonging to the largest ethnic group in a diocese. The very small advantage enjoyed by the Irish suggests that Irish domination of the Catholic hierarchy in the United States is maintained less by selective promotion within the ranks of the clergy and more by a disproportionate recruitment of Irish priests at the entrance levels of the organization. Disproportionate recruitment and preferential promotion are discussed as alternative mechanisms of domination within organizations.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Dryden's The Hind and the Panther (1687)\u2014in which the Stuart laureate renounced his Anglicanism for Roman Catholicism and defended James II's pro-Catholic policies\u2014outraged contemporary readers and has largely baffled modern critics. Seeking to understand the discursive conditions and logics from which Dryden's \u201cmysterious writ\u201d emerged, Matthew C. Augustine reads the poem in terms of the practice and poetics of transversion. To transverse, in Dryden's world, is to repeat, but always to repeat with a difference. Transversion is associated in The Hind and the Panther with Protestant spirituality, with scriptural error; however, transversion nonetheless crucially animates Dryden's own text and effects and gives us a new bearing on the poem.\n      </p>", "Mary Hobgood rightly asserts the significance of social science analysis for theological ethics; however, her argument that most injustice in the modern world is rooted in systemic flaws of global capitalism subverts her hope that governmental welfare policies can alleviate poverty and her support for the U.S. Catholic bishops' goals for welfare policies. On the other hand, if Hobgood's account of poverty and welfare exaggerates the role of systemic capitalism, as I contend it does, she has good reason to explore connections with the strands of social and moral thought within what she calls the dominant discourse.\n      </p>", "The Justice Development and Peace Commission (JDPC) of the Roman Catholic Church has been directly involved in different forms of conflict management and peacemaking within Nigeria's sociopolitical arena. These have marked it out as an important, nondiscriminatory, faith-based institutional leader in peace initiatives in the country. This paper critically examines the origins, nature, and dynamics of the JDPC's mandate and mission in Nigeria, focusing especially on its activities in the Ibadan and Ijebu-Ode Roman Catholic Archdioceses in Nigeria. The paper establishes that the mandate of the JDPC is to fulfill the Church's role in \u201cthe building of a just and peaceful world\u201d by answering its foundational question: what must the Church in Africa become for her message to be authentic and credible? In examining the variety of grassroots peace initiatives undertaken by the JDPC, the paper shows how the organization has been collaborating with individuals and groups (faith-based or otherwise, Christian or not). It thus argues that partnerships towards peacemaking, between faith-based groups and non-faith-based groups, on the one hand, and with other diverse religions and denominations, on the other hand, are not just possible, but attainable, given the experiences of the JDPC.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
