The limitations of the image-making process, however, may give misleading impressions of the feasibility of nanotech applications.\n      </p>", "The author considers Gerhard Richter's work on nanotechnology, highlighting how these pieces continue the artist's ontology on photographic blur and, as such, raise questions about truth and reality with respect to the mass media's visual presentation of nanotechnology. The four works discussed include: \"Erster Blick\" (2000) and \"Graphit\" (2005), the mural \"Strontium\" (2004) and the suite of sheets numbered 737 to 754 in the continuous image installation \"Atlas.\" Examining these works, the author notes Richter's general skepticism about the benefits of technology, shown through his allusions to war and terrorism, and contrasts Richter's artworks with utopian visions of nanoscience in the mass media.\n      </p>", "Metamorphic progress (productivity growth much faster than average) is often driven by Grilichesian inventions of methods of inventing. For hybrid seed corn, the enabling invention was double-cross hybridization yielding highly productive seed corn that was not self-propagating. Biotechnology stemmed from recombinant DNA. Scanning probe microscopy is a key enabling discovery for nanotechnology. Nanotech publishing and patenting has grown phenomenally. Over half of nanotech authors are in the U.S. and 58 percent of those are in ten metropolitan areas. Like biotechnology, we find that firms enter nanotechnology where and when scientists are publishing breakthrough academic articles. A high average education level is also important, but the past level of venture-capital activity in a region is not \u2014 it is easier to move venture capital and capitalists than the scientists possessing tacit knowledge of the new discoveries. Breakthroughs in nanoscale science and engineering appear frequently to be transferred to industrial application with the active participation of discovering academic scientists. The need for top scientists' involvement provided important appropriability for biotechnology inventions, and a similar process appears to have started in nanotechnology. Le progr\u00e8s m\u00e9tamorphique (croissance de la productivit\u00e9 plus rapide qu'en moyenne) est souvent guid\u00e9 par des perc\u00e9es au sens de Griliches, i-e des inventions permettant d'inventer. Pour le ma\u00efs hybride, l'invention essentielle fut l'hybridation crois\u00e9e qui a produit un ma\u00efs tr\u00e8s productif et ne se propageant pas. La biotechnologie est issue de la recombinaison de l'ADN. Le microscope \u00e0 effet tunnel a \u00e9t\u00e9 une d\u00e9couverte cl\u00e9 essentielle pour la nanotechnologie. Les publications et brevets la concernant ont beaucoup augment\u00e9. Plus de moiti\u00e9 des auteurs de ce domaine sont situ\u00e9s aux Etats-Unis et 58% de ceux-ci vivent dans dix m\u00e9tropoles. Comme pour la biotechnologie, nous trouvons que les entreprises investissent dans la nanotechnologie lorsque des scientifiques y publient des articles acad\u00e9miques innovants. Un niveau \u00e9lev\u00e9 d'\u00e9ducation est \u00e9galement important, alors que le niveau pass\u00e9 de capital-investissement dans la r\u00e9gion ne l'est pas \u2014 il est plus facile de d\u00e9placer le capital-investissement et les investisseurs que les scientifiques poss\u00e9dant la connaissance tacite des nouvelles d\u00e9couvertes. Les perc\u00e9es en science et ing\u00e9nierie nano sont fr\u00e9quemment transform\u00e9es en applications industrielles avec la participation active des savants auteurs des d\u00e9couvertes.

Shifting industry boundaries, new network forms, emerging sectors, and volatile ecosystems have become the stuff of everyday organizational life. Curiously, profound changes of this sort receive scant attention in organization theory and research. Researchers acknowledge fieldwide flux, emergence, convergence, and collapse, but sidestep direct investigations of the causes and dynamic processes, leaving these efforts to political scientists and institutional economists. We attribute this neglect to our field's philosophical, theoretical, and methodological fealty to the precepts of equilibrium and linearity. We argue that ingrained assumptions and habituated methodologies dissuade organizational scientists from grappling with problems to which these ideas and tools do not apply. Nevertheless, equilibrium and linearity are assumptions of social theory, not facts of social life. Drawing on four empirical studies of organizational fields in flux, we suggest new intellectual perspectives and methodological heuristics that may facilitate investigation of fields that are far from equilibrium. We urge our colleagues to transcend the general linear model, and embrace ideas like field configuration, complex adaptive systems, self-organizing networks, and autocatalytic feedback. We recommend conducting natural histories of organizational fields, and paying especially close attention to turning points when fields are away from equilibrium and discontinuous changes are afoot.\n      </p>", "The governance of nanotechnology seeks to limit its risks, without constraining opportunities. The literature on the effectiveness of approaches to governance has neglected approaches that impact directly on the behavior of a researcher. We analyze the effectiveness of legal regulations versus regulation via self-commitment. Then, we refine this model by analyzing competition and autonomy as key contingency factors. In the first step, qualitative interviews with nanotechnology researchers are conducted to reflect this model. In the second step, its empirical relevance is tested using a survey of 90 nanotech researchers. The results indicate that legal regulations, as well as self-commitment to an informal CoC reduce the scope of behavior. Finally, that competition and autonomy affect the relative strength of these governance factors.\n      </p>"], "words": {"and": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "played": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "an": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "as": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "governance": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "in": {"number": 4, "prob": 3.312505952159133e-05}, "organizational": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "education": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "considers": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "author": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "opportunities": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "research": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "to": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "role": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "progress": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "has": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "seeks": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "tool": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "outreach": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "important": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "nanotechnology": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "a": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "both": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "imagery": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "fields": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "without": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "limit": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "of": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "the": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "undergo": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "its": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}}}
