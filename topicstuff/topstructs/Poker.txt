The preference data collected in the context of this game are comparable to incentive-compatible choice-based conjoint (CBC) analysis data. We develop a statistical efficiency measure and an algorithm to construct efficient CP designs.

Our results suggest that CP induces respondents to consider more of the profile-related information presented to them compared with CBC.\n      </p>", "Bluffing in poker is examined as a problem in game theory. A very common situation occurs where the `kitty' contains K, player B has the apparent high hand, and player A has an apparent probability, P, of having a better hand than B, and considers a bluff. Under these conditions it can be shown that A should raise 1 unit with probability (1/(1 + K)) (P/(1 - P)) \u00b7 B, in turn, should call A's potential bluff with probability K/(1 + K). This says that in pot limit poker, if the potential bluffer has the appearance of having the winning hand with probability .25, he should bluff 1/2\u00b71/3 = 1/6 of the time. The optimal strategy is to call a potential bluffing hand half the time.\n      </p>", "A two-person poker game is analyzed and a solution is obtained. The essential difference between this game and those treated in the past is the fact that this one allows arbitrarily high bets. It turns out, curiously enough, that the number 7 is present in an essential way in both players' solutions, and furthermore, the value of the game turns out to be 1/7 of the ante. I leave to the numerologists the explanation of this mystical appearance.\n      </p>", "In this paper we discuss aspects of the solution of an eight-person draw poker game. Best strategies against perfect players (game-theoretic strategies) and against lesser players are presented. These strategies generally are functions of pot odds, the positions of relavant opponents, and their playing habits. For example, if player A opens with a pair of kings or better (his habit), player B should call with a minimum of aces when second from last to act (his position) and the pot equals twice the bet (pot odds are 2 to 1). Strategies of this type are given for opening, calling, and raising. We study the percentage of time one should raise as a bluff before the draw. A simple explanation is given for previously known results concerning optimal bluffing and calling after the draw.\n      </p>", "Twice monthly for one year the author attended the \"friendly\" poker games of a group which had played twice monthly for more than ten years.

Micro social structures have a sui generis aspect to them. Social structures are simultaneously a set of relations between positions and interactional relations between people.

The article thus retains the insights associated with both interactionist and structuralist positions with respect to sociology's long history of debate about structure and agency.

Career-pros exhibit strong occupational identification, and consequently place great importance on the appearance of respectability. Career identification is discussed in terms of three factors: (1) the interest in professional skills; (2) ideological and moral concerns; and (3) the reliance on group support. The presentation of respectability, a denial of inaccurate stereotypes, is a defensive mode of adaptation for those in marginal occupations.

For quantitative analysis based on standardized objects of known availability, I tested poker chips of seven different colors on two bowerbird (Amblyornis inornatus) populations known to differ radically in their use of natural objects. Experiments were of four types: placing chips in the bower or on the mat and noting which were eventually removed (weeding); placing chips near a bower and noting which eventually appeared as decorations in the bower or on the mat (harvesting); watching the temporal sequence in which birds harvested chips; and monitoring the sequence in which numbered chips were stolen from a neighboring bower. In the southern Kumawa Mountains, where colored natural decorations are not used, no individual harvested a poker chip, and most adults weeded chips of any color. Wandamen birds, which do use colored natural decorations, selectively weeded and harvested poker chips. The preference sequence averaged over all Wandamen individuals was blue &gt; purple &gt; orange &gt; red &gt; lavender &gt; yellow &gt; white, but individual birds differed in their rankings of the five intermediately preferred colors from purple to yellow. All four tests yielded similar preference sequences: the color harvested most often was harvested first, stolen first, and weeded least often. Among harvested colors, more-preferred colors were placed inside the bower hut, less-preferred ones outside the hut on the bower mat. Chips of the same color tended to be grouped near each other and near similarly colored natural objects. Chips of different colors were occasionally stacked according to color preference. Use of chips by birds involved much testing of different colors or much testing of the same chip at different positions in the bower. There were numerous parallels between the uses of poker chips and of natural decorations. Finally, I reexamine six questions: how male bowerbirds became emancipated from care of the young; how the focus of displays became transferred from bodily to non-bodily ornaments; why bowers provide females with a comprehensive test of male quality; whether bower-design rules are arbitrary; whether the rules are transmitted genetically or culturally; and why bower building is unique to bowerbirds.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "We find that experienced poker players typically change their style of play after winning or losing a big pot\u2014most notably, playing less cautiously after a big loss, evidently hoping for lucky cards that will erase their loss.

At the time of the referendum, video poker machines legally operated in all of Louisiana's 64 parishes (counties). Video poker was voted down in 31 parishes and retained in 33 parishes. Voters also allowed the New Orleans land-based casino and 15 riverboat casinos to continue their operations. The extant horse racing and pari-mutuel betting were not voted on. We examine the economic, demographic, and religious factors that influenced how people voted on the issue of legalized video poker. This study is of interest because in recent years, legalized gambling has been expanding around the world. We know of no other referendum on gambling that covered an area as large as an entire U.S. state\u2014all of Louisiana\u2014and offered voters control over gambling in their locality. Months before the 1996 referendum, the news media suggested several factors that might determine the outcome of the vote. The media concluded that concern over jobs would be the major influence on the outcome. Other important factors included a campaign against gambling by Southern Baptist churches and the simultaneous national presidential election. We investigate whether these factors, along with demographic factors such as age and education, influenced the results of the gambling referendum. Surprisingly, we found no clear evidence that the economic health of a parish or the preexisting size of its gambling industry determined the vote. The presence of Southern Baptists in a parish increased the likelihood that gambling would be voted down. Democratic voters tended to vote for gambling, as did black voters. Age and education levels of voters did not appear to influence their votes on gambling. Voters in parishes that bordered other states were more likely to retain gambling. Overall, it appeared that personal values were more important in determining voter behavior than financial considerations. People were voting with their hearts, not their pocketbooks.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Sociologists are fond of game metaphors.

Loss of catchment vegetation during fire can impact streams directly through altered solute and debris inputs and changed light and temperature regimes. Over longer time scales, fire can accelerate permafrost degradation, altering catchment hydrology and stream nutrient dynamics. In 2004, the 217,000 ha Boundary Fire burned 65% of an established study site in the Caribou-Poker Creeks Research Watershed. We used this opportunity to investigate the impact of wildfire on stream chemistry and metabolism in boreal forest catchments. Wildfire impacts on chemistry were evaluated by examining solute chemistry in four catchments from 2002 to 2007. Ecosystem metabolism was measured over the summer of 2005 in one burned and two unburned catchments. Wildfire led to stream nitrate concentration increasing up to threefold, whereas dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen concentrations decreased post-fire. Average stream gross primary production in the burned catchment was double that of the unburned sites (2.4 and 1.2 g O\u2082 m\u207b\u00b2 day\u207b\u00b9, respectively). Respiration rate was also elevated in the burned stream (6.6 g O\u2082 m\u207b\u00b2 day\u207b\u00b9) compared with the control streams (1.2 and 4.5 g O\u2082 m\u207b\u00b2 day\u207b\u00b9).

Bowers in the south Kumawa Mountains are tall towers of sticks glued together, resting on a circular mat of dead moss painted black, and decorated with dull objects such as snail shells, acorns, and stones. Bowers in the Wandamen Mountains are low woven towers covered by a stick hut with an entrance, resting on a green moss mat and decorated with colorful objects such as fruits, flowers, and butterfly wings. Young males build simpler bowers, and adult males differ among themselves. Experiments with poker chips of seven colors offered as decorations showed that individual birds prefer some colors over others, individuals and populations differ in these preferences, certain objects are placed in specific parts of the bower, and birds steal chips from neighbors. Bower style may be partly learned. Hence, geographically varying bower styles may be a culturally transmitted trait, like human art styles.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "This study examined interpersonal communication patterns among 70 of 149 members in the New York State Assembly. The average member spoke frequently with about 22% of his or her colleagues, less frequently to another 44%, and virtually never to the remaining third of the membership. Shared membership in political party had the strongest relationship to communication patterns (which colleagues a member communicated with) followed by regional delegation. Seat proximity and shared committee membership showed weaker relationships, and office proximity and gender were of little influence. In general, homophilous attributes were more important than proximity factors in influencing frequency of communication.

We analyzed long term data from watersheds underlain with varying degrees of permafrost, sampled springs and thermokarsts, used fluorescence spectroscopy, and measured the bioavailabity of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Permafrost driven patterns in hydrology and vegetation influenced DOM patterns in streams, with the stream draining the high permafrost watershed having higher DOC and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) concentrations, higher DOC:-DON and greater specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) than the streams draining the low and medium permafrost watersheds. Streams, springs and thermokarsts exhibited a wide range of DOC and DON concentrations (1.5-37.5 mgC/L and 0.14-1.26 mgN/L, respectively), DOC:DON (7.1-42.8) and SUVA (1.5-4.7 L mgC\u207b\u00b9 m\u207b\u00b9). All sites had a high proportion of humic components, a low proportion of protein components, and a low fluorescence index value (1.3-1.4), generally consistent with terrestrially derived DOM. Principal component analysis revealed distinct groups in our fluorescence data determined by diagenetic processing and DOM source. The proportion of bioavailable DOC ranged from 2 to 35%, with the proportion of tyrosine- and tryptophan-like fluorophores in the DOM being a major predictor of DOC loss (p &amp;lt; 0.05, R\u00b2 = 0.99). Our results indicate that the degradation of permafrost in CPCRW will result in a decrease in DOC and DON concentrations, a decline in DOC:DON, and a reduction in SUVA, possibly accompanied by a change in the proportion of bioavailable DOC.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Most of the work on card shuffling assumes that all the cards in a deck are distinct, and that in a well-shuffled deck all orderings need to be equally likely.
