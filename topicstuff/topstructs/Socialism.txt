{"total_words": 1161, "documents": ["Despite some important similarities, capitalism's informal economy and socialism's second economy are not functional equivalents or structural counterparts. An informal economy is the product of efforts to circumvent accountability to the explicit rationalizations of regulatory bureaucratization. It operates according to principles disparate from those of the rules of internal labor markets but congruent with the market principles that coordinate the formal economy. In the centrally planned economies of state socialism where informalization responds to the contradictions of redistributive bureaucratization, the embryonic market relations of the second economy are incongruent with the bureaucratic principles that coordinate the formal economy, and in fact, stimulate the institutionalization of transactive market relations and the expansion of property rights inside the socialist enterprise. As a sphere of activity relatively autonomous from the state, the second economy is a source of fundamental change remaking the economic institutions of socialism.\n      </p>", "Socialism is defined as a normative property of an allocation: that the allocation of labor and output be Pareto efficient, and that output received by individuals be proportional to the value of the labor they expended in production. Social democracy is an institution: the redistribution of income through taxation, with a system of private ownership of capital. We present a stylized parameterization of the US economy and compute its (unique) socialist allocation, and the Gini coefficient of the income distribution in that allocation. We compute the Gini coefficient of after-tax income in the present US \"social democracy\" and show that it is lower than in the socialist allocation. Hence, socialists must choose between two mutually exclusive alternatives: eliminating exploitation in the Marxian sense (achieving socialism, as defined above), or equalizing income. We propose that egalitarians must go beyond socialism, as it has been classically conceived.\n      </p>", "Too often regarded as merely an experiment in language, an effort to bring the harsh alliterative resources of Anglo-Saxon prosody into modern English poetry, Ezra Pound's \"The Seafarer\" is a far more ideologically complex text than modernist scholars have assumed. When examined in conjunction with medievalist commentary and political reflections written by Pound for the English socialist magazine The New Age between 1911 and 1914, this celebrated Anglo-Saxon translation reveals itself to be not only deeply political but surprisingly socialist in its sympathies. By publishing \"The Seafarer\" and other writings in this radical publication, Pound affirmed his solidarity with striking English laborers, particularly what was understood to be their patriotic efforts to recover ancient Saxon liberties. He also gave provisional support to an Anglo-medievalist variant of socialism known as guild socialism, thereby establishing that his pre-war politics were more progressive and left-leaning than previously acknowledged.\n      </p>", "The first decades of the twentieth century produced an enormous shift in Colombian political sensibilities, political discourse, and forms of political expression. The relationship of Colombian socialism in its most dynamic stage (1926\u20141930) with the Communist International was characterized by both sympathy and distance because its desire to become part of the international communist movement sometimes contradicted its commitments to a rich local political tradition. Colombian socialists eventually established ties with the Comintern in a roundabout way, but the ideological direction it offered was difficult to assimilate to the ideological substrate of militants and leaders, in which Christian values, liberal practices, and artisanal traditions mixed.\n      </p>", "In reporting on recent research on the changing geographies of everyday life in the town of Nowa Huta in southern Poland, this paper seeks to promote the use of post-socialism as a conceptual, rather than simply descriptive and/or transitory, category. By exploring experiences of (im)mobility and (in)security in post-socialism, this paper connects to related work on the West and asks what difference post-socialism makes. It concludes by presenting a post-socialism marked out as different by the particular experiences of socialism, its construction and destruction and as a partial and hybrid social form, produced by a combination of multiple social forms constructed at varied scales of time and space.\n      </p>", "Until 1917 Lenin and Trotsky believed that an isolated revolutionary Russia would have no chance of survival. However, from 1917 to 1923 Lenin's standpoint on this matter underwent a complete reversal. First he came to the conclusion that socialism could be built in an isolated Russia, although it would remain 'incomplete' in the absence of the world revolution. By 1923 he was abandoning that latter qualification too. The standpoint of Stalin and Bukharin in the debate on 'socialism in one country' of 1925-26 was more 'orthodox-Leninist' than the position taken by Trotsky, who had at first also embraced the notion of 'incomplete socialism', but subsequently returned to the old concept, abandoned by Lenin, that the restoration of capitalism was inevitable in the absence of the world revolution.\n      </p>", "The official need to tackle urban unemployment and reform state establishments, together with unequal privileges granted by the state, formed the critical context for staff recruitment in the early People's Republic of China. This article, which examines hiring in secondary schools in Shanghai, shows that none of the elements mentioned was aimed at the political or technical needs of work organizations. As a result, the organizations that fell on the lower level of the socialist institutional hierarchy received staff members they did not want. In Shanghai secondary schools, large numbers of people whom the state considered politically suspicious or academically unprepared joined the faculty, even as the state was attempting to develop a system of socialist education. Their recruitment both accelerated the state's need to tighten political control in schools and damaged classroom teaching. The impact of this policy on the campus lasted well into the Cultural Revolution.\n      </p>", "This article draws on archival sources and oral histories to describe changing post-colonial land management in the North Pare Mountains of Tanzania. The independent state transformed colonial institutions but did not maintain colonial common property regimes for water source, irrigation and forest management. Farmers responded by encroaching upon and dividing the commons. After 1967, Tanzania's socialist policies affected environmental conditions in North Pare indirectly by increasing the ambiguity and negotiability of resource entitlements. The material, social and cultural legacies of these processes include environmental change, declining management capacity and persistent doubt about the value of 'conservation'.\n      </p>", "This essay is a response to questions raised by my review of a book by Uta Gerhardt called Talcott Parsons on National Socialism. In short, I found many issues unresolved in the Cold War years from 1946 to 1954 at Harvard University, especially the role of Talcott Parsons and Clyde Kluckhohn in allegedly bringing Nazi collaborators to the United States. I have tried to address these controversial issues in this response.\n      </p>", "Spencer's evolutionary philosophy is usually identified with right-wing doctrines such as individualism, laissez-faire liberalism and even conservatism. Since he himself defended similar positions, it is perhaps not surprising that the study of the political interpretations of his ideas has drawn relatively little attention. In this article I propose to examine a rather atypical reading of Spencer's organic analogy, though definitely not a marginal one: Enrico Ferri's Marxist doctrine of Scientific Socialism. Ferri is not a figure unknown to scholars interested in the political aspects of the evolutionary debate. Nonetheless, the relation between his theory and Spencer's biosociology -- notably the complex dialectic of themes such as \"the struggle for existence\" versus \"class struggle,\" or \"evolution\" versus \"revolution\" -- has not yet received full-length analysis. In my study I investigate the diffusion of Spencer's ideas in Italy and their impact on the new \"positivist\" sciences of psychology and sociology inasmuch as these questions are essential to understanding Ferri's position. Throughout, I stress the importance of the intellectual and political context in the process of appropriation of ideas that led to this unexpected shift in meaning.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

New facts have been made available concerning the analysts who remained in Germany and the integration of the Berlin Psychoanalytical Institute into the Nazi System. They were convinced that psychoanalysis could be practiced as a pure medical science even under National Socialism. They knew very well of the risk inherent in trying to preserve psychoanalysis in its pure form by relying only on themselves. As a result of their attempt to save their practice and institutions, the Institute and the \"science\" of psychoanalysis became a shell and a fetish for whose maintenance a high price had to be paid. The present controversy among psychoanalysts about psychoanalysis in Nazi Germany makes it clear that even psychoanalysis could be coopted in politically troubled times because the analysts had betrayed Freud's demand for a \"pure and untendentious psychoanalysis.\" Even if the critical science of psychoanalysis could have functioned as a psychotherapeutic method in any form of society, the lessons of psychoanalysis under National Socialism illustrate the difficult situation as well as the opportunities available to the critical scientist in the contemporary context of the nuclear threat to mankind which emerged in the aftermath of the destruction of the Nazi system.\n      </p>", "From the late 1880s to the early 1900s, Jewish socialists in the United States shipped thousands of Yiddish newspapers, journals, and pamphlets to the Russian Empire. The literature was used to spread revolutionary ideas and secular knowledge among a relatively small but growing number of Russian Jews drawn into the nascent Jewish workers' movement. This article examines which publications were sent, how they were smuggled into and circulated within Russia, and their influence on the Jewish workers' movement. In doing so, the article argues in favor of a transnational framework for understanding relations between Jews in the United States and Russia, one that recognizes the influence of America on developments in Russia as well as the reverse.\n      </p>", "Modern communism is traditionally understood as an atheist, secular, and profane movement, actively opposed to religion as well as any form of \"idealism.\" The thought of Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mari\u00e1tegui, one of the main founders of Latin American communism, has very little in common with this conventional image. Mari\u00e1tegui had a heterodox attitude toward religion, as well as other subjects. Mari\u00e1tegui does not venture a new definition of religion. However, it can be inferred from his writings that his is an ethical-political and spiritual concept, one related to \"all the need of the infinite that exists in man\" (of which he wrote in 1925) and the quest for a heroic myth that could restore sense and enchantment to life. The word \"mystical,\" which appears very often in Mari\u00e1tegui's work, is evidently religious in origin but has a broader meaning: it refers to the spiritual and ethical dimension of socialism, as well as faith in the revolutionary struggle, absolute commitment to the emancipatory cause, and the heroic willingness to risk life itself.\n      </p>", "Early utopias envisioning a perfect order were superseded by small-scale versions in utopian communities. \"Scientific socialism\" then held that utopian socialism was doomed to failure in a hostile capitalistic world. As the Soviet experience elicited anti-utopias, utopianism has been unable to resolve its own contradictions in an imperfect world. This tragic outcome is an opportunity for sociology in its study of human interactions to analyze both the possibilities and the inherent limitations of proposed social systems. By monitoring the rich variety of social experience, it may help to restrain some of the fanaticisms that now surround us.\n      </p>", "Cuba's reform and economic opening have been crucial to its post\u2014cold-war survival and the development of a uniquely Cuban socialism. The country has moved from a public-property system to a mixed economy and from a sugar mono-economy to a diversified economy while introducing and increasing foreign investment. The result has been steady increase in growth without the abandonment of socialist principles. Some problems remain to be resolved, however, if Cuba is to rise to prominence in the global order.\n      </p>", "Scholars use a variety of terms to refer to the regimes of the former Soviet bloc. Some prefer communist, while others use socialist or state socialist. In this article, Andrew Roberts argues that communism is the better choice. Using socialism or state socialism to refer to these regimes stretches the concept unnecessarily, making one label refer to two regimes with little in common. This conceptual stretching has two negative consequences. First, it impedes efficient scholarly communication. Second, it impoverishes political debate by diminishing the achievements of democratic socialists. A solution to this problem is to use the term communist to refer to Soviet-style regimes.\n      </p>", "The Brazilian socialist and communist left was for historical reasons divided into 12 parties of factions, spanning the left ideological spectrum. This field research utilized a Q-Method protocol of 54 statements administered to 43 prominent members of the 12 parties to ascertain the deep structure of opinion underlying surface organizational diversity. Factoral rotation produced three opinion types: (1) Socialists proposing a radical mass movement with emphasis on participatory democracy, ecological and feminist issues; (2) Militant Marxist-Leninists committed to creation of a vanguard party but with leanings toward pluralism and internal democracy; and (3) Eurocommunists striving for a peaceful, democratic, and legal road to socialism.

It adopts an interpretative framework stressing that policy approaches to strategic and commercial services, on one hand, and social services, on the other hand, should be fundamentally different, given the structurally different nature of such diverse services activities. The paper analyzes the evolution of health policies during the doi moi period and reviews the national and international debate on health systems reforms, arguing that an approach prone to blur the intrinsic difference between social and non-social services has led to market-oriented health reforms that are severely flawed in Vietnam, with negative impacts on universality of access, equity, poverty, and efficiency. In sum, social services policies, and policies in the domain of health in particular, appear to constitute the weakest and most contentious component of Vietnam's otherwise extremely successful development strategy. Therefore, they are a prime candidate for critical re-examination.\n      </p>", "In recent years, women's transnational labor migration from Moldova has grown exponentially and their absence from families has provoked considerable anxiety over transformations in the social order. Few scholars of postsocialist states have explored transnational labor. Those who have focus on how new economic practices such as trading are anxiety-ridden because they index transformations from socialism to \"postsocialism.\" These scholars have not detailed nor theorized the gendered nature of migrant labor, representations of it, and states responses to it Using ethnographic research and interviews with Gagauz Moldovan migrant women who travel to work as domestics in Turkey and their village compatriots in Moldova, this paper illustrates a discourse of blame that employs the trope of \"mothers as key to the social order,\" one complicated by notions of socialism, sexuality, ethnicity, work, wealth, and rurality This trope plays a key role in blaming female migrant laborers for social disorder and in migrants' own justifications for going abroad. I argue that the migrants' gendered justifications constitute a new moral economy that aligns with global and Moldovan state neoliberal rationales. Drawing on a broad feminist and anthropological literature, this article problematizes claims about \"postsocialist\" transnational labor experiences by specifying them in terms of other overlapping subjectivities, particularly gender. In so doing, it shifts the anthropological gaze from a narrow focus on \"postsocialism\" in this region to identify problems and processes of globalization that hold wider significance and questions our categorizations of states into \"postsocialist,\" \"postwelfare,\" \"third world,\" \"global south,\" and/or \"postcolonial.\"\n      </p>", "Christianity, as Richard Steigmann-Gall argues in his study on the Holy Reich, did not constitute a barrier to nazism. Quite the opposite, he says: for many of the leading nazis he explores in his book the battles waged against Germany's enemies constituted a war in the name of Christianity. He aims to prove this central thesis by text analysis of prominent nazi leaders as well as some selected fields of nazi action. However, his main line of argumentation is far from being persuasive. A strange obsession to depict National Socialism as emphatically as Christian as possible runs throughout the book. It seduces the author into a series of systematic blind spots about National Socialism as a whole. Time and again he tends to over-generalize his partial findings. He refuses to adopt important sources like the Goebbels diaries and relevant literature, especially if they provide evidence contrary to his central thesis. In the end, the whole of his line of reasoning goes awry. Although SteigmannGall provides an interesting, stimulating and provocative interpretation of religious dimensions of the Third Reich, it is necessary to remind the author of the essential fact that National Socialism, above all, waged a war in the name of the 'Aryan-Germanic race', and preached a new and predominantly non-Christian faith, but not Christianity, the 'old faith'.\n      </p>", "Graham Wallas turned from his study of the classics to political science. The son of an Anglican clergyman, he rejected the church but not Christian ethics. His moral concerns led him to Fabian socialism, and his acquaintance with Darwin's writings led him to the study of psychology. In 1908, he wrote Human Nature in Politics, a milestone in the development of modern political psychology. The present paper traces the development of Wallas's thought and examines the important intellectual influences on him. Emphasis is placed upon the impact of his Fabian colleagues, and particularly on his friendship with H. G. Wells.\n      </p>", "Steigmann-Gall confronts us with the provocative thesis that National Socialism was in reality a Christian movement. He wishes to correct the 'mistaken belief of the last 50 years' that the nazi movement was stamped by a basic hostility to Christianity. Steigmann-Gall's thesis is original. But it does not convince. The list of crown prosecution witnesses he calls to the bar has no consistency and lacks the necessary weight. Steigmann-Gall mistakes the ideological nature of nazism, which in reality did not want to tolerate any kind of religion in the long run, since every religion would inevitably represent competition with it and thus question the claim of the ideological dictatorship of National Socialism to a monopoly over people's beliefs. In the 1990s there was a lively debate about the idea of nazism as a political religion, a debate unfortunately largely ignored in Steigmann-Gall's book. This debate took as its starting point the thesis that nazism intended to be a secular religion. But one has to ask in this context whether the concept of political religion is based on a meaningful concept of religion per se. Whatever the case may be, there was certainly one thing that nazism did not want to be: Christian.\n      </p>", "Following the perversion of \"Volkskunde\" by National Socialism during the Third Reich, scholars in the German-speaking world have several times attempted to overcome this usurpation of their discipline. \"Vergangenheitsbew\u00e4ltigung\" has, however, been quite difficult. Through the postwar years there have been various attempts to hide the unholy alliance between German \"Volkskunde\" and National Socialism. A few attempts had been made immediately after the end of the war, but this resulted in the \"legend\" of two \"Volkskunden\" by John Meier and Will-Erich Peuckert, one tainted and the other continuing the traditions of the past. Then again from the mid-1960s to the early 1970s there was hefty debate concerning the work of Hermann Bausinger and Wolfgang Emmerich, but there was too little interest, too much guilt, or too much concern with the newly developing directions of the discipline to devote the kind of energy and careful documentation necessary to accomplish an accurate historiography of this dark period. Research activity again intensified during the 1980s. Some revisionistic tendencies are surfacing, and the topic continues to be avoided by many German and Austrian scholars.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "This response accepts Richard Steigmann-Gall's argument that nazism and Christianity were less sharply opposed than popular and much scholarly opinion have assumed. Personal ties, institutional links and ideological common ground connected nazism and Christianity, and many members of the nazi elite considered themselves to be devoted Christians. Steigmann-Gall makes a significant contribution by focusing on such 'Christian nazis', in contrast to the 'nazi Christians' that others have examined. But he could do more to clinch his case. By defining religion solely in terms of belief, he ignores important aspects of nazi-Christian co-existence: for example, the fact that Church membership remained extremely high in Germany throughout the nazi era. His assumption of an especially close nazi-Protestant nexus obscures the significant cooperation of the Catholic Church. Meanwhile, by denying the existence of tensions between nazism and Christianity, he fails to consider the defensive posture of Church leaders, a stance that motivated much of their eager accommodation of National Socialism.\n      </p>", "All law reform must look for local precedents to build on. Does this claim also apply to formerly totalitarian states? Building on her research on East German legal history, the author asks whether there might be some generally applicable reasons explaining why in the German Democratic Republic the first tender shoots of a rule of law appeared before the collapse of socialism. She finds an inverse relationship between political and legal faith: as one declines, the other rises, and vice versa. The waning of utopian hopes tends to be compensated for by an increased interest in law and rights and by the growing professionalism of a disenchanted legal class. The author believes that not only is the \"prerogative state\" a constant threat to the \"normative state,\" but that, vice versa, the practice of legality, even the legality of totalitarian state, can threaten and undermine the effectiveness of autocratic rule.\n      </p>", "Cuba's history subsequent to Spanish colonization can be divided into 50 years of republican capitalist government and 50 years of socialist revolutionary government, with an intervening 7 years of dictatorship. The revolutionary period was the result of and grew from the first, capitalist, period, including the Batista dictatorship, within the larger context of the cold war. Immediately after coming to power, the revolution met a determined reaction from the United States, setting the stage for 50 years of struggle for its survival, with and without the support of the former Soviet bloc. Far from representing a static tableau of abstract capitalism versus socialism, relations between the two countries followed a tortuous map of events and changes around the world in which both were protagonists, each with victories and defeats. The essential merit of the revolution is to have survived for the past half century.\n      </p>", "As a participant-observer, the author relates observations, interviews, and surveys from her experience in a Cuban Escuela al Campo (\"School to the Countryside,\" or EAC) camp located on a collective farm outside of the city of Havana. The Pioneers, the youth section of the official Cuban Communist Party, organize the EAC program nationwide. The program's rugged, military lifestyle experience is required for city-based junior high school students in Cuba, an essential rite of passage of the politicization and socialist consciousness-raising efforts designed by the Revolutionary Government. The author proposes that beneath the revolutionary symbols and activities of the EAC, a new and latent socialist consciousness has been evolving for some time, one that reflects neither an absolute nor an erosion of socialist ideals. Rather, this consciousness (conciencia), much like A. Yurchak (2005) demonstrates in his study of Gorbachev's Russia, reveals a system that inhabits incommensurable positions; Cuba's socialism is both everlasting and steadily declining, at the same time full of vigor and bleakness, as well as dedicated to high ideals and devoid of them. None of these positions is a mask. The intention of this article is, therefore, to show how each is real and mutually constitutive in the EAC. Understanding this peculiar dynamic is crucial for understanding the everyday practices of students, their parents and teachers, the socializing function of Cuban schools, and the seemingly duplicitous behavior in Cuban's daily lives.\n      </p>", "In 1990, East Germany's ex-communists appeared to be in the political dustbin. Today, they are serious rivals of Germany's mainstream parties in the country's eastern states.

First, they reflect the discursive possibilities opened up by the political upheavals of November 1989 in Eastern Europe and of August 1991 in the Soviet Union; second, they express and represent the theoretical heterogeneity of contemporary American anthropology. We can characterize anthropological work in the former Soviet Union as attempts to use and explore the concept of culture in various sites of social, economic, and political transformation. By contrast, anthropologists studying postsocialist societies in Eastern Europe have turned from analyses of the cultural practices of groups on the margins of modernizing state projects to accounts of how communities are shaped by systemic changes in the political economy of states.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Geographical analysis of the symbolism of the landscape of the socialist city has, in contrast, been limited. Similarly, several geographers have commented on the changes which have been occurring to the cities of Central and Eastern Europe since the fall of communism, indicating the ways in which urban settlements are being adapted to the needs of the mixed economies that are now developing there. Less attention has been paid, however, to those elements of the socialist city which were created with a view to symbolizing the polity of the communist period - its glittering icons - and which, perhaps surprisingly, have survived its passing.

While Northern Europe's social-democrat parties forged organic relations with trade unions, cooperatives and mutual companies, the hectic history of the French worker movement is thought to have deprived the French party of privileged partners by putting it in competition with trade unionism, this \"other socialism\". Yet the permanence of this party and its ability to bounce back, in spite of several major crises over a century (1920, 1945, 1969, for example), suggest that it has real links with the society. This record has led to reconsidering these links, through the networks and milieus supporting the socialists and that enabled successful renewals. And thus to reconsider the supple and evolving links with the working class movement, secular networks and associations, not to mention that of the elected officials.\n      </p>", "This article takes a general view of perestroika and analyzes certain possible changes in the Soviet Constitution.

During 1960\u201361, Polish composers and critics debated the seeming paradox of official support in Poland for avant-garde aesthetics. Their disputes arose after the premiere of Henryk Miko\u0142aj G\u00f3recki's Scontri (Collisions) for Orchestra, op. 17, at the 1960 Warsaw Autumn Festival; disrupted the General Assembly of the Polish Composers' Union in December 1960; and persisted in the journal Ruch Muzyczny (Musical Movement) during the early months of 1961.\n         Taken together, the successive stages of debate show how defenses of Polish avant-garde music intersected with competing cultural imperatives of the Cold War. Maneuvers by composers and critics formed a musical corollary to the \u201cPolish road to socialism\u201d that W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka had engineered with the Soviet Union, an agreement by which expanded internal freedoms would be tolerated as long as no serious steps were taken to abandon state socialism in Poland.

O'Dowd's radicalism incorporated various strands of liberal, radical and socialist ideas without necessarily reconciling them. Indeed, his writings and activities reveal many of the tensions experienced by middle-class intellectuals of his generation and inclinations as they confronted the problem of political commitment in a context of working-class mobilisation, socialism and the movement for women's rights.

Incentives to engage in distributional struggles, to seek contrived transfers are strong, but incentives to engage in productive work are too weak. Stagnation and some unemployment should be expected. Long lasting democracies within unchanged borders create a permissive environment for rentseeking. The provision of rents very much depends on government. The stronger the governmental involvement in the economy, the higher social security spending, the more rents the government is likely to generate. Therefore, creeping socialism understood as increased government control of the economy should reinforce the rent-seeking society and the corresponding negative effects on growth and employment. Whether such creeping socialism is backed by ideological socialism or not should make little difference for growth or employment. These ideas have been tested and partially supported by a 19 nation sample of industrial democracies, using data from the sixties and seventies. By and large, the rent-seeking approach is fairly successful in explaining national differences in economic growth rates, but receives ambiguous support or less for unemployment. Olson's (1982, 1983) proposition about the negative impact of long lasting democracy within unchanged borders on economic growth is much better supported than the growth-retarding effects of government revenues or social security spending are.\n      </p>", "Many studies have documented the existence of spatial socioeconomic inequalities in developing nations, as well as developed, Western nations with market economies. Such spatial inequalities generally have been ascribed to deficiencies in the political, social, and economic systems prevailing in these states. Some writers have implied that under Marxist forms of socialism such inequalities would not occur and that territorial or spatial justice would prevail instead. This paper reviews evidence in recent literature bearing on the question of spatial equality and inequality in the socialist countries of the USSR and northeastern Europe, all of which profess an ideological commitment to the goal of eliminating spatial inequality. Judged from various perspectives-regional contrasts, urban-rural and urban-urban comparisons, and intraurban distinctions-the socialist states studied exhibit marked spatial inequalities. The persistence of these inequalities can be explained in terms of the priority placed on efficiency or military security as opposed to equity in industrial location decisions, the favoring of investment in \"productive sectors\" rather than social infrastructure, a desire to defer urbanization costs as reflected in constraints on urban growth, the growing scale requirements of service and human welfare facilities, and the continuation of substantial differences in income for various occupation groups.\n      </p>", "The Luk\u00e1cs Circle in Szeged, a spontaneous, unofficial organization of young Hungarian scholars and philosophy teachers, characteristically represented Georg Luk\u00e1cs' influence on young Hungarian intelligentsia in the period of late socialism. In this paper, the author recalls and critically analyses the intellectual milieu and motives that led a considerable part of young Hungarian intelligentsia of that time to make a cult of Luk\u00e1cs' philosophy. The key to the analysis is the ambiguous character of the political feelings and philosophical orientation of many young people in the period of late socialism and the paradoxical 'non-bourgeois bourgeois' character of Luk\u00e1cs' philosophy. Luk\u00e1cs' young followers were dissatisfied with the political conditions of 'real socialism' and with official Marxism. However, they considered themselves Marxists and were convinced by the anti-capitalist, romantic idea of democratic socialism. In the eyes of his young followers, Luk\u00e1cs was a genuine philosopher whose teaching was interwoven by his wide-ranging bourgeois middle-class education, promising both a real philosophical alternative to official Marxism and a high-level philosophical foundation for a non-capitalist but democratic future human history. The author argues that Luk\u00e1cs' philosophy did not satisfy these expectations. In his political philosophy, the philosopher could not move away from the mythological idea concerning the leading role of the communist party and therefore could not elaborate a genuine philosophical foundation for the idea of democratic socialism. Despite the superiority of his philosophy, his methodology and approach to the history of philosophy failed to provide a real philosophical alternative to the Bolshevik tradition of Marxism.\n      </p>", "If the Central Committee of the CPI(M) insists that the 'transition between socialism and communism' which it posits in its recent document on developments in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, and the 'transition between capitalism and communism' which textually appears in Marx and Lenin are equivalent statements, then the only logical conclusion would be that in the eyes of the party, socialism is the same as capitalism.

Using the prominent National Socialist philosopher Alfred Baeumler as a prism, this article is an attempt to shed a more nuanced light on the Nietzsche/National Socialist synthesis. Baeumler's portrait of Nietzsche as the envoy of a new spirit of 'heroic realism' served as a crucial counterpoint for the Nietzsche reception in the Third Reich.

This process is illustrated through a review of research on liberal, social rights, developmental, and socialist states in the postwar capitalist economy. These state models were reconciled with expanding international markets through a series of controls on trade and capital flows. Globalization has undermined many of these controls so that states must increasingly integrate themselves into local and global networks. States are experimenting with organizational and strategic changes nationally and internationally in order to respond to a networked economy and polity. Neoliberal institutions are the dominant force shaping the relation between states and markets in the contemporary era, but alternative state-society alliances are emerging to contest the hegemony of neoliberalism in shaping globalization.\n      </p>", "Interpretations of post-Soviet subjectivities have tended to emphasize the ways in which subjects experience these with a sense of liberation from a monolithic socialist state; however, local responses to post-Soviet forms of power have varied widely. In the case of indigenous Siberians in the 1990s, an older generation of Evenk women expressed positive feelings about their experience as students in the Soviet-era residential schools that continue to shape their subjectivity in the post-Soviet present. Evenk subjectivities, as with those of other indigenous Siberians, have been significantly formed through the institution of the residential school and, by extension, through a range of interactions with state power as it has been locally remade and interpreted in the 1990s. In this article, I explore the widespread nostalgia associated with the residential school. Drawing on the narratives of elderly Evenk women, I argue that such expressions of Evenk nostalgia for the socialist era are a form of critique of the neoliberal logics emerging in Russia today. In this respect, Evenk women's accounts allow us to explore negotiations of power in a post-Soviet era and to examine how ideologies shape conceptions of self and the social order more broadly.\n      </p>", "The position of town directories as sources in urban geography is discussed here. Traditionally attention has focused on their use in studies of social or commercial change in urban environments, and making use of the extensive listings of names and addresses contained therein. They are, however, far more versatile sources than this and provide excellent information on political and cultural change. Directories were often compiled not just with an administrative or commercial role in mind but to broadcast a particular image of society to the outside world. Perhaps nowhere is this more clearly illustrated than in Germany in the National Socialist period where directories were used as instruments of propaganda and social control. Concerted, and often quite subtle, efforts were made by the NSDAP through directories to cultivate a new image of society, one which was closely tied to their ideology. Moreover, when viewed against Hitler's town building programme, directory evidence casts it in a different light as one interested as much in projected image as urban regeneration.\n      </p>", "Archaeological evidence under the auspices of the National Socialist regime was exaggerated, misrepresented and otherwise abused in various ways to support contemporary military and social agendas, ranging from invasion to genocide.

It also means that the surface of that same object becomes less discernable. I apply this analogy to argue that the current preoccupation with transparency allows certain ideological movements to hide controversial agendas from public scrutiny. Focusing on evangelical Christian aid to Kyrgyzstan, this article traces how post-Soviet liberalization enabled evangelicals to gain a strong footing in this Muslim-majority society. Their emphasis on religious rights served to legitimize their missionary agendas, while the adoption of development rhetoric allowed evangelicals to present themselves as \"transparent\" civil society players.

Its main argument is that conflicts over the oriental Jewish immigrant question were, in part, a manifestation of a conflict-ridden political culture, which fluctuated between two poles: centralism and egalitarianism. Alongside support and endorsements of a policy that would encourage paternalism, dependency, and patronage in the relationship between the government and the country's new immigrants, we can also find clear, well-articulated, and not infrequent protests against the promotion of passivity in political life. These oppositional voices sought to advance a distinct vision of their own that called for giving real political power to immigrants in order to transform them from a controlled public into an active partner in government.\n      </p>", "During the Spanish Civil War of 1936-39, an estimated 50,000 executions took place in the Republican zone. Of these, around 9000 were killed in the Spanish capital. Explanations of Republican violence still tend to assume that it was the work of 'uncontrollables' and frequently cite Agapito Garc\u00eda Atadell as an example. Atadell led a brigade of 48 men that spread terror in Madrid during the summer of 1936 before he attempted to escape for Cuba that October. However, he was captured in the Nationalist-held Canaries and executed in July 1937. This article considers whether Atadell was really an 'uncontrollable'. It shows not only that Atadell was a significant figure in Madrid's Socialist movement before the Civil War but also that his brigade was the result of an initiative by the Socialist Party bureaucracy in early August 1936 to reinforce the police with loyal Republicans. This does not imply the existence of a Republican 'programme of terror'. It suggests that the brigade operated autonomously in its pursuit of dangerous 'internal enemies'. It also argues that the brigade was widely perceived to be efficiently defending the Republic against the 'Fifth Column' and that Atadell's departure did not harm the career prospects of many of his subordinates in the reorganized Republican police after 1936.\n      </p>", "After 1945, Austrian government officials and the general Austrian population portrayed themselves as victims of National Socialism. Austrian Jews, Sinti and Romany Gypsies, homosexuals persecuted under National Socialism, and political and religious opponents of National Socialism rarely exist in their versions of the past.

Karl Marx and Frederick Engels were hostile critics but the typically English Fabian Society was influenced by George's seminal ideas. The Fabians were especially attracted to two notions: the conception that George gave to the thought of his time, that poverty was an evil preventable by political intervention--by State action; and that the disparity in incomes could be explained by the theory of unearned increment. In turn Sydney Olivier, George Bernard Shaw, Sidney Webb, Annie Besant, H. G. Wells and E. R. Pease came under the influence of George. Soon to affect the Fabians, however, was the development of the economist, P. H. Wicksteed, beyond George to Jevons and Marginalism. Key figures in the Parliamentary and Independent Labour parties almost achieved land value taxation.\n      </p>", "The discipline of Environmental History research should include studies which examine the acknowledgement, evaluation and resolution of environmental crises of ecological movements. There are just some few authors who have explored ecological movements under the era of National Socialism. Protection of nature is one of those movements which, even before 1933, presented a contradictory, ambivalent image: On the one hand, the protectors of nature had been deeply influenced by contemporary cultural criticism and by the distinctive German-national consciousness integral to large parts of the educated middle-classes since the Wilhelminian era. Their compelling argumentative connection of Volkstum, \"native land\", \"landscape\" and \"soul\", as well as their racial hygienic thinking, made them predisposed to National Socialism. They placed great expectations on the \"Third Reich\", which led to an ideological use of nature conservation in favour of National Socialism. On the other hand, however, rearmament and war preparations demanded a partial autarchy of the Reich with regard to the provision of food; consequently the struggle to raise the level of food production and the Four-Year Plan demanded the conversion of ecologically valuable natural and cultural lands into cleared farming and grazing areas. Nature protectors were forced \u2014 though willingly \u2014 to collaborate in bringing forward this development, as their concept of nature protection demanded a cooperation with the government as the only possible alternative \u2014 regardless what direction it would take them. Besides, they were unable to argue, and more so to recognize the fundamental conflict between economy and ecology. Even in the time after 1945, and scarcely nowadays is the past of the nature protection movement adequately investigated. Reasans form this situation may be found in the training of the protectors in the natural sciences, who \u2014 not until the 1980s \u2014 had begun to recognize the social dimensions of their work and to develop a democratic conception of protection. The propagation of an \"ecological ethic\" and the rejection of an anthropocentric notion of nature protection have the same roots, and give evidence of an ahistorical way of seeing what hinders rather than furthers the cause of protection.\n      </p>", "An exercise in re-envisioning socialism needs to seek answers to questions on depoliticisation of workers in socialist societies and exhibit a comprehensive understanding of globalisation under the impact of the information technology revolution and the potential role of international organisations in global governance.

It is imperative for socialist thinkers to devise new institutional mechanisms and adapt old ones to meet the challenge.\n      </p>", "The totalitarian model of socialism is no longer universally accepted as an analytic framework in the study of societies that have followed the Soviet path of development. There is, however, no alternative model of authoritarian socialism that systematically links the political and economic aspects of state socialism in a comprehensive interpretive framework. This article, which explores the relationship between political power, central planning, and social inequality in the Soviet Union, seeks to fill this void. The author argues that centrally planned economies generate distinctive patterns of class hierarchy in the sphere of household and individual consumption and that inequalities in consumption are produced by the resulting bifurcation in the structure of consumption opportunities for the privileged and the masses. The article links this to the political logic of \"marketless\" socialism and, ultimately, to the rise of novel forms of class domination.\n      </p>", "While Aijaz Ahmad (EPW, June 1) gives a brilliant blow-by-blow account of the high parliamentary drama preceding the United Front's accession to power in the context of the rise of the communal variant of fascism in India and its striving towards gaining a parliamentary majority, he has dealt unevenly with three issues: consensus and nationalism; fascism; and bolshevism, commune and socialism.

Soon he formed a prominent anti-militarist movement called Herveism. When France's socialist parties united in 1905, Herve led the most extreme faction. Soon Herveists started a weekly newspaper, La Guerre sociale, which attempted to unite the French extreme left. Six years of sensational and provocative campaigns and organizations failed to implement his ideas. Despite his dedication, the quixotic Herve became frustrated by continuing leftist divisions. His disillusionment was connected to a rather naive reading of the increasingly anachronistic revolutionary tradition. Despite his sincerity, Herve's romantic and eclectic socialism exhibited atavistic features. His gradual transition to blatant chauvinism by 1914 culminated in a form of national socialism after 1919, which sought to recruit workers and former militants in a crusade for French renewal. Herve's activist socialism had included an anti-materialistic critique of society; his interwar national socialism looked to the nation and its religious traditions to remedy social divisions and decadence. His renamed newspaper, La Victoire, and its associated groups offered authoritarian panaceas to end French disorder. Despite Herve's marginalized status during the interwar era and his general reluctance to engage in violence, his neo-Bonapartist views and admiration for Mussolini must inescapably be included within what Philippe Burrin has called 'the fascist drift'. Striking shifts such as Herve's, from one extreme to the other, have often been tied to the origins of fascism. But the two chief interpretations of French fascism, the 'consensus' approach associated with Zeev Sternhell and Eugen Weber as well as the 'neo-traditionalist' approach associated with Robert J. Soucy and William D. Irvine, sometimes use the case of Herve to buttress their contrasting arguments. Such a paradoxical situation demands a thorough exploration of the life and political career of Gustave Herve.\n      </p>", "According to a widely held position in academia and the mainstream press, capitalism has proven superior to socialism in responding to human needs. However, analysis of health conditions of populations continent by continent shows that, contrary to dominant ideology, socialism and socialist forces have, for the most part, been better able than capitalism and capitalist forces to improve health conditions. In the underdeveloped world, socialist forces and regimes have, more frequently than not, made greater improvements in health and social indicators than have capitalist forces and regimes. In the developed world, countries with strong socialist forces have been able to improve health conditions better than those countries without, or with weak, socialist forces. The socialist experience has, of course, also included negative developments that have negated important components of the socialist project. Still, the evidence shows that the historical experience of socialism has not been the failure of which it is accused. Quite to the contrary: it has been, for the most part, more successful than capitalism in improving people's health.\n      </p>", "We know John Stuart Mill as an expounder of liberty and representative government. We know also that he was attracted to socialism. In this article, Professor Sarvasy argues that Mill's theory of democracy is best understood as one addressing the transition from capitalism to socialism. His socialist vision provides the context for interpreting his democratic theory which posits incompatibility between democracy and capitalism and seeks to facilitate evolution to socialism.\n      </p>", "In 1901 Gustave Herv\u00e9 attained notoriety by writing an article which included the image of the tricolour planted in a pile of manure. Soon he founded a French anti-militarist movement called Herv\u00e9ism which attempted to unite the revolutionary left. When French socialists united in 1905, Herv\u00e9 led the most extreme faction and soon created a weekly newspaper, \"La Guerre sociale\". Before the first world war Herv\u00e9 was a strident voice within European socialism, advocating revolutionary means to prevent war. Six years of provocative campaigns failed to implement his ideas. Despite his dedication, the quixotic Herv\u00e9 grew frustrated due to continuing leftist divisions. His disillusionment was connected to a rather naive reading of the increasingly anachronistic revolutionary tradition. Herv\u00e9 was sincere, yet his romantic and eclectic socialism exhibited atavistic features. Well before 1914 he rallied to 'la patrie en danger' and eventually renamed his paper \"La Victoire\". In 1919, Herv\u00e9 and several prominent socialists created a national socialist party. Startling as his reversal may appear, Herv\u00e9's activist Insurrectionalism actually included an anti-materialistic critique of society. That critique was crucial to his national socialism which looked to the nation and its religious traditions to remedy social division. His interwar writing and organizations offered various authoritarian panaceas to end French decadence. Despite Herv\u00e9's marginalization during the interwar era and his reluctance to engage in violence, his neo-Bonapartist views and admiration for Mussolini must inescapably be included within 'the fascist drift'. Striking shifts, such as Herv\u00e9's, from one extreme to the other, have often been tied to fascism. But the two chief interpretations of French fascism sometimes use Herv\u00e9's career to buttress their contrasting arguments. Such a paradox demands an explanation. This article analyses the anomalous features of Herv\u00e9's socialism in order to make his shift to the extreme right understandable. As strange as it may seem, the anti-militaristic, anti-patriotic and international socialist Herv\u00e9 exhibited patriotic, ethnocentric, ascetic and anti-democratic attitudes from the very beginning, and he was episodically ambiguous on the issue of antisemitism. Herv\u00e9's ideas often belie the apparent logic of political language. Such continuity and ambivalence underscore the limits of political language in dealing with hybrid movements such as fascism.\n      </p>", "This paper is concerned with socialism purely as a theoretical category, leaving aside the historical movements and acts that have occurred in its name. \"Early Bolshevism\" refers to Bolshevism before Stalin's consolidation of power. Marx's notion of post-capitalist society - \"communism\", \"socialism\", \"society of free and associated producers\" - envisaged a society that has left behind all the vehicles of exploitation and oppression of the old society, such as state, commodity production, money, wage labour, to name the principal ones. This is contrasted with the notion of socialism as it appears in the writings of the early Bolsheviks - Lenin, Trotsky, Bukharin and Preobrazhensky. It turns out that the socialism emerging from the works of these avowed \"Marxists\" is the exact opposite of the socialism one finds in Marx's extant texts.\n      </p>", "To recapture the force of Mill's socialism as a theory of dynamic change and as a radical alternative to liberal-capitalism, this paper offers an explanation of Mill's shift from liberal-capitalism to socialism and an exploration of his conception of socialism. My argument is that Mill's socialism develops out of, on the one hand, the recognition that class polarization rooted in the wage-labor relationship is undermining the ability of a private property system to achieve social improvement as a combination of individual freedom and justice, and, on the other hand, the belief that the newly independent working class will soon find hiredlabor status entirely unacceptable. To salvage his vision of social improvement, Mill seeks to transform class relationships and to offer a vision of a decentralized socialism economy appropriate for a period of transition.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "This study introduces a collection of theme issue papers on metropolitan processes in post-communist states.
