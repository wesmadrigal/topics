{"total_words": 254, "documents": ["Constructions of nature as the antithesis of culture have influenced both the ascription of, and resistance to, specific racialized identities. While it is possible to develop alternatives to these imposed identities, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to escape the influence and limitations of dominant social constructs. To build this argument, I draw on the attempts of \"Indians\" in western Canada to assert their identity as cowboys. The article begins with a brief overview of Euro-Canadian conceptions of nature and culture and of how they were deployed to construct Indians as a separate and inferior race. As part of this process, rodeo was used to help entrench a cowboy/Indian dichotomy and to deny, thereby, the legitimacy of Indian cowboys. Against this backdrop, all-Indian rodeos are introduced as a response to these processes of exclusion. Close examination of these events demonstrates that they have facilitated the assertion of Indian cowboy identities by creating contexts in which all of the cowboys are Indians. At the same time, however, an examination of the ways in which Indians have constructed their identity as cowboys suggests a heavy reliance on hegemonic notions of nature, culture, and \"race.\" This identity is both a manifestation of the power of dominant concepts and an unsettling challenge to the goal of moving beyond binaries in the formation of fluid, flexible, and egalitarian identities.\n      </p>", "Professional rodeos continue to be popular events. The reasons given for the continued popularity of rodeos range from their entertainment value to their social and cultural significance. Based on surveys of fans at three types of professional rodeos, this paper examines the determinants of professional rodeo attendance. It is found that the frequency of rodeo attendance varies across socioeconomic groups. Also, the affirmation of an individual's identity with western culture and social interaction emerge as significant determinants of rodeo attendance, complementing the value of the rodeo events. Relaxation as a determinant decreased the frequency of rodeo attendance.\n      </p>", "We investigated efficacy of aerial and ground application of Rodeo\u00ae to control smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) on intertidal mudflats in Willapa Bay, Washington during 1992-1993. The herbicidal formula was applied to 2 1-ha plots using a helicopter with toe-mounted spray boom or by hand-held wand sprayer. Stem densities did not differ from pre- to post-treatment between aerially treated and control clones. Stem densities were reduced on clones where the herbicidal formulation was applied by hand. Stem density was reduced most at plots located highest in the intertidal zone. Efficacy depended on the time between treatment and subsequent tidal inundation of treated plants.\n      </p>", "We present a greedy method for simultaneously performing local bandwidth selection and variable selection in nonparametric regression. The method starts with a local linear estimator with large bandwidths, and incrementally decreases the bandwidth of variables for which the gradient of the estimator with respect to bandwidth is large. The method-called rodeo (regularization of derivative expectation operator)-conducts a sequence of hypothesis tests to threshold derivatives, and is easy to implement. Under certain assumptions on the regression function and sampling density, it is shown that the rodeo applied to local linear smoothing avoids the curse of dimensionality, achieving near optimal minimax rates of convergence in the number of relevant variables, as if these variables were isolated in advance.\n      </p>", "In the present paper the authoress makes a complete description of a case of suicide at Rodeo Colorado, Department of Iruya, Province of Salta, Argentina.

Although efficacies of control methods for canarygrass have been studied in the Midwest, little information is available regarding efficacies for treatments in the Pacific Northwest. Consequently, we investigated efficacies of integrated pest management techniques to control canarygrass in seasonal wetlands of southwestern Washington. We evaluated mechanical (disking or mowing), chemical (Rodeo\u00ae), and combinations of disking and Rodeo along with water-level control for 3 growing seasons. Stem densities of canarygrass were reduced most by spraying and disking with a follow-up application of Rodeo during the next growing season. Disking with a follow-up application of Rodeo during the next growing season generally had similar canarygrass control as the most efficacious treatment. Canarygrass that germinated and grew from viable rhizomes following drawdown after the initial Rodeo application or disking made a follow-up treatment with herbicide imperative for effective control. To prevent canarygrass re-infestation, treatments should not be initiated until the ability to manage consistent water levels throughout the winter and early spring exists for a wetland.\n      </p>", "Chihuahua pines (Pinus leiophylla Schiede and Deppe var. chihuahuana Engelmann) were surveyed on 11 study plots on the Mogollon Rim in east central Arizona to compare characteristics of trees that sprouted from the base or root collar after the Rodeo-Chediski fire with those of trees that did not sprout. The differences in trees killed and top-killed by the fire versus those that survived were also assessed. Trees that sprouted were significantly smaller in height and diameter at breast height; they also experienced lower fire intensities than trees that did not sprout. Smaller trees had higher incidences of mortality than larger trees. These results indicate that, even though Chihuahua pine has fire resiliency, sprouting rates after fire are related to size of trees, age of trees, and burn intensity. Since Chihuahua pine is a rare species in the area studied, its ability to recover from and tolerate fire could prove advantageous for sustainability.\n      </p>", "What do championship rodeo, Hollywood film and television, and a graduate student have in common?

Although the efficacies of control methods for canarygrass have been studied, little information is available regarding response of wetland plant communities to these treatments, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. Consequently, we investigated vegetative response to control of reed canarygrass in seasonally managed wetlands of southwestern Washington. We evaluated mechanical (disking or mowing) and chemical (Rodeo\u00ae) methods and combinations of disking and Rodeo with water-level management. Spraying and disking in the first year with a follow-up application of Rodeo during the next growing season resulted in the most diverse plant community. Disking in the first year with a follow-up application of Rodeo during the next growing season also yielded a diverse plant community similar to the most efficacious treatment. Canarygrass that germinated from seeds and grew from viable rhizomes following drawdown after the initial Rodeo application or disking made a follow-up treatment with herbicide during the next growing season imperative to maintain a diverse community of wetland plants with little canarygrass. To prevent re-infestation of canarygrass, treatments should not be initiated until water levels can be managed consistently throughout late winter and early spring.\n      </p>", "Rodeo is a popular sport among Native American people, particularly Plains Indians, and has been so for more than a century. Although native participation has long been recognized as present in rodeo, it is generally presumed to be simply accessory to a package of traditions whose origins and modes of expression are firmly seated in EuroAmerican ranching culture. This paper examines a group of ancient Plains Indian traditions which appear to be counterparts to rodeo traditions, specifically: (1) bison herding, hunting, and sporting skills; (2) horse handling skills; (3) regular tribal gatherings and recreational contests; (4) parades and finery; (5) personal insignia and charms; and (6) clowns. Comparison shows that the similarities between the two traditions are striking both in detail and in combination. Archaeological and ethnohistoric information indicates that the Indian traditions predate rodeo, and that native people had ample opportunity to contribute to core rodeo traditions. Consequently, I suggest that Plains Indians were substantial contributors, both early and throughout the development of rodeo, and therefore are deserving of a prominent place in its history.\n      </p>", "In a society whose members believe that it is based on choices made by individuals, choices that involve sacrifices of individuality, men who lead conventional lives are likely to ponder whether they have given up too much. This American dilemma is, I argue, confronted and temporarily resolved for certain of the men of Rock Creek, Montana, during the local Fourth of July rodeo. Through this event men are able to relive and transcend their pasts in such a way as to conclude that they, as responsible citizens, have indeed appropriately controlled but not significantly relinquished their autonomy as men. In conclusion I suggest that the oscillations in rodeo (and other rituals) between the liminal and the normal have, by virtue of their very structure, their movement in and out of society, a special salience and efficacy in the American context for the enactment of such existential issues concerning the relationship of the individual to society.
