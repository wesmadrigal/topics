They proposed an empirical classification scheme based on the notion that some liquid semiconductors are characterized by a finite gap in \u03c3 (E), the energy-dependent conductivity (narrow definition), whereas in others \u03c3 (E) is continuous (broad definition). Interesting behaviour occurs for systems at the narrow/broad boundary and further analysis of these liquid alloys will form the subject matter of this paper.

The first topic is an electronic phase transition in graphite, which is interpreted as a manifestation of a nesting-type instability inherent to a one-dimensional narrow Landau sub-band. The second topic is spin-dependent tranport in III-V based diluted magnetic semiconductors; in particular, a large negative magnetoresistance observed in the vicinity of metal-nonmetal transition.\n      </p>", "A hydrodynamical model based on the theory of extended thermodynamics is presented for carrier transport in semiconductors. Closure relations for fluxes are obtained by employing the maximum entropy principle. The production terms are modeled by fitting the Monte Carlo data for homogeneously doped semiconductors. The mathematical properties of the model are studied. A suitable numerical method, which is a generalization of the Nessyahu-Tadmor scheme to the nonhomogeneous case, is provided. The validity of the constitutive relations has been assessed by comparing the numerical results with detailed Monte Carlo simulations.\n      </p>", "We establish the global existence of smooth solutions to the Cauchy problem for the one-dimensional isentropic Euler-Poisson (or hydrodynamic) model for semiconductors for small initial data. In particular we show that, as t\u2192 \u221e , these solutions converge to the stationary solutions of the drift-diffusion equations. The existence and uniqueness of stationary solutions to the drift-diffusion equations are proved without the smallness assumption.\n      </p>", "A mathematical model is developed for the new nondestructive optical technique called laser-beam-induced currents (LBIC), which can be used to detect electrically active regions and defects in semiconductors. The wellposedness of the model equations is shown, and an approximate model that simplifies the numerical implementation of the identification problem is obtained. Some numerical results are presented to show that the approximate model preserves the significant features that the LBIC technique has been experimentally shown to possess.\n      </p>", "In the mid-1980s, Japanese firms strongly challenged American dominance of the semiconductor industry. A large literature arose to suggest that, in order to survive, American firms needed to adopt the capabilities and strategies of the Japanese. Recently, American firms have indeed surged back to regain a strong position in the industry. This essay attempts to collect some of the lessons for strategy research of that American resurgence. We argue that, although some of the American response did consist in changing or augmenting capabilities, most of the renewed American success is in fact the result not of imitating superior Japanese capabilities but rather of taking good advantage of a set of capabilities developed in the earlier heyday of American dominance.\n      </p>", "Organic semiconductors are carbon-based materials capable of transporting charged excitations and interacting with visible radiation. For this reason they can replace conventional inorganic semiconductors in optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting diodes, photovoltaic cells and field-effect transistors. Organic chemistry offers a wide variety of tools for tailoring the functional properties of these materials, essentially molecular and macromolecular in nature, via addition or substitution of carefully designed chemical groups. This also provides the opportunity for transduction of chemical or biochemical interactions into optoelectronic signals, and hence for the fabrication of chemo- and bio-sensors. Very cheap manufacture, the possibility of covering large-area and flexible substrates with an immense freedom in the tunability of the electronic and optical properties are the promise of organic, possibly polymeric, optoelectronics for the next millennium. In this paper we briefly review some aspects of the basic physics and give an account of the state-of-the-art reached so far in turning these materials into useful devices. Finally, we attempt to project how the development of the latter may link up to progress in the biotechnologies.\n      </p>", "Heavily doped semiconductors, in particular Si:P and Si:B, have been prototype materials for the study of the metal-insulator (MI) transition at low temperature, T. Because of the statistical distribution of donors or acceptors in the (usually single-crystalline) host, disorder plays a crucial role for the MI transition. In addition, electron-electron interactions are important as evidenced by the rather large corrections to the Boltzmann conductivity already far above the MI transition. Usually, the MI transition is investigated by studying samples of varying dopant concentrations, N, although stress tuning and magnetic-field tuning have also been employed. An issue of considerable importance which we will discuss in this review is the critical behaviour of the electrical conductivity, \u03c3 (T \u2192 0) \u223c (N - N&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;\u03bc&lt;/sup&gt;, close to the critical dopant concentration N&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e. the exponent puzzle of \u03bc \u2248 0.5 versus \u03bc \u2248 1. The question of critical behaviour of the Hall constant will also be addressed. We further discuss the role of magnetic moments on thermodynamic and transport properties close to the MI transition. It has been known for some time that localized moments which of course are present on the insulating side of the MI transition, exist also on the metallic side. Only recently, however, was their influence detected on a transport property, namely the thermoelectric power. We review some of the salient features of local magnetic moments at the MI transition and report on measurements of the specific heat and magnetization on the same samples. The direct comparison of thermodynamic quantities allows a test of models for local moments at the MI transition. Finally, thermoelectric-power measurements together with electrical resistivity reveal strong differences between uncompensated Si:P and compensated Si:(P,B) on the insulating side of the MI transition, with evidence of opening of a Hubbard gap in Si:P only considerably below N&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;.\n      </p>", "A fundamental, yet underexplored, materials system is the interface between biological molecules and inorganic surfaces. In an elemental approach to this problem, we have systematically examined the adhesion of amino acids to a series of inorganic surfaces including metals, insulators, and semiconductors. Significant differential adhesion is observed over the full complement of amino acids, determined largely by amino acid side-chain charge. Extensive mapping of the amino acid adhesion versus materials in multiple solutions is presented, with preliminary mechanisms derived from concentration and pH dependence. These results provide an empirical basis for building peptide to inorganic surface structures, and, using this adhesion data, we design inorganic nanostructures that are shown to selectively bind to prescribed primary peptide sequences.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "A semiclassical transport equation for electrons in a semiconductor crystal is considered. It includes a nonlinear scattering operator modeling electron-phonon interaction. A formal macroscopic limit under the assumption of a small phonon energy is carried out, leading to the so-called spherical harmonics expansion (SHE) model for an energy-dependent distribution function with a scattering operator of Fokker-Planck type. By a further macroscopic limit for electric fields balancing the inelastic scattering operator, a nonlinear, hyperbolic conservation law for the macroscopic density is derived. The flux depends nonlinearly on the electric field. The nonlinear structure of the conservation law and the behavior for large fields are studied.\n      </p>", "Ferromagnetism in manganese compound semiconductors not only opens prospects for tailoring magnetic and spin-related phenomena in semiconductors with a precision specific to III-V compounds but also addresses a question about the origin of the magnetic interactions that lead to a Curie temperature (TC) as high as 110 K for a manganese concentration of just 5%. Zener's model of ferromagnetism, originally proposed for transition metals in 1950, can explain TC of Ga1-xMnxAs and that of its II-VI counterpart Zn1-xMnxTe and is used to predict materials with TC exceeding room temperature, an important step toward semiconductor electronics that use both charge and spin.\n      </p>", "This paper first reviews the general macroscopic and quantum mechanical formulae necessary for the calculation of Faraday rotations and Voigt shifts in semiconductors. The general formulae are then applied to calculate Faraday rotations, \u03b8, in semiconductors as caused by: (i) allowed direct band-to-band transitions, (ii) forbidden direct transitions, (iii) indirect (`phonon-assisted') transitions, and (iv) transitions by electrons in donor states. The dependence of the contributions (i) to (iii) on frequency \u03c9 is slower than would correspond to a single classical oscillator; for (i) it diverges as (\u03c9g-\u03c9) $^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$ as \u03c9 tends towards the band-gap, \u03c9g, and for (ii) and (iii) it tends to finite limit at the absorption edge. At low frequencies all three sources give contributions varying as \u03c92. Electrons bound in donor states behave like hydrogenic atoms and yield an obvious quantum generalization of the classical formula at low fields (equation (6\u00b77)). At high field strengths the expression obtained is similar to that for free electrons except that the free electron cyclotron resonance frequency, \u03c9c, is replaced by \u03c9c+ $\\Delta/\\hslash$ , where $\\Delta/\\hslash$ depends logarithmically on field strength (equation (6\u00b79)).\n      </p>", "Using a unique database derived from prospectuses for U.S. initial public stock offerings, we examine the location of four actors (the firm's lawyers, the venture capitalists on the board of directors, the other members of the board of directors, and the lead investment banker) of the entrepreneurial support network for startup firms in three high-technology industries: semiconductors, telecommunications equipment, and biotechnology. We demonstrate that the economic geography of the biotechnology support network differs significantly from the networks in semiconductors and telecommunications equipment. Biotechnology has a far-more-dispersed entrepreneurial support network structure than do the two electronics-related industries. The case of biotechnology indicates that if the source of seeds for new firms is highly dispersed, then an industry may not experience the path-dependent clustering suggested by geographers. We argue that contrary to common belief, biotechnology and its support network do not exhibit as great a clustering as do semiconductors and telecommunications equipment and their support networks. This argument leads to an epistemological issue, namely, the lack of interindustry comparative work. This is an odd omission, since nearly all authors agree that industries are based on particular knowledge bases, yet few consider that the knowledge and the sources of it may have an impact on spatial distributions.\n      </p>", "An asymptotic analysis of the Gunn effect (oscillations of the current through a semiconductor under constant voltage bias) is given. The electric field inside the one-dimensional semiconductor is described by a parabolic equation with small diffusivity, plus zero-field boundary conditions and a constant-voltage integral constraint. Nonuniform stationary solutions are constructed and their stability analyzed under both current and voltage bias. The oscillations are known to be produced by repeated generation at one boundary of a solitary wave that moves towards and is annihilated at the other boundary. Far from the boundaries the solitary wave is constructed and its stability analyzed. The effect of the boundaries is qualitatively discussed and several open problems pointed out.\n      </p>", "Investigations of the dynamics of muonium transitions in semiconductors using RF-\u03bc SR and longitudinal depolarization measurements are described. Results for intrinsic and doped Si allow development of an essentially complete model for the Mu dynamics. Energy barriers are compared with the few available measurements for H in Si. In intrinsic and p-type samples three states, Mu&lt;sub&gt;BC&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, Mu&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, and Mu&lt;sub&gt;BC&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; are active and at high temperatures a rapid cycle among all three states is identified. In n-type samples the Mu&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; state becomes important and numerous additional transitions become active. Parameters are extracted for seven separate transition processes and features associated with several additional ones are identified. Preliminary data for other materials are also briefly discussed.\n      </p>", "The development of solution-processable, high-performance n-channel organic semiconductors is crucial to realizing low-cost, all-organic complementary circuits. Single-crystalline organic semiconductor nano/microwires (NWs/MWs) have great potential as active materials in solution-formed high-performance transistors. However, the technology to integrate these elements into functional networks with controlled alignment and density lags far behind their inorganic counterparts. Here, we report a solutionprocessing approach to achieve high-performance air-stable nchannel organic transistors (the field-effect mobility (\u03bc) up to 0.24 cm\u00b2/Vs for MW networks) comprising high mobility, solutionsynthesized single-crystalline organic semiconducting MWs (\u03bc as high as 1.4 cm\u00b2/Vs for individual MWs) and a filtration-and-transfer (FAT) alignment method. The FAT method enables facile control over both alignment and density of MWs. Our approach presents a route toward solution-processed, high-performance organic transistors and could be used for directed assembly of various functional organic and inorganic NWs/MWs.\n      </p>", "Semiconductor devices generally take advantage of the charge of electrons, whereas magnetic materials are used for recording information involving electron spin. To make use of both charge and spin of electrons in semiconductors, a high concentration of magnetic elements can be introduced in nonmagnetic III-V semiconductors currently in use for devices. Low solubility of magnetic elements was overcome by low-temperature nonequilibrium molecular beam epitaxial growth, and ferromagnetic (Ga, Mn)As was realized. Magnetotransport measurements revealed that the magnetic transition temperature can be as high as 110 kelvin. The origin of the ferromagnetic interaction is discussed. Multilayer heterostructures including resonant tunneling diodes (RTDs) have also successfully been fabricated. The magnetic coupling between two ferromagnetic (Ga, Mn)As films separated by a nonmagnetic layer indicated the critical role of the holes in the magnetic coupling. The magnetic coupling in all semiconductor ferromagnetic/nonmagnetic layered structures, together with the possibility of spin filtering in RTDs, shows the potential of the present material system for exploring new physics and for developing new functionality toward future electronics.\n      </p>", "A linear stability analysis of the stationary solution of a one-dimensional drift-diffusion model used to describe the Gunn effect in GaAs is performed. It is shown that for long semiconductor samples under dc voltage bias conditions, and small diffusivity, the steady state may lose stability via a Hopf bifurcation. In the limit of infinitely long samples, there is a quasicontinuum of oscillatory modes of the equation linearized about the steady state that a acquire positive real part for voltages larger than a certain critical value. The linear stability of the solitary wave characteristic of the Gunn effect is proved for an idealized electron velocity curve in the zero diffusion limit.\n      </p>", "The interband Faraday rotation of semiconductors, i.e. the rotation not specifically due to free carriers, shows an unusual variety of behaviour. Whereas the rotation of ionic crystals and insulators is generally positive at all frequencies below the absorption edge, in InSb and InAs it is unusually large and negative and in Ge and GaSb it is positive at low frequencies but passes through a maximum and becomes negative as the frequency is increased towards the absorption edge. The interband Faraday rotation is analyzed here on the basis of the Luttinger-Kohn model. Effective mass parameters and other band constants previously determined have been employed in computations for GaAs, GaSb, Ge, InAs and InSb. The qualitative features of the observed interband rotations are correctly predicted by this model. This analysis shows that the observed interband rotation is principally determined by a competition between (virtual) transitions from the heavy valence states (a positive term) and the light valence states (a negative term). A small energy gap and small valence effective masses favour the light over the heavy valence band contribution; and conversely for a large gap and large valence masses. Ge lies in the middle of our sequence of five substances and a largely complete cancellation between these two principal contributions leads to an unusually small rotation.\n      </p>", "Hydrogen exhibits several distinct effects in semiconductors. These include: the neutralization of shallow impurities; the removal of deep states which act as recombination centres; the catalytic enhancement of oxygen diffusion; the change in the electrical characteristics of transition metal impurities. The basic theoretical methods that have been used to investigate these are described along with their principal results and outstanding problems.\n      </p>", "Soft, conformable electrical contacts provide efficient, noninvasive probes for the transport properties of chemically and mechanically fragile, ultrathin organic semiconducting films. When combined with high-resolution printing and lamination techniques, these soft contacts also form the basis of a powerful technique for fabricating flexible plastic circuits. In this approach, a thin elastomeric film on a plastic substrate supports the electrodes and interconnections; laminating this substrate against another plastic substrate that supports the gate, dielectric and semiconductor levels establishes effective electrical contacts and completes the circuits. In addition to eliminating many of the problems associated with traditional layer-by-layer fabrication strategies, this lamination scheme possesses other attractive features: the transistors and circuit elements are naturally and efficiently encapsulated, and the active organic semiconductor layer is placed near the neutral mechanical plane. We demonstrate the features of soft, laminated contacts by fabricating large arrays of high-performance thin film transistors on plastic substrates by using a wide variety of organic semiconductors.\n      </p>", "Organic molecules can alter inorganic microstructures, offering a very powerful tool for the design of novel materials. In biological systems, this tool is often used to create microstructures in which the organic manipulators are a minority component. Three groups of materials-biomaterials, ceramics, and semiconductors-have been selected to illustrate this concept as used by nature and by synthetic laboratories exploring its potential in materials technology. In some of nature's biomaterials, macromolecules such as proteins, glycoproteins, and polysaccharides are used to control nucleation and growth of mineral phases and thus manipulate microstructure and physical properties. This concept has been used synthetically to generate apatite-based materials that can function as artificial bone in humans. Synthetic polymers and surfactants can also drastically change the morphology of ceramic particles, impart new functional properties, and provide new processing methods for the formation of useful objects. Interesting opportunities also exist in creating semiconducting materials in which molecular manipulators connect quantum dots or template cavities, which change their electronic properties and functionality.\n      </p>", "Recent experiments involving the propagation of extremely high frequency, short-wavelength acoustic phonons in semiconductors are described. Such phonons, which play an important role in thermal energy transport and nonradiative recombination processes, can be used as sensitive microscopic probes of electronic, defect, and interface states. Experiments on phonon transmission through epitaxially grown bulk material as well as thin-film superlattice structures in the semiconductor gallium arsenide are described. Such thin-film periodic structures can be used to build frequency-selective phonon filters and reflectors, which can in turn be used to manipulate phonon diagnostic beams in technologically important materials.\n      </p>", "A theory of the dielectric constant arising from electrons in localised states is developed. The theory applies to randomly distributed states, such as they might occur in disordered solids, impurities in crystalline semiconductors, polymer aggregates and other materials. The theory includes many-electron effects. These, it is shown, are under certain circumstances equivalent to the classical local field effect. A practical solution of the local field problem is given for arbitrarily shaped polarizable centres which are randomly distributed in space. The orientation, however, need not be random. The theory should be particularly useful where highly non-spherical polarizable centres are encountered. It is shown that for such cases the theory can be applied to much higher densities of polarizable centres than the Clausius-Mossotti formula. Attention is paid primarily to the d.c. dielectric constant. However, the frequency dependence is found for a simple case of interacting centres. The results indicate that the interaction lowers the frequency range of the dispersion. The relevance to the problem of d.c. conductivity is briefly discussed.\n      </p>", "The Shockley-Read-Hall model for generation-recombination of electron-hole pairs in semiconductors based on a quasi-stationary approximation for electrons in a trapped state is generalized to distributed trapped states in the forbidden band and to kinetic transport models for electrons and holes. The quasi-stationary limit is rigorously justified both for the drift-diffusion and for the kinetic model.\n      </p>", "How do firms avoid being \"fenced in\" by owners of patented technologies used, perhaps unknowingly, in the design or manufacture of their products? This paper examines the conditions under which firms expand their own portfolios of patents in response to potential hold-up problems in markets for technology. Combining insights from transactions cost theory with recent scholarship on intellectual property and its exchange, I predict firms will patent more aggressively than otherwise expected when markets for technology are highly fragmented (i.e., ownership rights to external technologies are widely distributed); this effect should be more pronounced for firms with large investments in technology-specific assets and under a strong legal appropriability regime. Although these characteristics of firms and their external environments have been highlighted in the theoretical literature, prior research has not explored the extent to which such factors interact to shape the patenting behavior of firms. To empirically test these hypotheses, I develop a citations-based \"fragmentation index\" and estimate the determinants of patenting for 67 U.S. semiconductor firms between 1980 and 1994. Accumulating exclusionary rights of their own may enable firms to safeguard their investments in new technologies while foregoing some of the costs and delays associated with ex ante contracting.\n      </p>", "This work is concerned with multidimensional isentropic hydrodynamical models for semiconductors with short momentum relaxation time. With the help of the Maxwell iteration, we prove that, as the relaxation time tends to zero, periodic initial-value problems of a certain scaled hydrodynamical model have unique smooth solutions existing in the time interval where the classical drift-diffusion model has smooth solutions. Meanwhile, we justify a formal derivation of the latter from the former.\n      </p>", "Metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) is a process in which two or more metalorganic chemicals (for instance, trimethylgallium) or one or more metalorganic sources and one or more hydride sources (for instance, arsine, AsH$_{3}$) are used to form the corresponding intermetallic crystalline solid solution. MOCVD materials technology is a vapor-phase growth process that is becoming widely used to study the basic physics of novel materials and to grow complex semiconductor device structures for new optoelectronic and photonic systems. The MOCVD process is described and some of the device applications and results that have been realized with it are reviewed, with particular emphasis on the III-V compound semiconductors.\n      </p>", "High-quality crystals of the organic molecular semiconductors tetracene and pentacene were used to prepare metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) structures exhibiting hole and electron mobilities exceeding 104 square centimeters per volt per second. The carrier concentration in the channel region of these ambipolar field-effect devices was controlled by the applied gate voltage. Well-defined Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and quantized Hall plateaus were observed for two-dimensional carrier densities in the range of 1011 per square centimeter. Fractional quantum Hall states were observed in tetracene crystals at temperatures as high as \u223c2 kelvin.\n      </p>", "Defects in semiconductors play a controlling role in determining their technologically useful properties. Particularly important in this regard are defects that introduce levels far from the conduction and valence band edges. Capture or emission of electrons or holes into such levels generally results in displacement of the atoms in the immediate vicinity of the defect, and the action of the defect in determining the semiconductor properties must be understood with this complication in mind. Examples of the role of calculations in establishing some of our currently useful knowledge are presented.\n      </p>", "Organic electronics technology, in which at least the semiconducting component of the integrated circuit is an organic material, offers the potential for fabrication of electronic products by low-cost printing technologies, such as ink jet, gravure offset lithography and flexography. The products will typically be of lower performance than those using the present state of the art single crystal or polysilicon transistors, but comparable to amorphous silicon. A range of prototypes are under development, including rollable electrophoretic displays, active matrix liquid crystal (LC) displays, flexible organic light emitting diode displays, low frequency radio frequency identification tag and other low performance electronics. Organic semiconductors that offer both electrical performance and stability with respect to storage and operation under ambient conditions are required. This work describes the development of reactive mesogen semiconductors, which form large crosslinked LC domains on polymerization within mesophases. These crosslinked domains offer mechanical stability and are inert to solvent exposure in further processing steps. Reactive mesogens containing conjugated aromatic cores, designed to facilitate charge transport and provide good oxidative stability, were prepared and their liquid crystalline properties evaluated. The organization and alignment of the mesogens, both before and after crosslinking, were probed by grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering of thin films. Both time-of-flight and field effect transistor devices were prepared and their electrical characterization reported.\n      </p>", "The two main computational techniques to calculate the microscopic electronic structure of localized defects in solids are reviewed. Cluster calculations using the Hartree-Fock method as well as density-functional methods have been widely used to determine the equilibrium structure of hydrogen and hydrogen-related complexes in semiconductors. Results for the structure of both acceptor-hydrogen and donor-hydrogen pairs in silicon obtained by various methods and at different levels of approximations are discussed. Comparisons are made among the calculated vibrational frequencies of hydrogen in these passivation complexes. The spin density distribution for bond-centred hydrogen or muonium in diamond is investigated. Owing to the light masses of the proton and the muon it is necessary to average the computed hyperfine parameters over the finite extension of the ground-state wave function.\n      </p>", "A scheme is proposed wherein nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) can be induced and monitored using only optical fields. In analogy to radio-frequency fields used in traditional NMR, circularly polarized light creates electron spins in semiconductors whose hyperfine coupling could tip nuclear moments. Time-resolved Faraday rotation experiments were performed in which the frequency of electron Larmor precession was used as a magnetometer of local magnetic fields experienced by electrons in n-type gallium arsenide. Electron spin excitation by a periodic optical pulse train appears not only to prepare a hyperpolarized nuclear moment but also to destroy it resonantly at magnetic fields proportional to the pulse frequency. This resonant behavior is in many ways supportive of a simple model of optically induced NMR, but a curious discrepancy between one of the observed frequencies and classic NMR values suggests that this phenomenon is more complex.\n      </p>", "The ``mobility edge'' is the critical point at which a transition from localized to extended character of the eigenfunctions occurs in the random lattice problem. We study the behavior of the eigenfunctions as this critical point is approached, and produce arguments that suggest that they fall off, on the average, as exp(-\u03b1 )R with range R, and that $\\alpha \\propto|E-E_{c}|^{0.6}$ .\n      </p>", "This study focused on the degradation of dye Acid Red B in a catalytic electrolysis system with a semiconductor suspended in the electric field. The study showed that the addition of titanium dioxide substantially enhances the degradation of dye and that a semiconductor catalyst can improve electrolysis efficiency. This catalytic system has great potential to be applied commercially with the development of the catalyst. Analytical measurements show that some acidic compounds are produced in the treatment process and that biodegradability of the solution increases after electrolysis because of the breakdown of molecules. The UV-visible spectrum also indicates that the conjugated bonds of dye Acid Red B must be destroyed and that the molecules are broken into small ones. Furthermore, the results from the IR spectrum indicate that the nitrogen-nitrogen double bond of dye Acid Red B must be oxidized to nitrate. Electrochemical measurements show an apparent dye oxidation peak from 0.65 to 0.85 V (versus the saturated calomel electrode) in dye solution (10 g/L), confirming that dye is oxidized in this catalytic system.\n      </p>", "In this paper we carry out an asymptotic analysis of the system of differential equations describing the transient behavior of a p-n-junction device (i.e., a diode). We determine the different time scales present in the equations and investigate which of them actually occur in physical situations. We derive asymptotic expansions of the solution and perform some numerical experiments.\n      </p>", "This article considers a problem posed by a semiconductor manufacturer. The manufacturer wished to design the most cost-efficient final functionality test procedure possible for its semiconductor devices while maintaining high outgoing quality. The problem is that its test procedure is imperfect. Although the manufacturer believes that the test's probability of incorrectly accepting a defective device is very close to 0, they know that it frequently rejects devices that are functioning correctly. Every device must be tested once to ensure high quality. Items that fail can be retested to reduce the cost of discarding good devices. The manufacturer wished to determine whether retesting is beneficial and if so how many retests to conduct. We construct a model from which the expected benefit of n retests may be calculated and then maximized. Expected benefit is a function of both the probability that a device is defective and the probability that the test is incorrect. Thus we suggest methods of estimating these probabilities from the results of retesting. We also consider methods of using these estimates to design test plans and compare their effectiveness.\n      </p>", "This paper offers a unified discussion of equilibrium recombination-generation noise in semiconductors, and of its relation to the steady-state and transient lifetimes. It extends many existing results and covers situations where certain types of Auger processes, as well as one-electron transitions, contribute to the noise. The cases of degenerate bands, and of centres each able to trap one or more electrons are included. The new general results are, however, on the whole less complicated in form than their already known special cases. This is in part due to the fact that the equations are here expressed in a form which is symmetrical in bands and traps, so that there is no need to distinguish between them in the formal part of the theory. The following procedure is used. The formalism of irreversible thermodynamics is applied to a certam class of systems of which a homogeneous semiconductor is an example. The kinetic equations are written in a form involving generalized resistance and capacitance matrices. An admittance matrix and a lifetime matrix are introduced, and expressions for the steady-state and transient lifetimes in terms of the latter are obtained. Results from semiconductor statistics are used to evaluate these matrices in terms of the equilibrium electron numbers in, and transition rates between, the various groups of states (bands and localized levels) in the semiconductor. It is shown that the transition rates due to a certain class of Auger processes have the same dependence on quasi-Fermi levels as the transition rates due to corresponding single-electron processes. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem is applied, relating the spectral densities and variances of the fluctuating electron numbers to the admittance matrix, and so to the equilibrium numbers and transition rates. Problems involving two or three groups of states are considered in detail, and connexions with previous results are established.\n      </p>", "The role of defects as essential entities in semiconductor materials is reviewed. Early experiments with semiconductors were hampered by the extreme sensitivity of the electronic properties to minute concentrations of impurities. Semiconductors were viewed as a family of solids with irreproducible properties. Scientific efforts overcame this idiosyncrasy and turned the art of impurity doping into today's exceedingly useful and reproducible technology that is used to control precisely electrical conductivity, composition, and minoritycarrier lifetimes over wide ranges. Native defects such as vacancies and self-interstitials control basic processes, foremost self- and dopant diffusion. The structural properties of dislocations and higher dimensional defects have been studied with atomic resolution, but a thorough theoretical understanding of their electronic properties is incomplete. Reactions between defects within the host lattices are increasingly better understood and are used for gettering and electrical passivation of unwanted impurities. Metastable defects such as DX centers and the EL2-related arsenic antisite are briefly discussed. The recent development of isotopically controlled semiconductors has created new research opportunities in this field.\n      </p>", "The large dielectric constant and small effective mass in a semiconductor allows a description of its electronic states in terms of envelope wavefunctions whose energy, time, and length scales are mesoscopic, i.e., halfway between those of atomic and those of condensed matter systems. This property makes it possible to demonstrate and investigate many quantum mechanical, many-body, and quantum kinetic phenomena with tabletop experiments that would be nearly impossible in other systems. This, along with the ability to custom-design semiconductor nanostructures, makes semiconductors an ideal laboratory for experimental investigations. We present an overview of some of the most exciting results obtained in semiconductors in recent years using the technique of ultrafast nonlinear optical spectrocopy. These results show that Coulomb correlation plays a major role in semiconductors and makes them behave more like a strongly interacting system than like an atomic system. The results provide insights into the physics of strongly interacting systems that are relevant to other condensed matter systems, but not easily accessible in other materials.\n      </p>", "We discuss the various many-body effects that contribute to the large optical nonlinearities of semiconductors close to the band edge. Such effects are: band filling, screening due to the excited electron-hole pairs, band-gap shrinkage, energy broadening and excitonic enhancement. Compared to the Coulomb self-energy corrections, the radiative self-energies are normally small. However, they determine the transition rates in the rate equations of the photons and electrons.\n      </p>", "The determination of the space charge layer in p-n junction semiconductors leads to a boundary value problem with unknown interfaces. The solution u(x, y) which is the potential at (x, y) satisfies in the domains separated by the interface either the Poisson equation or the Laplace equation. We show that this problem reduces to a variational inequality, giving existence and uniqueness of the interfaces and at the same time discuss a direct computational technique based on the finite element method.\n      </p>", "Optical 2D Fourier transform spectroscopy (2DFTS) provides insight into the many-body interactions in direct gap semiconductors by separating the contributions to the coherent nonlinear optical response. We demonstrate these features of optical 2DFTS by studying the heavy-hole and light-hole excitonic resonances in a gallium arsenide quantum well at low temperature. Varying the polarization of the incident beams exploits selection rules to achieve further separation. Calculations using a full many-body theory agree well with experimental results and unambiguously demonstrate the dominance of many-body physics.\n      </p>", "Innovation and the management of intellectual capital are playing an increasingly important role in competition in high-technology industries. To operate in markets where innovation is cumulative, such as in electronics and semiconductors, firms frequently need to engage in extensive licensing and cross-licensing. This need is amplified by recent increases in the strength of patent protection and by the more active licensing stance of intellectual property owners. A high-quality patent portfolio not only reflects the firm's inventive capacity, but may significantly increase its crosslicensing bargaining ability and reduce royalty payments. In addition, it may directly contribute to its product and process innovation.\n      </p>", "A Hopf bifurcation analysis of the spontaneous current oscillation in direct current (DC) voltage-biased extrinsic semiconductors is given for the classical model of the Gunn effect in n-GaAs. For semiconductor lengths L larger than a certain minimal value, the steady state is linearly unstable for voltages in an interval (\u03c6\u03b1, \u03c6\u03c9). As L increases, the branch of time-periodic solutions bifurcating at simple eigenvalues when \u03c6 = \u03c6\u03b1 turns from subcritical to supercritical and then back to subcritical again. For very long semiconductors a quasi continuum of oscillatory modes bifurcates from the steady state at the onset of the instability. The bifurcating branch is then described by a scalar reaction-diffusion equation with cubic nonlinearity subject to antiperiodic boundary conditions on a subinterval of [ 0, L ]. For the electron velocity curve we have considered, the bifurcation is subcritical, which may agree with experimental observations in n-GaAs. An extension of our calculation suggests that a supercritical time-periodic bifurcating branch (possible for other electron velocity curves) consists of the generation at x = 0 and evolution of waves that are damped before they can reach the receiving contact. Our calculation is a first step in determining how the bifurcating solution branch is related to the branch of oscillatory solutions mediated by solitary wave dynamics. The relation to previous numerical and experimental results is discussed.\n      </p>", "This paper presents a calculation of the lifetimes (\u03c4 ) of excess electrons and holes in a semiconductor assuming the Auger effect between bands (electron-electron and hole-hole collisions) to be the only recombination mechanism. If pair annihilation, and the corresponding reverse process of pair creation, are counted separately, there are four classes of processes to be considered. The suitably weighted algebraic sum of the rates of these processes yields a net recombination rate R. If N be the non-equilibrium number of pairs, then \u03c4 = N/R. In the calculation the effect of traps is neglected, and the group of electrons in the conduction band and the group in the valence band are each assumed to be in equilibrium among themselves, but not with each other, by the use of quasi-Fermi levels. Bloch functions \u03c8 k = u( k, r) exp (i k. r) are used. The matrix element of the Coulomb interaction is obtained as a multiple sum over reciprocal lattice vectors. Most of these terms correspond to Umklapp-type processes whose probability of occurrence is shown to be small. The dominant term, after integration over all initial and final states, yields the dependence of lifetime on temperature, carrier concentration, energy gap and other parameters. The absolute value of the lifetime depends also on an overlap intergral of the form \u222b u*( k, r) u( k\u2032, r) d r where k, k\u2032 are in different bands. This integral is estimated on the basis of a one-dimensional model. The theory is compared with experimental lifetimes in InSb, and shows that the mechanism envisaged may dominate radiative recombination above 240 \u00b0 K and accounts for the order of magnitude of the observed lifetimes (\u223c 10-8 s) in the neighbourhood of the highest temperature (330 \u00b0 K) at which recombination in InSb has so far been studied.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

This involves certain overlap integrals. They are of the form \u222b u*(k1, r) u(k2, r) dr, where the u's are the modulating parts of Bloch wave functions. The integrals are calculated in this paper on the basis of a Kronig-Penney model. The value of the parameter obtained is shown to be rather insensitive to many details of the model used. When the value found is inserted into the previously published theory of life-times in InSb, very good agreement is obtained with the more detailed experimental results which have recently become available. This strongly suggests that the dominant recombination mechanism in InSb at elevated temperatures has been identified. A more general analysis of the properties of the overlap integrals is also given in this paper.\n      </p>", "Organic semiconductors based on \u03c0-conjugated oligomers and polymers constitute the active elements in new generations of plastic (opto)electronic devices. The performance of these devices depends largely on the efficiency of the charge-transport processes; at the microscopic level, one of the major parameters governing the transport properties is the amplitude of the electronic transfer integrals between adjacent oligomer or polymer chains. Here, quantum-chemical calculations are performed on model systems to address the way transfer integrals between adjacent chains are affected by the nature and relative positions of the interacting units. Compounds under investigation include oligothienylenes, hexabenzocoronene, oligoacenes, and perylene. It is shown that the amplitude of the transfer integrals is extremely sensitive to the molecular packing. Interestingly, in contrast to conventional wisdom, specific arrangements can lead to electron mobilities that are larger than hole mobilities, which is, for instance, the case of perylene.\n      </p>", "The identifiability of defects in a semiconductor from its laser-beam-induced current (LBIC) image is studied. It is shown that the LBIC technique is reliable for detecting any spatial defects in the semiconductor material.

For the one-dimensional case, the authors first characterize the attainable class of current measurements, and from this they show the nonuniqueness of the inverse problem. Then the reconstruction of the equilibrium potential is reduced to finding two constants subject to some constraints. A reconstruction algorithm is established based on a least squares formulation of the problem. The case of noise-collapsed data is also discussed. For a special case of two-dimensional domain, the authors apply the one-dimensional algorithm supplemented with a correction from the other spatial direction to establish an alternate direction iteration algorithm for reconstruction of the two-dimensional equilibrium potential. The authors also present some numerical examples to illustrate the reconstruction results by these algorithms.\n      </p>", "A singular perturbation analysis of the drift-diffusion model for stationary flow of charge carriers in a semiconductor device is given.

A solution-liquid-solid mechanism for the growth of InP, InAs, and GaAs is described that uses simple, low-temperature (\u2264203\u00b0C), solution-phase reactions. The materials are produced as polycrystalline fibers or near-single-crystal whiskers having widths of 10 to 150 nanometers and lengths of up to several micrometers. This mechanism shows that processes analogous to vapor-liquid-solid growth can operate at low temperatures; similar synthesis routes for other covalent solids may be possible.\n      </p>", "We developed a chemical route to produce graphene nanoribbons (GNR) with width below 10 nanometers, as well as single ribbons with varying widths along their lengths or containing lattice-defined graphene junctions for potential molecular electronics. The GNRs were solution-phase--derived, stably suspended in solvents with noncovalent polymer functionalization, and exhibited ultrasmooth edges with possibly well-defined zigzag or armchair-edge structures. Electrical transport experiments showed that, unlike single-walled carbon nanotubes, all of the sub--10-nanometer GNRs produced were semiconductors and afforded graphene field effect transistors with on-off ratios of about 10\u2077 at room temperature.\n      </p>", "As the invention of fundamental new sciences spawns subsequent research, discovery, and commercialization, core technologies branch into new applications and markets. Some of them evolve over time into many derived technologies, whereas others are essentially \"dead ends.\" The pattern of evolution and branching is called a \"technological trajectory.\" An intriguing question is whether some firms can ride the trajectory by developing proprietary experience in a \"platform technology.\" Because the knowledge is proprietary, firms that originate in industrial fields based on a platform technology acquire the technological skills to diversify and to mimic the branching of the underlying technological trajectory. The ability to compete in hypercompetitive markets depends on the acquisition of know-how that is applicable to a wide set of market opportunities. Such capabilities serve as platforms into quickly evolving markets. To respond rapidly to market changes, a firm must have already acquired fundamental competitive knowledge. In a high-technology industry, such knowledge invariably is derived from experience with the underlying science and related technological fields. The authors examine capabilities as platforms by analyzing the temporal sequence of diversification as contingent on market opportunities and previous experience. The pattern of diversification of firms reflects the evolutionary branching of underlying technologies. In that sense, the aggregate decisions of firms are driven by the technological trajectories common across an industrial sector. Certain technologies have wider technological and market opportunities, and consequently experience in those technologies serves as a platform for expansion. The authors propose that a firm's experience in platform technologies increases the likelihood of diversification when environmental opportunities are favorable. The proposition is tested with the sample of 176 semiconductor startup companies founded between 1977 and 1989. Evidence from multidimensional scaling of expert opinion and from an analysis of patent records was gathered to identity relatedness among subfields and the evolutionary direction of the technologies. A discrete hazard model is specified to estimate the effect of technological histories on subsequent diversification. The results confirm the relationship between relatedness and directionality of technologies and the industrial path of diversification. The finding that diversification depends on technological experience and market opportunity has important implications for firms' entry decisions. The authors discuss those implications by describing experience as generating options on future opportunities and distinguishing between the historical path by which the stock of knowledge is accumulated and the path by which new knowledge is generated and commercialized.\n      </p>", "The past decade has seen remarkable progress in isolating and controlling quantum coherence using charges and spins in semiconductors. Quantum control has been established at room temperature, and electron spin coherence times now exceed several seconds, a nine\u2014order-of-magnitude increase in coherence compared with the first semiconductor qubits. These coherence times rival those traditionally found only in atomic systems, ushering in a new era of ultracoherent spintronics.

Although this new model contains degeneracies giving rise to discontinuous solutions, preliminary experiments show that an efficient and reliable numerical solution by standard methods is possible.\n      </p>", "The steady state semiconductor equations in one dimension are examined subject to a given current through the device, supplemented by Dirichlet boundary conditions on one end of the device. Solutions to this current driven model are identified as the fixed points of a mapping T, and uniqueness of solutions for the unipolar model is shown for arbitrary currents, by demonstrating that T is unconditionally a contraction. For both the uni- and the bipolar model existence of solutions close to thermodynamic equilibrium is shown. This means that for the one-dimensional unipolar current driven model the situation is complementary to that for the potential driven model where it is possible to show existence of solutions for arbitrary applied potentials, and uniqueness close to thermodynamic equilibrium only. For the unipolar case, iteration with the mapping T defines an algorithm for the solution of this model which is unconditionally convergent to the unique solution if it exists.\n      </p>", "A simple model for the time-dependent behavior of semiconductor inverter circuits is used for an analysis of the dynamics of inverter rings.

First, rotating waves are computed explicitly for an idealized model problem. Second, a Hopf bifurcation theorem for problems with symmetries is employed to study the local behavior of the periodic solutions.

This applies to competitiveness in general, but is examined here in three specific industries: steel, motor vehicles and semiconductors. Explanations of changes in competitiveness often focus on economic and cultural variables, but an examination of the three industries shows that a better explanation can be found in the way in which each country organizes its state and its society. State-societal arrangements influence competitiveness mainly through their impact on the speed of diffusion of new technologies. The disparate cases of Germany (strong business and labour, weak government) and Japan (strong business and government, weak labour) suggest that there is more than one path to competitiveness. The literature on competitiveness has focused too much on Japan, and therefore on state industrial policies, as the key to increasing competitiveness.

The factors that control the solid-state polymerization of disubstituted diacetylenes and the perfection of the resultant polymer crystals are discussed. The presence of large substituent groups leads to weak interchain coupling so that PDAs are quasi-one-dimensional materials. Optical spectroscopy has shown that the strong dichroism of PDA crystals results from an excitonic excited state lying about 0.5 eV below the interband transition. The latter is weakly absorbing but can be observed by electro-modulation spectroscopy. Thermal and photogeneration of free carriers is inhibited by the large band gap (greater than 2 eV), the weak interband absorption and the high probability of geminate recombination. The dependence of photocurrents on applied field is adequately described by the Onsager theory of geminate recombination in one dimension. This leads to the conclusion that carrier drift velocities are saturated even for low applied fields. In addition, photocurrent decay displays anomalous behaviour. Both phenomena have been attributed to scattering by defects, which leads to the failure of linear response theory in one dimension. Even for imperfect samples with high trap densities the carrier motion is still accurately described by a one-dimensional diffusive model. This predicts unusual field and temperature dependencies in the decay of photocurrents that have been confirmed experimentally.\n      </p>"], "words": {"limited": {"number": 1, "prob":
