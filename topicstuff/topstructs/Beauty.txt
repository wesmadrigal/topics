{"total_words": 200, "documents": ["This study advances understanding of how a normative feminine beauty ideal is maintained through cultural products such as fairy tales. Using Brothers Grimm's fairy tales, the authors explore the extent and ways in which \"feminine beauty\" is highlighted. Next, they compare those tales that have survived (e.g., Cinderella, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty) with those that have not to determine whether tales that have been popularized place more emphasis on women's beauty. The findings suggest that feminine beauty is a dominant theme and that tales with heavy emphases on feminine beauty are much more likely to have survived. These findings are interpreted in light of changes in women's social status over the past 150 years and the increased importance of establishing forms of normative social control to maintain a gender system.\n      </p>", "Dove, a popular beauty brand, impressed some in the advertising world with its unique \"Campaign for Real Beauty\" and made others cringe. But little is known about how real women respond. \"Real\" beauty according to Dove means various shapes and sizes\u2014flaws and all\u2014and is the key to rebranding, rebuilding women's self-esteem, and redefining beauty standards. Drawing on interviews and focus groups with sixteen Canadian women and guided by social semiotics and dramaturgy, I examine Dove's presentation of beauty and women's reactions to it from a \"beauty as performance\" frame. This study examines processes of interpretation and finds that expressing beauty, the self, and a public image inextricably requires elements of performance.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Terence Horgan has provided the clearest account of why, contrary to Lewis, Beauty has evidence against the proposition that the coin comes up heads when she awakens on Monday. In this paper, I argue that Horgan's proposal fails because it neglects important facts about epistemic probability.\n      </p>", "Using Afrocentric theory and standpoint theory, this article examines the effect of the White standard of beauty upon African American women. By shedding light on the salience of the effects of beauty, body image, and hair, this article questions societal definitions of beauty. Adherence to the Euro American beauty standard has had, and continues to have, devastating effects upon African American women. In addition, this standard pits African American women against the dominant cultural standard of beauty. A call to challenge the hegemonic White standard of beauty through Black beauty liberation is offered.\n      </p>", "Hitchcock advances a diachronic Dutch Book argument (DDB) for a 1/3 answer to the Sleeping Beauty problem. Bradley and Leitgeb argue that Hitchcock's DDB argument fails. We demonstrate the following: (a) Bradley and Leitgeb's criticism of Hitchcock is unconvincing; (b) nonetheless, there are serious reasons to worry about the success of Hitchcock's argument; (c) however, it is possible to construct a new DDB for 1/3 about which such worries cannot be raised.\n      </p>", "According to the Doomsday Argument we have to rethink the probabilities we assign to a soon or not so soon extinction of mankind when we realize that we are living now, rather early in the history of mankind. Sleeping Beauty finds herself in a similar predicament: on learning the date of her first awakening, she is asked to re-evaluate the probabilities of her two possible future scenarios. In connection with Doom, I argue that it is wrong to assume that our ordinary probability judgements do not already reflect our place in history: we justify the predictive use we make of the probabilities yielded by science (or other sources of information) by our knowledge of the fact that we live now, a certain time before the possible occurrence of the events the probabilities refer to. Our degrees of belief should change drastically when we forget the date\u2014importantly, this follows without invoking the \"Self Indication Assumption\". Subsequent conditionalization on information about which year it is cancels this probability shift again. The Doomsday Argument is about such probability shifts, but tells us nothing about the concrete values of the probabilities\u2014for these, experience provides the only basis. Essentially the same analysis applies to the Sleeping Beauty problem. I argue that Sleeping Beauty \"thirders\" should be committed to thinking that the Doomsday Argument is ineffective; whereas \"halfers\" should agree that doom is imminent\u2014but they are wrong.\n      </p>", "Current research on construction of the female body focuses on non-Hispanic women in the United States. The idealized Latina body, however, is rapidly becoming commodified and objectified in global popular culture. Using standardized and open-ended surveys and group and individual interviews, the author examines the negotiation of sociocultural ideals and body image by adolescents at the intersection of gender, race, and beauty. These young women hold racist beauty ideals but are flexible when judging the appearance of real-life women. They perceive two competing or complementary prototypes of beauty, one white and one Latina. This study fills a gap in the literature on beauty and the body by examining a non-US. sample that does not fit into the usual Black-white dichotomy of race.\n      </p>", "Beauty therapy is part of a vast multi-national, multi-million pound beauty industry. The beauty salon lies at the heart of a complex set of discourses and practices. Research conducted in the salon sheds light upon a number of key sociological debates including; issues of health and well-being; gendered employment practices; the construction and maintenance of gender identity and sexuality; body practices; and leisure activities. In this sense the salon may be used as a microcosm in which to investigate wider sociological concerns. In this paper, I will draw upon the testimonies of beauty salon clients, and beauty therapists. I describe four areas of treatment: pampering; routine grooming; health treatments; and corrective treatments. These areas are investigated in depth and related to different spheres in the woman's life. In particular, I show how the beauty salon is drawn upon in helping to negotiate the balance between these competing arenas. The ambivalences of achieving an 'appropriate' appearance in these differing spheres is investigated. Their implication in the self-surveillance of the client is also discussed.\n      </p>", "Beauty pageants are an exemplar of global cultural flow, and the tensions between local and supranational production and reception of media events. This paper discusses the local history and political context of beauty pageantry in the Caribbean country of Belize. The pageants are portrayed as sites where Belizean identity is recast in a universalized language of difference and distinction. The political economy of beauty allows local production and interpretation only within a narrow semantic frame provided by the metropole.\n      </p>", "Studying the Communist revolution, scholars of China have generally assumed that the revolutionary era and pre-Cultural Revolution stage of the Communist regime were dominated by asceticism, androgynous clothing, or both. This article seeks to demonstrate that an interest in female beauty was always present in the revolutionary process. The author analyzes how revolutionaries sustained that interest by employing self-beautification practices and women's beauty politically and how social interactions reinforced the perception that female beauty was rewarding, underscoring that Communists accepted the practice of self-adornment. After examining the revolutionary aesthetics of femininity developed by women activists, the article briefly explores the legacy of female beauty in the Communist regime. In its conclusion, it urges that more attention be paid to interest in female beauty as an important part of female experience both during the revolutionary process and during the Communist regime.\n      </p>", "The Miss Galaxy beauty pageant held annually in Nuku'alofa, the capital of Tonga, is, at first glance, a show of transgendered glamour, but it is equally a display of translocality. Through the performance of an exotic otherness (through costumes, names, dances, etc.), the socially marginalized contestants claim to define the local, in ways that may oppose the received order, in which the difference between locality and nonlocality is controlled by the privileged. The juxtaposition of gender transformation and translocality in the same event reinforces their stereotypical linking in the eyes of both transgendered and mainstream Tongans. For transgendered persons, this linking provides an escape route from local dynamics of social exclusion and poverty, but it also potentially offers mainstream persons a pretext to marginalize transgendered persons from their local groundings. Privileged transgendered persons are less vulnerable to these dynamics of exclusion and use tokens of translocality to assert their social standing vis-\u00e0-vis both underprivileged transgendered persons and society at large.\n      </p>", "In this paper, I argue for a view largely favorable to the Thirder view: when Sleeping Beauty wakes up on Monday, her credence in the coin's landing heads is less than 1/2. Let's call this \"the Lesser view.\" For my argument, I (i) criticize Strict Conditionalization as the rule for changing de se credences; (ii) develop a new rule; and (iii) defend it by Gaifman's Expert Principle. Finally, I defend the Lesser view by making use of this new rule.\n      </p>"], "words": {"generally": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "global": {"number": 1, "prob":
