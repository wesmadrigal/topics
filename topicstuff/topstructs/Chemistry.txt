These media provide children with optimal conditions for nurturing their visuospatial intelligence. In chemistry and biochemistry, over the past 125 years, thinking has shifted from the logical-mathematical to the logical-visuospatial. In chemistry visuospatial thinking has never been so dominant as today. Thus in chemistry, a truly international, pictorial language has evolved. Yet, the founding and growth of chemical education as a separate discipline has resulted, albeit unintended, in an alienation of chemistry educators from these dramatic changes in chemistry. By confining themselves in their teaching of chemistry to the logical-mathematical and the verbal, teachers and chemical educators are conveying a false and abandoned conception of chemistry in the class rooms. And, they fail to address the most important developed intelligence of our young.\n      </p>", "The aim of this paper is to describe a novel modeling and simulation package, connected chemistry, and assess its impact on students' understanding of chemistry. Connected chemistry was implemented inside the NetLogo modeling environment. Its design goal is to present a variety of chemistry concepts from the perspective of \"emergent phenomena\"--that is, how macro-level patterns in chemistry result from the interactions of many molecules on a submicro-level. The connected chemistry modeling environment provides students with the opportunity to observe and explore these interactions in a simulated environment that enables them to develop a deeper understanding of chemistry concepts and processes in both the classroom and laboratory. Here, we present the conceptual foundations of instruction using connected chemistry and the results of a small study that explored its potential benefits. A three-part, 90-min interview was administered to six undergraduate science majors regarding the concept of chemical equilibrium. Several commonly reported misconceptions about chemical equilibrium arose during the interview. Prior to their interaction with connected chemistry, students relied on memorized facts to explain chemical equilibrium and rigid procedures to solve chemical equilibrium problems. Using connected chemistry students employed problemsolving techniques characterized by stronger attempts at conceptual understanding and logical reasoning.\n      </p>", "The study examined the effect of supplementing laboratory instruction with problem solving strategy and or practical skills teaching on students' attitude toward chemistry. A total of 286 senior secondary class II students (145 males and 141 females) drawn from four local government areas in Oyo township in Oyo state, Nigeria, took part in the study. A pretest-posttest nonrandomized control group in a quasi-experimental setting using a 4 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 factorial representation formed the design of the study. Data analysis was done by the use of analysis of covariance but Scheffe post hoc analysis was carried out in the case of significant main effect of the treatment and also in the occasion of significant interaction effect. Graphical illustrations were however used to further explain the interaction effects. The results revealed that the use of enhanced laboratory instructional strategy significantly improved the attitudes of students toward chemistry. The results underscore the need for secondary school chemistry teachers to adopt the use of enhanced laboratory instructional strategy in order to promote good attitude on the part of the students toward learning of chemistry.\n      </p>", "We discuss a nanoengineering approach for supramolecular chemistry and self assembly. The collective properties and biofunctionalities of molecular ensembles depend not only on individual molecular building blocks but also on organization at the molecular or nanoscopic level. Complementary to \"bottom-up\" approaches, which construct supramolecular ensembles by the design and synthesis of functionalized small molecular units or large molecular motifs, nanofabrication explores whether individual units, such as small molecular ligands, or large molecules, such as proteins, can be positioned with nanometer precision. The separation and local environment can be engineered to control subsequent intermolecular interactions. Feature sizes as small as 2 \u00d7 4 nm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (32 alkanethiol molecules) are produced. Proteins may be aligned along a 10-nm-wide line or within two-dimensional islands of desired geometry. These high-resolution engineering and imaging studies provide new and molecular-level insight into supramolecular chemistry and self-assembly processes in bioscience that are otherwise unobtainable, e.g., the influence of size, separation, orientation, and local environment of reaction sites. This nanofabrication methodology also offers a new strategy in construction of two- and three-dimensional supramolecular structures for cell, virus, and bacterial adhesion, as well as biomaterial and biodevice engineering.\n      </p>", "The link between recognition and replication is fundamental to the operation of the immune system. In recent years, modeling this process in a format of phagedisplay combinatorial libraries has afforded a powerful tool for obtaining valuable antibodies. However, the ability to readily select and isolate rare catalysts would expand the scope of library technology. A technique in which phage infection controlled the link between recognition and replication was applied to show that chemistry is a selectable process. An antibody that operated by covalent catalysis to form an acyl intermediate restored phage infectivity and allowed selection from a library in which the catalyst constituted 1 in 105 members. Three different selection approaches were examined for their convenience and generality. Incorporating these protocols together with well known affinity labels and mechanism-based inactivators should allow the procurement of a wide range of novel catalytic antibodies.\n      </p>", "Plasma processing is a standard industrial method for the modification of material surfaces and the deposition of thin films. Polyatomic ions and neutrals larger than a triatomic play a critical role in plasma-induced surface chemistry, especially in the deposition of polymeric films from fluorocarbon plasmas. In this paper, low energy CF3 + and C3F5 + ions are used to modify a polystyrene surface. Experimental and computational studies are combined to quantify the effect of the unique chemistry and structure of the incident ions on the result of ion-polymer collisions. C3F5 + ions are more effective at growing films than CF3 +, both at similar energy/atom of \u2248 6 eV/atom and similar total kinetic energies of 25 and 50 eV. The composition of the films grown experimentally also varies with both the structure and kinetic energy of the incident ion. Both C3F5 + and CF3 + should be thought of as covalently bound polyatomic precursors or fragments that can react and become incorporated within the polystyrene surface, rather than merely donating F atoms. The size and structure of the ions affect polymer film formation via differing chemical structure, reactivity, sticking probabilities, and energy transfer to the surface. The different reactivity of these two ions with the polymer surface supports the argument that larger species contribute to the deposition of polymeric films from fluorocarbon plasmas. These results indicate that complete understanding and accurate computer modeling of plasma-surface modification requires accurate measurement of the identities, number densities, and kinetic energies of higher mass ions and energetic neutrals.\n      </p>", "The basic structures for linking squares into polyhedra and networks (reticulation) are enumerated, and corresponding examples are described in which crystals were synthesized by linking paddle wheel (square) units into metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-named MOF-102 to MOF-112.\n      </p>", "Twelve derivatives of peptide-amphiphile molecules, designed to self-assemble into nanofibers, are described. The scope of amino acid selection and alkyl tail modification in the peptide-amphiphile molecules are investigated, yielding nanofibers varying in morphology, surface chemistry, and potential bioactivity. The results demonstrate the chemically versatile nature of this supramolecular system and its high potential for manufacturing nanomaterials. In addition, three different modes of self-assembly resulting in nanofibers are described, including pH control, divalent ion induction, and concentration.\n      </p>", "The learning of chemistry is described as a process analogous to the process of making chemical discoveries. Historical examples are given to show how chemists have used their insight to break out of a conceptual loop in order to advance the science. Having the insight to make the intuitive leap necessary to break a conceptual loop is as important as having the mastery of the pertinent facts. As in making chemical discoveries, learning elementary chemistry requires developing insight as well as acquiring mastery of the facts. However, current general chemistry teaching tends to teach facts first and insight later. Suggestions for improving this situation so that insight and facts are learned together are given. Finally, the nature of insight is probed more deeply and presented as a two-step process where the first step is an evaluation of the perceptions about science which are held. Once the student, teacher, or researcher has a clear evaluation of the validity of the perceptions that he or she holds, further significant progress toward understanding or scientific discovery is possible.\n      </p>", "Iron is concentrated in ferritin, a spherical protein with a capacious cavity for ferric nanominerals of &lt;4,500 Fe atoms. Global ferritin structure is very stable, resisting 6 M urea and heat (85\u00b0 C) at neutral pH. Eight pores, each formed by six helices from 3 of the 24 polypeptide subunits, restrict mineral access to reductant, protons, or chelators. Protein-directed transport of Fe and aqueous Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; chemistry (solubility &lt;latex&gt;$\\approx\\!10^{-18}\\&gt;M$&lt;/latex&gt;) drive mineralization. Ferritin pores are \"gated\" based on protein crystals and Fe chelation rates of wild-type (WT) and engineered proteins. Pore structure and gate residues, which are highly conserved, thus should be sensitive to environmental changes such as low concentrations of chaotropes. We now demonstrate that urea or guanidine (1-10 mM), far below concentrations for global unfolding, induced multiphasic rate increases in Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-bipyridyl formation similar to conservative substitutions of pore residues. Urea (1 M) or the nonconservative Leu/Pro substitution that fully unfolded pores without urea both induced monophasic rate increases in Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; chelation rates, indicating unrestricted access between mineral and reductant/chelator. The observation of low-melting ferritin subdomains by CD spectroscopy (melting midpoint 53\u00b0 C), accounting for 10% of ferritin \u03b1-helices, is unprecedented. The low-melting ferritin subdomains are pores, based on percentage helix and destabilization by either very dilute urea solutions (1 mM) or Leu/Pro substitution, which both increased Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; chelation. Biological molecules may have evolved to control gating of ferritin pores in response to cell iron need and, if mimicked by designer drugs, could impact chelation therapies in iron-overload diseases.\n      </p>", "Experts, teachers, and students took active part in a process of organic chemistry studyware development. A unique characteristic of this process was the active involvement of three different groups of people in the authoring process: science educators, chemistry teachers, and chemistry students studying towards an education certificate. The science educators the experts-advised the team on new methods of presenting the subject matter in an appealing way, using 3D computerized molecular modeling. The in-service chemistry teachers contributed from their rich field experience to constructing the studyware. This mutual development helped maintain the balance between expert requirements and expectations from students on one hand, and the actual student capabilities, as perceived by teachers through constant contact with the students, on the other. Finally, the preservice teachers--the undergraduate chemistry students-were often zealous, enthusiastic, and willing to put in the extra time and effort needed to produce quality studyware, while following the guidelines of the experts and teachers. Feedback on the qualities and shortcomings of the studyware was obtained in two cycles. The first one was done while the studyware was still under development by peers, and the second by individual target students, serving as a beta-site. This double feedback helped improve the studyware, mainly by elaborating on portions that require more detail and explanation. The paper describes the process as well as representative parts of the studyware. The combination of experts, teachers, and students in the development team seems to have the potential to yield studyware that is appropriate for effective science education in general and chemistry teaching in particular.\n      </p>", "The present study aimed to evaluate whether a chemistry laboratory course called \"Laboratory Experiments in Science Education\" based on constructivist instruction accompanied with concept mapping enhanced pre-service chemistry teachers' conceptual understanding. Data were collected from five pre-service chemistry teachers at a university in Ankara by means of a concept test and semi-structured interviews. Results showed that pre-service teachers had some alternative conceptions about chemistry topics. Moreover, using constructivist instruction accompanied with concept maps as an instructional tool was effective to promote conceptual understanding. Participants thought that concept maps were useful especially in recognizing the relation between different chemistry concepts.\n      </p>", "The recent observation [Wentworth, P., Jones, L. H., Wentworth, A. D., Zhu, X. Y., Larsen, N. A., Wilson, I. A., Xu, X., Goddard, W. A., Janda, K. D., Eschenmoser, A. &amp; Lerner, R. A. (2001) Science 293, 1806-1811] that antibodies form H2O 3 from 1O 2 plus H2O was explained in terms of the formation of the H2O 3 species that in the antibody reacts with a second H2O 3 to form H2O 2. There have been few reports of the chemistry for forming H2O 3, but recently Engdahl and Nelander [Engdahl, A. &amp; Nelander, B. (2002) Science 295, 482-483] reported that photolysis of the ozone-hydrogen peroxide complex in argon matrices leads to significant concentrations of H2O 3. We report here the chemical mechanism for this process, determined by using first-principles quantum mechanics. We show that in an argon matrix it is favorable (3.5 kcal/mol barrier) for H2O 2 and O3 to form a [(HO2)(HO3)] hydrogen-bonded complex [head-to-tail seven-membered ring (7r)]. In this complex, the barrier for forming H2O 3 plus 3O 2 is only 4.8 kcal/mol, which should be observable by means of thermal processes (not yet reported). Irradiation of the [(HO2)(HO3)-7r] complex should break the HO-OO bond of the HO3 moiety, eliminating 3O 2 and leading to [(HO2)(HO)]. This [(HO2)(HO)] confined in the matrix cage is expected to rearrange to also form H2O 3 (observed experimentally). We show that these two processes can be distinguished isotopically. These results (including the predicted vibrational frequencies) suggest strategies for synthesizing H2O 3 and characterizing its chemistry. We suggest that the [(HO2)(HO3)-7r] complex and H2O 3 are involved in biological, atmospheric, and environmental oxidative processes.\n      </p>", "The O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-reaction chemistry of 1:1 mixtures of &lt;latex&gt;$(F_8)Fe^{II}\\&gt;(1;\\&gt;F_8 = tetrakis(2, \\!6\\!-\\!diflurorophenyl)porphyrinate)$&lt;/latex&gt; and &lt;latex&gt;$\\lbrack(L^{Me_2N})Cu^I\\rbrack^+\\&gt;(2;\\&gt;L^{Me_2N} = N, \\!N\\!-\\!bis\\lbrace2\\!-\\!\\lbrack2\\!-\\!(N^\\prime, \\!N^\\prime\\!-\\!4\\!-\\!dimethylamino)pyridyl\\rbrack ethyl\\rbrace methylamine)$&lt;/latex&gt; is described, to model aspects of the chemistry occurring in cytochrome c oxidase.

Understanding the time scale as well as the chemical and spatial patterns of perturbations to trace gases is needed to evaluate possible environmental damage (e.g. stratospheric ozone depletion or climate change) caused by anthropogenic emissions. This paper reviews lessons learned from treating global atmospheric chemistry as a linearized system and analysing it in terms of eigenvalues. The results give insight into how emissions of one trace species cause perturbations to another and how transport and chemistry can alter the time scale of the overall perturbation. Further, the eigenvectors describe the fundamental chemical modes, or patterns, of the atmosphere's chemical response to perturbations.\n      </p>", "A new methodology for the construction of combinatorial libraries is described. The approach, termed dendrimer-supported combinatorial chemistry (DCC), centers on the use of dendrimers as soluble supports. Salient features of DCC include solution phase chemistry, homogeneous purification, routine characterization of intermediates, and high support loadings. To demonstrate the feasibility of DCC, single compounds and a small combinatorial library were prepared via the Fischer indole synthesis. Excellent product yields and purities were obtained, and dendrimer-protected intermediates could be routinely analyzed by $^{1}$H and $^{13}$C NMR and by mass spectrometry. The results indicate that DCC is a general and efficient strategy for the generation of combinatorial libraries.\n      </p>", "We present a novel user-orientated approach to provenance capture and representation for in silico experiments, contrasted against the more systems-orientated approaches that have been typical within the e-Science domain. In our approach, we seek to capture the scientist's reasoning in the form of annotations as an experiment evolves, while using the scientist's terminology in the representation of process provenance. Our userorientated approach is applied in a case study within the atmospheric chemistry domain: we consider the design, development and evaluation of an electronic laboratory notebook, a provenance capture and storage tool, for iterative model development.\n      </p>", "Hellbenders are large aquatic salamanders. The Ozark subspecies is in decline through its range. This is the first comprehensive report on hematologic and serum chemistry for both Ozark and eastern hellbenders. Blood samples were analyzed for 25 parameters in 33 Ozark hellbenders from the North Fork of White River and the Eleven Point River in Missouri and 45 eastern hellbenders from the Davidson River-Looking Glass Creek in North Carolina and the Cooper Creek in Georgia. Each river was considered a population. In general, the majority of the blood parameters analyzed were similar between populations and subspecies for same-sex individuals, although a few significant differences were identified. The baseline data we acquired are important for future monitoring of hellbender populations, particularly as Ozark hellbender populations continue to age.\n      </p>", "This report describes a study which explores, from the out-of-school student viewpoint, why students are not studying chemistry anymore. In a 2-day stay at a research institution three groups of graduating high school students from different schools, together with their chemistry teacher, were confronted hands-on with molecular modeling in industry and in university. Each of these volunteer students had agreed to write an essay on \"School Chemistry Vs. Chemistry in Research.\" These essays were evaluated together by the students, the teacher, and the researcher in a meeting at their school. The opinion of the students show that school chemistry does not convey today's chemistry in research and in industry. At the computer screen the students demonstrated their skill in performing molecular modeling experiments. Moreover, at the computer screen, chemistry was fun and easier to understand. Now we begin to see the solution: our students are also our teachers.\n      </p>", "During the on-line conference, \"Applications of Technology in Teaching Chemistry,\" June 14-August 20, 1993, the topic \"What Chemists (or Chemistry Students) Need to Know About Computing\" generated considerable discussion.

The key points developed here include: the computer as a tool for learning study, research, and communication; hardware, software, computing concepts and other teaching concerns; and the appropriate place for chemistry computer usage instruction. Some suggestions for access, implementation, and extent of implementation of useful skills for the chemist and chemistry student are given in the paper.

We have developed a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis method to investigate the effect of a strand gap on DNA structure. We generate a library of gapped DNA molecules by treating a DNA restriction fragment with the hydroxyl radical, generated by the reaction of Fe(II) EDTA with hydrogen peroxide. The DNA molecule studied contains a fixed bend produced by a set of phased adenine tracts. The A-tract bend serves as a reference bend for investigating the conformational nature of a strand gap. In the first electrophoretic dimension, a bent DNA molecule that has been treated with the hydroxyl radical is electrophoresed on a native gel. Smearing of the band on the native gel indicates that the library of gapped DNA molecules contains a variety of DNA conformations. In the second electrophoretic dimension, gapped DNA molecules having different native gel mobilities are electrophoresed on separate lanes of a denaturing gel to reveal how each strand gap affects the native gel mobility (and thus shape) of the DNA. Our results demonstrate that a single-nucleoside gap in a DNA duplex leads to an anisotropic, directional bend in the DNA helix axis. The implications of our findings for recognition of this lesion by DNA repair proteins are discussed.\n      </p>", "Porphyrins and fullerenes are spontaneously attracted to each other. This supramolecular recognition element can be exploited to produce ordered arrays of interleaved porphyrins and fullerenes.

The Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions connect the pyridylporphyrins in infinite sheets with an interlayer spacing of 12.1 \u00c5. The fullerenes are intercalated between these layers, acting as pillars. The 6:6 ring juncture bonds of C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; are centered over the porphyrins, bringing the layers into strict tetragonal register. This arranagement identifies the fullerene-porphyrin interaction as a structure-defining element.

However, the Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-binding site(s) on albumin is ill-defined. We have analyzed the 18 x-ray crystal structures of human albumin in the PDB and identified a potential five-coordinate Zn site at the interface of domains I and II consisting of N ligands from His-67 and His-247 and O ligands from Asn-99, Asp-249, and H&lt;sub&gt;2O&lt;/sub&gt;, which are the same amino acid ligands as those in the zinc enzymes calcineurin, endonucleotidase, and purple acid phosphatase. The site is preformed in unliganded apo-albumin and highly conserved in mammalian albumins. We have used &lt;sup&gt;111&lt;/sup&gt;Cd NMR as a probe for Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; binding to recombinant human albumin. We show that His-67 \u2192 Ala (His67Ala) mutation strongly perturbs Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; binding, whereas the mutations Cys34Ala, or His39Leu and Tyr84Phe (residues which may H-bond to Cys-34) have no effect. Weak Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; binding to the fifth coordination site of Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; was demonstrated. Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; binding was dramatically affected by high fatty acid loading of albumin. Analysis of the x-ray structures suggests that fatty acid binding to site 2 triggers a spring-lock mechanism, which disengages the upper (His-67/Asn-99) and lower (His-247/Asp-249) halves of the metal site. These findings provide a possible mechanism whereby fatty acids (and perhaps other small molecules) could influence the transport and delivery of zinc in blood.\n      </p>", "We examined changes in stream chemistry following the removal of a 2-m-high dam on Manatawny Creek in southeastern Pennsylvania. Our primary objective was to determine the effect of small dam removal on the concentrations and forms of C, N, and P. Dissolved and particulate constituent concentrations were monitored at sites upstream and downstream of the dam and impoundment. Seasonal changes in alkalinity and N and P concentrations were observed before and after dam removal. However, the proportions of $NO_{3}^{-} + NO_{2}^-$ , NH4 +, and dissolved organic N (DON), and soluble reactive P (SRP) and dissolved organic P (DOP) in the total dissolved pools of N and P did not change seasonally. The dam and dam removal did not influence C, N, or P concentrations and forms (except for NH4 +) in this stream. The lack of significant changes probably was a result of the short hydraulic residence time (&lt;1.5 h at base flow), infrequent temperature stratification, and potential C limitation of bacterial activity in the small impoundment. Our results suggest that alterations in N and P concentrations and forms following dam removal may be site-specific. The characteristics of the dam, watershed, and impoundment (e.g., the amount of wetted streambed, hydraulic residence time, and organic enrichment of sediment and water) probably determine the influence of dam removal on stream water chemistry.\n      </p>", "Seventeen blood chemistry parameters were measured in macaws, Amazon parrots, cockatoos, African grey parrots and budgerigars using a Kodak Ektachem system.

The inclusion complex of MV dication in CB[7] is stable thermodynamically and kinetically. The electrochemical study reveals that unlike \u03b2-cyclodextrin, CB[7] prefers the charged species, MV dication (MV&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), and cation radical (MV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;sup&gt;\u00b7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) to the fully reduced neutral (MV&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; species as guests. Dimerization of MV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;sup&gt;\u00b7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is suppressed effectively by forming a stable complex with CB[7] in aqueous solution as confirmed by spectroelectrochemical experiments.

The structured silane monolayers on silicon oxide substrates were fabricated by a combination of liquid- and gas-phase deposition of different trialkoxysilanes with a photolithographic patterning technique. By using this method various types of surface functionalizations such as regions with amino functions next to areas of the bare silica surface or positively charged regions of a quaternary ammonium silane surrounded by a hydrophobic octadecylsilane film could be obtained. Furthermore, a triethoxysilane with a photoprotected amino group was synthesized, which allowed direct photopatterning after monolayer preparation, leading to free NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; groups at the irradiated regions. The different silane monolayer patterns were used to study the surface assembly behavior of carboxylated methacrylate particles by optical and scanning electron microscopy. In dependence of the assembly conditions (different surface functionalizations, pH, and drying conditions), a selective preference of the particles for a specific surface type versus others was found. Site-specific colloid adsorption could be observed also on the photosensitive silane layers after local deprotection with light. From the photosensitive silane and positively charged ammonium silane, molecularly mixed monolayers were prepared, which allowed particle adsorption and photoactivation within the same monolayer as shown by fluorescence labeling.\n      </p>", "A designed lanthanide-binding chimeric peptide based on the strikingly similar geometries of the EF-hand and helix-turn-helix (HTH) motifs was investigated by NMR and CD spectroscopy and found to retain the same overall solution structure of the parental motifs. CD spectroscopy showed that the 33-mer peptide P3W folds on binding lanthanides, with an increase in \u03b1-helicity from 20% in the absence of metal to 38% and 35% in the presence of excess Eu(III) and La(III) ions, respectively. The conditional binding affinities of P3W for La(III) (5.9 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5M) and for Eu(III) (6.2 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5M) (pH 7.8, 5 mM Tris) were determined by tryptophan fluorescence titration. The La(III) complex of peptide P3, which differs from P3W by only one Trp-to-His substitution, has much less signal dispersion in the proton NMR spectra than LaP3W, indicating that the Trp residue is a critical hydrophobic anchor for maintaining a well-folded helix-turn-helix structure. A chemical-shift index analysis indicates the metallopeptide has a helix-loop-helix secondary structure. A structure calculated by using nuclear Overhauser effect and other NMR constraints reveals that P3W not only has a tightly folded metal-binding loop but also retains the \u03b1-\u03b1 corner supersecondary structure of the parental motifs. Although the solution structure is undefined at both the N and C termini, the NMR structure confirms the successful incorporation of a metal-binding loop into a HTH sequence.\n      </p>", "Staphylococcus aureus CzrA and Mycobacterium tuberculosis NmtR are homologous zinc/cobalt-responsive and nickel/cobalt-responsive transcriptional repressors in vivo, respectively, and members of the ArsR/SmtB superfamily of prokaryotic metal sensor proteins. We show here that Zn(II) is the most potent negative allosteric regulator of czr operator/promoter binding in vitro with the trend Zn(II)&gt;Co(II)\u226bNi(II), whereas the opposite holds for the binding of NmtR to the nmt operator/promoter, Ni(II)&gt;Co(II)&gt;Zn(II). Characterization of the metal coordination complexes of CzrA and NmtR by UV/visible and x-ray absorption spectroscopies reveals that metals that form four-coordinate tetrahedral complexes with CzrA [Zn(II) and Co(II)] are potent regulators of DNA binding, whereas metals that form five- or six-coordinate complexes with NmtR [Ni(II) and Co(II)] are the strongest allosteric regulators in this system. Strikingly, the Zn(II) coordination complexes of CzrA and NmtR cannot be distinguished from one another by x-ray absorption spectroscopy, with the best fit a His-3-carboxylate complex in both cases. Inspection of the primary structures of CzrA and NmtR, coupled with previous functional data, suggests that three conserved His and one Asp from the C-terminal \u03b15 helix donate ligands to create a four-coordinate complex in both CzrA and NmtR, with NmtR uniquely capable of expanding its coordination number in the Ni(II) and Co(II) complexes by recruiting additional His ligands from a C-terminal extension of the \u03b15 helix.\n      </p>", "The African dwarf crocodile, Osteolaemus tetraspis (Crocodilidae, Reptilia), possesses a pair of skin glands, the paracloacal glands, the secretion of which is thought to be used to mark nest sites or attract mates. Ten aromatic steroidal esters were isolated from this secretion and characterized on the basis of NMR spectroscopic investigations, electrospray ionization-MS analyses, and chemical degradation. These esters, which account for more than 90% of the paracloacal glandular secretion, are derived from either cholesterol or cholestanol, esterified with a C-20 or C-22 acid closely related to dianeackerone, the only significant volatile compound found in this secretion.\n      </p>", "We present a DNA-containing polymeric nanocontainer using the self-assembled superstructure of amphiphilic block copolymers in aqueous solutions. To demonstrate that DNA translocation is possible across a completely synthetic block copolymer membrane, we have used a phage transfection strategy as a DNA-transfer model system. For this purpose the bacterial channel forming protein LamB was reconstituted in ABA-triblock copolymer vesicles. The outer membrane protein LamB is a specific transporter for maltodextrins but also serves as a receptor for \u03bb phage to trigger the ejection of \u03bb phage DNA. We demonstrate that the functionality of the LamB protein is fully preserved despite the artificial surrounding. This leads to a type of polymeric vehicle for DNA that could be useful for gene therapy.\n      </p>", "The major volatile component in the paracloacal glandular secretion of the adult African dwarf crocodile (Osteolaemus tetraspis) was isolated and characterized as a 19-carbon aromatic ketone, dianeackerone (3,7-diethyl-9-phenyl-2-nonanone). This ketone is absent from the secretion of immatures. Careful examination of dianeackerone samples isolated from individual adults revealed that this ketone occurs as both the (3S, 7S) and (3S, 7R) stereoisomers, with different individuals presenting strikingly different ratios of the isomeric forms. Our initial suspicion that the stereoisomeric dianeackerones might be indicators of gender proved untenable, leaving the role of these glandular constituents a challenge for future study.\n      </p>", "Our originally designed dansylamidoethylcyclen 4 as a biomimetic Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-selective fluorophore has been demonstrated to be a good detector of the apoptosis (induced by an anticancer agent, etoposide, and H&lt;sub&gt;2O&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in cancer cells such as HeLa and HL60 cells. The macrocyclic Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ligand 4 (mostly as a deprotonated form) is cell-permeable to show weak fluorescence (emission at 550 nm), which forms a strong fluorescent 1:1 Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; complex 5 (emission at 530 nm) when Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is incorporated into the cells by a zinc(II) ionophore pyrithione. Thus formed, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; complex 5 is cell-impermeable and remains intact over a few hours. When apoptosis in HeLa or HL60 cells is artificially induced, 4 selectively and strongly stains apoptotic cells only at early stages, which was verified by using the conventional apoptosis detection probe annexin V-Cy3. Detection of the apoptotic cells by 4 was perhaps due to significantly increased free Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; flux at early stages of apoptosis. Apoptotic detection by 4 has been compared with a presently available Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; fluorophore, Zinquin 1. We present that 4 has advantages in detection of apoptosis over annexin V-Cy3 and Zinquin 1.\n      </p>", "The bifunctional CO dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase (CODH/ACS) plays a central role in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway of autotrophic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation. A recent structure of the Moorella thermoacetica enzyme revealed that the ACS active site contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster bridged to a binuclear Cu-Ni site. Here, biochemical and x-ray absorption spectroscopic (XAS) evidence is presented that the copper ion at the M. thermoacetica ACS active site is essential. Depletion of copper correlates with reduction in ACS activity and in intensity of the \"NiFeC\" EPR signal without affecting either the activity or the EPR spectroscopic properties associated with CODH. In contrast, Zn content is negatively correlated with ACS activity without any apparent relationship to CODH activity. Cu is also found in the methanogenic CODH/ACS from Methanosarcina thermophila. XAS studies are consistent with a distorted Cu(I)-S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; site in the fully active enzyme in solution. Cu extended x-ray absorption fine structure analysis indicates an average Cu-S bond length of 2.25 \u00c5 and a metal neighbor at 2.65 \u00c5, consistent with the Cu-Ni distance observed in the crystal structure. XAS experiments in the presence of seleno-CoA reveal a Cu-S&lt;sub&gt;3Se&lt;/sub&gt; environment with a 2.4-\u00c5 Se-Cu bond, strongly implicating a Cu-SCoA intermediate in the mechanism of acetyl-CoA synthesis. These results indicate an essential and functional role for copper in the CODH/ACS from acetogenic and methanogenic organisms.\n      </p>", "A gradual transition from electrical to optical networks is accompanying the rapid progress of telecommunication technology. The urge for enhanced transmission capacity and speed is dictating this trend. In fact, large volumes of data encoded on optical signals can be transported rapidly over long distances. Their propagation along specific routes across a communication network is ensured by a combination of optical fibers and optoelectronic switches. It is becoming apparent, however, that the interplay between the routing electrical stimulations and the traveling optical signals will not be able to support the terabit-per-second capacities that will be needed in the near future. Electrical inputs cannot handle the immense parallelism potentially possible with optical signals. Operating principles to control optical signals with optical signals must be developed. Molecular and supramolecular switches are promising candidates for the realization of innovative materials for information technology. Binary digits can be encoded in their chemical, electrical, or optical inputs and outputs to execute specific logic functions. We have developed a simple strategy to gate optical signals with optical signals by using a photoactive molecular switch. We have demonstrated that NAND, NOR, and NOT operations can be implemented exclusively with optical inputs and optical outputs coupling from one to three switching elements. Our remarkably simple approach to all-optical switching might lead to the development of a new generation of devices for digital processing and communication technology.\n      </p>", "Four ionic fullerene derivatives, which are relatively soluble in polar solvents, are shown to organize into morphologically different nanoscale structures. Spheres, nanorods, and nanotubules form in water depending on the side chain appendage of the fullerene spheroid. Images at different nanoscale structures were obtained via transmission electron microscopy. Also, computer simulations were used for investigating the relative spatial arrangements. The efficient method to fabricate almost perfect and uniformly shaped nanotubular crystals, which order spontaneously by self-assembly, opens the way to the possibility of exploiting the fullerene properties at the nanometer scale.\n      </p>", "A rhodium(III) complex, rac-[ Rh(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;2phzi&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (bpy, 2, 2&lt;sup&gt;\u2032&lt;/sup&gt;-bipyridine; phzi, benzo[a]phenazine-5,6-quinone diimine) has been designed as a sterically demanding intercalator targeted to destabilized mismatched sites in double-helical DNA. The complex is readily synthesized by condensation of the phenazine quinone with the corresponding diammine complex. Upon photoactivation, the complex promotes direct strand scission at single-base mismatch sites within the DNA duplex. As with the parent mismatch-specific reagent, [ Rh(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(chrysi)]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; [chrysene-5,6-quinone diimine (chrysi)], mismatch selectivity depends on the helix destabilization associated with mispairing. Unlike the parent chrysi complex, the phzi analogue binds and cleaves with high affinity and efficiency. The specific binding constants for CA, CC, and CT mismatches within a 31-mer oligonucleotide duplex are 0.3, 1, and &lt;latex&gt;$6 \\times 10^7\\&gt;M^{-1}$&lt;/latex&gt;, respectively; site-specific photocleavage is evident at nanomolar concentrations. Moreover, the specificity, defined as the ratio in binding affinities for mispaired vs. well paired sites, is maintained. The increase in affinity is attributed to greater stability in the mismatched site associated with stacking by the heterocyclic aromatic ligand. The high-affinity complex is also applied in the differential cleavage of DNA obtained from cell lines deficient in mismatch repair vs. those proficient in mismatch repair. Agreement is found between photocleavage by the mismatch-specific probes and deficiency in mismatch repair. This mismatch-specific targeting, therefore, offers a potential strategy for new chemotherapeutic design.\n      </p>", "The simple organometallic, (\u03bc-S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, serves as a precursor to synthetic analogues of the chemically rudimentary iron-only hydrogenase enzyme active site. The fundamental properties of the (\u03bc-SCH&lt;sub&gt;2CH&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2CH&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2S&lt;/sub&gt;)[ Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; compound, including structural mobility and regioselectivity in cyanide/carbon monoxide substitution reactions, relate to the enzyme active site in the form of transition-state structures along reaction paths rather than ground-state structures. Even in the absence of protein-based active-site organization, the ground-state structural model complexes are shown to serve as hydrogenase enzyme reaction models, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production, with the input of photo- or electrochemical energy, respectively.\n      </p>", "The nutritional dietary supplement chromium picolinate, [Cr(pic)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;], has gained much notoriety as a safe supplement that supposedly promotes fat loss and muscle enhancement in humans. Thus, a significant industry has materialized around the incorporation of [Cr(pic)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] in many sports foods and drinks and a variety of weight loss products. However, in vitro studies have suggested that low levels of [Cr(pic)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] in the presence of biological reducing agents can catalytically generate reactive oxygen species, and recent in vivo studies have detected oxidative damage in rats receiving the supplement. The potential deleterious in vivo effects of this activity were examined by using Drosophila melanogaster. [Cr(pic)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;], but not CrCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, at levels of 260 \u03bcg Cr/kg food or less were found to lower the success rate of pupation and eclosion and to arrest development of pupae in a concentration dependent fashion. X-linked lethal analysis indicates that the supplement greatly enhances the rate of appearance of lethal mutations and dominant female sterility.\n      </p>", "Chemical cross-linking is a potentially useful technique for probing the architecture of multiprotein complexes. However, analyses using typical bifunctional cross-linkers often suffer from poor yields, and large-scale modification of nucleophilic side chains can result in artifactual results attributable to structural destabilization. We report here the de novo design and development of a type of protein cross-linking reaction that uses a photogenerated oxidant to mediate rapid and efficient cross-linking of associated proteins. The process involves brief photolysis of tris-bipyridylruthenium(II) dication with visible light in the presence of the electron acceptor ammonium persulfate and the proteins of interest. Very high yields of cross-linked products can be obtained with irradiation times of &lt;1 second. This chemistry obviates many of the problems associated with standard cross-linking reagents.\n      </p>", "The synthesis and characterization of a new threefold symmetric hemilabile phosphino-alkylthioether ligand are described. This ligand can be used in combination with Rh(I) and Ir(I) precursor complexes to prepare 40-membered macrocyles with threefold symmetry via the Weak-Link Approach. Synthesis and characterization of two such structures are reported along with a single crystal x-ray diffraction analysis of one of the key intermediates in the case of Rh(I). This is a demonstration of the viability of the Weak-Link Approach for preparing structures other than bimetallic macrocycles and suggests that it could be generalized for a wide range of higher symmetry structures through appropriate hemilabile ligand design.\n      </p>", "Treatment of gold(I) halide complexes of the type L-Au-X [where L = PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, PEt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with X = Cl, Br, I, or L = 2,6-(MeO)&lt;sub&gt;2C&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;6H&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3PPh&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with X = Cl] with AgSbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; in the molar ratio 2:1 in dichloromethane/tetrahydrofuran at -78\u00b0C affords high yields of di[gold(I)]halonium salts of the formula &lt;tex-math&gt;$\\lbrace X[Au(PR_3)]_2\\rbrace^+\\,\\,SbF_6^-$&lt;/tex-math&gt; (2-8). A determination of the crystal structures of the four triarylphosphine complexes (2-4, 8) revealed the presence of novel tetranuclear dications with a highly symmetrical structure (point group S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) that arises from self-assembly of the dinuclear monocations through a set of four equivalent aurophilic Au-Au interactions. A comparison with two reference structures of corresponding chloronium perchlorate and bromonium tetrafluoroborate salts with monomeric, dinuclear cations shows that the geometry of the latter is greatly altered on dimerization to optimize the interactions between the closed-shell metal centers (Au: 5d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;). Weak metallophilic bonding clearly becomes significant only in crystal lattices where anions with a larger ionic radius (SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; vs. BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-,&lt;/sup&gt; ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) reduce the otherwise dominant role of strong interionic Coulomb forces. The results indicate that aurophilic bonding is indeed an ubiquitous, quite dependable mode of intermetallic interactions provided that the right environment is chosen to allow the weak forces to become operative.\n      </p>", "A series of podands based on two or three hydrogen bonding \"arms\" situated in mutually ortho, meta, or para relationships about an aryl core have been prepared, and their affinities for simple inorganic anions were measured. Of the two-arm hosts the meta compound and to a lesser extent the ortho host exhibit a cooperative anion binding effect. The two arms function essentially independently in the para derivative. The mutually meta three-arm host shows dramatically enhanced cooperative binding. Conformational changes within the meta two-arm host result in significantly enhanced electrochemical anion sensing compared with the more conformationally rigid three-arm host.\n      </p>", "Two thread-shaped cations, pyridinium nicotinamide and imidazolium, as their chloride and hexafluorophosphate salts, were studied with regards to complexation with hydrogen-bond-donating acyclic and macrocyclic ligands. In the latter case, the cations form pseudorotaxanes templated by the chloride anion but not hexafluorophosphate. This formation is a function of the coupling of ion-pairing between the cation and chloride anion and subsequent recognition of the anion by the macrocyclic diamide, which provides the driving force for interpenetration. We propose that this anion template principle is a general method for the construction of pseudorotaxanes and could be applied to other cationic threads, anions, and macrocyclic species.\n      </p>", "The synthesis and characterization of two cytosine-substituted calix[4]pyrrole conjugates, bearing the appended cytosine attached at either a \u03b2- or meso-pyrrolic position, is described. These systems were tested as nucleotide-selective carriers and as active components of nucleotide-sensing ion-selective electrodes at pH 6.6. Studies of carrier selectivity were made using a Pressman-type model membrane system consisting of an initial pH 6.0 aqueous phase, an intervening dichloromethane barrier containing the calix[4]pyrrole conjugate, and a receiving basic aqueous phase. Good selectivity for the Watson-Crick complementary nucleotide, 5\u2032-guanosine monophosphate (5\u2032-GMP), was seen in the case of the meso-linked conjugate with the relative rates of through-membrane transport being 7.7:4.1:1 for 5\u2032-GMP, 5\u2032-AMP, and 5\u2032-CMP, respectively. By contrast, the \u03b2-substituted conjugate, while showing a selectivity for 5\u2032-GMP that was enhanced relative to unsubstituted calix[4]pyrrole, was found to transport 5\u2032-CMP roughly 4.5 times more quickly than 5\u2032-GMP. Higher selectivities were also found for 5\u2032-CMP when both the \u03b2- and meso-substituted conjugates were incorporated into polyvinyl chloride membranes and tested as ion selective electrodes at pH 6.6, whereas near-equal selectivities were observed for 5\u2032-CMP and 5\u2032-GMP in the case of unsubstituted calix[4]pyrroles. These seemingly disparate results are consistent with a picture wherein the meso-substituted cytosine calix[4]pyrrole conjugate, but not its \u03b2-linked congener, is capable of acting as a ditopic receptor, binding concurrently both the phosphate anion and nucleobase portions of 5\u2032-GMP to the calixpyrrole core and cytosine \"tails\" of the molecule, respectively, with the effect of this binding being most apparent under the conditions of the transport experiments.\n      </p>", "Manipulation of molecular crystals formed from self-organization is one of the important methods to develop the new molecular functional materials. In particular, we look upon mutual cohesive interactions of hydrogen bonding and metal coordination as one useful tool to construct the preprogramming superstructures. In this study, five controlled superstructures of a one-dimensional linear chain-a zigzag ribbon, right-handed and left-handed helices, and a two-dimensional honeycomb sheet-are newly created by using the neutral metal complexes with some 2,2\u2032-biimidazolate mono-anions.\n      </p>", "Host molecules with U-shaped receptor cavities have been derivatized at their convex side with two n-hydrocarbon tails (1), two first-generation (2), and two second-generation (3) monodendritic hydrocarbon tails. Although hosts 1 and 2 display plastic-crystalline behavior, evidence suggests that host 3 forms a cubic liquid-crystalline phase. In this phase, molecules of 3 are arranged in spherical supramacromolecular assemblies, in which the receptor cavities are situated in the core and the hydrocarbon tails at the periphery. The 1:1 host-guest complex of 3 with methyl 3,5-dihydroxybenzoate forms a similar liquid-crystalline phase, with the guest included in the core of the assemblies.\n      </p>", "Iron concentrations in the ocean are low enough to limit the growth of marine microorganisms, which raises questions about the molecular mechanisms these organisms use to acquire iron. Marine bacteria have been shown to produce siderophores to facilitate iron(III) uptake. We describe the structures of a suite of amphiphilic siderophores, named the amphibactins, which are produced by a nearshore isolate, \u03b3 Proteobacterium, Vibrio sp. R-10. Each amphibactin has the same Tris-hydroxamate-containing peptidic headgroup composed of three ornithine residues and one serine residue but differs in the acyl appendage, which ranges from C-14 to C-18 and varies in the degree of saturation and hydroxylation. Although amphiphilic siderophores are relatively rare, cell-associated amphiphilic siderophores are even less common. We find that the amphibactins are cell-associated siderophores. As a result of the variation in the nature of the fatty acid appendage and the cellular location of the amphibactins, the membrane partitioning of these siderophores was investigated. The physiological mixture of amphibactins had a range of membrane affinities (3.8 \u00d7 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to &lt;latex&gt;$8.3 \\times 10^2\\&gt;M^{-1}$&lt;/latex&gt;) that are larger overall than other amphiphilic siderophores, likely accounting for their cell association. This cell association is likely an important defense against siderophore diffusion in the oceanic environment. The phylogenetic affiliation of Vibrio sp. R-10 is discussed, as well as the observed predominance of amphiphilic siderophores produced by marine bacteria in contrast to those produced by terrestrial bacteria.\n      </p>", "The enclosure of functional entities within a protective boundary is an essential feature of biological systems. On a molecular scale, free-standing capsules with an internal volume sufficiently large to house molecular species have been synthesized and studied for more than a decade. These capsules have been prepared by either covalent synthesis or self-assembly, and the internal volumes have ranged from 200 to 1,500 \u00c5&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Although biological systems possess a remarkable degree of order within the protective boundaries, to date only steric constraints have been used to order the guests within molecular capsules. In this article we describe the synthesis and characterization of hexameric molecular capsules held together by hydrogen bonding. These capsules possess internal order of the guests brought about by hydrogen bond donors within, but not used by, the framework of the capsule. The basic building blocks of the hexameric capsules are tetrameric macrocycles related to resorcin[4]arenes and pyrogallol[4]arenes. The former contain four 1,3-dihydroxybenzene rings bridged together by -CHR- units, whereas the latter contain four 1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene rings bridged together. We now report the synthesis of related mixed macrocycles, and the main focus is on the macrocycle composed of three 1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene rings and one 1,3-dihydroxybenzene ring bridged together. The mixed macrocycles self-assemble from a mixture of closely related compounds to form the hexameric capsule with internally ordered guests.\n      </p>", "Molecular \"nanowire\" structures composed of the charge transfer complex of a bis-tetrathiafulvalene substituted macrocycle and tetrafluorotetracyanoquinodimethane were constructed on mica substrates by employing the Langmuir-Blodgett technique. The nanowires transferred from a dilute aqueous potassium chloride subphase had typical dimensions of 2.5 nm \u00d7 50 nm \u00d7 1 \u00b5m. The nanowires are oriented to specific directions, corresponding to the directions of the potassium-ion array on the mica surface having sixfold symmetry. Such correlation between the nanowires and the substrate surface was also observed when a dilute aqueous rubidium chloride subphase was used. On the other hand, the correlation completely disappeared when the subphase contained divalent cations, indicating that the molecular nanowires orient by recognizing the monocation array on the mica surface. The nanowires formed by the vertical dipping method coexist with the monolayers. Only nanowire structures are, however, observed when we apply the horizontal lifting method. Based on the crystal structure of a related complex, a possible structure of the nanowires is presented. The conductivity of the nanowires was estimated to be of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; S\u00b7cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. The nanowires formed specific (regular) structures such as T-shape junctions, suggesting their use in construction of future molecular nanoscale devices.\n      </p>", "Efficient binding of biomacromolecular surfaces by synthetic systems requires the effective presentation of complementary elements over large surface areas. We demonstrate here the use of mixed monolayer protected gold clusters (MMPCs) as scaffolds for the binding and inhibition of chymotrypsin. In these studies anionically functionalized amphiphilic MMPCs were shown to inhibit chymotrypsin through a two-stage mechanism featuring fast reversible inhibition followed by a slower irreversible process. This interaction is very efficient, with a K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;app&lt;/sup&gt; = 10.4 \u00b1 1.3 nM. The MMPC-protein complex was characterized by CD, demonstrating an almost complete denaturation of the enzyme over time. Dynamic light scattering studies confirm that inhibition proceeds without substantial MMPC aggregation. The electrostatic nature of the engineered interactions provides a level of selectivity: little or no inhibition of function was observed with elastase, \u03b2-galactosidase, or cellular retinoic acid binding protein.\n      </p>", "Although the presence of an exogenous anion is a requirement for tight Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; binding by the bacterial (Neisseria) transferrin nFbp, the identity of the exogenous anion is not specific in vitro. nFbp was reconstituted as a stable iron containing protein by using a number of different exogenous anions [arsenate, citrate, nitrilotriacetate, pyrophosphate, and oxalate (symbolized by X)] in addition to phosphate, predominantly present in the recombinant form of the protein. Spectroscopic characterization of the Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;/anion interaction in the reconstituted protein was accomplished by UV-visible and EPR spectroscopies. The affinity of the protein for Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is anion dependent, as evidenced by the effective Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; binding constants (K&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;\u2032&lt;/sup&gt;) observed, which range from &lt;latex&gt;$1 \\times 10^{17}\\&gt;M^{-1}$&lt;/latex&gt; to &lt;latex&gt;$4 \\times 10^{18}\\&gt;M^{-1}$&lt;/latex&gt; at pH 6.5 and 20\u00b0 C. The redox potentials for Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;nFbpX/Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;nFbpX reduction are also found to depend on the identity of the synergistic anion required for Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; sequestration. Facile exchange of exogenous anions (Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;nFbpX + X&lt;sup&gt;\u2032&lt;/sup&gt; \u2192 Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;nFbpX&lt;sup&gt;\u2032&lt;/sup&gt; + X) is established and provides a pathway for environmental modulation of the iron chelation and redox characteristics of nFbp. The affinity of the iron loaded protein for exogenous anion binding at pH 6.5 was found to decrease in the order phosphate &gt; arsenate ~ pyrophosphate &gt; nitrilotriacetate &gt; citrate ~ oxalate \u226b carbonate. Anion influence on the iron primary coordination sphere through iron binding and redox potential modulation may have in vivo application as a mechanism for periplasmic control of iron delivery to the cytosol.\n      </p>", "A synthetic supramolecular complex has been adapted to quantify cation-\u03c0 interactions in chloroform by using chemical double-mutant cycles. The interaction of a pyridinium cation with the \u03c0-face of an aromatic ring is found to be very sensitive to the \u03c0-electron density. Electron-donating substituents lead to a strong attractive interaction (-8 kJ/mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), but electron-withdrawing groups lead to a repulsive interaction (+2 kJ/mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;).\n      </p>", "This paper introduces a biomimetic strategy for the fabrication of asymmetrical, three-dimensional electronic devices modeled on the folding of a chain of polypeptide structural motifs into a globular protein. Millimeter-size polyhedra-patterned with logic devices, wires, and solder dots-were connected in a linear string by using flexible wire. On self-assembly, the string folded spontaneously into two domains: one functioned as a ring oscillator, and the other one as a shift register. This example demonstrates that biomimetic principles of design and self-organization can be applied to generate multifunctional electronic systems of complex, three-dimensional architecture.\n      </p>", "Diiron and dimanganese proteins catalyze a wide range of hydrolytic and oxygen-dependent reactions. To probe the mechanisms by which individual members of this class of proteins are able to catalyze such a wide range of reactions, we have prepared a model four-helix bundle with a diiron site located near the center of the bundle. The four-helix bundle is constructed by the noncovalent self-assembly of three different chains (A&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, and B) that self-assemble into the desired heterotetramer when mixed in a 1:1:2 molar ratio. On addition of ferrous ions and oxygen, the protein forms a complex with a UV-visible spectrum closely resembling that of peroxo-bridged diferric species in natural proteins and model compounds. By combining a small collection of n variants of these peptides, it should now be possible to prepare an n&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; member library, which will allow systematic exploration of the features giving rise to the catalytic properties of this class of proteins.\n      </p>", "Gas-phase photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory have been used to investigate the interactions between the sulfur \u03c0-orbitals of arene dithiolates and high-valent transition metals as minimum molecular models of the active site features of pyranopterin Mo/W enzymes. The compounds (Tp*)MoO(bdt) (compound 1), Cp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mo(bdt) (compound 2), and Cp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti(bdt) (compound 3) [where Tp* is hydrotris(3,5-dimethyl-1-pyrazolyl)borate, bdt is 1,2-benzenedithiolate, and Cp is \u03b7&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-cyclopentadienyl] provide access to three different electronic configurations of the metal, formally d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and &lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. The gas-phase photoelectron spectra show that ionizations from occupied metal and sulfur based valence orbitals are more clearly observed in compounds 2 and 3 than in compound 1. The observed ionization energies and characters compare very well with those calculated by density functional theory. A \"dithiolate-folding-effect\" involving an interaction of the metal in-plane and sulfur-\u03c0 orbitals is proposed to be a factor in the electron transfer reactions that regenerate the active sites of molybdenum and tungsten enzymes.\n      </p>", "A series of mononuclear zinc thiolate complexes have been prepared and fully characterized. The reactions of the complexes with alkyl halides, leading to zinc halides and the corresponding thioethers, have been examined by kinetic methods. In toluene, the reactions obey a second-order rate law displaying activation parameters consistent with a S&lt;sub&gt;N2&lt;/sub&gt; attack of the zinc-bound thiolate on the carbon electrophile. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding of an amide N-H to the thiolate sulfur reduces the nucleophilicity and consequently, the rate of alkylation more than 30-fold at 25\u00b0 C. The H-bonding shows an inverse H/D isotope effect of 0.33 (60\u00b0 C) ascribed to differential H-bonding for the two isotopomers due to zero point energy differences. These model studies provide quantitative evaluation of H-bonding on reaction rates relevant to zinc thiol-activating proteins.\n      </p>", "Our present knowledge of the composition and chemistry of Titan's stratosphere is reviewed. Thermal measurements by the Cassini spacecraft show that the mixing ratios of all photochemical species, except ethylene, increase with altitude at equatorial and southern latitudes, reflecting transport from a high-altitude source to a condensation sink in the lower stratosphere. Most compounds are enriched at latitudes northward of 45\u00b0 N, a consequence of subsidence in the winter polar vortex. This enrichment is much stronger for nitriles and complex hydrocarbons than for ethane and acetylene. Titan's chemistry originates from breakdown of methane due to photodissociation in the upper atmosphere and catalytical reactions in the stratosphere, and from destruction of nitrogen both by UV photons and electrons. Photochemistry also produces haze particles made of complex refractory material, albeit at a lower rate than ethane, the most abundant gas product. Haze characteristics (vertical distribution, physical and spectral properties) inferred by several instruments aboard Cassini/Huygens are discussed here.\n      </p>", "Are there circumstances under which scientists and engineers doing their ordinary jobs can be thought of as participants in a social movement? The technoscientists analyzed in this article are at the forefront of a new way of doing chemistry; they are attempting to redesign chemical products and synthesis pathways to significantly reduce health effects and environmental damage from industrial chemicals. Green chemistry practitioners and entrepreneurs now constitute a small minority of chemists and chemical engineers in the university, government, and corporate sectors, but the innovators gradually are institutionalizing their efforts and winning converts. Drawing on concepts from social movement theory, the authors argue that examining green chemistry as a social movement sheds light on the intentional social organization of emerging scientific and engineering disciplines, advances thinking about the role of expertise in social change, and uncovers a possible pathway toward reconstructing chemical technologies on a more environmentally sustainable basis. The article closes with questions about potential coalitions among green chemists and engineers, regulators, and activist sectors of civil society.\n      </p>", "Bone chemistry paleodietary studies are emerging as important research areas in archaeology, biological anthropology, and paleontology. With appropriate controls, the inorganic and organic chemical composition of bones and teeth can provide information about past diet and habitat use. Chemical signatures are used to address individual dietary variability in early hominid fossils, paleontological remains, and more recent human and faunal populations.\n      </p>", "A synthetic strategy for constructing ionic hydrogen-bonded materials by combining perhalometallate anions with cations able to serve as hydrogen bond donors is presented. The approach is based on identification of well defined hydrogen bond acceptor sites on the anions by a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches. Selective population of these sites by hydrogen bond donors has the potential to afford organized crystalline arrays in one, two, or three dimensions. The approach is applicable to a wide range of metal centers.\n      </p>", "A molecular receptor consisting of a spacer bearing two cofacially disposed terpyridyl-palladium-ligand (terpy-Pd-L) units rigidly separated by about 7 \u00c5 has been investigated for molecular recognition of planar aromatic molecules. It is found that although the receptor forms stable 1:2 host-guest association complexes with 9-methylanthracene (9-MA), the guest undergoes very rapid site exchange within the receptor and with external free 9-MA. A crystal structure of the 2:1 adduct shows one 9-MA in the molecular cleft defined by the two terpy-Pd-L units and the other resides on an outside face of one terpy-Pd-L unit. To establish the site residency time of the guests, a number of tethered molecules were prepared. These involve an anthracene molecule tethered to a pyridine ligand bound to the palladium atoms to form intramolecular host-guest adducts. Rotating-frame Overhauser effects were used to infer the site residency of the anthracene guests in the receptor. Variable-temperature &lt;sup&gt;1H&lt;/sup&gt; NMR spectroscopy of the intramolecular host-guest complexes has revealed that the site residency time of the anthracene guests is 1.6 \u00d7 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; sec at 20\u00b0C and 1.3 sec at -90\u00b0C in acetone solution. Whereas the guests are thermodynamically stable, they are kinetically very labile. A crystal structure of one of the tethered host-guest adducts reveals the expected structure which is the same as that determined in solution by &lt;sup&gt;1H&lt;/sup&gt; rotating-frame Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy experiments.\n      </p>", "The mechanism of morphological phase transitions was studied for rod-shaped supramolecular assemblies comprised of a poly(acrylic acid)-block-poly(methyl acrylate)-block-polystyrene (PAA&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt;-b-PMA&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;-b-PS&lt;sub&gt;100&lt;/sub&gt;) triblock copolymer in 33% tetrahydrofuran/water after perturbation by reaction with a positively charged water-soluble carbodiimide. Tetrahydrofuran solvation of the hydrophobic core domain provided the dynamic nature required for the rod-to-sphere phase transition to be complete within 30 min. The intermediate morphologies such as fragmenting rods and pearl-necklace structures were trapped kinetically by the subsequent addition of a diamino crosslinking agent, which underwent covalent crosslinking of the shell layer. Alternatively, shell-crosslinked rod-shaped nanostructures with preserved morphology were obtained by the addition of the crosslinking agent before the addition of the carbodiimide, which allowed for the shell crosslinking to be performed at a faster rate than the morphological reorganization. The formation of robust shell-crosslinked nanostructures provides a methodology by which the morphological evolution processes can be observed, and it allows access to otherwise thermodynamically unstable nanostructures.\n      </p>", "A family of nanoscale-sized supramolecular cage compounds with a trigonal prismatic framework was prepared by means of spontaneous self-assembly from the combination of a predesigned molecular \"clip\" with tritopic pyridyl subunits. As confirmed by x-ray crystallography, the smallest structure of the reported series is \u22481 \u00d7 2 nm and possesses a nitrate anion incarcerated inside its molecular cavity.

The powdery sample showed purple color, which is a result of the mixed valence absorption of the linear chlorobridged complex (Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-Cl-Pt&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;-Cl-)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. When the lipid complex is dispersed in dichloromethane, purple-colored dispersion is obtained at 0\u00b0C, whereas the color disappears after heating the solution to 21\u00b0C. The observed thermochromism is reversible with respect to the temperature changes and is ascribed to the reversible dissociation and reassembly of the self-assembling inorganic wires. Casting of the 0\u00b0C-purple dispersion on solid substrates affords honeycomb nanostructures in addition to the nanowires with the width of about 20 nm. The honeycomb patterns seem to be templated by the condensed water droplets that are formed and aligned on the rapidly evaporating dichloromethane solution. On the other hand, more regular honeycomb structures are exclusively obtained by casting the 21\u00b0C-colorless solution. These observations indicate that the ordered honeycomb structures are obtainable on solid surfaces by the self-assembly of molecularly dispersed components [Pt(en)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;](1)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and trans-[PtCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(en)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;](1)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Very interestingly, formation of double-layered honeycomb nanostructure is observed by scanning electron microscopy. The unit hexagons and pillars of the honeycombs are made of nanowires that are hierarchically assembled from the lipid-packaged Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;/Pt&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; complexes. The surface self-organization of lipophilic inorganic complexes has a potential to fabricate novel nanoarchitectures with conjugated electronic structures.\n      </p>", "The self-organization of multicomponent tetrarosette assemblies into ordered nanostructures on graphite surfaces has been studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Real-space information on the level of individual molecules allowed us to analyze the underlying structure in unprecedented detail. In highly ordered nanorod domains, tetrarosettes 1&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;\u00b7(DEB)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; arrange in the form of parallel rows with a spacing of 4.6 \u00b1 0.1 nm. High resolution AFM revealed the internal packing of the tetrarosette assemblies in these rows, which can be described by an oblique lattice with a = 2.5 \u00b1 0.3 nm, b = 5.0 \u00b1 0.1 nm, and \u03b3 = 122 \u00b1 3\u00b0. The results, together with recent improvements in synthetic approaches, contribute to the development of a general strategy to develop H-bonding-based nanostructures with molecular precision.\n      </p>", "Dicarboxamide host 2 forms 1:1 complexes with n-octyl pyranosides derived from D-glucose, D-mannose, D-galactose, D-fucose, D-lyxose, and D-arabinose. Association constants (K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) in the range of 77-940 M&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; were measured in chloroform by means of induced circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy. Variations in K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values correspond qualitatively to expected differences in hydrogen-bonding abilities of guest hydroxyl groups. Induced circular dichroism effects for complexes of saccharides bearing equatorial 3-OH, 4-OH, and 6-OH groups show that the host chromophore is twisted in a P-helical conformation. A structural model is proposed that is also consistent with the results of previous studies involving complexation of dicarboxylic acid 1 with cationic saccharides in methanol.\n      </p>", "Linear porphyrin arrays self-assembled by either hydrogen bonding or metal ion coordination self-organize into lipid bilayer membranes. The length of the transmembrane assemblies is determined both by the thermodynamics of the intermolecular interactions in the supermolecule and by the dimension and physical chemical properties of the bilayer. Thus, the size of the porphyrin assembly can self-adjust to the thickness of the bilayer. An aqueous electron acceptor is placed on one side of the membrane and an electron donor is placed on the opposite side. When illuminated with white light, substantial photocurrents are observed. Only the assembled structures give rise to the photocurrent, as no current is observed from any of the component molecules. The fabrication of this photogated molecular electronic conductor from simple molecular components exploits several levels of self-assembly and self-organization.\n      </p>", "We have designed a synthetic tetracationic metallo-supramolecular cylinder that targets the major groove of DNA with a binding constant in excess of 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; M&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and induces DNA bending and intramolecular coiling. The two enantiomers of the helical molecule bind differently to DNA and have different structural effects. We report the characterization of the interactions by a range of biophysical techniques. The M helical cylinder binds to the major groove and induces dramatic intramolecular coiling. The DNA bending is less dramatic for the P enantiomer.\n      </p>", "We have previously shown that macrotricyclic host 1a is a powerful receptor for glucopyranosyl units in the nonpolar medium of chloroform. However, the solubility properties of 1a did not permit studies of the extraction of carbohydrates from aqueous solution. This paper describes the synthesis of the new variant 1b, furnished with a highly lipophilic exterior array of 12 benzyloxy substituents. In homogeneous solution, 1b behaves much as 1a, binding n-octyl \u03b2-D-glucoside with K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = 720 M&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in CD&lt;sub&gt;3OH&lt;/sub&gt;/CDCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (8:92). In two-phase experiments, the improved solubility of 1b allows carbohydrate extraction to be observed. Three hexoses (glucose, galactose, and mannose), two pentoses (ribose and xylose), and the two methyl glucosides are all extracted substantially into chloroform from 1 M aqueous solutions. Among the hexoses, 1b shows notable affinity and selectivity for glucose, extracting detectable amounts even from 0.1 M aqueous solutions.\n      </p>", "Microporous thin films (\u224850 to 400 nm) composed of discrete, cavity-containing molecular rectangles have been prepared. The films, which contain both amorphous and microcrystalline domains, display shape-selective transport behavior. They are permeable to small molecules and to molecules that are short or narrow in at least one dimension-for example, elongated planar molecules-but are impermeable to molecules lacking a narrow dimension. However, the shape selectivity is based on transport through intramolecular rather than intermolecular cavities. By using redox-active probe molecules, rates of transport through the rectangle-based material have been extracted from electrochemical measurements. Spatially resolved measurements obtained via scanning electrochemical microscopy have permitted transport through individual microcrystals to be evaluated semiquantitatively. The measurements reveal that transport is roughly two orders of magnitude slower than observed with thin microcrystalline films of molecular squares featuring similar-sized cavities. The differences likely reflect the fact that cavities within the square-based materials, but not the rectangle-based material, align to form simple one-dimensional channels.\n      </p>", "The multiple bonding between multinuclear zinc(II)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane (cyclen, a 12-membered tetraamine) complexes and multidentate ligands is an effective method for constructing supramolecular complexes having well defined and distinct structures in aqueous solution.

But so far, compounds that selectively bind Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in the presence of other alkali and alkaline earth metal ions are rare and current approaches toward this goal are often accompanied with substantial synthetic efforts. Here we describe a trinuclear ruthenium metallamacrocyclic complex (1) that was obtained by self-assembly of ruthenium halfsandwich complexes and 3-hydroxy-2-pyridone ligands. This complex was shown to be an extremely potent receptor for LiCl with an affinity high enough to extract LiCl from water. The selectivity of this receptor is exceptional: even in the presence of a large excess of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was extracted exclusively. The Li&lt;sup&gt;+/&lt;/sup&gt;Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; selectivity ratio was determined to be higher than 1,000:1. Compared with other synthetic ionophores, the receptor 1 offers two additional advantages: (i) the synthesis can be accomplished in one step by using simple starting materials; and (ii) the presence of lithium ions can be detected electrochemically. Complex 1 is therefore a very attractive candidate for the construction of a Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-specific chemosensor.\n      </p>", "A (R)-binaphthol tethered bis-hexameric oligo(m-phenylene ethynylene) foldamer was examined in 30 solvents to correlate the unfolded-folded conformational equilibrium to bulk solvent properties and specific solvent-chain interactions. The oligomer is soluble in a variety of solvents of intermediate polarity, with the majority of these solvents being helicogenic. The amphiphilic nature of the chain allows the solvophobic backbone to be solubilized in a wide range of solvents through the polar triethylene glycol side chains. As demonstrated through UV and CD spectroscopic experiments, the helical conformation is increasingly stabilized with increasing solvent polarity in the absence of specific solvent-chain interactions. Surprisingly, very few solvents are capable of fully denaturing the helix, indicating the strength of the solvophobic driving forces in this cooperative system. The folding reaction for this amphiphilic oligomer can be described as a compromise in solubility properties, where chains collapse intramolecularly into helical conformations to minimize solvent-backbone contacts while maintaining favorable solvent-side chain interactions for solvation. In terms of mimicking the properties of biomacromolecules, foldamers using solvophobic driving forces must be tempered with functionalities that promote solubility of the folded state while at the same time allowing access to the unfolded state through the use of denaturants.\n      </p>"], "words": {"emerging": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "aquatic": {"number": 1, "prob":
