Many authors advocate \"systematic\" reviews and articulate standards for these. This article compares the bodies of literature derived from systematic and other types of review, which the author labels conceptual, and examines problems associated with different approaches to defining a body of literature. These problems include (a) defining the boundaries of the literature, (b) distinguishing studies from citations, (c) distinguishing literature from lore, (d) deciding which reporting venues to include, and (e) weeding out anomalous studies. The article demonstrates that although systematic reviews may remove some biases through their inclusion rules, they may introduce other biases through their exclusion decisions and may thwart conceptual advances in a field.\n      </p>", "This article argues that the literature of the Portuguese-speaking world can and should seek to internationalize itself in the early decades of the twenty-first century and that there are five contexts which should prove to be effective vehicles in helping to do this: Latin American literature; inter-American literature; Europe; Africa; and world literature. In each category, the author offers some specific examples of how this might be done, that is, specific authors, texts, themes, or issues that the literature of the Portuguese-speaking world might address to increase its international visibility.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "The \"Lazarillo,\" Spain's oldest and most prestigious continuous prize for children's literature, was created to stimulate the production of good books for young readers. External conditions of the prize have been modified several times between 1958 and the present, in an apparent effort to adapt to changes in the sociopolitical climate and to balance such criteria as fairness and practicability. The annotated bibliography, presented here, of works that have won the prize for the text of highest literary quality shows that among the genres, narrative fiction predominates. The content of the prize winners over the years reflects Spain's gradual liberalization and opening to the outside world. Many prize-winning authors have influenced the evolution of children's literature through their innovations in form and content. Although the \"Lazarillo\" has not escaped criticism, the prize continues to enjoy great prestige in both Spain and Latin America.\n      </p>", "John Wigmore's list of Legal Novels\u2014really several lists compiled over the first thirty years or so of the twentieth century\u2014helped to generate the modern embodiment of the Law and Literature movement. The bibliographical element, although of course controversial as the Law and Literature canon developed through multiple debates about what should and should not be read and discussed, proved essential in locating a group of stories that lawyers were to live with throughout their professional careers. More than bibliographical, however, Wigmore's accompanying text stressed the democratization through great literature of a legal profession otherwise prone to misunderstanding the human realities with which it was theoretically always concerned. A defined group of fictional narratives\u2014stories about law, lawyers, trials, statutes\u2014was to reawaken in the legal reader the attachment to democratic values conveyed by literature through its acute awareness of human needs and the failure of great institutions to serve them. This essay marks the thirtieth anniversary of its author's update of the Wigmore list. I trace the very active debates that have informed Law and Literature since that 1976 Northwestern Law Review article, and I celebrate the expansion to foreign shores of knowledge about Wigmore, as Law and Literature proponents both home and abroad have embraced Wigmore's democratic impulse for law.\n      </p>", "Various works of literature are explored in light of the math that can be gleaned from their pages; includes activity sheets.\n      </p>", "Undergraduate students of today often lack the ability to effectively process research-based literature. In order to offer education students the most up-to-date methods, research-based literature must be considered. Hence a dilemma is born as to whether professors should discontinue requiring the processing of this type of information or teach effective skills on how to process research-based information.

It argues that the emergence of new fiction-writers and poets from large social sectors historically marginalised from Peruvian public life is part of a dramatic process of social change by which these sectors are gaining an important role in the transformation of their society. The article concludes that the work of these new writers reflects their search for a distinctive independent expression which mirrors their origins and their attitude towards their surrounding world.\n      </p>", "A model for guiding students in writing reviews of family literature is presented. The conceptual base for the model is drawn from Bloom and associates' (1956) taxonomy of educational objectives. A survey of advisors addressing the skills of their graduate students in writing literature reviews is reported. The findings supported the hierarchical nature of the taxonomy and demonstrated similarities across scientific disciplines. The article highlights the value of the Bloom taxonomy for assisting academic mentors, enlightening graduate students, and advancing family science.\n      </p>", "Literary accounts of traumatic events can be more informative and insightful than personal testimonials. In particular, reference to works of literature can give us a more vivid sense of what it is like to receive a devastating diagnosis. In turn this can lead us to question some common assumptions about the nature of autonomy, particularly for patients in these circumstances. The literature of concentration camp and labour camp experiences can help us understand what it is like to have one's life-plans altered utterly and unexpectedly. Contrary to common views of autonomy which have difficulty in characterising autonomous action when long-standing assumptions are suddenly lost, these examples show that autonomy is possible in these circumstances. We need a theory of autonomy which can deal with traumatic events and is useful in the clinical context.\n      </p>", "The paper argues that there is a proper place for literature within aesthetics but that care must be taken in identifying just what the relation is. In characterising aesthetic pleasure associated with literature it is all too easy to fall into reductive accounts, for example, of literature as merely \" fine writing\". Belleslettrist or formalistic accounts of literature are rejected, as are two other kinds of reduction, to pure meaning properties and to a kind of narrative realism. The idea is developed that literature\u2014 both poetry and prose fiction\u2014 invites its own distinctive kind of aesthetic appreciation which far from being at odds with critical practice, in fact chimes well with it.\n      </p>", "A review of how, in their professional writings, economists have used passages, plots, characters, themes, and ideas from literature and drama.\n      </p>", "In this final article of a three-part series, a number of Samoan texts on historical subjects are analyzed, and their importance for the study of Samoan history and culture is discussed.

The literature presented in this article cuts across the disciplines of education as well as English and library science. Using the selective tradition as a theoretical underpinning, the authors review extant literature through a three-pronged thematic heuristic developed as a result of their analysis. These themes present research findings related to African American children's literature as (1) contested terrain, (2) cultural artifact, and (3) literary art. The three themes generated to delineate the findings derived from a four-stage iterative process of analysis. By considering collective findings, a more careful and continued institutionalization of this literature can take place in schools, libraries, bookstores, popular media, and within families. The authors also address future implications for educational practice and research related to African American children's literature.\n      </p>", "The role of computer-based information services, and specifically online literature searching systems, in access to information relevant to applications of statistics are discussed.

The strengths and limitations of this approach, compared with traditional printed sources, are described, and future prospects noted.\n      </p>", "The past 30 years have witnessed an explosion of literary production by people of African descent. Although Black writers have been publishing their work for centuries, this has been an era of institutionalizing and diversifying literature, identifying and creating a market for it, and formalizing its study.

As a first step in the study of aspects of Samoan literature, the author analyzes the structure of the single story form on the basis of a wide reading in the published Samoan-language texts. That structure is found to consist of a title or titular sentence, an introduction, an optional time reference connection to the narrative, a narrative, an optional conclusion, and an optional terminal phrase or sentence. This form, found also in Hawaiian literature, can be used in a wide range of genres and can be identified within larger complexes, making possible a closer analysis of their construction.\n      </p>", "Computer-aided literature studies have failed to have a significant impact on the field as a whole. This failure is traced to a concentration on how a text achieves its literary effect by the examination of subtle semantic or grammatical structures in single texts or the works of individual authors. Computer systems have proven to be very poorly suited to such refined analysis of complex language. Adopting such traditional objects of study has tended to discourage researchers from using the tool to ask questions to which it is better adapted, the examination of large amounts of simple linguistic features. Theoreticians such as Barthes, Foucault and Halliday show the importance of determining the linguistic and semantic characteristics of the language used by the author and her/his audience. Current technology, and databases like the TLG or ARTFL, facilitate such wide-spectrum analyses. Computer-aided methods are thus capable of opening up new areas of study, which can potentially transform the way in which literature is studied.\n      </p>", "Building on earlier work in the production of culture, reception aesthetics, and cultural capital, sociology of literature research during the past few years has concentrated on readers' construction of meaning and on networks within literary systems.

It summarizes and evaluates over forty essays, giving details on works discussed, sample sizes used, statistical methods applied, and quotations from the researchers. The essay ends with a polemical summary of what has been done and what the future holds.

I conclude that judicious and careful use of Western theoretical models coupled with sensitivity to and deep knowledge of non-Western systems of thought have the best chance of eliciting important insights regarding dreams and other matters in Chinese folktales. In the course of my discussion of \"The Seven-Colored Flower\" I draw from both traditional Western psychological systems of thought as well as non-Western beliefs and systems, including Native American, Buddhist, and Taoist.\n      </p>", "This critical synthesis incorporates both theoretical and empirical literature on social capital since its original conceptualization by Bourdieu (1986) and Coleman (1988) in the late 1980s. The focus of the review is on educational literature that studies social capital and educational outcomes. After outlining their approach, the authors briefly trace the intellectual history of the concept and its transport to the field of education. Next, they undertake a critical review of the literature by first examining trends in conceptualization, methods, and outcomes and then assessing empirical support for claims that social capital is positively linked to educational and psychosocial outcomes. Finally, they discuss gaps in the conceptualization, measurement, and analysis of social capital in educational literature.\n      </p>", "Part of the value of stories is moral, in that understanding them, and the characters within them, is one way in which we seek to make moral sense of life. Arguably, it has become quite common to use stories in order to make moral sense of business life. Case method is the standard teaching method in top business schools, and so-called \"war stories\" are customary for on-the-job training. Shakespeare is a trendy purveyor of leadership education. Several books and articles have been written on the intersection between literature and business and/or business ethics. Still, it is one thing to claim that literature can contribute to our understanding of business conduct, but yet another to claim that literature can contribute to the related goal of improving moral conduct in business. Supporters of the claims tend to presume they go together, while skeptics and detractors often discard them as a package. These claims warrant further investigation if they are to be perceived by business scholarship and practice as worthy of serious attention, not just a quaint search for lowbrow moral fables or a vain pursuit of highbrow poetry. One instrumental function of literature is to imitate life, thereby expanding our vision beyond our parochial interests; to see literature merely as a didactic instrument to serve business interests misses the point that literature should expand understanding, our sense of what in addition to business is interesting and valuable.\n      </p>", "The Portuguese communities of the United States have been producing a steady flow of creative works both in Portuguese and in English. Usually, these works are considered part of American literature if written in English and of Portuguese literature if written in Portuguese. However, from a sociological point of view one can look at the communities as a single coherent whole expressing itself in two languages. In fact, whether written in English or in Portuguese, these books are received as part of the Portuguese-American world (I have called it L[USA]land) while at the same time dissolving at both ends into the mainstreams of Portuguese and American literary traditions. Given the cultural similarities and proximity between Portuguese communities in Canada and the U.S., they are here treated collectively as North-American Portuguese.\n      </p>", "We evaluated the credibility of early literature about famous North American wolves (Canis lupus). Many famous wolves were reported to be older than they actually were, and we estimated they did not live long enough to have caused purported damage to livestock and game animals. Wolf kill rates on free-ranging livestock appeared to be inflated compared to recently published kill rates on native ungulates and livestock. Surplus killing of sheep and goats may have accounted for some high kill rates, but surplus killing of free-ranging longhorn cattle probably did not occur. Some famous wolves may actually have been dogs (C. familiaris), wolf-dog hybrids, or possibly coyote (C. latrans)-dog hybrids. We documented instances where early authors appeared to embellish or fabricate information about famous wolves. Caution should be exercised when using early literature about wolves as a basis for wolf management decisions.\n      </p>", "The effects of ninth graders' culture-specific schemata on their responses to multicultural literature were investigated. Data collected from students (N = 76) in 4 ninth-grade English honors classes included written responses to prompts on participants' (a) self-identified culture(s), (b) self-selected level of cultural development, and (c) responses to 3 multicultural stories. J. A. Banks's (1981, 1997) Typology of Ethnic Identity was adapted for use as a response measure. Findings revealed that students' self-ratings of cultural awareness were often accurate, that their awareness of their own cultural backgrounds sometimes aided in entering a literary text and sometimes did not, and that the students benefited from using typologies to analyze their own development and their responses to literature.\n      </p>", "This article reviews the literature examining family variables associated with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa and family systems treatments for these eating disorders. Definitions of and diagnostic criteria for anorexia and bulimia are presented, and the prevalence of these disorders is discussed.

Family therapy approaches to treating anorexia and bulimia are discussed, and recommendations for future research are presented.\n      </p>", "This paper is a review of research in product development, which we define as the transformation of a market opportunity into a product available for sale. Our review is broad, encompassing work in the academic fields of marketing, operations management, and engineering design. The value of this breadth is in conveying the shape of the entire research landscape. We focus on product development projects within a single firm. We also devote our attention to the development of physical goods, although much of the work we describe applies to products of all kinds. We look inside the \"black box\" of product development at the fundamental decisions that are made by intention or default. In doing so, we adopt the perspective of product development as a deliberate business process involving hundreds of decisions, many of which can be usefully supported by knowledge and tools. We contrast this approach to prior reviews of the literature, which tend to examine the importance of environmental and contextual variables, such as market growth rate, the competitive environment, or the level of top-management support.\n      </p>", "A literature analysis was conducted to examine the application of Management Science (MS) tools in Strategic Planning. The 766 abstracts were classified into a series of strategic categories to identify their contribution to specific phases of the Strategic Planning process. A functional classification was used to indicate the key issue or type of problem involved. Industry, publication date, and publication source were also considered. To identify potential application areas for the MS tools, beyond those found in this sample, a gap analysis was performed using Reisman's methodology for finding researchable topics.\n      </p>", "The required graduate reading lists of 56 leading Ph.D.-granting Spanish faculties in the United States were analyzed to characterize the current canon for Spanish and Spanish American literature. The database consisted of 14,686 items. Little consensus was found regarding authors, and even less for specific works of literature. Only two authors and two works from Spain achieved 100 percent representation on the lists. Thirty-nine authors (one female) and 22 male-authored works from Spain, and 24 authors (two female) and ten male-authored works from Spanish America were present on 75 percent or more of the lists. At the other end of the spectrum, nearly 1,000 different titles appeared just once in the database, demonstrating presence on only a single reading list. The findings show little agreement about what constitutes literary value in this field. This has important implications for graduate education.\n      </p>", "Formal literature review and synthesis is an important component of Patient Outcomes Research Teams (PORTs) and the development of clinical practice guidelines supported by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR). Investigators face unresolved methodological issues and practical problems in carrying out this work because the use of such systematic reviews is relatively new in medicine. In addition, standard meta-analytic methods may not readily be applied to the literature pertinent to most PORTs. Representatives of the InterPORT Work Group on Literature Review and Meta-Analysis exchanged information to identify and assess their respective approaches to these challenges. All 12 PORTs used systematic approaches to identifying relevant studies and to gather and analyze data abstracted from these studies. Most PORTs had undertaken or made plans for several separate reviews, which focused on a specific question about the outcomes of therapeutic health care services or procedures, diagnosis, prevention or prognosis. The descriptive information provided by PORTs reveals substantial commonalities in their methods for searching literature and organizing bibliographic databases. However, there was considerable variation in other aspects of reviews, such as selection/exclusion criteria, the use of blinding, and the techniques used to assess the quality of studies. Alternative approaches to literature review and synthesis warrant further examination because they have implications for research and health policy both in terms of the substantive conclusions and efficiency of reviews.\n      </p>", "'Good gene' mate selection theory proposes that all individuals share evolved mental mechanisms that identify specific parts of a woman's body as indicators of fertility and health. Depiction of feminine beauty, across time and culture, should therefore emphasize the physical traits indicative of health and fertility. Abdominal obesity, as measured by waist size, is reliably linked to decreased oestrogen, reduced fecundity and increased risk for major diseases. Systematic searches of British literature across the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries reveal that a narrow waist is consistently described as beautiful. Works in ancient Indian and Chinese literature similarly associate feminine attractiveness with a narrow waist. Even without the benefit of modern medical knowledge, both British and Asian writers knew intuitively the biological link between health and beauty.\n      </p>", "Objectives This paper reports on a systematic review of the international qualitative research literature on return to work. This review was undertaken in order to better understand the dimensions, processes, and practices of return to work. Because return to work often includes early return before full recovery while a person is undergoing rehabilitation treatment, physical recovery is embedded in complicated ways with workplace processes and practices and social organization. These process-oriented dimensions of return to work are well described in the qualitative literature. Methods This systematic review of the literature covered peer-reviewed papers that focused on musculoskeletal and pain-related injuries and were published in English or French between 1990 and 2003. Findings from papers meeting relevance and quality criteria were synthesized using the meta-ethnographic approach. Results This review found that return to work extends beyond concerns about managing physical function to the complexities related to beliefs, roles, and perceptions of many players. Good will and trust are overarching conditions that are central to successful return-to-work arrangements. In addition, there are often social and communication barriers to return to work, and intermediary players have the potential to play a key role in facilitating this process. Conclusions This paper identifies key mechanisms of workplace practice, process, and environment that can affect the success of return to work. The findings illustrate the contribution that qualitative literature can make to important aspects of implementation in relation to return to work.\n      </p>", "Five questions guided a case study exploring the relationship between oral narrative and discussion in middle school literature study: (a) Relative to similar classrooms in a large-scale study, how can overall literature instruction be characterized? (b) Relative to similar classrooms in a large-scale study, how well do students achieve in the focal classroom? (c) What, if any, are the links between oral narrative and discussion? (d) If discussion and narrative co-occur, what sorts of oral narratives do narrators tell in discussions? and (e) If discussion and narrative co-occur, how can we characterize the overlap in terms of interaction? In the frequent conversational narrative discussions, where oral narrative and discussion discourse overlapped, teacher and students used various kinds of oral narrative genres to prime, sustain, ratify, and amplify discussion.\n      </p>", "Anthologies have evolved from literary collections of the Middle Ages, reflecting changes in scholarship, attitudes, and pedagogical needs.

However, it is also granted that the personal qualities of a narrator may be more or less radically effaced. Recently, philosophers and film theorists have debated whether movies similarly involve implicit audiovisual narrators. Those who answer affirmatively allow that these cinematic narrators will be radically effaced. Their opponents deny that audio-visual narrators figure in the ontology of movies at all, and many have argued that the 'effaced' literary narrator is an illusion as well. In this paper, I attempt to sort out the central issues that arise in these debates, defending the existence of effaced narrators in both literature and film.\n      </p>", "This paper is concerned with parallel positionings of animal and child in the discourses of animal rights and children's literature criticism respectively. It suggests that animal and child are often constructed in such texts as 'real' and therefore impervious to discourse. In analysing the ways these discourses nevertheless construct their object, alternative constructivist attempts to remain self-reflexive about their own discursive assumptions are discussed. Examples of outright resistance to constructivism are selected from animal advocacy, whilst the co-option of constructivism to a liberal humanist agenda is noted in current children's literature criticism. I argue that both positions fail to recognize their own mastery of the animal/child on whose behalf they claim to speak.\n      </p>", "A unique type of writing used exclusively by local women is found in the mountainous areas of Hunan Province in central China.

Remarkable progress has been made since 1988, with new phenomena and observations reported, such as on longshore transport processes at walls. Some previous results and conclusions of the 1988 review have been cast into doubt, with example new results being that (1) wave reflection at walls may not be a significant contributor to profile change, and (2) scour at seawalls in the field may be more a product of longshore transport and return of overtopping water than a result of direct cross-shore wave action. The validity or usefulness of small-scale physical model tests is questioned. Conclusions and recommendations for future work are given. This paper is the first of a companion set of papers that investigate the effects of seawalls on the beach. The second paper presents a numerical model of cross-shore transport and beach profile change at seawalls that includes wave reflection, and it compares predictions to measurements made at the SUPERTANK project and to recent results found in the literature on scour at walls.\n      </p>", "Research and theorizing in psychology, and as well as in other behavioral and social sciences, will be enhanced, enriched, and made more practical and useful if the variables and constructs therein are broadened and deepened by the words, the expressions, and the observations found in poetry, literature, plays, narratives and in the arts broadly speaking, media which are more sensitive to the nuances and subtleties in behavior than are those contained more conventionally in psychology.\n      </p>", "Studying mathematics-related fiction and poetry helps students develop an appreciation for both mathematics and literature and an understanding of the connection between the two.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "The concept of place has, over the past decade, been invigorated theoretically by geographers emphasizing the unboundedness, historical dynamism, and multiple identities inherent in places. This work is often characterized as a new way of conceiving place, enabled in part by the rise of postmodern cultural and social theory and the related demise of modernism in academia. Modernism, it has been claimed, devalued place as a relevant vehicle for understanding social change. This paper, however, contends that in fact place has been a particularly significant terrain for representing the experience of modernity, and that the conception of place envisioned in contemporary cultural geography has important humanistic roots in much nineteenth- and twentieth-century literature. The paper examines the intersections between this literary tradition of place representation and academic geography, examining the work of Goethe and Hardy, and the fiction of Raymond Williams. These writers articulated a vision of place not as the site of by-gone traditions and knowable communities, but as the landscape of modernity's paradoxes and contradictions. While there have been echoes of this distinctly modern approach to place in cultural geography, it is often obscured by a focus on the oppositional geopolitics of resistance. I argue that the vision of place derived from the literature discussed can serve as a template for examining the contemporary cultural dynamics of socioeconomic transformation and restructuring, and is advocated here as a basis for evaluating the cultural politics of place in terms of the contradiction and paradox-as opposed to a narrower conception of progressive politics-with which people continue to engage the changes swirling around them.\n      </p>", "Although computer-based learning environments (CBLEs) are becoming more prevalent in the classroom, empirical research has demonstrated that some students have difficulty learning with these environments.

Results indicate that behavioral and psychological factors are positively related to computer self-efficacy. Students who receive behavioral modeling report significantly higher computer self-efficacy than do students who receive the more traditional instruction-based method when learning with CBLEs. Computer self-efficacy is related both to learning outcomes and to learning processes with CBLEs.

Diabolic shape-shifting was a common feature in witch trials all over Europe, but no other country gained a similar notoriety as an alleged lycanthropy hot spot. During the last two decades, historians and anthropologists have devoted considerable attention to the topic, but their research has been predominantly focused on trial records and juridical sources. Complementing these contributions, this essay approaches the Livonian werewolves from a different angle: as a topic of theoretical considerations and scholarly treatises.\n         European men of letters first learned about the shape-changers of Livonia from Sebastian M\u00fcnster's influential Cosmographia in 1550. Five years later, the exiled Swedish bishop Olaus Magnus expanded M\u00fcnster's succinct report into a detailed and fanciful description of the Baltic werewolves and their savage nature\u2014an account that left a lasting impression on the imagination of European intellectuals. For the next 150 years, Livonian werewolves were regularly mentioned and discussed in demonological, ethnographic, and historiographic treatises, before the skeptical attitude of the early Enlightenment banished them from scholarly literature in the 1720s.\n      </p>", "The article wants to show that modern Tamil writers' tales on their religious rites complement anthropologists' and Indologists' studies.

Determination of the number of components to retain is the most crucial problem confronting the researcher when using PCA. An incorrect choice may lead to the underextraction of components, but commonly results in overextraction. Of several methods proposed to determine the significance of principal components. Parallel Analysis (PA) has proven consistently accurate in determining the threshold for significant components, variable loadings, and analytical statistics when decomposing a correlation matrix. In this procedure, eigenvalues from a data set prior to rotation are compared with those from a matrix of random values of the same dimensionality (p variables and n samples). PCA eigenvalues from the data greater than PA eigenvalues from the corresponding random data can be retained. All components with eigenvalues below this threshold value should be considered spurious. We illustrate Parallel Analysis on an environmental data set. We reviewed all articles utilizing PCA or Factor Analysis (FA) from 1987 to 1993 from Ecology, Ecological Monographs, Journal of Vegetation Science and Journal of Ecology. Analyses were first separated into those PCA which decomposed a correlation matrix and those PCA which decomposed a covariance matrix. Parallel Analysis (PA) was applied for each PCA/FA found in the literature. Of 39 analyses (in 22 articles), 29 (74.4 %) considered no threshold rule, presumably retaining interpretable components. According to the PA results, 26 (66.7 %) overextracted components. This overextraction may have resulted in potentially misleading interpretation of spurious components. It is suggested that the routine use of PA in multivariate ordination will increase confidence in the results and reduce the subjective interpretation of supposedly objective methods.\n      </p>", "Les situations des \u00e9crivains et des pays sont si diverses que l'on peut se demander si la caract\u00e9ristique commune de cette production n'est pas avant tout son lien avec la Grande Bretagne et les \u00c9tats-Unis et son dialogue avec toute la litt\u00e9rature postcoloniale de langue anglaise.

I argue that the founding of the nation-state instigated far-reaching changes in the life, structure, and symbolic identity of the nation, and it is in light of these changes that Israeli culture should be analyzed. The main change was the death of constitutive Zionist desire, by which the nation underwent several shifts, one of which was from a masculine to a feminine symbolic identity.

This raises the question of what the standards of an empirical science in the strictest sense should generally be. Practical relevance of its results soon turns up as the fundamental condition for an explanatory empirical science, if the ideology of nearing an empirical truth is no longer accepted and a mere pragmatic justification rejected as its insufficient substitute. As a consequence the logical priority of scientific explanation over scientific description is considered irrefutable. The so-called \"sciences of understanding\" - among them a \"science of literature\" - are confronted with a special difficulty, if they want to become explanatory empirical sciences. Their practical problems to be solved are related to linguistically or semiotically coded facts. To empirically describe these problematic facts causes this difficulty, which the author tries to overcome with recourse to ideas from Wittgenstein. And the practical relevance, which may be achieved with the help of nomological explanations, here doesn't consist in predictions for better practical production of means, direct or indirect, for survival, but in the provision of rational understanding for better practical teaching or criticism. This practical relevance is shown in the explanation of valuing acts of readers of The Golden Bowl by Henry James.

Mas vem igualmente mostrar que o escritor cearense n\u00e3o se curvou \u00e0s suas fontes francesas: assimilou-as de tal forma que imprimiu ao seu romance um car\u00e1ter independente e original. /// The marks of France, on Brazilian literature of the second half 19th century, are underiable. They were introduced in our literary manifestations directly, by Zola's and other great French writer's work, or indirectly, by Portuguese Naturalist novels. The present reading of Bom-Crioulo, by Adolfo Caminha, confirms that reality. But that reading equally comes to show that the writer from Cear\u00e1 was not dominated by his French background: he assimilated it in such a way that he gave to his novel an independent and personal characteristic.\n      </p>", "The role of literature and imagination in medicine and medical ethics is currently under discussion. This paper argues that the role of literature is not to furnish generalisable examples for guidance. Rather, engagement with literature parallels moral engagement with other people. The work of the imagination, in this context, is not to hypothesise, but to grant life to the characters and world of literature. In doing this, one may develop one's moral life.\n      </p>", "The essay describes the use of George P. Landow's hypertext, The Dickens Web, in an advanced undergraduate literature class and analyzes its practical and theoretical implications. Hypertext is shown to encourage active student engagement, especially with contextual material; to lead to more focused research topics; and to facilitate student collaboration. Some of Landow's claims about the ease with which this occurs, however, are questioned. The difficulty of teaching students how to follow and construct conceptual hypertextual links is examined, and the instructor's role in relation to student contributions to the Web is presented as much more problematic than Landow allows.\n      </p>", "Settling in fertile valleys at less than 300 meters above sea level, the Vietnamese Th\u00e2y are glutinous rice eaters and producers in wet and dry fields. Their experience in rice production and consumption is expressed extensively in beliefs, rituals, customs, and folk literature. Glutinous rice figures as an inseparable part of their spiritual and material life from childhood up to old age. Myths, legends, and folktales confirm this role of rice from time immemorial. The Tai-speaking people in neighboring countries have many common features of rice and of the cult of the Rice Goddess in their folktales.\n      </p>", "This article examines examples of advice literature published in Britain for what they indicate about changes in the material culture of home entertaining from 1920 to 1970. Advice writing offers ideal models of design consumption attentive to social behaviour and reflective of reader concerns. A theoretical framework for the fusion of the social and material in a domestic setting is forged through reference to the work of Norbert Elias, Erving Goffman and Pierre Bourdieu. Elias's 1939 work The Civilising Process illuminates pre-industrial etiquette, Goffman's 1959 The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life bridges the movement away from such a model, and Bourdieu's 1969 Distinction assists understanding of the reception of modernist design. A pre-industrial courtly model of ornament and luxury apparently jarred with the comparative austerity embodied in 'high' modernism and popular idioms such as moderne and contemporary. Modern design was recommended in advice literature, therefore, as contributing new ideals to the comfort of a social setting: flexibility, youth, practicality, thrift, hygiene, economies of space, fashionability and longevity. However, modernist design was also credited with the traditional etiquette ideals of dignity, luxury and comfort, pointing to a new appreciation of the beauty of utility grounded in the aestheticization of everyday life that modified the visual language of status and of hospitality.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Far from being an Ivory Tower distraction, answering the ancient question of what the Sirens sang leads us to the narrative origins of our law.\n      </p>", "In just the past decade molecular data have demonstrated that recurrent origins of polyploids appear to be the rule, rather than the exception, with well-documented examples for bryophytes, ferns, and angiosperms. However, Russian investigators seem to have embraced the possibility of recurrent polyploidy at a much earlier date than did other evolutionary biologists. The crossing studies conducted by Maria Rozanova (1934, 1938, 1946) on Rubus should be considered classic investigations of the process of allopolyploidisation. Unfortunately, however, scientists in the West remain unaware of this work because it was largely published in Russian. We review here these remarkable investigations, which revealed at an early date the complexities of polyploidisation. Rozanova demonstrated that the same polyploid species can form multiple times and in multiple ways; she also suggested that the same processes revealed in her crossing studies likely occurred in nature and could account for the morphological diversity observed in natural populations. Thus, although molecular data have recently revealed the high frequency and importance of independent origins of polyploid species, traditional crossing studies conducted in Rubus over 60 years ago actually provided an early suggestion of the possible prevalence of this process, as well as providing critical insights into the mechanisms of polyploidisation.\n      </p>", "One of the skills necessary for the conductor of an ensemble is the ability to detect errors of pitch and rhythm in a rehearsal while examining a correct score. This study developed (1) a program to train the ability to detect errors, and (2) a test to measure improvement of this ability. Both the program and the test used full-score band literature of medium-level difficulty. Three forms of the program, each differing in the number of practice frames, were developed in order to determine the optimum length of program needed to effectively train error detection skill. Results showed that programmed instruction was effective in training error detection skill and that the longer forms of the program resulted in greater gains.\n      </p>"], "words": {"essay":
