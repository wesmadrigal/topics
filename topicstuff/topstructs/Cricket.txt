{"total_words": 1298, "documents": ["After its introduction to one-day cricket in 1997, the Duckworth/Lewis method has spread to become the standard rule throughout senior levels of the game for resetting the target in matches shortened after their start due to rain or other causes. This paper reviews how the method is working following its application to more than 400 known cases. A comparison of the Duckworth/Lewis model with several years of data from international matches is made that confirms the suitability of the underpinning model, but the data indicate that there is a need to update the model's parameters. An upgrading of the model is suggested to cope with high-scoring matches when the basic model's assumptions begin to break down. Although the price of the enhanced model is loss of simplicity and complete reliance on software, cricketing authorities have begun to believe the price to be worth paying. Data from actual matches are used throughout to illustrate the implementation of this successful use of Operational Research principles to the solution of a practical problem in one-day cricket.\n      </p>", "Multiple linear regression techniques are applied to determine the relative batting and bowling strengths and a common home advantage for teams playing both innings of international one-day cricket and the first innings of a test-match. It is established that in both forms of the game Australia and South Africa were rated substantially above the other teams. It is also shown that home teams generally enjoyed a significant advantage. Using the relative batting and bowling strengths of teams, together with parameters that are associated with common home advantage, winning the toss and the establishment of a first-innings lead, multinomial logistic regression techniques are applied to explore further how these factors critically affect outcomes of test-matches. It is established that in test cricket a team's first-innings batting and bowling strength, first-innings lead, batting order and home advantage are strong predictors of a winning match outcome. Contrary to popular opinion, it is found that the team batting second in a test enjoys a significant advantage. Notably, the relative superiority of teams during the fourth innings of a test-match, but not the third innings, is a strong predictor of a winning outcome. There is no evidence to suggest that teams generally gained a winning advantage as a result of winning the toss.\n      </p>", "The tradition of tossing a coin to decide who bats first in a cricket match introduces a randomly assigned advantage to one team that is unique in sporting contests. The potential importance of the toss rule in determining cricket match results has been the subject of some investigation, which is further advanced in this paper that utilizes a data set relating to the increasingly popular, but contentious, day-night form of limited overs cricket as played at international level. We employ logit regression models to examine the effects of winning the toss and choice of batting order on the likelihood of a match victory, while controlling for home advantage and (relative) team quality. Our findings suggest that winning the toss and batting first increases the probability of winning whereas winning the toss and bowling first does not.\n      </p>", "Exposure to anthropogenic endocrine disruptors has been listed as one of several potential causes of amphibian declines in recent years. We examined gonads of 814 cricket frogs (Acris crepitans) collected in Illinois and deposited in museum collections to elucidate relationships between the decline of this species in Illinois and the spatial and temporal distribution of individuals with intersex gonads. Compared with the preorganochlorine era studied (1852-1929), the percentage of intersex cricket frogs increased during the period of industrial growth and initial uses of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (1930-1945), was highest during the greatest manufacture and use of p,p-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and PCBs (1946-1959), began declining with the increase in public concern and environmental regulations that reduced and then prevented sales of DDT in the United States (1960-1979), and continued to decline through the period of gradual reductions in environmental residues of organochlorine pesticides and PCBs in the midwestern United States (1980-2001). The proportion of intersex individuals among those frogs was highest in the heavily industrialized and urbanized northeastern portion of Illinois, intermediate in the intensively farmed central and northwestern areas, and lowest in the less intensively managed and ecologically more diverse southern part of the state. Records of deposits of cricket frog specimens into museum collections indicate a marked reduction in numbers from northeastern Illinois in recent decades. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that endocrine disruption contributed to the decline of cricket frogs in Illinois.\n      </p>", "The batting average statistic has been used almost exclusively to assess the worth of a batsman. It reveals a great deal about the potential performance of batsmen in cricket played at the first class level. However, in the one-day game, strict limits on the number of balls bowled have introduced a very important additional dimension to performance. In the one-day game, it is clearly not good enough for a batsman to achieve a high batting average with a low strike rate. Runs scored slowly, even without the loss of wickets, will generally result in defeat rather than victory in the one-day game. Assessing batting performance in the one-day game, therefore, requires the application of at least a two-dimensional measurement approach because of the time dimension imposed on limited overs cricket. In this paper, we use a new graphical representation with Strike rate on one axis and the Probability of getting out on the other, akin to the risk-return framework used in portfolio analysis, to obtain useful, direct and comparative insights into batting performance, particularly in the context of the one-day game. Within this two-dimensional framework we develop a selection criterion for batsmen, which combines the average and the strike rate. As an example of the application, we apply this criterion to the batting performances of the 2003 World Cup. We demonstrate the strong and consistent performances of the Australian and Indian batsmen as well as provide a ranking of batting prowess for the top 20 run scorers in the tournament.\n      </p>", "Discrete state series can often be modelled by stationary Markov chains. However, if the Markov chain depends on the value of an additional variable, then it may be necessary to fit a set of interconnected Markov chains. This paper shows how this can be done using log-linear modelling. The methods are exemplified by modelling the human alpha-fetoprotein DNA sequence and the results of Australia versus England test cricket matches. In the former case, the additional variable is reading frame position and in the latter it is the country in which the match is played. Practical problems such as the power of the tests and the effect of cells with small expected values are discussed.\n      </p>", "This paper describes the scheduling of the matches for the 1992 World Cup of Cricket using a heuristic method programmed in Lotus 1-2-3.

This article traces its origins, rules and regulations, membership, progress and activities through to the 1870s and again in the revival of the 1880s and 1890s. It reveals that although the game of cricket was adopted by few Mexicans, it was enthusiastically played by the British community in Mexico throughout the nineteenth century. The Club continues to the present time in Mexico City.\n      </p>", "Traditionally, evaluation of individual player performances in one-day cricket has been based on measures such as batting and bowling averages, and strike and economy rates. It is recognized, within the game of cricket, that such measures have severe limitations in assessing the true performances and abilities of players. Whenever a player's performance statistics are quoted, there is nearly always some verbal qualification that is necessary in order to place the statistics into context. Such comments include the stage of an innings a player usually bats or bowls, as this significantly affects a player's opportunity for scoring runs or taking wickets. Further, traditional measures do not allow the comparison of the skills of batting and bowling as they are based on incompatible scales. This paper uses the well-established Duckworth/Lewis methodology to create alternative measures of player performance. These measures, it is argued, have the potential to reflect better the performances of players having regard for the stages of innings that runs are scored or conceded and wickets taken or lost. The proposed measures could impact in evaluating player performance for a particular match, a series of matches, or in the longer term over players' careers. Further, the methodology enables an objective measure to be created that compares and combines the performances of batsmen and bowlers and of a player's all-round ability. Data from international matches are used to illustrate the methodology and how it compares with existing measures.\n      </p>", "The paper discusses the properties of a rule for adjusting scores in limited overs cricket matches to preserve probabilities of victory across interruptions by rain. Such a rule is argued to be attractive on grounds of fairness, intelligibility and tactical neutrality. A comparison with other rules also offers a useful way of assessing the way in which the application of such rules will affect the fortunes of teams in rain-affected games. Simulations based on an estimated parameterization of hazards of dismissal and on numerical dynamic programming methods are used to compare a probability preserving rule with the now widely used Duckworth-Lewis method.\n      </p>", "Herpetologists are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of hematological parameters for evaluating the welfare of their study animals. In particular, differential counts of white blood cells (from blood smears) are now commonly performed on amphibians, although interpretation of such counts relies on some knowledge of the normal range for the species in question, and for many species this range is not known. In this study we examined blood smears from 79 cricket frogs (Acris c. crepitans) from two ponds in northeastern Georgia to establish reference ranges of white blood cell differentials for this species and to explore possible differences in relative white blood cell numbers between sexes, ponds, and body sizes. For comparison, we also compiled values of many other amphibians from published and unpublished records. We found that lymphocytes made up the majority (68.3%) of white blood cells in cricket frogs, followed by neutrophils (22.4%). There was no difference in relative cell numbers of any type between sexes, nor was there an association with body size. Relative numbers of certain cell types (lymphocytes and neutrophils) varied between ponds. In general the values for cricket frogs resembled those of other amphibians, with high numbers of lymphocytes and neutrophils and low numbers of eosinophils, basophils and monocytes. However, in assembling the records for other species we discovered that all Ambystomatid salamanders examined thus far have markedly elevated values of eosinophils compared to other amphibian species. Moreover, their eosinophil counts may be the highest of all vertebrates, and clearly warrant further study to determine their significance.\n      </p>", "In cricket, a rain-affected pitch can make batting more difficult than normal. Several other conditions such as poor light or an initially lively pitch, may also result in difficulties for the batsmen. In this note, we refer to all of them as 'sticky wickets'. On sticky wickets, lower order batsmen are often sent into 'hold the fort' until conditions improve. In this paper, a stochastic dynamic programming model is used to examine the appropriateness of this policy. The model suggests that the tactic is often optimal when the sticky wicket persists until the end of the day's play, but not often when the sticky wicket is transitory. In some circumstances, it is worthwhile, on a normal wicket near the end of the day, to send in a lower order batsman to hold the fort (a night watchman): when the wicket is sticky, this tactic is even more worthwhile.\n      </p>", "The author's previous paper on this topic showed that the Duckworth/Lewis methodology has considerable potential for providing relevant and objective measures of performance in one-day cricket. The present paper evaluates how these measures can apply in the longer term. This assessment is based upon several series of matches involving the main players from most of the major cricketing nations. Although data used are not exhaustive, they are of sufficient quantity to provide strong indications of the long-term viability of the measures, thus leading to the realistic expectation of inclusion of the methodology into the existing player-rankings or the development of an independent set of performance indicators that reflect more validly the value of players' inputs to matches. Such measures are expected to be of valuable use to team management, media commentators and to the public.\n      </p>", "The paper attempts to understand batting strategies that are employed in limited overs cricket games. The question of the optimum batting strategy is posed in a simplified dynamic programming representation. We demonstrate that optimum strategies may be expected to differ fundamentally in the first and second innings, typically involving an increasing run rate when setting a target but a run rate which may decline over the course of an innings when chasing one. Data on English county level limited overs games are used to estimate a model of actual batting behaviour. The statistical framework takes the form of an interesting variant on conventional survival analysis models.\n      </p>", "In cricket, when a batsman is dismissed towards the end of a day's play, he is often replaced by a lower-order batsman (a 'night watchman'), in the hope that the remaining recognised batsmen can start their innings on the following day. A dynamic programming analysis suggests that the common practice of using a lower-order batsman is often sub-optimal. Towards the end of a day's play, when the conventional wisdom seems to be to use a night watchman, it may be best to send in the next recognised batsman in the batting order. Sending in a night watchman may be good judgement when there are several recognised batsman and several lower order batsmen still to play (say four of each). However, with smaller numbers (two of each, for example), then, with very few overs left to play, it may be better to send in a recognised batsman.\n      </p>", "Left-handers occur at unexpectedly high frequencies at top levels of many interactive sports. This may occur either because left-handed contestants are innately superior or because they enjoy a negatively frequency-dependent strategic advantage when rare relative to right-handers. We analysed the batting records from the 2003 cricket World Cup and showed that left-handed batsmen were more successful than right-handers, and that the most successful teams had close to 50% left-handed batsmen. We demonstrate that this was because left-handed batsmen have a strategic advantage over bowlers, and that this advantage is greatest over bowlers that are unaccustomed to bowling to left-handers. This provides a clear mechanism for negative frequency-dependent success of left-handed batsmen. Our results may also support a historical role for negative frequency-dependent success in fights and other contests in the maintenance of left-handedness by natural selection.\n      </p>", "This paper concerns a computer system which has been devised to timetable the county cricket matches in England. The context of the work is discussed and the many constraints and objectives described. Details of the solution method are given; it involves tabu search with a form of diversification dependent on the solution subcosts as well as the overall cost. Experiments are described which suggest that this type of diversification may have wide applicability to large, complex, multi-objective combinatorial problems.\n      </p>", "The batting average is ubiquitous in cricket. In this paper we show that the traditional batting average depends on an unrealistic parametric assumption. We propose a nonparametric approach based on runs scored for assessing batting performance. The methods have been applied to a large sample of players at various levels of cricket, examples of which are featured in this paper. The statistical methodology employed is akin to that used in reliability and survival analysis.\n      </p>", "Luck can play a big part in tournament success, and progress is not necessarily the best measure of performance. A linear model is used to fit least squares ratings to margins of victory in the cricket World Cup. The Duckworth/Lewis rain interruption rules are used to project a winning second innings score and create a margin of victory in runs, equivalent to that used when the team batting first wins. Results show that, while the better teams progressed through the first round of the competition, some injustices occurred in the Super-Six round. This appears to be due to the double counting of selected matches. Ordering teams by average margin of victory gives similar results to the more complicated linear model, and its use as a tie breaker is suggested. Publication of the margin of victory as estimated by the Duckworth/Lewis method for second innings victories in all one-day matches would provide a common margin of victory suitable for analysis.\n      </p>", "In cricket, particularly near the end of an innings, batsmen of different abilities need to manage the rate at which they score runs. Either batsman can choose to bat aggressively or defensively, which alters their chances of scoring runs or being dismissed. Since they change ends when they score a run and at the end of an over, by scoring an odd or even number of runs the two batsmen also determine which of them will face the next ball. It may be worthwhile to refuse a run to keep the slower or lower scoring batsman from the strike. Some dynamic programming models are developed which could be used to maximise the total number of runs scored.\n      </p>", "Cricket requires a continuity of performance by one team in batting until a violation of the playing rules is encountered. That violation-causing a binary decision, the possible dismissal of a batsman-may have a significant effect on the course of the batting side, and ultimately on the game. Some dismissals are indisputable, but a significant minority are the subject of decisions by umpires. Some of these are complex situations yet need rapid decision-making, and television slow-motion replays have highlighted the problem of apparent misjudgments. The effect of such decisions on batsmen and on innings totals can be simulated and consequently estimated to assess their importance.\n      </p>", "The proportions of dismissals which were leg before wicket in test cricket matches during 1978-2004 are analysed by using generalized linear and mixed models to assess the effect of location, team and the presence or otherwise of neutral umpires. The location and the team batting are clearly significant. There is also clear evidence of an interaction showing that some teams' players are out leg before wicket less often at home but there is no further interaction with neutral umpires, suggesting that this is not caused simply by home umpires favouring the home team.\n      </p>", "A method is described for setting revised target scores for the team batting second when a limited-overs cricket match has been forcibly shortened after it has commenced. It is designed so that neither team benefits or suffers from the shortening of the game and so is totally fair to both. It is easy to apply, requring nothing more than a single table of numbers and a pocket calculator, and is capable of dealing with any number of interruptions at any stage of either or both innings. The method is based on a simple model involving a two-factor relationship giving the number of runs which can be scored on average in the remainder of an innings as a function of the number of overs remaining and the number of wickets fallen. It is shown how the relationship enables the target score in an interrupted match to be recalculated to reflect the relative run scoring resources available to the two teams, that is overs and wickets in combination. The method was used in several international and domestic one-day competitions and tournaments in 1997.\n      </p>", "Endecous betariensis, a new species of cricket collected in a limestone cave from the Ribeira Valley Speleological Province, state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, is described and its calling song characterized.

The role of developmental temperature in shaping female preference functions, and thus its influence on signal-preference coupling has not been investigated. In this study, the effects of developmental temperature are examined in both males and females of the Hawaiian cricket, Laupala cerasina, to determine the degree of signal-preference matching between male song and female preference due to developmental environment. We found that rearing females in different temperature environments affected adult female acoustic preference functions in the same direction as male calling song, thereby influencing variation in adult reproductive behavior in such a way that male and female components remain coordinated. However, we further demonstrate that for male song, the effect of the rearing environment is not permanent but appears only to exert influence for a period of days. This mid-term temperature effect is distinct from the effect of short-term ambient temperature, which influences song in a matter of minutes and has been well documented. Signal-preference coordination, and sexual selection pressures due to mismatching within natural populations, likely will be influenced by nymphal developmental environments of males and females, as well as by adult singing and preference environments.\n      </p>", "Larviparous female tachinid flies are attracted to taped cricket songs. In the laboratory flies deposit larvae on a cricket mounted to a speaker; the larvae burrow through the cricket's exoskeleton and develop internally. These acoustically orienting parasitoids probably influence male reproductive behavior and sexual competition in crickets.\n      </p>", "Leg before wicket decisions in test cricket series have sparked some controversy in recent years. In particular, series played in Australia have drawn much criticism from individual players in visiting teams, as well as from the general public both in Australia and overseas. It has been suggested that the umpiring in test series in Australia has been biased towards Australian teams. This paper uses logistic regression to analyse data from the test cricket series played in Australia from 1977 to 1994. It is found that, of the seven teams which have played against Australia over this period, three have significantly higher rates of leg before wicket decisions given against them than were given against Australia. Although this could be seen to be due to a bias towards Australian teams, other factors could account for these differences.\n      </p>", "The species of cricket Cicloptyloides americanus has males with 2n = 14 and females with 2n = 16 chromosomes. The autosomes are metacentrics and the sex determining mechanism is of the X1 X2 O (male) - X1 X1 X2 X2 (female) type, with X1 submetacentric and X2 acrocentric. This mechanism is cited for the first time among species belonging to the order Orthoptera.\n      </p>", "Using a dynamic programming formulation, an analysis is presented of the innings of the team which bats first (here referred to as the first innings) and the innings of the team which bats second (here referred to as the second innings). This allows a calculation, at any stage of the innings, of the optimal scoring rate, along with an estimate of the total number of runs to be scored (in the first innings) or the chance of winning (in the second innings). The analysis is used to shed some light on possible batting tactics (in terms of the best run rate at any stage of the innings), to quantify the effects of selecting extra batsmen in a side, and to suggest a method for the development of alternative measures of player performance. Results suggest that scoring rates should be more uniform than at present, and that the team batting second has an advantage. Possible extensions to the model are discussed.\n      </p>", "W. Grey Walter built robotic systems to improve understanding of biological systems. In that tradition, this paper reports ongoing work on a robot model of cricket sound localization. The main advances are the inclusion of a much larger range of neuroethological detail, and the investigation of multimodal influences on the behaviour. The former allows exploration of the functionality of identified neurons in the insect, including the possible roles of multiple sensory fibres, mutually inhibitory connections, and brain neurons with pattern-filtering properties. The latter focuses on the inclusion of an optomotor stabilization response, and how this might improve tracking, particularly under conditions of random disturbance.\n      </p>", "Crickets are known to be inefficient sound producers. When calling, typically less than 1% of their metabolic energy is converted into sound. This low efficiency has been attributed to losses within the insect and to poor acoustic coupling with the environment. A previously uninvestigated factor that might contribute to low efficiency is ultrasonic radiation. If the impacts of the plectrum and file teeth excite vibration in the ultrasonic range, then the sound pressure level meters typically used to measure acoustic power would not accurately detect it. We made audible and ultrasound recordings of the calling songs of a phylogenetically diverse group of 6 cricket species, and, for comparison, 2 katydid species. In most of the cricket species, energy was present well into the ultrasonic region as a series of harmonics of the carrier frequency. However, the energy in these peaks was very small in comparison to the audible-range harmonics. There was no evidence of significant oscillations that were not harmonics of the carrier frequency. In all but one cricket species, over 97% of the total audible and ultrasonic energy was contained in the carrier frequency band.\n      </p>", "Females of many insects posses an ovipositor, which in crickets is usually used to place eggs deep into the soil. Ovipositor length in female striped ground crickets (Allonemobius socius) increased at higher latitudes and altitudes in North America, despite an opposing trend in overall body size. Crickets inhabiting regions with short growing seasons and long, cold winters invariably had longer ovipositors than crickets inhabiting warmer regions. The only exception to this observation was for first generation crickets in bivoltine populations where there was no pattern of geographic variation in ovipositor length. However, second generation females from these same populations always had longer ovipositors than their first generation ancestors,and followed a pattern of geographic variation similar to that found for univoltine crickets. Overall, these results support Masaki's (1986) model, which predicts that longer ovipositors will evolve in northern cricket populations as an evolutionary response to the selective advantages of overwintering eggs being oviposited deep in the soil in cold habitats. In order to determine the mechanisms underlying patterns of phenotypic variation in the wild, and to test the hypothesis that interpopulation variation reflects genetic differentiation while intergeneration variation within a population reflects environmentally induced phenotypic plasticity, crickets from eight populations were brought to the laboratory and reared through three generations in a common garden. It was found that laboratory-reared populations varied significantly in ovipositor length, with the pattern of variation mimicking that found for field-collected crickets. This finding supports the hypothesis that geographic variation in the wild has a significant genetic basis. The influence of environment on ovipositor length was examined in 20 full-sib families from a bivoltine population. Crickets reared in @'autumn-like@' conditions (30@?C, 15:9 h, L:D), such as might be experienced by second generation bivoltine crickets in the wild, were generally larger and had significantly longer ovipositors than siblings reared under @'spring-like@' conditions (27@?C 11:13 h, L:D). This pattern corresponds to that observed for bivoltine populations in the wild and suggests the importance of environmental cues for phenotypic plasticity, or polyphenism in ovipositor length in bivoltine populations of this cricket.\n      </p>", "Discussions about the evolution of female mating preferences have often suggested that females should express multiple strong preferences when different male traits are correlated with different mating benefits, yet few studies have directly tested this hypothesis by comparing the strength of female preferences for male traits known to be correlated with different benefits. In the variable field cricket, Gryllus lineaticeps, females receive fecundity and fertility benefits from mating with males with higher chirp rates and life-span benefits from mating with males with longer chirp durations. Although females prefer higher chirp rates and longer chirp durations when the other trait is held constant, it is possible that they give priority to one of these song traits when both vary. In this study, we examined the relative importance of chirp rate and chirp duration in female mate choice using single-stimulus presentations of songs that varied in both chirp rate and chirp duration. Females expressed both directional and stabilizing preferences based on chirp rate, responding most strongly to a chirp rate approximately one standard deviation above the population mean. Females did not express preferences based on chirp duration, and did not express correlational preferences. These results suggest that females may give priority to the reproductive benefits provided by males that produce higher chirp rates.\n      </p>", "The evolutionary trajectory of a trait depends not only on the presence of genetic variation, but also on the pattern of genetic correlations (rg) among traits. Genetic correlations are most easily measured under homogeneous, controlled laboratory conditions, whereas natural populations typically experience a higher degree of environmental variability The effect of environmental variability on genetic correlations in the cricket, Gryllus pennsylvanicus, was studied by measuring genetic correlations within and between two environments differing in levels of environmental heterogeneity. Within-environment rg among morphological traits measured in the homogeneous laboratory environment were found to be reliable predictors of rg measured in the experimental field environment. Laboratory measures of rg involving life-history traits, though, were not found to reflect the same correlations measured in the heterogeneous environment. A significant negative genetic correlation between fecundity and developmental time was found in the field environment, yet was not detectable when measured in the laboratory. Phenotypic correlations may be obtained much more easily than genetic correlations, but their usefulness in evolutionary inference depends on the pattern of similarity between the two correlations. A comparison of genetic and phenotypic correlations revealed a close match between the two measures for morphological traits, but revealed only broad similarities when considering life-history traits. Male-female genetic correlations between morphological traits were high (all rg &gt; 0.73) and were consistently higher in the field environment than in the laboratory. The genetic correlations between the sexes in developmental time followed the same trend, but the male-female genetic correlation of gonad weights was low in both environments. Across-environment correlations were found to be strong for morphological traits and for gonad weight, whereas the genetic expression of developmental time was found to be dependent on the environment in which the crickets were raised.\n      </p>", "Scientific literature often touts the many advantages of large body size, but seldom addresses the value of small body size. Yet selection for large size must be counterbalanced by selection for small size, otherwise, all animals would be large. In this paper, we demonstrate female-biased size dimorphism and a strong copulatory advantage for small males in a Jerusalem cricket (JC) (Stenopelmatus) from central California. We selectively paired male and female JCs of diverse body sizes and recorded their ability to copulate. All copulations were successful for males smaller or equal in size to females. In contrast, when the male was 6.1 mm longer than the female, copulation had only a 50% chance of occurring successfully. In general, as the difference between male and female body length increased (i.e., as males became longer than their mates), the probability of successful copulation decreased. These patterns of mating resulted in net selection for small male size and large female size. We also detected positive linear direct selection on male hind leg length, which may explain why male JCs have longer legs than females. The copulatory disadvantage of large males derives from the odd mating behavior of this group, in which males must contort and precisely align their bodies to couple. We believe that this is the first example of small-male advantage based solely on the physical aspects of copulation. In this species, small, not large, males have a copulatory advantage.\n      </p>", "A new genus Paranurogryllus, closely related to Anurogryllus Saussure, and two new species, P. capricornio and P. boraceia, are described.

One proposed mechanism for this decline is the negative effects of acidified precipitation on this acid-sensitive species. To test the predictions of this hypothesis, we sampled 570 randomly-selected sites along three transects in Ohio using chorusing surveys during 2004. Along these transects, we assessed pH and acid neutralizing capacity (alkalinity), as well as terrestrial and aquatic vegetation cover. Our surveys detected 53 extant Cricket Frog populations (9.3% of surveyed sites) in ponds, lakes, and streams. These sites were exclusively located in western Ohio, indicating a substantial (~120 km) range contraction, compared to its historic distribution in the state. A multiple logistic regression model found no significant relationship between Cricket Frog occurrence and either pH or acid neutralizing capacity (P &gt; 0.50). Acid neutralizing capacity and pH were also not significantly different in extant and extinct areas of the Cricket Frog's range in Ohio (P &gt; 0.05). Cricket Frogs were found to occur significantly more frequently than expected by chance in lakes and at sites with low canopy cover (P &lt; 0.001). While synergistic interactions with other factors cannot be ruled out, these results suggest that habitat acidification is likely not responsible for Cricket Frog declines in Ohio. Unlike other declining amphibians, where likely causal mechanism(s) have been identified, causes of Cricket Frog declines remain enigmatic.\n      </p>", "Snowy tree crickets synchronize their chirps by responding to the preceding chirp of their neighbors. If a neighbor's chirp precedes his own, a cricket shortens his chirp and the following interval. If it follows his own, he lengthens his chirp interval and sometimes the following chirp. A single response of the first type may advance his phase of chirping 160\u00b0 and one of the second type may retard it 200\u00b0.\n      </p>", "The orientation of southern cricket frogs was tested in a circular pen 60 ft in diameter located in water. With only the sun and sky visible, frogs moved in a direction corresponding to a line drawn perpendicularly toward the home shoreline. Accuracy of daytime orientation was not diminished after frogs were held 43 hr in total darkness. Animals collected by day and kept in total darkness oriented correctly when tested at night in view of the moon. Cricket frogs tested with only stars visible show bipolar orientation along the proper axis. When the same frogs were tested twice, the results were nearly identical. Successful orientation to home shores was observed in frogs displaced 15.1 mi and in those from 2 different shores when tested simultaneously. Reorientation to a new shoreline was evident after 3 hr and was virtually complete after a week.\n      </p>", "Rapid evolution has been well documented in naturally selected traits, but few examples exist for sexually selected traits, particularly sexual signals. This may in part be due to the complex set of behaviors associated with sexual signals. For a sexual signal to change, the change must be favorable for the signaler, but must also be accommodated by the receiver's perception and preferences. We investigated female accommodation of an extreme change in the sexual signal of Polynesian field crickets, Teleogryllus oceanicus. The cricket is native to Australia, widely distributed on Pacific Islands, and was recently introduced to Hawaii. Selective pressure by a deadly parasitoid fly favored a wing mutation in Hawaii (flatwing) that eliminates males' singing ability altogether. Despite conventional wisdom that females require males to produce a courtship song before mating, we show that females from ancestral, unparasitized Australian and Pacific Island populations as well as parasitized Hawaiian populations, will mate with silent flatwing males, suggesting this behavioral option predates the change in sexual signal. Furthermore, ancestral Australian females discriminate against flatwing males more severely than island females. We suggest island colonization favored females with relaxed mating requirements (Kaneshiro's effect) facilitating the rapid evolutionary loss of song in Hawaii.\n      </p>", "This work is concerned with the nature and magnitude of certain transverse aerodynamic forces on cricket balls in flight. The forces considered are those arising from the non-isotropy of cricket balls, that is those occurring mainly because the ball has a prominent seam around its circumference. The forces were measured for a variety of balls in experiments where the balls were either fixed in or projected through a wind tunnel jet. The principal objectives were to provide a set of results for the transverse swing of cricket balls, and to identify and consider the factors on which the effect depends. The experiments supported many, but not all, of the popular beliefs concerning the phenomenon. In particular, cricket balls swing well if the ball has a prominent seam inclined at a slight angle to the direction of projection, and if the surface of the ball is otherwise smooth. A small amount of back-spin imparted along the seam at projection helps to maintain the orientation of the ball during the flight. The experiments did not support the common belief that cricket balls swing more on humid days. Also, it is argued that 'late swing' is an uncontrollable effect. Perhaps the most important conclusion, however, is that the whole phenomenon is easily influenced by transient effects that are beyond control. Therefore swing bowlers should expect considerable variation in swing, even with new balls.\n      </p>", "Two new genera of nemobiine crickets, Amanayara and Monopteropsis are, respectively, described from the forests of eastern Brazil and the mountains from Magdalena, Colombia.

Neither network ties, nor national values, nor climatic conditions account for this disparity. Our explanation hinges instead on two key factors: first, the degree to which elites chose either to appropriate the game and deter others from participating or actively to promote it throughout the population for hegemonic purposes; and second, the degree to which the game was \"popularized\" by cultural entrepreneurs looking to get and keep spectators and athletes interested in the sport. Both outcomes relate to the nature of status hierarchies in these different societies, as well as the agency of elites and entrepreneurs in shaping the cultural valence of the game. The theoretical significance of this project is thus the observation that the diffusion of cultural practices can be promoted or discouraged by intermediaries with the power to shape the cultural meaning and institutional accessibility of such practices.\n      </p>", "A critical prediction of the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis is that the expression of secondary sexual traits should be positively correlated with pathogen resistance ability. This correlation is necessary if females are to be able to use a particular sexual trait as an indicator of a male's resistance ability. In this study we document a positive correlation between a sexually selected component of the calling song of male house crickets (the number of syllables per chirp) and haemocyte load, an important determinant of the ability to encapsulate pathogens in insects. The results indicate that, by favouring males which produce more syllables per chirp, females may also select males with higher pathogen resistance ability, potentially generating either direct or indirect selection on female mating preferences.\n      </p>", "The parasitoid fly Ormia ochracea uses the calling song of its host Gryllus spp. to locate an area inhabited by potential hosts. Once a calling male has been located, O. ochracea deposits live larvae on the host, and on substrates surrounding the host to enable the larvae to attach to and enter individuals in the vicinity of the calling male. In Texas, where O. ochracea parasitizes the Texas field cricket Gryllus texensis, we observed juvenile crickets in the mating aggregations that form around calling males. Juvenile G. texensis crickets are, therefore, potentially susceptible to parasitism by O. ochracea. Here we investigated whether laboratory reared juvenile field crickets could successfully host O. ochracea larvae. We found that juvenile crickets were appropriate hosts for O. ochracea. /// La mosca parasitoide Ormia ochracea usa el canto de cortejo del hospedero Gryllus spp. para ubicar las \u00e1reas habitadas por hospederos potenciales.

These phenomena are typically associated with actual or anticipated depletion of food resources after an increase in population density, but the mechanisms driving such collective movements are poorly understood. Here we reveal that insects in large, coordinated migratory bands consisting of millions of Mormon crickets in western North America were deprived of two essential nutritional resources: protein and salt. The insects themselves provided a major source of these nutrients, and cannibalism was rife. We show that protein and salt satiation reduced cannibalism and that protein satiation inhibited walking. Additionally, experimentally reducing the motility or mobility of crickets substantially increased their risk of being cannibalized by other band members. As a result, the availability of protein and salt in the habitat will influence the extent to which bands march, both through the direct effect of nutrient state on locomotion and indirectly through the threat of cannibalism by resource-deprived crickets approaching from the rear. The crickets are, in effect, on a forced march. Migratory band formation and subsequent mass movement, therefore, are manifestations of specific tradeoffs between the costs and benefits of group living. Bands afford antipredator benefits to individual group members. Group movement then mitigates the resulting costs of intraspecific competition, namely local depletion of nutritional resources and the associated increased risk of cannibalism.\n      </p>", "Two new species of the genus Eidmanacris are described (E. bidentata and E. corumbatai) and a new combination name (E. alboannulata) is assigned for the species Arachnomimus alboannulatus Piza, 1960 (= E. bicornis Mesa &amp; Mello, 1985).

The study showed that large propagules resulted in larger local populations during the years following introduction. Probability of colonization for each propagule size was measured and showed that propagule size had a significant effect on colonization success, i.e., large propagules were more successful in colonizing new patches.

The elements of the synaptonemal complex show detail of structure which is absent in other preparative procedures. The transverse filaments found in the central region of the synaptonemal complex from both species are straight and have a similar width, 1.6-1.8 nm. These filaments occur mainly in bundles. The central element differs in architecture in the two species. In hamster bivalents it is formed of longitudinal stretches of filaments 1.6-1.8 nm wide and a small amount of an amorphous material similar to that of the lateral elements. In the cricket, the central element contains transverse fibrils which are continuous with the transverse filaments of the central region, and an amorphous material lying mainly along the sides of the central element. All of the components of the central region of the synaptonemal complex are resistant to pancreatic DNase. The overlapping ends of the transverse filaments, together with additional protein material, make up the central element. The widespread occurrence and close morphological and histochemical interspecies similarities of the transverse filaments indicate that they serve an essential role, probably one concerned with holding synapsed bivalents together via the lateral elements.

We support the hypothesis that repeated copulation increases insemination success, as the number of sperm transferred increases with each spermatophore. This probably increases paternity for males, as on average a female mates with over 40 males. Despite intense sperm competition each ejaculate has only a few hundred sperm, orders of magnitude less than in related crickets. We show that all sperm are transferred from each spermatophore in the few seconds before a female removes and eats it. Repeated copulation increases effective copulation duration while a small ejaculate ensures that this strategy is not excessively costly. Thus repeated copulation in these crickets may have arisen as a counter-adaptation to female-imposed limits on copulation.\n      </p>", "Optical movement detectors are often used in laboratory studies of insect behavior. They offer advantages of time resolution and ease of analysis compared with video. However, design and construction have rarely been described in enough detail to allow the devices to be built easily by others.

The great majority of heritability (h2) estimates are performed under laboratory conditions that are characterized by low levels of environmental variability. Very little is known about the effect of environmental variability on the estimation of components of quantitative variation, although theoretical extrapolations from lab studies have been attempted. Here we investigate the effects of environmental heterogeneity on variance component estimation using full-sib families of Gryllus pennsylvanicus split between a homogeneous laboratory environment and a more variable field environment. Although large standard errors prevent demonstration of statistically significant differences among h2 of traits measured in the two environments for all but one trait, the values of h2 are, on average, lower in the variable field environment, with a mean reduction of 19%. Developmental time is an exception, exhibiting high levels of additive variance in the field, leading to a higher value of h2 in the variable environment. Underlying the lower field h2 estimates are greater components of environmental variance as expected, as well as lower components of genetic variance. In this study, there is no evidence that the increase in the environmental component of variance in the field is any more important in the reduction of h2 than is the decrease in the additive genetic component. The implications of the relative changes in the two components of variance are discussed.\n      </p>", "Field crickets depend on acoustic organs to detect the presence of potential predators as well as conspecific crickets.

Differential introgression of linkage groups indicate favored, neutral, and disfavored genomic regions with respect to intrinsic (epistatic interactions, linkage to specific genes) and extrinsic (environmental selection, behavior, ecological interactions) environments. Additionally, the ability of alleles to introgress will depend on hybrid zone structure (opportunity for individuals to interact) and maintenance (criteria for favorable traits). Thus, trait differences that influence local distribution within these hybrid zones contribute to species coexistence and persistence in the face of hybridization. The mosaic hybrid zone between two North American field crickets, Gryllus firmus and G. pennsylvanicus, is structured by underlying soil heterogeneity in Connecticut. Despite this, it is not clear what role soil type plays in maintaining this hybrid zone. A companion study demonstrated that abiotic characteristics of different soil types do not cause significant viability selection on diapausing cricket eggs that overwinter in the soil. Instead, other environmental factors, such as winter weather, play larger roles in egg survival. Here I investigated one biotic factor that potentially has a large effect on egg survival - predation by ants. These results show that when ants are present, egg mortality is dramatic, increasing 2.5 fold against areas without ant infestations. Although not significant, there is some indication that ant activity may vary among sites and soils. Hence, this biotic factor may influence the distribution of cricket species in this hybrid zone and consequently the dynamics of their interactions.\n      </p>", "Cricket frogs (Acris crepitans) from several different sites in Illinois were collected to assess the effects of environmental contamination on the prevalence of intersex gonads. Of 341 frogs collected in 1993, 1994, and 1995, 2.7% were intersex individuals. There was no statistically significant relationship between the chemical compounds detected and cricket frog intersexuality. However, there was an association approaching significance (p = 0.07) between the detection of atrazine and intersex individuals. A comparison of reference sites with sites that had point polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and polychlorinated dibenzofuran (PCDF) contamination revealed a significant relationship between sex-ratio reversal and contamination with PCBs and PCDFs. The sex ratio of juvenile frogs studied from three sites with PCB and PCDF point contamination favored males over females, which was the opposite of the sex ratio in control ponds (p = 0.0007). The statistically significant correlation between organochlorine contamination and sex-ratio reversal suggests PCBs and PCDFs can influence cricket frog sexual differentiation. The current study suggests that in cricket frogs, sex ratios and the prevalence of intersex gonads are altered by environmental contamination.\n      </p>", "Initially, the essay offers the impressions of a sixteen-year-old German when confronted with an unknown game (Cricket) in an unknown country (Pakistan).

Fipronil residue concentrations decreased with time ( $C = 0.00002x^2 - 0.0053x + 0.3675$ , $R^2 = 0.9998$ where C = fipronil concentration (\u03bc g/g of soil) and x = days after treatment). Concentrations of two metabolites, fipronil sulfone and fipronil sulfide, increased as fipronil residues decreased. Each treatment's affect on late instar mole crickets was significantly different from the non-treated; however, there were no significant differences in nymph status among fipronil-treated containers. Fipronil and residues of its metabolites 120 days after application were $0.047 \\mu g/g$ of soil and were high enough to kill or repel mole crickets to the same extent as the 0-day treatment, $0.368 \\mu g/g$ of soil. Repellency of fipronil and its metabolites was significant as the majority of nymphs evacuated or died in the treated containers, but 35 of 37 nymphs were found alive in the non-treated containers. /// En un experimento de invernadero, fipronil fue aplicado a $raz\\acute{o}n$ de 0.014 kg ia/ha sobre pasto Bermuda, Cynodon dactylon L., en recipientes plasticos de 5-litros 120, 90, 60, 30, y 0 dias antes de poner una ninfa del grillo topo, Scapteriscus vicinus Scudder en el recipiente. $Despu\\acute{e}s$ del periodo de $exposici\\acute{o}n$ , el suelo en los recipientes fue dividido en incrementos de 0-4,4-8, y 8-18 cm de profundidad, y el estado del grillo fue registrado como muerto, ausente, o vivo por la $examinaci\\acute{o}n$ completa del suelo.

La repelencia de fipronil y sus metabolitos fue significativa, ya que la mayoria de las ninfas emigraron o morian en los recipientes tratados, pero 35 de las 37 ninfas se encuentraron vivas en los recipientes no tratados.\n      </p>", "Northern Cricket Frogs, Acris crepitans, are experiencing population declines throughout their range for unknown reasons. Habitat alteration is one potential explanation, so evaluating habitat use and movement of Cricket Frogs could be valuable to protect and manage this species. To understand how altered landscapes influence Cricket Frog movements, we initiated a study at a golf course to assess the dispersal of adults on a variety of terrestrial habitat types (mown grass, unmown grass, or the ecotone between mown and unmown grass) released at different distances from a single pond (10, 20, or 40 m). We monitored movements of adult male frogs by marking individuals with fluorescent powder. Distance from the pond did not appear to affect movement or orientation toward the pond. However, Cricket Frog movement was significantly affected by habitat type. Cricket Frogs produced longer paths in unmown grass and were more likely to orient toward the pond than frogs released at the ecotone, which may be beneficial during dispersal events. Frogs released in both unmown and mown grass moved in straighter paths than frogs released at the ecotone between these habitats, suggesting that, when given the choice, both habitat types are used to potentially optimize travel, foraging, and/or avoiding predation. Our research suggests that while managed green spaces may provide suitable habitat for connecting pond-breeding amphibians, habitat with more structure (i.e., unmown grass) may offer Cricket Frogs the greatest benefits.\n      </p>", "The Mormon cricket (Anabrus simplex Haldeman) (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae) is a historic pest on millions of acres in the western US. During outbreak years, annual losses attributed to it have amounted to millions of dollars. Nonchemical controls are needed for environmentally sensitive areas \u2014 an increasing concern. Myco-insecticides are available but show an unpredictable and unexplainable lack of effect on Mormon crickets. This research sought to understand performance of Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium brunneum under field conditions, compared to studies showing excellent performance under laboratory conditions. Our objectives were: (1) to evaluate B. bassiana GHA and M. brunneum F52 for potential use against Mormon crickets; (2) to compare spray and bait formulations of each fungus against immature and adult Mormon crickets; and (3) to understand the effect of Mormon-cricket body temperatures on the speed of efficacy by the two fungi. No mortality of 3rd-instar Mormon crickets was detected in the field 14 d after treatment with fungal baits or sprays of either B. bassiana Strain GHA or M. brunneum Strain F52. Unexpected bait aversion may have adversely affected the success of the bait treatments. Lack of spray efficacy was also unexpected, given the laboratory infectivity of both fungi for the Mormon cricket. Possible body temperatures were estimated by thermal surrogates located on the ground and in the plant canopy within field cages. Surrogate temperatures below 18\u00b0C, as well as above 30\u00b0C, were common during the study. When cumulative amount of time at temperatures optimal for fungal growth (18 to 30\u00b0C) was calculated for the duration of the post-treatment observation period, there was an insufficient number of fungal growth hours to produce mortality within the 14-d post-treatment period. Our data suggest that at least 32 to 43 d (M. brunneum) or 58 to 75 d (B. bassiana) should have been required for insect mortality to occur under the conditions of the test. In a second test, targeting seventh-instar nymphs and adults, the in-field mortality was not followed, but treated individuals were incubated both indoors and in outdoor cages. Infections by B. bassiana and M. brunneum in the indoor-incubated insects caused 69 and 100% mortality (corrected for untreated controls) respectively, with 71 and 80% mycosis in cadavers. Mormon crickets in outdoor cages succumbed to unexpected high temperatures. Our data illustrate the importance of Mormon cricket body temperatures and their effects on fungal infection. Because physical location and thermoregulation may alter the environ inside the insect, at least a month may be required after treatment for infections by B. bassiana GHA and M. brunneum F52 to cause mortality. Future studies should take this longer observational time into account. There is some potential for faster fungal growth in Mormon crickets under natural conditions, as opposed to our experimental cages, particularly in the immature stages. Mormon crickets aggregate in sheltered locations under inclement weather and at night. This behavior may conserve and actually promote body temperatures more favorable to fungal development. The potential value of this aspect of Mormon cricket behavior will require additional study.\n      </p>", "The Indian Premier League is seen as a bonanza for cricket viewers, players and corporate owners, but hidden behind the glitz is the fact that it represents a distorted form of commodity and consumer excess.\n      </p>", "The water permeability and water content of the cuticle of the cricket Acheta domesticus were examined using gravimetric techniques as well as in vivo and in vitro methods used in conjunction with the transpiration monitor. At 30 C and &lt;5% RH, water loss rates (WLR) in intact, untreated animals exceeded values for live (mouthand anus-sealed) and dead crickets. Individuals immersed in hexane or chloroform: methanol prior to testing exhibited markedly higher WLR. The permeability of thorax cuticle (untreated) measured electronically with a ventilated capsule (in vivo) was slightly greater than the mean value estimated from gravimetric measurements on dead crickets (.027 vs. .017 mg cm\u207b\u00b2 h\u207b\u00b9 mmHg\u207b\u00b9, respectively); however, in vitro values determined on isolated segments of thoracic cuticle were approximately four times higher. The permeability of hexane-treated cuticle was also significantly higher than that of untreated cuticle, both in the in vivo and in the in vitro procedures. Cuticular water content of crickets kept in dry air was significantly lower than values for crickets held in Ringer-equilibrated air, but there were no significant differences between these measurements made in vivo and in vitro. All of the cuticular water appeared to be held in the endocuticle. The permeabilities of the endocuticle and combined epi-and exocuticles confirm the previously held view that the principal integumental barrier to water is at or close to the surface of the cuticle, with lipids being a primary contributor to this barrier. We conclude that the epidermis plays no significant part in regulating integumental water loss in this species. A simple, passive, two-layer model that is based on equilibrated water contents predicted values for the water content of cuticle having Ringer solution on the inside and dry air outside that are in reasonable agreement with those observed.\n      </p>", "To understand the variation in aggressiveness and factors important for contest outcome, we quantified and compared agonistic interactions of four field cricket species in eastern North America: Gryllus fultoni (Orthoptera; Gryllidae), G. vernalis, G. pennsylvanicus, and G. rubens. The most aggressive behavior that we observed, the grapple, was frequently displayed in agonistic trials of G. pennsylvanicus and G. rubens. By contrast, we never observed this behavior in trials involving G. fultoni and G. vernalis. Consequently, species was the only significant variable affecting the variation in aggressiveness, whereas size difference, age difference, and contest duration had no significant effect. In species with high levels of aggressiveness, G. pennsylvanicus and G. rubens, the factors that might be indicative of resource holding potential such as size or age difference seemed to be significant for contest outcome. In species with low levels of aggressiveness, G. fultoni and G. vernalis, however, there were indications that contest outcomes were determined by aggressiveness itself rather than the size and age differences between opponents. Markov chain analyses revealed that the difference in aggressiveness between species with high and low levels of aggressiveness lay in a sequence of escalating behaviors: antennal fencing, mandible flare, and grapple. The escalated state of aggressiveness char- acterized by this behavioral sequence in G. pennsylvanicus and G. rubens seems to be the ancestral state in the North American Gryllus phylogeny. We argue that the loss of a tendency to use burrows in G fultoni and G. vernalis might be related to low levels of aggressiveness in these species.\n      </p>", "This article is concerned with the simulation of one-day cricket matches.

Every league match requires two officiating umpires. There are various preferences relating to the deployment of umpires that fall short of being definite constraints. The requirement was to produce a computer system that would allocate umpires in a satisfactory manner without the need for human interaction, since the users of the system will be unqualified amateurs. This necessitated the construction of a very complex objective function, using imprecise and ill-defined information. The biggest challenge was thus one of problem formulation; the solution technique was relatively straightforward.

The flagella of mid-spermatids contain the usual 9 + 2 set of fibers and a set of nine accessory fibers. At first all are hollow, then the lumina become filled with an electron-opaque matrix material in which narrow electron-lucent microcylinders are embedded. The accessory fibers and one central fiber become filled first, then the B subfibers and the other central fiber, and finally the A subfiber. In all but the B subfibers, microcylinders are arranged in a circular or oval group that lies against the wall of the lumen and encloses one or several additional microcylinders. In accessory fibers there are 9-11 microcylinders in the outer group and 4-5 in the inner group. In the central fibers and the A subfibers there are 7-9 microcylinders that enclose one or two more. In the B subfibers there is a crescentic group of 6-7 microcylinders that partially encloses 2-3 more. Microcylinders become packed as though they are independent units; the matrix appears to be an amorphous substance that fills the spaces around the microcylinders. The mean diameter of the microcylinders is 36 A, and they have a center-to-center distance of 56 A. In both respects they resemble wall subunits of flagellar fibers and microtubules and they may be similar structures but with a different localization. The diameter of accessory fibers is about 350 A, which is 25% greater than that of the other flagellar fibers and of cytoplasmic microtubules. Rotation tests suggest that the accessory fibers have 16 wallsubunits.\n      </p>", "In this essay, I argue for the practice of \"coalitional consciousness-building,\" a method of self and collective education toward coalition. The approach itself is based on the radical democratic practice of feminist consciousness-raising, yet reconfigures the method in several ways in light of critiques by women-of-color feminists. In particular, I draw upon the insights of Chandra Talpade Mohanty, Mar\u00eda Lugones, and Bernice Johnson Reagon as well as upon examples of approaches used by consciousness-raising groups that had success in engendering solidarity across multiple lines of difference to suggest a process of coalitional consciousness-building. The process includes the following three steps: (1) sharing experiences related to a theme in a way that pays close attention to the national, racial, and class and other relevant contexts and histories in which the experiences being articulated are being played out; (2) examining the experiences with an eye for the multiple relations of oppression and resistance at play; (3) exploring the barriers to, and possibilities for, coalitional action with regard to the experiences. Such a practice, I argue, could help contribute to the development of a feminist movement culture that is oriented toward the work of building and sustaining coalition.\n      </p>", "Cricket in 21st century India provides a space where all differences are overcome.

Anuran species may differ in their susceptibility to declines based on life-history characteristics, leading to different probabilities of decline and conservation statuses. In this experiment, we looked at two anuran species, Northern Cricket Frogs (Acris crepitans) and Green Frogs (Rana clamitans), reared in mesocosms containing a common invasive or introduced potential predator (Rusty Crayfish, Bluegill Sunfish, or triploid Grass Carp) and imidacloprid, a common insecticide. We found that anurans differed in their sensitivity to these factors. Cricket Frog survival was significantly reduced with imidacloprid exposure, whereas Green Frogs were not. Abundance of both amphibian species was reduced in the presence of predators, particularly the fish. Our study suggests that Cricket Frogs may be especially sensitive to the insecticide imidacloprid, as well as fish predators, and that these factors could contribute to their population declines.\n      </p>", "This paper concerns a computer system which was devised to schedule umpires for the major cricket games played in England.

In the early spermatid there is a single Golgi body, called the acroblast, which is cup-shaped, the walls being composed of a number of parallel membranes. A pro-acrosomal granule then appears within the acroblast. Next, the granule migrates to the nucleus, where it becomes attached. The acroblast then migrates away from the attached granule and is eventually sloughed off. In the first stage of acrosome differentiation the granule assumes the shape of a blunt cone and its base invaginates deeply so that it becomes hollowed. Within the space created by the invagination a new structure forms which, from the first, has the shape of a hollow cone. The two cones constitute the mature acrosome.
