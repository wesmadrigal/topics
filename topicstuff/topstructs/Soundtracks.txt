In a preliminary study and in the main experiment, subjects saw the film accompanied by one of two soundtracks or with no soundtrack, or they heard one of the two soundtracks alone. In the main experiment, Semantic Differential judgments on Activity and Potency dimensions, obtained for the music, predicted effects of the soundtracks on corresponding ratings of the film as compared to ratings in a no soundtrack condition. As well, ratings on the Activity dimension of the film characters themselves were altered by the soundtracks. It is hypothesized that congruent auditory and visual structure directs the encoding of particular visual features of the film. In addition, associations generated by the music provide a context for the interpretation of the action in the film. As a result, stimulus features and concepts that are initially encoded as disjunctive conjoin in perception and memory.\n      </p>", "PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT MUSICAL soundtracks can influence the emotional impact, interpretation, and remembering of visual information. The present research examines the reverse relationship and whether visual information influences the perception and memory of music. In Experiment 1, listeners were presented with affectively ambiguous tunes paired with visual displays varying in their affect (positive, negative) and format (video, montage), or a control condition (no visual information at all). After each, participants were asked to provide a set of perceptual ratings that evaluated different melody characteristics and qualities of the visual displays. Results showed that both the affect and format of visual information differentially influenced the way a melody was perceived. Experiment 2 extended these findings by revealing that the affect of visual displays distorted melody recognition in a mood congruent fashion. These results are discussed in terms of their theoretical implications for audiovisual processing.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The intent here was to investigate whether the affect of music can also contribute to a story's comprehension by guiding the course of selective attending and providing a more elaborative encoding of characters' actions, motivations, and inherent temperament. These ideas were examined by presenting participants with three ambiguous film clips accompanied by positive, negative, and no music. Immediately after viewing each clip, some participants were asked to extrapolate the film's ending, evaluate the personality and motivations of the main character(s), and complete a series of bipolar adjective ratings about the film's actions. In addition, other participants returned a week later for a surprise recognition test that assessed their memory for certain objects within each film. Results revealed that relative to the control group of no music, positive and negative music significantly biased viewers' interpretation and subsequent remembering of a film in a mood-congruent fashion. These findings are discussed in terms of the schematic influences of music upon the cognitive processing of visual scenes.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Early Fancoist musical soundtracks are viewed as sites of crossings and mutual inflections between modern and traditional concepts of Spanish cultural identity.

Following this, the psychoanalytical self-consciousness of dirty realist fiction is explored through Phillips's preoccupation with dreams, the irrational, the family romance, and the maternal body.

That Haneke often denies his audiences the comfort of suturing or conventional musical structures demands closer scrutiny. I explore the openings of representative examples: Cach\u00e9 (2005) and Funny Games (1997, remade in 2007). The structured silences of Cach\u00e9 have the most unnerving power: the absence of any harmonious, rhythmic, or melodic pattern communicates the devastating inconclusiveness that is, in the film, connected with the fallout from colonial tragedy. The sparing use of music in both versions of Funny Games is no less confrontational: the opening collision of operatic and thrashpunk music establishes Haneke\u2019s intent to radically reframe the horror genre. I explore how these soundtracks are crucial for establishing that the films are \u201cinterrogative texts\u201d (to apply Catherine Belsey\u2019s term), films that self-consciously raise unsettling questions as opposed to offering the spectator the formulaic security of classic realism. Ultimately, I argue that the soundtracks of Haneke\u2019s films also call attention to the processes of their construction and manipulation so as to be, in the director\u2019s words, \u201cmore honest.\u201d\n      </p>", "Musical borrowings, or samples, have long been a means of creating lineage between hip-hop and older genres of African-American music such as funk, soul, and rhythm and blues.

Over the past thirty years, the shakuhachi, a Japanese end-blown bamboo flute, has steadily grown in popularity throughout the West. In Japan, the shakuhachi developed from an instrument utilized by the Zen Buddhist priests of the Fuke Shuu (Fuke sect) in a form of meditation known as suizen (blowing Zen) to an instrument, which is presently used internationally not only for meditation, but also in movie soundtracks, contemporary compositions by Western-trained composers, and even jazz. Since the mid-to-late 1960s, the shakuhachi tradition has steadily grown in popularity in the Western world. This is evident with the growing number of non-Japanese recordings, web pages, publications, compositions, local shakuhachi organizations, and e-mail groups. This paper summarizes the history of shakuhachi performance in Japan since 1871 and then describes its introduction to the West from 1960s onward.\n      </p>", "In this research, the development of intermodal perception in infancy was examined by using a new method, the intermodal learning method. 3-month-old infants were given the opportunity to learn a relation between 2 single film and soundtrack pairs through a 2-min familiarization period under 1 of 4 conditions. Films of naturalistic events were accompanied by a soundtrack that was (1) appropriate to the composition of the object and synchronous with its motions, (2) appropriate and nonsynchronous, (3) inappropriate and synchronous, or (4) inappropriate and nonsynchronous. A group of control subjects was familiarized with irrelevant films and soundtracks. Then all subjects were tested in a 2-choice intermodal preference test to determine under which familiarization conditions intermodal learning had occurred. Results indicated that only subjects who had been familiarized with appropriate and synchronous film and soundtrack pairs showed evidence of intermodal learning as compared with the performance of control subjects. Intermodal learning occurred on the basis of 2 kinds of invariant audio-visual relations, temporal synchrony, and temporal microstructure specifying the composition of the object. Intermodal learning did not occur through association on the basis of co-occurrence, nor did it occur when any incongruent audio-visual structure was present.

This is connected to the indirect element, more effective with regards to acoustics, which refers to all the sequences where the dialogue and the cues acquire a pure sound meaning. A further analysis of cinematographic works, starting more from a listening point than a view point, allows us to perceive the \"harmonic soul\" presence in the texture. In fact, the framework, where the director bases and builds his films, is made up of a long series of melodical and harmonical elements: the cinematographic idea, before becoming a filmic form, would have existed already in Visconti's mind like a musical embryo, without any visual evolution. The director keeps in mind the soundtrack's piece structure during the film's making and even manages, on occasion, to interprete visually the expression marks of the musical sheet, and to compose the whole work in a vertical way, harmonising musical and filmic elements like a composer. He obtains at the end the musical-filmic bar, as we could define it. That is why I needed a specific term, musicism, to frame Visconti's peculiar artistic inspiration and his consequent cinematographic use of music.\n      </p>", "This article examines the de- and re-contextualisation of 1960s audio recordings of Balinese kecak performances in two landmark films, Federico Fellini's Satyricon (1969) and Joel and Ethan Coen's Blood Simple (1984). It begins with a historical overview that situates kecak's own history as a Balinese cultural phenomenon within broader frameworks of hybridity, schizophonic and appropriative processes, and international filmmaking, devoting special attention to the contributions of Walter Spies. It then proceeds to close studies of kecak's use in the soundtracks of Satyricon and Blood Simple from a theoretical position of schizophonic transmogrification, which is defined as the rematerialisation and thorough reinvention of people and places whose voices and sounds, as inscribed on sound recordings, have been separated from their original sources of identity and meaning and resituated in entirely alien contexts\u2014real or imaginary or somewhere in between\u2014for purposes that serve especially to evoke the strange, and often the grotesque and sinister as well.\n      </p>", "For over a decade, design culture portals have hosted online resources such as tutorials, examples of compelling design and links to other design-related websites.

These design-culture community websites have also exposed the tensions between production and consumption, professional and amateur practices, work and play and expression/exploration and service. Evolving practices, enabled by networked technologies, have supported a reputation-based system of knowledge building and resource distribution that allow for modest, open creative cultural production to grow outside the commercial realm. While this parallel practice has promoted an expansion of our notion of creative production, it has also been fed in part by corporate mythologies that contribute to the precarious nature of contemporary creative work.

The objects and sounds were united by temporal synchrony and amodal audiovisual information specifying object composition. Infants then participated in one of three types of transfer tests (requiring low, moderate, or high degrees of generalization) to measure the extent to which in-termodal knowledge generalized to a new task and across events (familiar events; change in color/shape; change in substance, motion, and color/shape). Results indicated that infants tested with the familiar events and with events of a new color/shape showed learning and transfer of knowledge. In contrast, infants tested with events of a new substance, motion, and color/shape showed no generalization of learning. Thus, infants of 3.5 months appear to show a moderate degree of generalization of intermodal knowledge across events.

By using electronica music, the films train the audience\u2019s attention to subtle changes of musical texture, which, when synchronized to changes in the image, help to convey the theme of the chance encounter. I argue further that the compositional practices that characterize Tykwer\u2019s approach to film music constitute a fundamental shift not only from the leitmotif-bound tradition of classical Hollywood scoring but also from that same tradition\u2019s Romantic conception of the single, creative artist who works within a musical canon associated with high art.\n      </p>", "This essay argues that film music functions not only as a cross-promotional medium for marketing movies and licensed recordings, but also as a key site for effectively managing and containing processes of consumption.

Infants saw either a normally lighted face (fully illuminated condition) or a moving dot display of a face (point light condition). In Study 1, one woman expressed the affects vocally, another woman expressed the affects facially, and what they said also differed. Infants in the point light condition showed a reliable preference for the affectively concordant displays, while infants in the fully illuminated condition showed no preference for the affectively concordant display. In a second study, the visual and vocal displays were produced by a single individual on one occasion and were presented to infants 5 sec out of synchrony.
