{"total_words": 456, "documents": ["Photographs of San descendants from Prieska, Northern Cape, form part of the Bleek Collection, Oppenheimer Library, University of Cape Town. They show some of the Prieska San performing a dance and were taken by Dorothea Bleek in late 1910, or possibly early 1911. A particular posture adopted by dancers in some of these photographs, stooped and supported by two sticks, is represented in San rock paintings. It has also been observed in the rites of some San-speakers, as well as those of some southern Bantu-speakers in South Africa. This article investigates the symbolism of the dancing sticks and whether the rites in which these sticks are employed originated with the San or whether they originated with southern Bantu-speakers. It is suggested that the sticks were used to support trancing San shamans, as has been proposed previously, but that in at least some cases they also symbolized the front legs of an animal into which a shaman was transforming. The rite probably had its origins amongst the San, but, in some cases, the meaning attached to it may have changed as San and southern Bantu-speakers exerted a mutual influence on each others' cultures.\n      </p>", "This paper explores the motivations and experiences of British women working as lap dancers in the tourist resorts of southern Tenerife, with a particular focus on the subjective choices and processes undertaken by working-class women in the embodiment of positively evaluated identities. It uses Skeggs' theoretical framework of 'becoming respectable' (1997) alongside other debates on 'identity management' in order to begin mapping the ways in which migrant British lap dancers produce themselves, negotiate gender and class, and seek forms of respectability, reputability and honour through their work. Drawing on empirical data, it will discuss how strong disassociations with the Other are formed, and how and why important binaries, particularly distinctions between lap dancing and prostitution and lap dancing and other 'degraded' forms of work and lifestyle are drawn in the dancers' own stories of themselves. It will look at notions and processes of gaining 'respectability' through part of a wider migrant discourse, exploring how being a migrant lap dancer can serve as a vehicle for reproducing a 'respectable' and otherwise positively evaluated self on several levels.\n      </p>", "The recent Supreme Court ruling in favor of \"Erie, Pennsylvania against the Kandyland Club,\" which upheld a city ordinance prohibiting the club's dancers from performing in the nude, exemplifies what Kathy Davis has defined as \"society's impulse to keep women's bodies under 'constant surveillance'\" (1997, 11). The case illustrates complex, often contradictory, assessments of the empirical and metaphoric significance of the female body, specifically as it is presented on stage, and also raises issues of sexual control, of the distinctions between speech and conduct, and of a seemingly deliberate judicial misreading of the expressive elements of exotic dancing. Naked Politics argues that the Kandyland case is a particularly blatant incident in a long history of patriarchal efforts to regulate the theatrical display of women's bodies, and that the Court's ruling reveals its allegiance to a presumptive \"moral\" code more sacred (to itself) than the Constitutional protections it is sworn to uphold.\n      </p>", "Dancing and trophallactic behaviour of forager honey bees, Apis mellifera ligustica Spinola, that returned from an automatic feeder with a regulated flow rate of 50% weight-to-weight sucrose solution (range: 0.76-7.65 \u03bcl/min) were studied in an observation hive. Behavioural parameters of dancing, such as probability, duration and dance tempo, increased with the nectar flow rate, though with very different response curves among bees. For trophallaxis (i.e. mouth-to-mouth exchange of food), the frequency of giving-contacts and the transfer rate of the nectar increased with the nectar flow rate. After unloading, foragers often approached other nest mates and begged for food before returning to the food source. This behaviour was less frequent at higher nectar flow rates. These results show that the profitability of a food source in terms of nectar flow rate had a quantitative representation in the hive through quantitative changes in trophallactic and dancing behaviour. The role of trophallaxis as a communication channel during recruitment is discussed.\n      </p>", "Dancing figures are shown in a variety of contexts in medieval art. Some have a positive significance, for example those in Ambrogio Lorenzetti's Siena fresco of Good Government. Others, especially figures dancing singly or in couples, are condemned. A negative attitude to dance is also prevalent in literary texts. It is argued here that this negativity, which is a reaction to a threatening sexuality in the single and couple dances, is, as it were, neutralized in round and circle dances. The circle represents metaphorically the acceptance of the couple into the social fabric, especially through marriage.\n      </p>", "The performance of belly dancing in the West embodies a central paradox: while invoking Orientalist tropes in its appropriation of Middle Eastern dances, it is cast as a celebratory form of women's empowerment that destabilizes Western patriarchy. Exploring these contradictory claims, the author situates the predicaments of gender and interculturalism that surface in discourses about Western belly dance.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "Nectar foraging in honey bees is regulated by several communication signals that are performed mainly by foragers. One of these signals is the tremble dance, which is consistently performed by foragers from a rich food source which, upon return to the hive, experience a long delay before unloading their nectar to a nectar receiver. Although tremble dancing has been studied extensively using artificial nectar sources, its occurrence and context in a more natural setting remain unknown. Therefore, this study tests the sufficiency of the current explanations for tremble dancing by free-foraging honey bees. The main finding is that only about half of the observations of tremble dancing, referred to as delay-type tremble dancing, are a result of difficulty in finding a nectar receiver. In the remaining observations, tremble dancing was initiated immediately upon entering the hive, referred to as non-delay-type tremble dancing. Non-delay tremble dancing was associated with first foraging successes, both in a forager's career and in a single day. More than 75% of tremble dancing was associated with good foraging conditions, as indicated by the dancer continuing to forage after dancing. However, at least some of the other cases were associated with deteriorated foraging conditions, such as the end of the day, after which foraging was discontinued. No common context could be identified that explains all cases of tremble dancing or the subset of non-delay-type tremble dancing. This study shows that the current explanations for the cause of the tremble dance are insufficient to explain all tremble dancing in honey bees that forage at natural food sources.\n      </p>", "The Bible gives us many characterizations of the dance and its importance in Iron Age Israel.

This illegal profession negatively impacts wild populations because cubs are poached to fuel it. It also raises serious welfare issues for the bears. Poor enforcement, a lack of adequate facilities for confiscated bears, and sustainable alternative sources of revenue for the bears' owners have allowed it to continue. Since the late 1990s, a number of wildlife organizations have focused on this issue. Despite recent claims that it had been eradicated in India, a thorough assessment of its current status was lacking. We report on a 2010 nationwide survey of dancing bears in India and show that, despite significant achievement in reducing the number of bears involved, the practice is still prevalent, typically in rural, remote, or inaccessible areas (in at least 7 states across India). Therefore, it remains a conservation and animal welfare issue that needs to be addressed.\n      </p>", "Postcolonial theory assists in making apparent the essentialism of \"self\" and \"other\" that characterizes Eurocentric colonial discourse. A North American postcolonial hermeneutic is proposed that focuses on the oral voice of tradition embodied in the lived experience of an indigenous community. Postcolonial interpretation entails an interpreter entering into ritual relationship with a traditional community so that the hegemonic pattern of dominant-culture discourse is circumvented. The traditional practices of the Wakpamni Lake community on Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota provide the local context for understanding Sun Dancing as a postcolonial undertaking. The postcolonial character of Sun Dancing at Wakpamni Lake is identified through four interrelated features described as four ways of respect. This Sun Dancing expresses a religious praxis, described as a politics of kinship, that contradicts the colonizing power relations rooted in European American cultural heritage. This politics of kinship offers the dominant culture a way to intercultural relationship that disarms the entrenched essentialism of \"self\" and \"other.\"\n      </p>", "This paper offers a case history of the BBC's ambivalent engagement with dance music during the Second World War. It examines what 'dance music' meant to the BBC, musicians, and the public, and how they contested and performed those meanings in the context of new social dance practices and the growing popularity of what became known as 'swing' in Britain. Although broadcasting in effect disembodied music closely associated with the physical, the BBC was a primary way for people to access dance music which supported their bodily acts of leisure and regimentation. The BBC's study and regulation of dance music centred around two goals: pleasing important groups in national service and broadcasting morale-boosting music. The problem of whether these goals were congruent lay at the heart of the issue, for the youth active in national service emerged as the primary audience for the two genres - 'swing' and 'sentimentality' - about which the BBC felt most dubious.\n      </p>", "Dancing must be an integral part of our understanding of Greek tragedy as a form of dance drama, but its reconstruction is obscure.

One of the characteristics of the political environment that produces women's praise singing and dancing in Malawi is the unequal relationship between politicians and the people they lead, which can generally be characterized as patron-client. Politicians enact their roles as patrons at public functions by giving material gifts to women performers, giving them an incentive to join the party, dance in its service, and ultimately vote for its politicians. This article explores the institution of women's political praise dancing and singing in Malawi party politics, especially during the campaigning for the second multi-party elections that took place in 1999. I situate this practice within the context of patron-client relationships and question whether women are acting as conscious agents when they dance or whether they are strategically manipulated and exploited by politicians.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

His work focused on the Predynastic figurines of Egypt, and concluded that there was nothing divine about them. They were probably dolls, ancestor figures, talismanic pregnancy aids, tools for sex instruction and puberty rites, twin substitutes in graves and concubine grave figurines. Since then, this group of figurines has received minimal attention. Using Ucko's four-stage methodology, this study more closely examines these figurines in the context of Ancient Egyptian culture and religion, with specific attention to the contemporary Sudanese religious beliefs and practices, which may share roots with Predynastic Egyptian culture. This study concludes that some Dynastic religious beliefs and iconography relating to female deities can be recognised in many of these figurines, and can be traced back to prehistoric Nilotic rituals.\n      </p>", "This study presents an analysis of one event-break dancing-in an ongoing three-year study of social identification and interactions between Ute, Navajo, and Anglo students, their communities, and their high school. It presents one social group or clique, break dancers, in a larger, intertwined set of social interactions in the school and community. In response to continual academic failure and social isolation, these Indian students turn to break dancing to express their uniqueness, facilitate intragroup communication, create group identity, and achieve a kind of success in an otherwise indifferent or negative school and community environment.\n      </p>", "Rio's pre-Lenten carnival and its Afro-Brazilian dance, samba, have been symbols of Brazilian identity since the 1930s. This article explores the choreographical antecedents of samba, before the crystallisation of the modern dance genre with that name, highlighting the importance of earlier social dances in the evolution of the twentieth-century symbol. It traces the development of carnival dancing in Rio de Janeiro from the time when few danced, through the long reign of the polka, to the emergence of generalised carnival street dancing around 1889. A modified view of the roots of samba has interesting implications for on-going debates on the social meaning of Brazilian carnival.\n      </p>", "A mathematical model is formulated for decision making by honeybees during nest-site choice, using a population matrix model.

Through an exploration of how tradition has been perceived and used in Malawi's political sphere, Gilman argues that though tradition does exist as a selective process-people choose to endow certain cultural practices with special meaning because they link them to the past-they often do so unconsciously. It is because people think of traditions as directly linked to the past that they have a deep-felt commitment to continue them into the future. It is this distinction between the reality of tradition as process and the idea of tradition as authentic and static that makes it powerful hegemonically. In Malawi, political leaders have exploited women as political dancers and praise singers in the name of local \"tradition,\" notably during the dictatorial rule of Dr. Hastings Kamuzu Banda (1964-94) and throughout the contemporary multiparty era. Because many people in Malawi have come to accept women's political dancing as their tradition, many endow it with special meaning and feel committed to continuing it into the future even when it contributes to the perpetuation of political and economic inequities.\n      </p>", "Honeybees present a paradox that is unusual among the social Hymenoptera: extremely promiscuous queens generate colonies of nonreproducing workers who cooperate to rear reproductives with whom they share limited kinship. Extreme polyandry, which lowers relatedness but creates within-colony genetic diversity, produces substantial fitness benefits for honeybee queens and their colonies because of increased disease resistance and workforce productivity. However, the way that these increases are generated by individuals in genetically diverse colonies remains a mystery. We assayed the foraging and dancing performances of workers in multiple-patriline and single-patriline colonies to discover how within-colony genetic diversity, conferred to colonies by polyandrous queens, gives rise to a more productive foraging effort. We also determined whether the initiation by foragers of waggle-dance signaling in response to an increasing sucrose stimulus (their dance response thresholds) was linked to patriline membership. Per capita, foragers in multiple-patriline colonies visited a food source more often and advertised it with more waggle-dance signals than foragers from single-patriline colonies, although there was variability among multiple-patriline colonies in the strength of this difference. High-participation patrilines emerged within multiple-patriline colonies, but their more numerous foragers and dancers were neither more active per capita nor lower-threshold dancers than their counterparts from low-participation patrilines. Our results demonstrate that extreme polyandry does not enhance recruitment effort through the introduction of low-dance-threshold, highactivity workers into a colony's population. Rather, genetic diversity is critical for injecting into a colony's workforce social facilitators who are more likely to become engaged in foraging-related activities, so boosting the production of dance signals and a colony's responsiveness to profitable food sources.\n      </p>", "This article considers ragtime dancing within the contexts of American minstrelsy, African American migration, and European immigration. Based on archival research and drawing upon contemporary minstrelsy scholarship, I argue that ragtime dancing of the early twentieth century can be understood as a form of participatory minstrelsy that allowed dancers to embody markers of \"blackness.\" I further suggest that, as they danced \"black\" to ragtime music, European immigrant youths distanced themselves from African Americans and facilitated their own strategic assimilation as Americans.\n      </p>", "In this article I look at the European legacy of Graeco-Roman pantomime dancing through the prism of statuary. Starting from the late antique Descriptiones of the sophist and art critic Callistratus, a text which, as I argue, is mediated by the aesthetic experience and performance practice of the pantomime stage, I consider some fascinating early modern ways of coupling theatrical mimesis with the plastic arts, namely, the so-called \"Attitudes\" of Lady Emma Hamilton and the equestrian pantomimes of Andrew Ducrow. What they share with ancient pantomime is the art of building character and passion through mute corporeal eloquence as well as the thrilling experience of bridging the statuesqueness of the plastic arts and the unfolding narrative of the dramatic stage, a blend which was a distinctive feature of ancient pantomime dancing.\n      </p>", "This article provides an in-depth analysis of Sally Potter's \"The Tango Lesson\" (1997), viewing it as a highly theoretical and pedagogical work of feminist film theory. While creating a modernist narrative concerning her real-life adventures in learning the tango and falling in love with her dance instructor, Potter simultaneously touches on such complex issues as female authorship, sexual representation, the politics of romantic pleasure, the history of the film musical, and the cultural and gendered legacy of ballroom dancing.\n      </p>", "ith <a
