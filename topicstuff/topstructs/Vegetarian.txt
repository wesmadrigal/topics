{"total_words": 347, "documents": ["To explore the relation between esophageal cancer and dietary trace elements in humans, we estimated the average daily intake of zinc, copper, iron, selenium, molybdenum, silicon, cadmium, and nickel in 21 Chinese communes, where the annual mortality rate from esophageal cancer among the population 30 years of age and over ranged from 0 to 495/100,000 person-years. We also estimated the relative level of calcium consumption. Zinc and copper intake were inversely related to esophageal cancer mortality, and calcium intake level was positively related to esophageal cancer mortality. The predicted esophageal cancer mortality among a vegetarian population with a high level of dietary calcium and a low level of dietary zinc was 5.3 times as high as that in a vegetarian population with a low level of dietary calcium and a high level of dietary zinc. The influence of a high level of dietary calcium in a vegetarian population may be explained by a reduction in the absorption of dietary zinc.\n      </p>", "Kathryn Paxton George's recent publication, Animal, Vegetable, or Woman? (2000), is the culmination of more than a decade's work and encompasses standard and original arguments against the feminist-vegetarian connection. This paper demonstrates that George's key arguments are deeply flawed, antithetical to basic feminist commitments, and beg the question against fundamental aspects of the debate. Those who do not accept the feminist-vegetarian connection should rethink their position or offer a non-question-begging defense of it.\n      </p>", "In a randomised crossover trial 58 subjects aged 30-64 with mild untreated hypertension were allocated either to a control group eating a typical omnivorous diet or to one of two groups eating an ovolactovegetarian diet for one of two six week periods. A fall in systolic blood pressure of the order of 5 mm Hg occurred during the vegetarian diet periods, with a corresponding rise on resuming a meat diet. The main nutrient changes with the vegetarian diet included an increase in the ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fats and intake of fibre, calcium, and magnesium and a decrease in the intake of protein and vitamin ${\\rm B}_{12}$ . There were no consistent changes in urinary sodium or potassium excretion or body weight. In untreated subjects with mild hypertension, changing to a vegetarian diet may bring about a worthwhile fall in systolic blood pressure.\n      </p>", "Biosphere 2 is a 3.15-acre space containing an ecosystem that is energetically open (sunlight, electric power, and heat) but materially closed, with air, water, and organic material being recycled. Since September 1991, eight subjects (four women and four men) have been sealed inside, living on food crops grown within. Their diet, low in calories (average, 1780 kcal/day; 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ), low in fat (10% of calories), and nutrient-dense, conforms to that which in numerous animal experiments has promoted health, retarded aging, and extended maximum life span. We report here medical data on the eight subjects, comparing preclosure data with data through 6 months of closure. Significant changes included: (i) weight, 74 to 62 kg (men) and 61 to 54 kg (women); (ii) mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure (eight subjects), 109/74 to 89/58 mmHg (1 mmHg = 133 Pa); (iii) total serum cholesterol, from 191 \u00b1 11 to 123 \u00b1 9 mg/dl (mean \u00b1 SD; 36% mean reduction), and high density lipoprotein, from 62 \u00b1 8 to 38 \u00b1 5 (risk ratio unchanged); (iv) triglyceride, 139 to 96 mg/dl (men) and 78 to 114 mg/dl (women); (v) fasting glucose, 92 to 74 mg/dl; (vi) leukocyte count, 6.7 to 4.7 x 109 cells per liter. We conclude that drastic reductions in cholesterol and blood pressure may be instituted in normal individuals in Western countries by application of a carefully chosen diet and that a low-calorie nutrient-dense regime shows physiologic features in humans similar to those in other animal species.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Most of the literature focuses on animals as prey. In this study, we investigate the occurrence of algae inside the traps of four species of bladderwort. We observed that algae of 45 genera form up to 80% of the total prey; algae were found frequently in traps without animal prey. The majority are coccal and trichal algae of the families Desmidiaceae and Zygnemataceae. The percentage of algae increases significantly with decreasing electric conductivity of the water ( $r_S = 0.417$&lt;/ ; P = 0,000). Thus, algae are the most frequent prey in extremely soft waters. The percentage of algae did not differ significantly, not within the investigated Utricularia species or within the various study sites. However, the taxonomic composition of the algal prey showed highly significant differences between different sites. More than 90% of the trapped algae were killed and degraded by the bladders. The recent data allow for two alternative hypotheses: either algal prey supplements animal prey in oligotrophic waters, or the unprofitable trapping of algae is rather an additional stress factor for Utricularia and contributes to its limited distribution in some peat bogs.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Moralization converts preferences into values, and in doing so influences cross-generational transmission (because values are passed more effectively in families than are preferences), increases the likelihood of internalization, invokes greater emotional response, and mobilizes the support of governmental and other cultural institutions. In recent decades, we claim, cigarette smoking in America has become moralized. We support our claims about some of the consequences of moralization with an analysis of differences between health and moral vegetarians. Compared with health vegetarians, moral vegetarians find meat more disgusting, offer more reasons in support of their meat avoidance, and avoid a wider range of animal foods.

Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: United Kingdom. Participants: About 11 000 non-meat eaters and their meat eating friends and relatives, with a median age of 33 years were recruited between 1980 and 1984. More than 20% of the cohort had a self reported BMI below 20 kg/m\u00b2 at recruitment. There were 195 000 person years of observation after a mean of 18.0 years of follow up. Main results: The characteristics of participants with a BMI below 18 kg/m\u00b2 were favourable to a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. Nevertheless, these participants had an increased all cause death rate ratio (2.07, 95% CI 1.58 to 2.70) in comparison with participants who had a BMI between 20 and 22 kg/m\u00b2. The death rate ratio for the slimmest category was also significantly increased for circulatory diseases (including ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease), respiratory diseases, and all other causes combined excluding all malignant neoplasms. This finding was consistent across a range of subgroups. Conclusions: Lean men and women (BMI &lt;18 kg/m\u00b2) experience increased all cause mortality compared with those with a BMI between 20 and 22 kg/m\u00b2. This pattern is not seen for cancer mortality, but is found for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.

Design: Prospective cohort study in which IQ was assessed by tests of mental ability at age 10 years and vegetarianism by self-report at age 30 years. Setting: Great Britain. Participants: 8170 men and women aged 30 years participating in the 1970 British cohort study, a national birth cohort. Main outcome measures: Self-reported vegetarianism and type of diet followed. Results: 366 (4.5%) participants said they were vegetarian, although 123 (33.6%) admitted eating fish or chicken. Vegetarians were more likely to be female, to be of higher social class (both in childhood and currently), and to have attained higher academic or vocational qualifications, although these socioeconomic advantages were not reflected in their income. Higher IQ at age 10 years was associated with an increased likelihood of being vegetarian at age 30 (odds ratio for one standard deviation increase in childhood IQ score 1.38, 95% confidence interval 1.24 to 1.53). IQ remained a statistically significant predictor of being vegetarian as an adult after adjustment for social class (both in childhood and currently), academic or vocational qualifications, and sex (1.20, 1.06 to 1.36). Exclusion of those who said they were vegetarian but ate fish or chicken had little effect on the strength of this association. Conclusion: Higher scores for IQ in childhood are associated with an increased likelihood of being a vegetarian as an adult.\n      </p>", "This paper examines the aesthetics and pragmatics of packaged food consumption in the twin transnational communities of the urban middle class in Bangalore city in south India, and the diasporic middle class Indian community in Boston, USA. It investigates the construction of an ethnic `Indian' identity in a multicultural field through ritualized food consumption, focusing upon the relationship between `authentic' consumption, the anxieties of motherhood and the politics of family provisioning among South Asians. I argue that several narratives are at play in the provisioning and consumption of \"Indian\" food. Food provisioning is fuelled by a \"meta-narrative of loss\" in which food consumption is seen as a \"narrative of affiliative desire\" that affectively recreates caste, micro regional and other social identity groupings for the cosmopolitan Indian family. Fuelled by a \"narrative of anxiety\" over \"authentic\" foods- \"as mother made them\"-the act of eating is transformed into a performance of \"gastro-nostalgia\" that attempts to create a cultural utopia of ethnic Indian- ness that is conceptually delinked from the Indian nation state. Finally, \"narratives of subterfuge\", often invest the preparation of these packaged heat-and-eat \"home made\" foods, as cosmopolitan South Asian women attempt to be socially acceptable models of domesticity. The burgeoning transnational packaged Indian food industry that enables such utopic eating is examined in socio-historical terms to complement the perspective by adding the component of the economic sub-structure that underpins this meaningful eating. The analysis turns upon a close examination of cultural exchange in the anthropology of commodities through structurally convergent traditions of eating in these two communities.\n      </p>", "Dumont argues that the opposition between higher vegetarian and lower meat-eating deities is a structuring principle of the Hindu pantheon, and that Hindu divinity is ralational. However, the opposition is rather between deities offered only vegetarian food in worship and those offered sacrifices. Data on south Indian village goddesses show that they are internally segmented into higher and lower forms, and this relational aspect is homologous with that between distinct higher and lower deities. But the relational divinity of village deities is largely replaced by substantial divinity for purely vegetarian Sanskritic deities, whose quality of highness is dissociated from a complementary lowness. Thus Sanskritic deities symbolise a Brahmanical ideal wherein relationships with inferiors are denied, whereas the cult of deities mainly worshipped by low castes legitimates the caste system. The significance of this result for analysis of Hindu religious ideology is highlighted by a comparison with black American Christianity.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Those who remain in Fiji have faced increasing marginalisation as the government of Prime Minister Qarase has proposed significant reforms to both the administration of land and Constitutional arrangements of political representation. The situation has been further compounded through Qarase's recently proposed ' Unity Bill', which would grant amnesty to some of those responsible for the 2000 coup. These reforms are all part of an effort to ensure the ' paramountcy' of indigenous Fijians as well as to limit Indo-Fijian participation in Fijian national politics. In this paper, I employ Greenhouse's concept of ' empirical citizenship' to analyse Indo-Fijian responses to their political marginalisation in Fiji. After considering how national identities and sentiments of belonging are expressed in Indo-Fijian discourse through the symbolic inter-connection of the land and the Indo-Fijian body, I argue that even if Indo-Fijians are openly willing to recognize indigenous Fijian supremacy in national politics and the project of nation-making, assertions of their right to live and labour on Fijian land constitute claims to ' citizenship' that are highly contestable in Fiji's current political climate.\n      </p>", "           ", "As part of a nutritional surveillance system of primary school children the relation between growth and vegetarianism in the Urdu, Gujarati, and Punjabi groups was explored.
