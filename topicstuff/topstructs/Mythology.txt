For the overwhelming majority of the Soviet people, however, it was presented in a form that was more mythological than ideological. This article analyzes the mythological use of the main ideas of Marxism-Leninism during the Soviet period. This mythology was used as one of the major bases for building a common Soviet national identity among the myriad ethnic groups living on Soviet soil. The rise of nationalism during the Gorbachev period and the rapid disintegration of the Soviet Union highlight the failure of the Soviet leadership to build a common Soviet identity that might have formed the basis for a more stable Soviet nation-state.\n      </p>", "This paper intends, first, to articulate the structure of what may be called the \"Central Asian type\" of the mythology of the origin of death and, then, to pursue the question of its origin and diffusion. Its basic scenario may be summarized as follows: God makes the first man from a piece of earth but is unable to give him breath or soul to make him a living creature. In order to procure the life-giving soul for him, this God ascends to the celestial Supreme Being, or more generally, to the heavenly world, leaving a naked dog behind for the protection of his creature. While he is away, the Devil comes, tempts the dog with the promise of a pelt, and defiles the body of the first man by spitting on him, making him mortal. The mythic story characterized by this motif of religious dualism is widely disseminated in Central Asia and Siberia, but it is also documented among the Uralo-Ugrics, the Russians, and some of the eastern Europeans. While it has been customary among scholars to discuss these variants under the category of Menschensch\u00f6pfungsmythe, we would hold that they can be most properly considered in the context of the mythology of the origin of death. As to the historical origin of what we now call the Central Asian mythology of the origin of death, we would suggest that it may have taken shape outside Iran, probably in a particular area of Central Asia close to the Indo-Iranian border, and chronologically well before the end of the ninth century A. D.\n      </p>", "The paper analyses A. F. Losev's argument for the identity of dialectical and mythical thinking which forms the key part of his theory of absolute mythology. Losev claims that dialectical thinking is limited by phenomenological intuition. He fails to recognise, however, that this intuition itself is a product of thinking. The same is true of Losev's concept of 'life' that is designed to limit intellectual reflection. The mystery of the Absolute is, contrary to Losev's claim, not a threshold that dialectical thinking cannot cross, but it is, in fact, realised only by such thinking. This has a bearing on the Christian Neoplatonist doctrine of energistic symbolism, which also plays a crucial part in Losev's philosophy of myth. Under the pressure of the Neoplatonist tradition Losev violates the demands of dialectical thinking in favour of myth's essential mysticism. And yet, because of the dialectical relation between rationalism and mysticism, Losev's attempt was not a failure, but a valuable contribution to the task of illuminating this relation.\n      </p>", "In Central and East Asian mythology, two antagonistic divine beings (e. g., Maitreya and S\u0101kyamuni) are often involved in dispute, vying with each other for sovereignty over the world, an island, a piece of land, or over the human destiny. They decide to settle the dispute by a flower contest; the one who would be the first to see a flower bloom in midnight should be the sovereign. This myth of the flower contest is found extensively in the Ryukyus, Korea, and Central Asia. After identifying the various thematic contexts into which it has been integrated, I would suggest that the myth probably originated somewhere in Central Asia, possibly among the Buriats, under the strong influence of syncretistic Iranian traditions.\n      </p>", "In this paper I seek to challenge the dominant modes of conceiving the relationship between memory and national identity, and in so doing offer analysts of nationalism an improved understanding of the dynamics of national identity formation. The concept of collective memory is invoked regularly in attempts to explain the pervasiveness and power of nationalism. I argue that the concept is misused routinely in this context, and instead I employ a 'social agency' approach to theorizing, whereby memory is conceived in a more limited and cogent manner. I argue that it is important to distinguish clearly between memory and mythology, both of which are essential to understanding national identity, for not only are the two concepts distinct, they can also act in opposition to each other. Following from this I introduce the notion of a 'mythscape', the temporally and spatially extended discursive realm in which the myths of the nation are forged, transmitted, negotiated, and reconstructed constantly. Through employing the idea of a mythscape we can relate memory and mythology to each other in a theoretically profitable way.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "Cultural change can be read from mythological material.

E. From an early perception of her as a beneficent goddess, slayer of the demon Mahi\u1e63a and protector of welfare and fertility, we see later portrayals of her with a frightful countenance and a predilection for graveyards. This change is traced through the mythology to poorly understood Tantric practices that deteriorated into black magic and the coercion of the goddess's power for evil purposes, causing her image in Java to become tarnished and turning her into an evil demon.\n      </p>", "This paper reinterprets the structural interpretation of Greek mythology presented by Leach and L\u00e9vi-Strauss from a feminist perspective. The reinterpretation approaches the Oedipus myth and Freud's analysis of it from the perspective of Antigone, daughter of Oedipus and a hero of Sophoclean tragedy. Ancient Greek tragedy allowed a few mythic women the role of hero, although women in ancient Greek society were confined to the domestic sphere. The paper discusses Antigone, Electra, and other mythic women in their relations to family and the public domain. The interpretation of Greek mythology differs from previous ones but is not inconsistent with them.\n      </p>", "In 1947, two years after the end of the Second World War, religious leaders of the Hopi Indians in Arizona were convinced that the last days of the earth were approaching, and therefore they decided to proclaim their secret prophecies to the world at large.

In the past, non-Semitic versions have often been quoted as evidence for the historical accuracy of the biblical record. In the 1870s, the dependence of the Genesis account on Mesopotamian (cuneiform) mythology became a fact recognized by scholarship. Biblical scholars, though, continued to refer to non-Semitic deluge tales in order to elucidate the nature or (alleged) pre-history of the biblical version. This paper analyzes and evaluates twenty-three contributions anthropologists and biblical scholars made to the study of non-Semitic deluge mythology between 1869 and 1981. While some of the older collections of deluge stories continue to be useful (especially those compiled by James George Frazer and Johannes Riem), there are three kinds of studies that provide rich material for comparative research: (a) collections of flood stories recorded in several versions; (b) studies of the various flood traditions current in ancient Greece, India, and Africa; (c) studies of \"syncretistic\" deluge mythologies reflecting the missionary influence which has often been underestimated by biblical scholars.\n      </p>", "Pygmies have long served, both in Western imagination and in Western science, as a sheet anchor for racial hierarchies and for putative sequences of human physical and social evolution. In the course of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Western exploration in Africa, Asia and the Pacific generated what might broadly be termed a colonial 'Pygmy mythology', composed of a set of characteristics deemed diagnostic of this diminutive 'race', articulated with an exceptional degree of confidence by travellers and metropolitan scientists alike. This paper charts the manner in which the three central tropes of racist denigration - the primordial, the infantile and the bestial - have been applied to excess in the description of Pygmies. Yet Pygmies have also been enlisted by colonial observers in an unlikely alliance, as third-party foils in arguments that seek to naturalize the conditions of colonial subjugation of non-Pygmy others. The impetus for this strange alliance is considered through reference to the recent re-discovery by the revisionist historian, Keith Windschuttle, of a Pygmy past in the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.\n      </p>", "The corporation today does not live up to the mythical personality and attributes with which it has been endowed by jurisprudence and business folklore.

E.) was associated with the Hindu goddesses Durg\u0101 and Dewi \u015ari, goddesses who came to be matched with the malevolent and benevolent sides, respectively, of Nyai Lara Kidul's vacillating character.

The roots of his religious crisis of 1927, which lie buried in the conflicts of his adolescent years, find first expression in the \"Libro de poemas\" (1921), taking at least three forms: (1) the use of small animals to voice religious questions, as in \"Encuentros de un caracol aventurero\" and \"\u00a1Cigarra!,\" (2) a contemplation of nature cloaking a deep spiritual debate, as in \"Canci\u00f3n oto\u00f1al\" and \"Los \u00e1lamos de plata,\" or (3) the unorthodox juxtaposition of Biblical figures with those from classical mythology to raise doubts about Christianity, as in \"Mar\" and \"Ma\u00f1ana.\" These poems, little-studied but typical of about one third of the collection, merit serious examination because they contain the first evidence of Lorca's religious struggles and associated imagery developed in later works, such as \"Poeta en Nueva York\" and \"Llanto por Ignacio S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00edas\".\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "This brief paper discusses Ratu Kidul, the Queen of the Southern Ocean, as ruler over the waters, both fresh and salty, on earth and in the clouds.

Even \"mythological\" scenes can lend insight into real-life activities like food production. One such activity, fishing, is especially prominent in Roman African mosaics.

One mosaic depicts Ulysses' encounter with the Sirens, while the second represents the god Bacchus transforming his would-be kidnappers into dolphins. The fishing scenes are incorporated into the mythological scenes and show fishermen harvesting the adjacent waters. The details of these fishing scenes are striking considering the inland location of Dougga, some 60 miles (100 km) from the sea, in the middle of Roman Africa's agricultural heartland. The inclusion of these fishing scenes in the \"House of Ulysses\" mosaics suggests that the house's owner had a close connection with the sea, and perhaps alludes to the Roman infrastructure that would have brought marine products to the interior.\n      </p>", "Si l'on consent \u00e0 traiter certains \u00e9pisodes des l\u00e9gendes de Pers\u00e9e et de Jason comme des variantes, on constate que les Gr\u00e9es dans l'une, les sympl\u00e9gades dans l'autre occupent la m\u00eame place et remplissent la m\u00eame fonction.

The mythology focused on the fiction of 'General Ludd' and his armies. This was a psychological response to the militarization of the population during the Napoleonic Wars. The creation of a mythology was reflective of provincial consciousness, uniting the north of England against their national enemies in government as well as their local enemies in the factories.

By examining a selection of important classical burlesques, some of which were never published, describing their authors and audiences, and situating them within their theatrical, historical, and ideological contexts, the article concludes that working-class and lower middle-class theatregoers of both sexes must have been much more familiar with classical mythology than they have been given credit for hitherto.\n      </p>", "Among the Carib groups of the Guianas the fauna is classified primarily in terms of heuristic devices.

Viewed from an 'alliance' perspective, the mythology is an accurate 'model' of Avatip social structure, but distorted for ideological reasons in a specific and very simple way.

This opus constitutes, in effect, Haydn's debut at the Esterh\u00e1zy court in 1761, a year in which the Transit of Venus across the sun attracted local and global fascination and intense astronomic study. Beyond demonstrating his cultural range to the court, Haydn's focus on the sun's trajectory also helps to explain many of the puzzling musical features of the trilogy, especially the unusual slow movements. These works cast new light on Haydn's return to musical settings of the diurnal cycle at the dusk of his career, in The Creation (1798) and The Seasons (1801), and reflect the Enlightenment composer's engagement with multiple fields of knowledge and experience.\n      </p>", "Nietzsche's \"The Birth of Tragedy\", and early 20th century Russians' interpretations and embellishments of it, informed Losev's theories of music and myth and his studies of the religions of Apollo and Dionysus.

Education and culture continued to be based on classical literature, and classical literature was inescapably polytheistic. The tension was only resolved by the creation of a Christian culture based on the Bible in the 7th century. Meanwhile, mythology and Christianity enjoyed a reasonably peaceful coexistence, comparable to their coexistence in the Renaissance, exemplified by the paintings of Poussin. So Antioch and Berytus continued to derive pride from their mythical origins; orators, poets, silversmiths and mosaic artists all continued to draw on mythological themes to add to the expressiveness of their respective works. The adventures of the god Dionysus remained particularly popular, but the Dionysiaca of Nonnus, the longest surviving ancient epic, should not be read as an expresssion of specifically pagan religiosity. Christians could accommodate themselves to purely literary use of myth.

The current dispute between the two largest of the former Soviet republics is deeply rooted in history, as the Russian side often uses historical arguments in its attempts to claim the Russian Federation's jurisdiction over the Crimea in general and the city of Sevastopol in particular. In doing so the Russian politicians often make use of highly developed historical mythology that presents Sevastopol as a symbol of Russian national glory and portrays Ukrainian jurisdiction over the city as a historical misunderstanding. This article discusses the development of Sevastopol mythology in Imperial and Soviet Russia from the times of the Crimean War till the dissolution of the USSR. It does so by placing Sevastopol mythology in the broader context of the development of Russian national identity and follows the changes in the functioning of the myth through more than a century. The article examines the atmosphere in which the myth of Sevastopol as a city of Russian glory was formed and how it managed to survive the dramatic changes that occurred in the former Russian Empire after the Revolution. It also discusses the ways in which the old imperial myth was transformed in order to meet the requirements of Soviet ideology and, within the last decade, of the ideological and political goals pursued by the new Russian state.\n      </p>", "This essay enquires into the depictions of Justice through the ages, as well as into the myths surrounding these depictions, more particularly in Egypt, Greece, and Rome, as well as in modern times. The essay departs in significant respects from traditional interpretations by seeking to gain from the insights in relation to mythology and the use of symbols provided by psychoanalysis, structuralism, Heidegger's thinking on Being, and deconstruction. Insofar as psychoanalysis is concerned, of importance in the present context is Freud's analysis of symbolism in the interpretation of dreams and in myths, specifically his contention that the symbols employed there almost invariably have a sexual connotation. The approach of Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss is the focus of the detour through structuralism, with L\u00e9vi-Strauss challenging certain of the most prevalent ideas in relation to myth, such as that there is some original version of a myth, usually believed to be the earliest version. In the case of Heidegger, of particular importance is his challenge to us \u201cmoderns\u201d not to be too quick to believe that we understand ancient texts or the ancient conceptions of deities. He more specifically questions the common belief that the gods and goddesses are persons or that they are abstract personifications of concepts. Derrida, in his analysis of the texts of Freud, L\u00e9vi-Strauss, and Heidegger, further develops the ideas of each of these thinkers, seeking thereby to go beyond the Oedipus complex, beyond the security of structure, and beyond Being. After an analysis of depictions of the goddesses Ma\u2019at, Themis, Dike, and Justitia, based on the insights gained in the preceding analysis, the essay concludes with a reading of the blindfold of Justice in her modern guise, which seeks to exceed metaphysics. Drawing specifically on Derrida's analysis of blindness in drawing, it arrives eventually not at the essence, but at the an-essence, of justice.\n      </p>", "Tom\u00e1s Gutierrez Alea's film Guantanamera uses Yoruba mythology as a trope for Cuban spirituality. By inserting the Yoruba mythological figure of Ik\u00fa throughout the film, Alea resituates the African as distinctly Cuban. Alea's cinematic amalgamation of Yoruba-Cuban mythology emphasizes the significant role that the reconstruction of Africanness has played in the creation of Cuban nationhood and cultural identity. Furthermore, the film speaks to how the \"naturalization\" of African epistemologies in New World contexts lends itself to political commentary and manipulation. Alea's cross-cultural adaptation of Yoruba mythology ironically represents Afrocuban religion on both a local and global scale: the film medium allows for its (re)presentation in multiple cultural contexts. Ultimately, Guantanamera is only one Cuban cultural production that resituates the Yoruba as Cuban. In popular religion, music, foodways, and other aspects of Cuban folklore, African cultures in Cuba dominate many of the products that are part of the process of \"creolization.\" By focusing on cimena, I address a type of cultural production that challenges bounded notions of African identity and expressive culture.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "A study of some 250 trivial names applied by Linnaeus to the various species of the genus PAPILIO, and all recalling persons of classical mythology, shows that Linnaeus must have drawn them mainly from two sources, the Fabulae of Hyginus and the Syntagmata de Deis of Giraldi.

Three operant factors emerged. All of the factors show some crisis related to the loss of myth in contemporary social life. Factor I, the Defender of the Promise, epitomizes the narrative archetype and is indeed suggestive of the most enduring element of the Kennedy myth. The Unenchanted Skeptic (Factor II) reflects the cynicism and cultural impoverishment of the modern political discourse, while Factor III (Reformed Believer) captures the dialectic between faith and loss of faith in mythic representation.\n      </p>", "In this preliminary description of the Sa'lakwmanawyat Ceremonial performed by the Third Mesa Hopi at Hotvela, the focus has been on the author's eyewitness observations together with central portions of oral and musical material taped during the March 1979 Ceremonial and on various folkloric statements regarding the origin and meaning of sacred puppets. The material seems to indicate that the overt aims of the puppet ceremonials are the procuring of rain and floods in order to bring about a good harvest and, of equal importance, the transporting of the worshipper into the richly populated mythical and ritual time dimensions where a totality of religious desire finds the means and the modes of expressing total fulfillment. The folk traditions indicate the deeper-lying psychic influence which the puppets have on mothers and children. The mythical evidence tentatively points to the importance of the fertile girl in Hopi religious thought and indicates as well the secondary, accretive role of the deities represented by the puppets. The entire body of evidence seems to indicate the late, and probably foreign, origins of these ceremonials.\n      </p>", "Japanese culture is more often than not presented as being a culture primarily based on the cultivation of rice (inasaku bunka). Although there are voices calling for a critical examination of this presentation, they are in the minority. Moreover, critical voices are often ignored not only by the general population but also by scholars. Yet, there are clear signs that suggest it would be useful to reinvestigate the significance of rice in Japanese culture in a way that would give more weight to diversity in the culture. In order to do this, it is necessary to reconsider the role rice has played in Japanese society and to pay attention to what this role was, or is, in comparison with the production of other cereals. The present article is intended to stimulate such a reconsideration not so much by presenting a new reading of historical documents concerning the use of rice (which, however, is necessary), but by paying attention to the lives and attitudes of its producers.\n      </p>", "This paper presents a mythical story about the revenge of a man whom his brothers-in-law attempted to kill: the protagonist, a gifted magician, petrifies his opponents -the rocks are one of the landmarks of the Kaile'una Island coast. On the basis of the story and further data collected in the field, I interpret this story as a conflict resulting in a cross-cousin marriage the chief -in the matrilineal Trobriand society -arranged for his son to make it possible for him to become the heir of his chiefly power. I argue that the story serves at least three functions: It marks an important landmark, emphasizes the power of the magical word, and reminds the Trobrianders to accept th\u00e9 power of a mighty chief. The text presented here also attempts to illustrate how much information about cultural values, rules, and regulations are encoded even in a relatively short piece of oral tradition.\n      </p>", "The article connects two sets of ethnographic facts: a myth, as told in multiple variants among several Himalayan hill tribes; and a calendrical event, as it is observed among the present day Magar of the Dhaulagiri region, Nepal. The myth relates the story of a man and his nine sons going on a hunt for wild honey; the annual event is the festival of the winter solstice. On both scales, in the mythological story and during the annual, ritual event, a bow-an-arrow competition form the core theme. In the myth, the nine brothers compete by means of target shooting for the hand of a forbidden woman: their own step-mother (after they have abandonned their father at a cliff). In the ritual event, young men compete by means of target shooting for the hand of a girl from a prescribed marriage category. In both cases, a sportive action confirms the social rules of marriage.\n      </p>", "A. F. Losev, one of the most important Russian philosophers and historians of ancient aesthetics and culture in the 20th century, develops in his 'Dialectics of the Myth' (\"Dialektika mifa\"), 1930, a personalistic ontology by using elements of neoplatonic philosophy and Orthodox Christian belief. According to Losev reality in all its different expressions and ontological strata must be understood as \"mythical\", i.e. as \"living mutual exchange of subject and object\". The subjective and personal aspect of reality is not grounded in man's epistemic relation to it alone; reality in itself has to be characterized as personal and subjective. The main philosophical opponent is Descartes, the founder of \"modern rationalism and mechanism\".\n      </p>", "A presente an\u00e1lise do conto \"Seq\u00fc\u00eancia\", do livro Primeiras est\u00f3rias, de Guimar\u00e3es Rosa, pretende demonstrar um recurso recorrente de estrutura\u00e7\u00e3o das \"est\u00f3rias\" do autor.

These plots have, in a general sense, the motif of travel and, in a strict sense, the journey of eternal return. In this path, the traverse is structured through a rite of passage, whose completion occurs at a mythical scenery as a sort of legendary lifting. In order to accomplish this process, the author's starting point is a motif of popular culture, which ends up by being amalgamated to the universe of the erudite tradition, through references to the narrative genre historical traditions and to its mythical codes.\n      </p>", "This article is an attempt to reconsider Baule history by way of re-analysing the myth of origin of the Baule, which was recorded and interpreted by Delafosse in 1900. After having been accepted as official history for more than 70 years Delafosse's analysis was criticised by Weiskel. Weiskel rejected the literal adoption of the myth as historical truth and concluded that due to its popularity in present day Ivory Coast the myth of Aura Poku has no longer any historical value. In my analysis of the myth I reject this conclusion and demonstrate that textual criticism and comparison of different variants can still produce historical evidence. My results conf\u00edrm WeiskeVs assumption of successive waves of immigration and allow me to argue that there were beginnings of centralization but not the existence of a powerful kingdom as Delafosse assumed.\n      </p>", "Many San lived in an environment where optical mirage phenomena were part of their experience. Mirage elements are reflected in their rock art in the form of elongated figures, 'flying' antelopes, double antelopes, upside-down creatures, huge flying creatures (rain animals), creatures on 'sky-ropes', land creatures with fins, undulating or zig-zag features and floating (mirage) water. Since mirages were interpreted as encounters with another world, San mythology may have been inspired by these phenomena. This would permit a tentative new interpretation of San rock art and confirm that the San were realistic observers of nature. Superior mirages, which are typically observed in the 'still' (lull) before rainstorms and which occasionally show stretches of the horizon projected into the sky, may have been interpreted as giant 'sky water snakes' or 'rain animals', upon which they tried to exert spiritual power. This was done by painting, i.e. creating a twin image, by involving 'sky ropes' or by simulating the inverted world seen in mirages, i.e. hands in back position, legs crossed. The concept of 'underwater', where souls and the sorcerers went to become 'stretched', may have been derived from the mirage illusion of water. The way in which the transcendental world of the San may have worked within this concept is demonstrated by analysing some of the key symbols of the rock art.\n      </p>", "The March 1968 battle of Karameh was a conflict with limited military importance fought primarily between the Israelis and Jordanians with some Palestinian guerrilla participation. Despite the limited guerrilla role, this battle, nevertheless, became a pivotal event in the emergence of a new Palestinian political identity. It also became an important case study in the role of political mythology in supporting emerging and evolving nationalisms. Demoralized Palestinians seized upon the heroic image of the small group of Palestinian guerrillas who had fought bravely during the battle. The myth about Karameh grew, for the most part, spontaneously because it met critical human needs among the Palestinians. This growth also occurred despite Jordanian and Israeli efforts to provide alternative descriptions of the same events. Distortions created by this myth and the Israeli countermyth can now be assessed using new and more candid sources. Additionally, Karameh also provides an interesting example of how political myths erode as they become less relevant to changing needs among the community they previously served.\n      </p>", "Mythology has long been discounted as a key to understanding San rock art, even though explanations of paintings by nineteenth century San commentators explicitly linked paintings of therianthropes to the mythological past. An interpretation which reconsiders the importance of San mythology in relation to rock paintings strongly suggests that figures with both animal and human features are not trancers or shamans, as the dominant model suggests. Rather, these and other images are better understood in relation to San myths and to beliefs about the spirits of the dead. A model which focusses on myth, history and the spatio-temporal schemata of San cosmology and culture is outlined. This model addresses problems of the 'ethnographic method' and of interpretations which assign priority to the role of the shaman in the production of San visual imagery.\n      </p>", "Political myths have played a crucial role in legitimising apartheid and white domination in South Africa. This article explores the history of one such political myth: the mythology surrounding the nineteenth century missionary leader John Philip. I foreground the links between the Philip myth and the changing political and ideological contexts within which it was mobilised over the course of 150 years. While the roots of the Philip myth lie in the racial polemics of conservative settler ideologues in the Cape Colony during the 1830s and 1840s, Philip had slipped into historical obscurity by the middle of the nineteenth century. It was only during the 1880s and 1890s that he was resurrected by the massively influential settler historian G.M. Theal. The reasons for Theal's construction of a full blown Philip myth are related to his political project of colonial nationalism and his growing interest in the ideologies of Social Darwinism and scientific racism. Although Philip evoked scant interest among Afrikaner nationalist historians during the early 1900s, he was yoked into the service of segregationist ideology during the 1930s and 1940s as the symbol of the meddling outsider at a time when Afrikaner nationalist historiography was becoming increasingly overt in its racism. During the apartheid era the myth of John Philip was popularised as it was transported from the relatively narrow domain of professional historians into the wider domain of public politics. Against the backdrop of intense apartheid zenophobia and heightened tensions between the apartheid state and left-wing churches, prime ministers and school teachers invoked, John Philip reinvoked the spectre of this historic enemy of white South Africa.\n      </p>", "Contrary to Tolkien's refutation of \"Celtic things\" as a source for his own mythology, this article attempts to show how his work has been inspired by Celtic folklore and myth. The article is not just a source study. It concentrates on one main example from Tolkien's early literary writings that betrays a Celtic influence. At the same time it discusses Tolkien's complex attitude towards \"things Celtic\" within the context of his strong sense of English identity. Finally, it seeks to explain Tolkien's derogatory comments on Celtic material as a result of popular ideas of \"Celticity.\"\n      </p>", "In surveying the humanistic implications of the Greek and Rome myths that have provided subject matter for twentieth-century art, the article shows how modern artists have interpreted the myths through their own personal experience. Among their motivations for turning to mythology is the attempt to suggest that the world is a continuum of unchanged human experience. Also explored is the influence on the artists of earlier artistic, literary, philosophical, and psychological interpretations. The focus is on the myths most frequently seen as bearing humanistic meaning: Prometheus, Venus, Apollo, Dionysos, Orpheus, Oedipus, and Odysseus, and the Minotaur.\n      </p>", "During the first United States occupation ofHaiti, from 1915 to 1934, Haitian band composer Occide Jeanty wrote compositions for the Haitian Presidential Band that contained culturally encoded critiques of U.S. occupation forces. In his compositions, Jeanty invoked the legend of Haitian general Jean-Jacques Dessalines, the soldier who led Haiti to independence in 1804 and whose spirit was absorbed into the Vodou religion as a type of Ogou, or warrior spirit, through a process that I term \"recombinant mythology,\" in which people in the present use mythologically oriented language to highlight praiseworthy characteristics of cultural heroes.\n      </p>", "Generally read today as a novel concerned with those personal relationships for which Forster has become famous; Howards End is, even more centrally, as it announces on its own pages, a work attempting to create a modern mythology for England. Taking his cue from the Schlegel brothers, Friedrich Schlegel in particular in his \"Talk on Mythology\" (\"Rede \u00fcber die Mythologie\"), who, distressed by the materialism, philosophic and economic, that followed the loss of religious faith and the rise of empiricism, called for the making of new mythologies that could speak for franscendent truth, Forster guides the Schlegel sisters, their obvious surrogates in his book, through a spiritual journey that replicates, in modern form, the ancient rituals of Eleusis. As the literal tale relates events in the lives of individuals, an embedded symbolic narrative traces the steps of the ancient mysteries, showing their relevance to modern life and their function in modern literature.\n      </p>", "This article focuses on multiple lexical entries for one Navajo classificatory verb, arguing that many of its subentries are polysemous, rather than unrelated homophones. It is suggested that the connection between them is based on metaphor and conventionalized cultural knowledge (mythology and cosmology). The documentation of such metaphorical connections is crucial not only for making sense of the uses of this verb stem but also for what it tells us about Navajo culture.\n      </p>", "Classical scholarship played a vital role in the intellectual concerns of early nineteenth-century Germany. Situated at the crossroads of religion, history, and explorations of the development of the human mind, Greek mythology in particular was expected to shed light on the origins of civilization. In the search for the true nature of myth, the hermeneutic problems involved in historical understanding were intensified. As myth was held to be of a different nature than rationality, to read the sources was to look for a completely different referent of the texts than was the case in historical reconstruction. In the quests for a scientific mythology, K. O. M\u00fcller (1797-1840) was often regarded as an opponent of F. Creuzer (1771-1858). Yet an analysis of their published work and of their private documents shows that they had much in common, a fact they both appreciated. In particular they held similar, deeply Romantic views on the religious origin of culture, in M\u00fcller's case inspired by Pietism, in Creuzer's by neo-Platonism. Creuzer's influence is revealed in M\u00fcller's Prolegomena zu einer wissenschaftlichen Mythologie (1825) and more specifically in his interpretation of the Amazons as worshippers of sexuality in Die Dorier (1824). Nevertheless, M\u00fcller differed from Creuzer in his views on the relationship of myth to history. Myth was not the reflection of a universal religion, sustained by a priestly class (as Creuzer had claimed), but the outcome of the encounter between the mental endowment of a people and local, historical circumstances. In the case of the Amazons, however, M\u00fcller assessed the connection of myth to history in defiance of his own theory, guided by his views on gender difference and on sexual morality.\n      </p>", "An important part of the postcolonial struggles for ethnic identity in Native America is the active \"retelling\" of the past, where the Indians construct themselves not as aboriginal others but as people who have for hundreds of years been mediated by colonialism. This study analyzes the reconstruction of mythological tradition, cultural identity, and social representation among the Bribri Indians of Costa Rica. During the transformation, the central imagery of the Bribri mythology alters from the representation of the social relationships between different Bribri clans to that of the racial inequalities between whites and Indians. The reconstruction of the mythological imagery is an essential part of the Bribri struggle to cope with the traumatic experiences of domination and to deconstruct the hegemonic version of history and power.\n      </p>", "Aleksandar Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 argues that the Yugonostalgia in the Lexicon of Yu Mythology should be taken, not as a regressive idealization of the Yugoslav socialist past, but as a critical intervention in both the contemporary postsocialist politics of memory and the politics of emancipation. Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 identifies the Lexicon as an exhibition catalogue of the virtual museum of all \u201cthings Yugoslav,\u201d a self-reflective postmodern hybrid emerging from the semantic overlapping of different genres and threaded with various memories, personal and collective, nostalgic and ironic, of everyday life in Yugoslav socialism. Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 contends that by evoking visual and textual reflections on the meaning of the past for the present, the Lexicon appears to have a materiality akin to that of a ruin: it exhibits a blend of affectionate and ironic nostalgia for the Yugoslav past, while simultaneously performing and reaffirming the socialist modernity's prospective perspective as its emancipating impact on the social imagination.\n      </p>", "The exact nature of the relation between science and Scripture in the thought of Francis Bacon is a well-studied but controversial field. In this paper, it is shown that Bacon, though convinced that there exists no enmity between the book of God's wisdom (Holy Writ) and the book of God's power (nature), usually tries to separate knowledge acquired by reason (philosophy) from knowledge acquired by faith (divinity). In his exposition of the principle of the conservation of matter, however, Bacon seems to find himself constrained to invoke Scriptural truths in a manner that he usually disapproves of. In order to establish this principle, which is so essential to his overall scientific program, he appeals both to the Bible and Greek mythology in a way that points to certain conceptual tensions within his natural philosophy.\n      </p>", "This paper traces changing perspectives in archaeology and ethnology regarding the historical content of myth and demonstrates a method whereby mythological data are used to generate hypotheses amenable to falsification when integrated with other data sets. Based on a myth collected among the Tzotzil of San Pablo Chalchihuitan, Chiapas, Mexico, the presentation offers predictions regarding the location, contents, interpretation, and age of an unreported prehistoric burial site. It also sheds light on some currently unexplained aspects of an associated site in a neighboring community, and amplifies other ethnohistorical discussions relating archaeology to contemporary Indian mythology elsewhere in Mesoamerica. By showing how a modern Maya myth reveals significant information about an ancient Maya site, the study illustrates the complementarity of archaeology and ethnography through a suggested relation between myth and history.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
