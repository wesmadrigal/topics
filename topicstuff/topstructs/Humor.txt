We examined how students perceived professors' uses of various types of humor during class and the types of humor that students and faculty recommend for use in class. We also correlated the way professors incorporated humor into their class lectures with their perceived competence and effectiveness, and we investigated whether students felt their learning experience improved when their teachers used humor. We also discussed topics such as \"scarcasm,\" professor gender, student and faculty support of humor, and humor in classrooms, tests, and the rest of life. Humor appropriately used has the potential to humanize, illustrate, defuse, encourage, reduce anxiety, and keep people thinking.\n      </p>", "This article examines research evidence for the popular idea that humor and laughter have beneficial effects on physical health. Potential theoretical mechanisms for such effects are discussed first. Empirical evidence for beneficial effects of humor and laughter on immunity, pain tolerance, blood pressure, longevity, and illness symptoms is then summarized. Overall, the evidence for health benefits of humor and laughter is less conclusive than commonly believed. Future research in this area needs to be more theoretically driven and methodologically rigorous.\n      </p>", "In light of recent evidence suggesting the importance of communication in the health care setting, an instrument to measure communication style preferences was developed. This reliable and content-valid paper-and-pencil measure consisted of six scenarios depicting physician-patient interactions, each followed by four potential verbal responses from the physician. The four responses, representing four communications styles-humor, hostility, reassurance, and neutrality-were ranked by respondents according to their preferences. Among both physicians and consumers, reassuring responses were the most preferred, followed by neutral, humorous, and hostile responses. The intercorrelations of the four preferences and their relationships to standardized tests of both facilitating verbal response preferences and nonverbal expressiveness are presented. Potential uses of the instrument are discussed.\n      </p>", "Humor is a common element of human interaction and therefore has an impact on work groups and organizations. Despite this observation, managers often fail to take humor seriously or realize its numerous benefits. Humor is more than just funny concepts; it represents a multifunctional management tool that can be used to achieve many objectives. This article describes how managers can use humor to reduce stress and enhance leadership, group cohesiveness, communication, creativity, and organizational culture. Specifically, we suggest humor styles that are best suited to realize these outcomes. Additionally, the effect of humor on organizational outcomes is moderated by individual differences such as ethnicity and gender. Much like selecting the proper tool from a toolkit, managers can select the appropriate humor style suitable for the desired organizational outcome, adjust for individual differences, and achieve positive organizational outcomes.\n      </p>", "This study investigated the relationship between children's level of cognitive functioning (according to Piaget's theoretical framework) and their comprehension and appreciation of humor based on violation of cognitive expectancies. A distinction was drawn between novelty and incongruity humor, differing in the nature of expectancy violation represented. The general hypothesis tested was that operational thinking is necessary for comprehension of incongruity humor but is not necessary for comprehension of novelty humor. The Ss were 30 boys at each of 3 age levels: 5, 7, and 9. The above hypothesis was confirmed only for the 7-year-old group. Also, for the incongruity humor (but not novelty humor), operational thinking was found to be an important factor in the ability to give interpretive, as opposed to descriptive, explanations. Level of cognitive development was not significantly related to humor appreciation for either novelty or incongruity humor. Analyses of age differences indicated consistent significant increases in comprehension with increasing age for all humor stimuli. Similar analyses for humor appreciation yielded no significant age differences.\n      </p>", "Code-switching from the Fijian language into a variety of Hindi is commonly used for joking among indigenous Fijians. Examples of this code-switching are described here, and its role in Fijian joking relationships is outlined. A survey of code-switching used for humor in other societies shows that code-switching may be a signal for joking, that the switching itself may be considered humorous, and that the variety to which one switches may be used for humorous mockery or parody. Three different psychological approaches to the study of humor throw some light on why code-switching into Hindi is funny to Fijians. A final discussion examines code-switching in relation to both unintegrated borrowing and style-shifting.\n      </p>", "This research examines contingencies that shape the effects of humorous appeals on consumers' recall of ads, as well as the processes underlying such effects. Results of experimentation show that ads are more memorable when humor is both strong and related to the message, and this interaction is mediated by attention and mood. Stronger humor appeals also induce higher recall among individuals with a high \"need for humor\" (NFH).\n      </p>", "Humor is often featured in consumer advertisements, yet its effects and the mechanisms by which they operate have not been fully elucidated. Previous studies have shown humor to enhance, inhibit, or have no effect on consumers' responses to advertisements. Clearly, there are boundary conditions governing the operation of humor. The authors report a program of experimentation that examines one such contingency: an individual's \"need for humor.\" Need for humor (NFH) is a trait that refers to a person's tendency to generate and seek out humor. Humor was manipulated in three studies using print ads and NFH was measured. Dependent variables included various measures of advertising effectiveness. Results of Study 1 show the impact of humor on attitude toward the ad to be moderated by NFH, such that humor influences only higher-NFH subjects. Results of Study 2 show a similar moderating effect of NFH, which is further qualified by the need for cognition (NFC), suggesting that the motivation to process may help explain the key finding. Study 3 provides additional evidence of a three-way interaction of humor, NFH, and NFC, and offers a process explanation using path modeling.\n      </p>", "The use of humor has become common practice in advertising; yet our knowledge about its impact has not been updated since the last major review almost twenty years ago. In the interim, a great deal of humor research has been conducted. The outcome of this research only partially supports earlier conclusions and highlights the need to apply humor with care. Humor is by no means a guarantee of better ads, but its effect can be enhanced with careful consideration of the objectives one seeks to achieve as well as the audience, situation, and type of humor.\n      </p>", "Marianne Moore treats humor as a means of both recognizing commonality and creating mutual understanding between individuals. In two comparatively minor poems, \u201cA Prize Bird\u201d (1915) and \u201cThe Wood-Weasel\u201d (1942), Moore uses humor as a test of friendship, and suggests that sympathetic laughter constitutes a distinctively American approach to collaborative artistic creation. Humor in \u201cThe Pangolin\u201d (1936), like the artists' tools Moore discusses in the poem, is both an end in itself and a means to ever-greater things: it becomes the marker of shared humanity and a medium for uniting the human with the divine. Throughout Moore's work, her humor can be read as a kind of ars poetica, modeling the synthesis of diverse components that she performs in her poetry.\n      </p>", "Every year billions of dollars are spent on advertising that uses humor to sell products. How is that spending decision made? Despite much research examining humor effects in advertising, many advertisers make the decision on faith. Many past studies lack a clear conceptual focus to guide the investigation of humor effects in advertising. The authors examine humor effectiveness by using a conceptual framework adapted from Speck along with a product-contingent focus. The resulting approach affords a clearer understanding of the appropriate use of humor through the examination of (1) the humor mechanisms employed, (2) the intentional relatedness of humor to the ad or product, and (3) the type of product advertised. The descriptive results of the study indicate that current practice for many advertisers is to employ incongruity-based humor in a humor-dominant context. That practice is contrasted with others to examine the influence of humor on the effectiveness of print advertisements for different product groups. Study results indicate that current advertising practices may not be the most effective in terms of advertisement performance.\n      </p>", "Lentropin, a factor present in the vitreous humor of the eye, stimulates lens fiber differentiation from chicken embryo lens epithelial cells in vitro. Lentropin has been partially purified but has not been isolated in sufficient quantity or purity for direct comparison with other growth and differentiation factors. Previous studies have shown that insulin and fetal bovine serum share with lentropin the ability to stimulate lens fiber formation from cultured epithelial cells. In the present study, a number of hormones and growth factors were assayed for lentropin activity. Of those tested, the only substances that had this activity were the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) somatomedin C (Sm-C/IGF-I) and multiplication-stimulating activity (MSA/IGF-II). Sm-C/IGF-I was approximately 30 times more potent than insulin or MSA/IGF-II in promoting fiber cell formation. A monoclonal antibody to human Sm-C/IGF-I inhibited purified Sm-C/IGF-I, fetal bovine serum, and chicken vitreous humor from stimulating fiber cell differentiation in vitro. This antibody has been shown not to crossreact with insulin and did not block insulinstimulated lens fiber formation. These findings indicate that lentropin is related to the IGFs and that these factors may play important roles in controlling cell differentiation, in addition to their better-known ability to stimulate cell division.\n      </p>", "A review of the literature indicates that the introduction of humor as an instructional strategy in computer-based instruction (CBI) has not been studied as much as the effects of humor use in the classroom and other media. In this article humor theories are summarized, examples of humor research are provided, and perspectives on the relationships between humor, affect, motivation, information processing, and learner characteristics are discussed. Also, general guidelines for incorporating humor in CBI are suggested, and a research agenda is proposed that would support more definitive prescriptions for humor applications that reflect the affordances of modern instructional technology.\n      </p>", "Following the sarin gas attack on Tokyo's subways in March of 1995, considerable effort has been devoted to explaining the rise of Aum Shinriky\u014d and its turn to violence. This paper aims to provide a contribution to efforts to understand how Aum has been perceived and interpreted in Japan by focusing on one aspect of the reaction to Aum that has received almost no attention either within or without Japan: the humor, joking, parody, and satire that formed a major part of efforts to understand and come to terms with Aum. It is argued that the reaction to Aum in Japan cannot be understood without taking into account the range of humor, parody, and satire relating to Aum that appeared throughout Japanese mass media. As a means of introducing this aspect of the reaction to Aum, \"senry\u016b\" (comic or satiric verse) related to Aum and contributed by readers of two major Japanese daily newspapers are translated and analyzed.\n      </p>", "Erik H. Erikson wrote three articles when he was in his late-twenties and an upand-coming member of the psychoanalytic community in Vienna. At the time he wrote these articles, he was in a training psychoanalysis with Anna Freud, teaching at the Heitzing School in Vienna, and learning the Montessori method of teaching. These articles focus on the loss of primary narcissism and the development of the superego (or punitive conscience) in early childhood, especially through the child's conflict with maternal authority. They support the idea that melancholia, with its internalized rage against the mother, is the inevitable outcome of the loss of primary narcissism. I note, however, that the third of these articles makes a case for the restorative role of humor, especially when Freud's view that humor is a function of the superego is taken into account.\n      </p>", "This study examines the relationships between workplace humor, manager gender, and leadership outcomes. Business school alumni provided data on the use of both positive and negative humor by their managers and described their managers' relative use of task behavior, relationship behavior and overall effectiveness. While humor was expected to affect perceived leader behavior and effectiveness, an interaction between humor use and manager gender was hypothesized where male managers were advantaged in ratings relative to females. The results show that positive humor is associated with higher ratings of all leader outcomes. Negative humor use was associated with lower task-behavior and relationshipbehavior ratings. Significant interactions between gender and humor use were found on relationship behavior and effectiveness, however the direction was not entirely as predicted. Male managers were reported to use more positive and negative humor than female managers, but there appeared to be a magnifier effect for females in how humor affected the leadership variables. Female managers using positive humor at work were rated higher than males in leader outcomes while females using negative humor were rated lower than males in those outcomes. Positive humor use may benefit managers (especially females) by improving communication and group relations.\n      </p>", "Es werden zwei Beispiele f\u00fcr (hier absichtlich nicht streng definierten) Humor aus dem Mittleren Reich vorgef\u00fchrt.

Each set involved a different experimental task: (a) arranging sequential cartoons in the correct order (Set I); (b) choosing the funniest pictorial completion for cartoons (Set II); (c) choosing the funniest caption (Set III). 5-, 7-, and 9-year-old boys served as Ss. For 7-year-olds, acquisition of operational thinking was significantly positively related to humor comprehension and number of correct choices for Sets I and II, and to giving interpretive (vs. descriptive) humor explanations for Sets I and III. For 9-year-olds, more cognitively advanced Ss showed greater humor comprehension for Set III and more frequent correct choices for Sets I and II. Cognitive development was not significantly related to humor appreciation at any age level.\n      </p>", "The present study examined the effect of degree of similarity between subjects and victims of an accidental mishap depicted in cartoons on appreciation of humor occurring in connection with the mishap. Boys and girls approximately 3-7 years old were presented with pairs of drawings differing only in the identification of the victim of the mishap and were asked to choose the funnier of the 2. The pairs included the following comparisons: boy- versus girl-victim, son- versus father-victim, son- versus mother-victim, daughter- versus father-victim, and daughter- versus mother-victim. Findings for boys were consistent with predictions, indicating that boys' humor is enhanced by the victimization of a person toward whom the child presumably feels less similar or is less favorably disposed. Findings for girls were consistent with this pattern as long as a parent-victim was compared with a child-victim, but no significant preference occurred when boy-victims were compared with girl-victims. The lack of significant differences among females for such comparisons is consistent with findings for adult samples and is interpreted in terms of differential rate of sex-role development among boys and girls.\n      </p>", "For eight hours on the first day of each month from age 2;0 to 3;0, incidents of B's laughter were noted, and five videotapes were made to obtain a permanent record of typical behavior. B was observed to tell jokes in a formal joke style and to make a pun, which other researchers have not believed possible in such a young child. Models for B's productive humor are identified in B's social interaction, both verbal and nonverbal, and its function for her is described. Further naturalistic studies of child humor are indicated, in particular, of the role of siblings in the development of humor.\n      </p>", "The relations between temperament, communicative competence, and humor expression were examined in a sample of 4- and 5-year-old nursery-school children (N = 158). Ratings of communicative competence and various dimensions of temperament accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in the reported frequency of children's laughter and verbal and behavioral attempts at initiating humor. Children who were normal-to-advanced in their level of communicative competence were rated as significantly more humorous than those assessed as delayed. Although the temperament characteristics of persistence/ attention span, distractibility, mood, and response threshold were associated with humor, activity level and approach were especially noteworthy in predicting the various expressions of humor. Humor development is discussed as a function of learned communicative abilities and temperamental predispositions which influence humor in both a direct and indirect manner.\n      </p>", "The Hopi Indians regard humor, even sexual humor, as a form prayer in their religious ceremonies. Clowns play an important role among the kachinas, twisting things around to make important points.\n      </p>", "Few studies have tested models incorporating cognitive as well as affective mechanisms that help explain different levels of perceived humorousness in advertising (cf. Alden and Hoyer 1993; Speck 1991). In the first of two studies, an extended incongruity resolution model of humor perception in television advertising is proposed and tested. In that test, schema familiarity is found to moderate surprise resulting from ad content incongruity. Furthermore, playfulness of the ad, ease of resolution of the incongruity in the ad and warmth created by the ad moderate the effects of surprise on humor. Thus, surprise appears to be a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for humor in television advertising. In the second study, the role of surprise in generating humor is examined in more detail. Specifically, evidence supports the hypothesis that, following exposure to incongruity, surprise can be transformed into diverse affective outcomes such as fear and humor depending on the presence of different contextual moderators. Implications of the overall model are discussed from both theoretic and applied perspectives and directions for future research are suggested.\n      </p>", "A consumer's prior evaluation of an advertised brand is hypothesized to moderate the effectiveness of humor in advertising. Further, cognitive responses are hypothesized as mediators of the impact of humorous ads on brand attitude. The results support the hypothesized moderator role of prior brand evaluation: when prior evaluation of the advertised brand is positive, a humorous ad is more effective than its nonhumorous counterpart in changing consumer attitudes and choice behavior. When consumers have a negative prior attitude, the opposite is true: a humorous ad is less effective in changing consumer attitudes and choice behavior than its nonhumorous counterpart. The results also support the conceptualization of cognitive responses as mediators of the impact of humorous advertisements on brand attitude.\n      </p>", "The use of humor by leaders is widely believed to have a beneficial impact on workplace outcomes. The present study, however, goes beyond a simple search for main-effect associations to test for the potential interactive role of leader humor in influencing the relationships between leader behavior and follower outcomes. For 179 leader-follower pairs sampled from public high schools, survey data were collected from teachers who described their principal's use of humor and degree to which the principal behaved with integrity, as well as used contingent personal reward. Moderated regression analysis revealed a significant interaction for leader use of humor and other dimensions of leader behavior in determining follower performance. In general, these results underscore a perspective wherein the impact of a leader's use of humor also depends on how a follower assesses other aspects of a leader's behavior.\n      </p>", "The thesis I explore in this essay is that organizational members use humorous remarks to discursively construct and organize their cognitive and emotional experiences in and of their organizations. My assumptions are that: (1) organizations are socially constructed through discourse about them (especially managerial discourse), (2) humorous discourse provides a contradiction-centered construction of organizations that operates in the domains of both cognition and emotion, and (3) interpretation of the text of ironic remarks will suggest the processes by which contradictions and their cultural and emotional contexts are socially constructed through discourse. In this essay I use a form of analysis that I developed in relation to humor theory (Mulkay 1988), theories of irony (Brown 1977, Weick and Browning 1986) and Rorty's (1989) concept of the ironic disposition to interpret spontaneous humorous exchanges observed during the regular meetings of a group of middle managers. My interpretations of ironically humorous remarks indicate that the managers in my study constructed at least some of their cognitive and emotional experiences in contradictory ways including: possible/impossible, great/horrible, comic/serious, and up-to-date/unprepared. The interpretations also suggest how, in constructing contradiction, the managers reflexively constructed themselves in relation to their organization. The analysis points to a paradoxical understanding of organizational stability and change and informs a contradiction-centered view of organizations.\n      </p>", "A plaqueforming agent, identified as Marek's disease herpesvirus, was isolated in chicken embryo fibroblast cell cultures from the aqueous humor of a chicken with ocular form of Marek's disease.\n      </p>", "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of music experience on preference and humor ratings in music listening. Based on studies that identified humorous compositions in Western Art Music, a stimulus tape was prepared with 16 musical excerpts. Researchers matched eight humorous excerpts by tempo and composer with eight non-humorous examples. Following two marked examples of the task, subjects rated 14 excerpts on two seven-point Likert scales: non-humor/humor and dislike/like scales. Subjects (N = 202) were 106 music and 96 non-music majors at a state university. Results indicated that subjects had general agreement on perceiving which items were humorous and non-humorous. Music majors showed significantly stronger perceptions for humor in music than non-majors did on 43% of the excerpts. Music majors reflected significantly higher levels of liking than non-music majors did on 79% of the cases. Both groups reflected positive preferences for humorous and non-humorous excerpts.\n      </p>", "In 2008, famed radio host El Cucuy de la Ma\u00f1ana (The Morning Bogeyman) bid farewell to listeners of Spanish-language radio. For over two decades, El Cucuy\u2019s trademark wit, cunning humor, and relentless use of laugh tracks boomed over the morning airwaves. Los Angelenos tuned in historic numbers to chuckle Monday through Friday to El Cucuy\u2019s radio show where matters of immigration, both personally and politically, were laced with humorous fanfare. As opposed to anger, laughter as a response to injustices can suppress, trivialize, and \u201claugh off\u201d the matter at hand.

The issue of humor as a form of popular culture with geopolitical content has been explored only recently by geographers. This paper utilizes disposition theory, with its emphasis on social context, to link humor and geopolitical analyses of humor. The analysis of two Jeff Dunham comedy skits centering on the character Achmed the Dead Terrorist demonstrates the utility of disposition theory as a construct to situate humor in the context of its original production and as a fluid, global phenomenon that is shared through various social networks via the Internet.\n      </p>", "This article explores how middle-class Jewish men on reserve duty in the Israel Defense Forces form a \"proper\" masculinity through humor and jokes. Reserve service creates a fruitful territory for researching four issues that have not been extensively studied in the literature on masculinities: the relation between gender and age, the periodic reaffirmation of masculinity along the life course, how women are perceived as sexual objects and how informal social pressure is placed on singles to marry and begin families, and how men not only are motivated by homophobia but use images of women and homosexuals to map and interpret power relations and competition between men.\n      </p>", "This is part II of a two-part essay on narrative humor. Part I appeared in Poetics Today 31: 4; it explained Wright's (2005) idea that both humor and narrative require audiences/readers to switch between \"intentional perspectives,\" that is, between the cognitive-emotive states of mind of agents (participants). Second, it distinguished between humor and narrative: while narrative contains minimally two layers of intentionality (oriented to the action and its presentation), humor can but need not involve those two layers; inversely, while humor always requires subjects to perceive incongruity and feel superiority, narrative is not defined by incongruity and superiority, although it can produce them. Third, part I went on to redefine the composite concept \"narrative humor,\" describing it as the production and/or exploitation of incongruity and superiority relations among the participants (agents, intentional perspectives) of narrative texts: author, narrator, reader/spectator, character. Fourth, it analyzed some types of narrative humor, mainly \"metanarrative humor,\" \"comic narrative suspense,\" and \"comic narrative surprise.\" Part II surveys and compares other approaches to humor in/and narrative. In the philosophical and psychoanalytic study The Odd One In (2008), Zupan\u010di\u010d suggests that comedies involving unhappiness deserve more attention than they have received. The idea that comedies are compatible with unhappiness is interesting, yet Zupan\u010di\u010d overlooks the central mechanisms behind the idea: perspectival mechanisms, which foster incongruity/superiority between participants in a narrative and thus enable comedies to turn someone's unhappiness into a funny thing. Also, Zupancic mistakes causal and temporal development for a feature of tragedy as against comedy, rather than identifying such development as a feature of narrative in general; by the standards of serious narrative, comic plots can even unroll \"incongruously\" many causal-temporal developments (as when farcical plots run wild). More generally, Zupan\u010di\u010d shows little awareness of existing research on humor and comedy. Humor Studies may erroneously regard such books as representative of humanist-interpretive analyses of humor in general\u2014and therefore keep excluding cultural and literary studies from their interdisciplinary enterprise. Yet Humor Studies likewise betrays problems in the face of narrative humor. As with Zupan\u010di\u010d, those problems (visible in Attardo 2001 and, less so, Ermida 2008) are related to a neglect of intentional perspective, a poor grasp of narrative's perspectival makeup, and a lack of interest in poetics.\n      </p>", "With recent investigation beginning to reveal the cortical and subcortical neuroanatomical correlates of humor appreciation, the present event-related functional MRI (fMRI) study was designed to elucidate sex-specific recruitment of these humor related networks. Twenty healthy subjects (10 females) underwent fMRI scanning while subjectively rating 70 verbal and nonverbal achromatic cartoons as funny or unfunny. Data were analyzed by comparing blood oxygenation-level-dependent signal activation during funny and unfunny stimuli. Males and females share an extensive humor-response strategy as indicated by recruitment of similar brain regions: both activate the temporal-occipital junction and temporal pole, structures implicated in semantic knowledge and juxtaposition, and the inferior frontal gyrus, likely to be involved in language processing. Females, however, activate the left prefrontal cortex more than males, suggesting a greater degree of executive processing and language-based decoding. Females also exhibit greater activation of mesolimbic regions, including the nucleus accumbens, implying greater reward network response and possibly less reward expectation. These results indicate sex-specific differences in neural response to humor with implications for sex-based disparities in the integration of cognition and emotion.\n      </p>", "A number of recent hypotheses have attempted to explain the ultimate evolutionary origins of laughter and humor. However, most of these have lacked breadth in their evolutionary frameworks while neglecting the empirical existence of two distinct types of laughter\u2014Duchenne and non\u2010Duchenne\u2014and the implications of this distinction for the evolution of laughter as a signal. Most of these hypotheses have also been proposed in relative isolation of each other and remain disjointed from the relevant empirical literature. Here we attempt to remedy these shortcomings through a synthesis of previous laughter and humor research followed by (i) a reevaluation of this research in light of theory and data from several relevant disciplines, and (ii) the proposal of a synthetic evolutionary framework that takes into account phylogeny and history as well as proximate mechanisms and adaptive significance. We consider laughter to have been a preadaptation that was gradually elaborated and co\u2010opted through both biological and cultural evolution. We hypothesize that Duchenne laughter became fully ritualized in early hominids between 4 and 2 mya as a medium for playful emotional contagion. This mechanism would have coupled the emotions of small hominid groups and promoted resource\u2010building social play during the fleeting periods of safety and satiation that characterized early bipedal life. We further postulate that a generalized class of nonserious social incongruity would have been a reliable indicator of such safe times and thereby came to be a potent distal elicitor of laughter and playful emotion. This class of stimuli had its origins in primate social play and was the foundation for formal human humor. Within this framework, Duchenne laughter and protohumor were well established in the hominid biobehavioral repertoire when more cognitively sophisticated traits evolved in the hominid line between 2 mya and the present. The prior existence of laughter and humor allowed them to be co\u2010opted for numerous novel functions, and it is from this process that non\u2010Duchenne laughter and the \u201cdark side\u201d of laughter emerged. This perspective organizes the diversified forms and functions that characterize laughter and humor today and clarifies when and how laughter and humor evolved during the course of human evolution.\n      </p>", "Previous research and theory suggest that two stable personality dimensions, extroversion and neuroticism, differentially influence emotional reactivity to a variety of pleasurable phenomena. Here, we use event-related functional MRI to address the putative neural and behavioral associations between humor appreciation and the personality dimensions of introversion-extroversion and emotional stability-neuroticism. Our analysis showed extroversion to positively correlate with humor-driven blood oxygenation level-dependent signal in discrete regions of the right orbital frontal cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and bilateral temporal cortices. Introversion correlated with increased activation in several regions, most prominently the bilateral amygdala. Although neuroticism did not positively correlate with any whole-brain activation, emotional stability (i.e., the inverse of neuroticism) correlated with increased activation in the mesocortical-mesolimbic reward circuitry encompassing the right orbital frontal cortex, caudate, and nucleus accumbens. Our findings tie together existing neurobiological studies of humor appreciation and are compatible with the notion that personality style plays a fundamental role in the neurobiological systems subserving humor appreciation.\n      </p>", "Using humor to communicate threatening information in advertising can often be observed in practice, but scholars have seldom investigated its effects. Drawing from dual processing models, the current study proposed that response to humor in threat persuasion would depend on the individual's level of issue involvement. This proposition was tested in two experiments. In Study 1, a significant humor and issue involvement interaction effect emerged for threat persuasion ads; low-involvement individuals rated the humor ad more positively than the nonhumor ad, and the opposite was true for high-involvement individuals. With threat intensities varied in Study 2, the results indicated that the effectiveness of various threat intensity and humor combinations depended on the individual's issue involvement. Implications for both theory and practice are discussed.\n      </p>", "A considerable body of empirical and theoretical work has recently been devoted to the subject of humor, In part this increased emphasis may be because of the increased importance of humor and other emotions (see Hochschild, 1983) as products. Notwithstanding the apparent importance of humor as a product in the contemporary economy, the theoretical understanding of humor seems inchoate and underdeveloped. In order to understand humor, we need to move beyond aspects of performance and content and on to the examination of the interactionist process of making humor. We asked a group of judges to evaluate a sample of descriptions of humorous events, and then analyzed the differences between the two extereme groups. We found that the sources of humor are the same as the sources of embarrassment and boredom (loss of identity, poise and confidence), and that context is the most important discriminator between \"funny\" and \"not funny.\" Because humor is created within the process of interaction, it necessarily is unstable and evanescent. However, just because hymor is a situated process which relies upon the definitions and interpretations of the participants does not consign the phenomenon into the realm of \"ineffable, unknown.\"\n      </p>", "An information-processing analysis is used in examining humor's effects on the attitude change process. Generally: humor integral to or adjacent to a persuasive message does not influence persuasion significantly; humor's effects on comprehension and source evaluations are inconsistent; and retention does not appear to be altered by humor usage. Severe methodological problems with prior research include inadequate control messages, questionable humor manipulations, inappropriate settings for receipt of humor, limited subject populations, and blatant demand characteristics. Many of these problems plague persuasion research in general. Two theoretical approaches, learning theory and distraction effects, offer requisite guidance for future investigators.\n      </p>", "This empirical study predicts and finds that effectiveness of ad humor is jointly determined by the humor process (i.e., incongruity resolution and arousal safety) employed in the ad and the cultural orientation (i.e., uncertainty avoidance and individualism-collectivism) of the ad viewer. In particular, attitudinal effects elicited by the cognitive/affective uncertainty elements in ad humor are more pronounced among consumers who have higher uncertainty avoidance, as well as among those with more collectivistic orientations. The theoretical and managerial implications stemming from the cultural boundaries of ad humor are considered. Research avenues suggested by the findings are also discussed.\n      </p>", "Humor is both a social product and an agency with social functions. It assumes different forms in various groups and within the same group according to the changes in situations. \"Gallows humor\" is a type of humor that arises in a type of precarious or dangerous situation.

The positive effect of gallows humor is manifested in the strengthening of morale. Its negative effect is revealed in its influence upon the disintegration of those toward whom it is directed.\n      </p>", "To evaluate the potential of ocular and systemic specimens to provide markers of active cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, we examined the relationship between virologic and clinical aspects of CMV infections in AIDS patients with CMV retinitis. CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of 74 aqueous humor and vitreous specimens indicated that ocular specimens can provide accurate markers to differentiate active and inactive CMV retinitis (aqueous or vitreous PCR, (P&lt; .001). Moreover, these markers were superior to extraocular measures, including plasma PCR (P = .08) and blood and urine CMV cultures (P = .05). A direct correlation was identified between the quantity of CMV DNA in aqueous humor or vitreous specimens and the corresponding surface area of active CMV retinitis (r\u00b2 = .69 and .44, respectively). Thus, qualitative and quantitative PCR-based analyses of aqueous humor can provide valuable markers of CMV retinitis activity. Such assays could provide rapid and reliable tools to assist in management of patients with CMV retinitis in whom the view of the retina is obscured.\n      </p>", "The use of humorous commercials is quite evident in television advertising today.

Es schliesst das Komische und allen Arten von Witz und Schertz ein. Diese Vieldeutigkeit ist zum Teile begr\u00fcndet in dem schillernden Charakter des humoristischen Ph\u00e4nomens. In der jetzigen Untersuchung befragen wir den Humor auf seinen wesentlichen Gehalt. Solche Analyse des Humors soll sich nicht von vornherein zu einem \u00e4sthetischen, psychologischen, ethischen oder soziologischen Ausgangspunkt entschliessen ; wir versuchen den Humor ph\u00e4nomenologisch gegen ihn verwandte Erscheinungen abzugrenzen. Zun\u00e4chst befragen wir den \u00ab Geist \u00bb des geistreichen Witzes. Dieser Geist, von den Franz\u00f6sen Esprit genannt, ist der \u00ab Geist des Komischen \u00bb, in dem Sinne, dass in ihm einer der Wesensz\u00fcge des Komischen seine letzte Vervollkommnung findet. Der geistreiche Witz ist ein intellektualistisch k\u00fchles Spiel mit Wert und Gegenwert ; er enth\u00fcllt pl\u00f6tzlich und ohne Mitgef\u00fchl ein Paradoxen. In dem Hinweis auf das Absurde liegt seine Affinit\u00e4t zum Humor. Der Humor ist aber weniger n\u00fcchtern, nicht so zugespitzt, sondern gem\u00fctlicher und freundlicher. Der Esprit f\u00fchrt nicht zum herzlichen Lachen, weil er das Gem\u00fct nicht ber\u00fchrt. Eine Analyse des Lachens zeigt uns dieses Ph\u00e4nomen als eine Krise des Verhaltens (Plessner). Lachen ist die Kapitulation einer Person vor der Unm\u00f6glichkeit eines Kontrastes, das dem Verhalten keinen Halt bietet. Im Lachen verlieren wir unsere Haltung und Selbstbeherrschung. Gerade diese Explosivit\u00e4t des Lachens ist es, die dem Humor abgeht. Der Lacher macht sich keine Sorge um den Wert, den er verlacht ; er lacht schlechtweg, weil der Kontrast zwischen der Erscheinung und ihrer Norm ihn dazu veranlasst. Der lachende Mensch sieht nicht, dass der l\u00e4cherliche Kontrast in einer tieferen Diskrepanz begr\u00fcndet ist : in der Diskrepanz zwischen dem realen Sein und der idealen Norm des Menschen. Es ist vor allem der tragische Blick, der diese fundamentale Diskrepanz entdeckt. Der tragische Mensch geht eben an diesem Wissen zugrunde. Seine Auseinandersetzung mit der Welt und mit sich selbst entfaltet sich in der Verstimmung, in der Einsamkeit und Trostlosigkeit. Es gelingt dem tragischen Menschen nicht, sich im Lachen von der Zerrissenheit der Existenz zu distanzieren. Das Lachen bietet dem Lachenden die M\u00f6glichkeit, Abstand zum Kontrast zu gewinnen. Es kann daher als Zugang zum Humor fungieren, der die Diskrepanz erkennt, sie aber im Gegensatz zum Tragischen, heiter relativiert. Der Humor spricht vom Absurden ohne Feindseligkeit oder Trauer, aber auch ohne Ausgelassenheit. Er h\u00fcllt sich jedoch nicht in der Indifferenz. Der Humor findet sich in einer gehobenen Stimmung beheimatet, und er verh\u00e4lt sich sympathisch zum Mitmenschen und zur Existenz. Sein Zeichen ist daher das L\u00e4cheln, diese Mim ik des Geistes (Plessner), eine harmlose Geb\u00e4rde, die eine Suspension der inneren Haltung wie der \u00e4usseren Aktivit\u00e4t verr\u00e4t. Der humoristisch gestimmte Mensch enth\u00e4lt sich von jeder Stellungnahme ; mit Vergn\u00fcgen zeigt er auf die Widersinnigkeit des Lebens hin, ohne sich mit dieser auseinanderzusetzen. Er verweigert sich, den andern Menschen bei seiner schwachen Stelle zu nehmen. Der Humor beabsichtigt also keinen Zweck. Er bl\u00fcht auf wie ein Geschenk des zufriedenen Zumuteseins. Er zeigt den Menschen im Spiel mit seinem eigenen paradoxalen Dasein. Seiner Neutralit\u00e4t wegen, und der darin implizierten Ambiguit\u00e4t, ist Humor so schwierig zu fassen. Der f\u00fcr den Humor unzug\u00e4ngliche Zuh\u00f6rer ist ja immer dazu geneigt, ihn aus einer bestimmten Haltung zu deuten, und sucht also im Humor Urteil oder Angriff, Mitleid oder Schertz. Der Humor setzt sich nicht mit den stellungnehmenden Anderen auseinander, er ist nicht in der Allt\u00e4glichkeit der Auseinandersetzung und des Gespr\u00e4ches zu Hause, sondern fordert den Mitmenschen auf zu einem gemeinsamen Blick auf den Kontrast, seine Tiefe und seine Relativit\u00e4t. Gerade deshalb fassen der religi\u00f6se und der tragische Mensch ihn als einen leichtsinnigen Schertz auf, der sich dem Ernste des Lebens entzieht. Sie haben dann eben nicht verstanden, dass das Wesen des Humors in seiner Feinheit und Zartheit liegt. Diese Feinheit ist die Feinheit einer Grenze. Es ist das Wesen des Humors, sich auf der Grenze zwischen dem Komischen und dem Tragischen zu befinden. Der Humor weder lacht noch weint, er l\u00e4chelt froh \u00fcber die Paradoxalit\u00e4t des Daseins.

When this pressure reached its minimum (20% of the normal value) horseradish peroxidase (molecular weight 40,000; radius of an equivalent hydrodynamic sphere about 2.5 nm; 0.5 g/kg body weight), was injected intravenously. Twenty minutes following peroxidase administration, either aqueous humor was sampled from the anterior chamber for biochemical determination of peroxidase activity, or one eyeball was enucleated and processed for light and electron microscopic localization of the enzymatic tracer. This experiment showed that: (1) therapeutic doses of hypertonic urea do not cause a breakdown of either the blood-retina or the blood-aqueous barriers; (2) as intraocular pressure decreases, peroxidase-containing blood flows back from the episcleral veins into the Schlemm canal; (3) macromolecules up to the dimensions of horseradish peroxidase leak through the intercellular clefts of the endothelium of the Schlemm canal, permeate the juxtacanalicular connective tissue and trabecular meshwork, and finally enter the anterior chamber. Thus, blood-borne substances can circumvent the blood-aqueous barrier when intraocular pressure is decreased, and administration of a hypertonic agent may represent a simple pharmacological device to cause penetration into the ocular chambers by drugs that are normally excluded from the interior of the eye.\n      </p>", "This study tests a cognitive and an affective model based on extant explanations of the effects of humor along with a new affective-cognitive model. Results are derived from meta-analytic data and show how previous explanations may be integrated in order to explain how humor in advertising works. Humor reduces negative cognitions related to the ad because it serves as a distraction from counter-argumentation. In order to maintain positive affect, humor reduces cognitive efforts, in particular those related to brand-related cognitions, thus supporting a vampire effect; that is, humor distracts from processing central benefits of the brand. Humor exerts its strongest impact along affective paths, supporting the dominance of affective mechanisms. Affect and cognition do interplay in line with a congruency effect where the impact of positive affect on attitudes towards the ad is mediated by positive cognitions. The models differ when they are performed based on data from studies using either real or fictitious stimuli. Depending on the type of stimuli, slight changes occur that can be explained by the lack or existence of prior brand experience. Overall, the integration of affect and cognitions into one model provides a better explanation than the previous solely cognitive or solely affective models.\n      </p>", "Humor is ubiquitous and often beneficial, but the conditions that elicit it have been debated for millennia. We examine two factors that jointly influence perceptions of humor: the degree to which a stimulus is a violation (tragedy vs. mishap) and one's perceived distance from the stimulus (far vs. close). Five studies show that tragedies (which feature severe violations) are more humorous when temporally, socially, hypothetically, or spatially distant, but that mishaps (which feature mild violations) are more humorous when psychologically close. Although prevailing theories of humor have difficulty explaining the interaction between severity and distance revealed in these studies, our results are consistent with the proposal that humor occurs when a violation simultaneously seems benign. This benign-violation account suggests that distance facilitates humor in the case of tragedies by reducing threat, but that closeness facilitates humor in the case of mishaps by maintaining some sense of threat.\n      </p>", "Some joke performances are meant to elicit differential responses-laughter from some, and unlaughter from salient others-and so serve as powerful methods for heightening group boundaries. This article illustrates this thesis by analyzing audience responses to practical jokes and to the Muhammad cartoons that aroused worldwide controversy in 2006. To further make this case, I will delineate a theory of the audience for humor. Such a theory has heretofore been largely missing from both folklore and humor scholarship; instead, the lion's share of scholarly attention has gone to the performers, with the audience's role taken for granted. In boundary-heightening humor, the audience response is the subject of special attention, and it is interpreted in terms of contemporary notions about the importance of having a sense of humor and especially of being able to laugh at oneself.\n      </p>", "Previous research on ingratiation in organizations has identified various categories of ingratiatory behaviors.

An important subset of this research looks at how humor affects this relationship. While research has considered this subset in television programming, almost no research has explored this in the context of advertising. This paper builds on the little research that exists by examining the effects of combining humor and violence, as well as the theoretical approaches that underlie these effects. A content analysis is conducted to identify the prevalence of violence, humor, and the combination of these elements in a longitudinal sample of Super Bowl commercials (2005, 2007, and 2009). Further, we investigate the relationship between the joint occurrence of humor and violence in ads and ad popularity. We conclude that violent acts are rampant in these commercials and that many acts are camouflaged by the simultaneous presence of humor, especially in the most popular ads.\n      </p>", "El pensamiento postmoderno es una de las manifestaciones m\u00e1s conocidas de un cierto proceso de p\u00e9rdida de fe en la raz\u00f3n como herramienta para la soluci\u00f3n de problemas sociales que se ha dado en las sociedades occidentales.

Humor was related to competence in several ways consistent with previous theory and research: (1) through the manifestation of intellectual ability both in humor behaviors and in competent functioning; (2) through the role of mastery motivation enhancing both types of functioning; and (3) through peer relations, resulting from the effects of humor on peer acceptance or the effects of peer relations on humor behaviors.

Conservatives, compared with liberals, were found to dislike jokes that are overtly sexual and aggressive, although there are signs of a recent reaction against \"sexist\" jokes among liberal youth. Within the sphere of nonsense humor, conservatives were intolerant of jokes that failed to provide resolution of incongruous elements.

A study of predominantly female peer groups in a middle-school setting revealed that humor is utilized in different ways depending upon the size of the group and the degree of \"closeness\" among its members. Telling \"memorized\" jokes is something which occurs frequently within newly formed, mixed-sex, or mixed-age groups. Within this context, humor is often used to establish a sophisticated identity among acquaintances. Practical jokes, funny stories, and humorous behavior, on the other hand, are frequently shared by two or three close friends. These forms of humor are used to convey information about peer norms, often by contrasting them with adult expectations.

Within therapy, humor can be utilized to break a client's resistance, reduce tension, generate catharsis, and increase trust in the client/therapist relationship. Within groups and/or teams\\ the effects of humor can assist in increasing cohesion and goal attainment. Furthermore, humor can be beneficial in the form of laughter when aimed at the goal or task. This analysis discusses the effects of stress on increasing episodes of laughter, and finds that to discourage the use of laughter may actually reduce task group performance.

Evidence from a content analysis of The Daily Show's \"Indecision 2004\" coverage of the Democratic and Republican Party Conventions shows the program's humor was much harsher during the Republican Convention than it was during the Democratic Convention. While the humor in both conventions was heavily based on self-deprecation and the exploitation of conventional political stereotypes, the ridicule of Republicans focused much more on policy and character flaws. Humor pointed toward Democrats, on the other hand, tended to focus more on innocuous physical attributes. Analysis of panel data collected by the National Annenberg Election Survey during the 2004 national party conventions shows that exposure to The Daily Show's convention coverage was associated with increased negativity toward President Bush and Vice-President Dick Cheney. These relationships remain significant even when controlling for partisan identification and ideology.

The content analysis showed a significant increase in the use of humor in the U.S. since the last major benchmark study, but less humor than in the U.K. sample of advertising. An examination of the content analysis data using the Foote, Cone and Belding (FCB) planning matrix revealed a situational use of humor in both countries, with humor most often used with low involvement/feeling products and least often used with high involvement/feeling and thinking products.

Here we ask how humor operates in task-oriented group discussions. We use theories about the functions of humor to generate hypotheses about who jokes, when and in what situations. Then we use event history techniques to analyze humor attempts and successes in six-person groups. Our results combine to suggest an image of joking as a status-related activity, with men, high participators, frequent interrupters, and those who are frequently interrupted all showing status-related patterns of humor use. We find substantial time dependence in humor use, in which humor may serve to form a status hierarchy early in a group's development and to dissipate task-related tension later in the discussion. We use these results, in conjunction with core insights on status and emotion from the group processes literature, to develop a new theory of humor use in task-oriented groups. The new theory generates predictions about the content of humor episodes, which we examine with additional data from our group discussions. Consistent with the theory, we find that a higher proportion of men's humor is differentiating, while a higher proportion of women's humor is cohesion-building. We find the same general pattern with our other status variable, participation.\n      </p>", "Sociological analysis of humor has focused primarily upon its control and conflict functions. Such studies have been concerned principally with race and ethnic differences. However, an analysis of jokes concerning social and economic differences as revealed by anthologies of wit and humor demonstrate that their primary function is not conflict.

The source of the purinergic agonists acting in the ciliary epithelium, as in many epithelial tissues, is unknown. We found that the fluorescent ATP marker quinacrine stained rabbit and bovine ciliary epithelia but not the nerve fibers in the ciliary bodies. Cultured bovine pigmented and nonpigmented ciliary epithelial cells also stained intensely when incubated with quinacrine. Hypotonic stimulation of cultured epithelial cells increased the extracellular ATP concentration by 3-fold; this measurement underestimates actual release as the cells also displayed ecto-ATPase activity. The hypotonically triggered increase in ATP was inhibited by the Cl--channel blocker 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB) in both cell types. In contrast, the P-glycoprotein inhibitors tamoxifen and verapamil and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) blockers glybenclamide and diphenylamine-2-carboxylate did not affect ATP release from either cell type. This pharmacological profile suggests that ATP release is not restricted to P-glycoprotein or the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, but can proceed through a route sensitive to NPPB. ATP release also was triggered by ionomycin through a different NPPB-insensitive mechanism, inhibitable by the calcium/calmodulin-activated kinase II inhibitor KN-62. Thus, both layers of the ciliary epithelium store and release ATP, and purines likely modulate aqueous humor flow by paracrine and/or autocrine mechanisms within the two cell layers of this epithelium.\n      </p>", "Embedded in his top ten reasons for using humor in the classroom, Goebel describes engrossing and enriching humor-writing activities for students.\n      </p>", "The historical view of political humor in America maintains that the humor adheres to democratic theory and practice, viz., its dimension boundless, its character egalitarian, its substance encompassing and its expression open.

Humor, not intended by the Knight, simultaneously qualifies and reinforces this anachronistic, romantic ideal. Puns on \"queinte\" and \"harneys\" add the reality of the physical to the idealism of the Knight's notions of love. The courtly debate between Palamon and Arcite degenerates into bickering. Theseus' attempt at order through form does not avoid the carnage of the tournament. Even Arcite's death is treated most unceremoniously. Everywhere reality intrudes upon romantic idealism, even in the Knight's narrative techniques. Although \"occupatio\" is common in Chaucer, the Knight leaves his characters in particularly distressing circumstances. Thus, even form is not undisturbed in the method of narration.

Significant main effects were found indicating a developmental lag for the learning disabled subjects. Moderate correlations were established between comprehension and appreciation measures.\n      </p>", "A cartoon involving polygons and acute and obtuse angles is coupled with a full-page activity sheet.\n      </p>", "A cartoon involving least common multiples and 6-bun and 10-hotdog packages is coupled with a full-page activity sheet.\n      </p>", "In this paper we attempt to coordinate a variety of analytic tools in the study of Zinacanteco naming practices, especially that of nicknaming. We suggest that nicknames, whose initial use is informal, are extended to members of distinct local descent groups and are gradually incorporated into the system of formal names by replacing Indian surnames. Viewing local descent groups as the principal point of articulation between the naming system and lineage structure, we show how changes in the latter are accompanied by changes in the former, and we outline the economic and political factors that seem to be behind the tendencies toward segmentation within the lineage. We conceive of naming as a system of communicative codes and measure the communicative efficiency of naming components. This enables us to compare eighteenth-century Zinacanteco surname groups with modern nickname groups and enhances our argument that they are parallel in structure, in statistical distribution over population, and in the meaning content of particular names. We present evidence suggesting that our model relating formal and informal naming practices to modern Zinacanteco social structure appears to have historical validity as well\n      </p>", "To date, no published studies in art education or humor have examined how children respond to a wide variety of visual humor. In keeping with this conclusion, the purpose of this qualitative study was to explore: (1) how elementary age children at different grade levels reflect upon a wide range of visual humor; and (2) what beliefs and assumptions arise in their responses. Thirty-three elementary age children, eleven male and twenty-two females, engaged in small peer discussion groups during their weekly scheduled art class over a sixteen week period. Students looked at visual humor in fine art and popular culture in the areas of visual parody, pun, paradox, and satire. Findings were that children across grade levels: (1) found amusement and interest in visual humor in popular culture and a lack of amusement and interest in visual humor in fine art images; (2) have shared assumptions, particular understandings, and ways of thinking about art and humor by grade two; and (3) found that visual humor can expand their concepts of art. It is recommended that elementary aesthetic education embrace visual humor and postmodern aesthetic issues.\n      </p>", "Many have acknowledged the favorable, even therapeutic, effects of humor.

The first study used relevant humor in a one-semester statistics course in an experimental group and no humor in a control group. One hundred sixty-one students participated, and the results showed significant differences between the two groups in favor of the group learning with humor. No significant sex differences nor interactions were found. The second experiment was a replication of the first one, using 132 students in a one-semester introductory psychology course. The students (all females) were divided randomly into two groups. Humor was used in one, and the same teacher taught the second group without using humor. Again, significant differences were found: The group studying with humor had higher scores on the final exam. Explanations for the ways in which humor in teaching can influence student learning are given.\n      </p>", "What is the importance of humor in public administration? Dean Yarwood examines the sources, types, and consequences of humor in administration. He suggests that much administrative humor comes from incongruity-from contrasting the naturalness and ease of traditional institutions with the forced, formal character of bureaucracy. Social scientists from a variety of disciplines have carried out empirical studies of humor in organizations. They conclude that humor has important consequences for hierarchy and for the social dynamics of organizations. Another source for understanding humor in organizations is creative literature. Here, forms of humor abound that are not emphasized in the social science literature. The author concludes that the study of organizational humor ought to be of interest to both public managers and scholars because it is part of the serious business of organizations.\n      </p>", "           ", "This paper attempts to categorize political humor using four criteria: target, focus, acceptability, and presentation.

First graders in three classes (N=58) were randomly assigned to one of three humor design treatment groups and a control group. On two successive days prior to receiving a humor treatment, each group received a taped reading of a familiar story, which succeeded in the intended manipulation of subjects to low levels of arousal and interest across all groups. The three humor designs included a humor experience which was immediately followed by a serious presentation of new information (contiguous-immediate design), the same humor experience with a one week postponed presentation of the new information (contiguous-postponed design), and a presentation of the new information with humor interspersed within (integrated design). Results indicated that the two contiguous humor treatment groups had higher immediate memory and retention scores than the control group, particularly with regard to recall of the new information. The integrated humor treatment failed to have its intended humor reaction. Limitations of previous research, which generally does not support the instructional value of humor, are discussed in terms of basic theory and research in humor, motivation, and learning.\n      </p>", "There is evidence that humor in a commercial leads to effects that are desirable for the advertiser.

I begin by distinguishing between this particular role and the other kinds of ways in which humor and amusement might be regarded through a moral lens, consider historical approaches to humor that corroborate the kind of role for it on which my investigation focuses, and end by considering contemporary examples of irony, sarcasm, and satire as vehicles of just the kind criticism under review (for instance, the July 21, 2008, cover of the New Yorker).\n      </p>", "In this essay, Andrea McKenzie argues that the scatological and bawdy humor for which early eighteenth-century highwayman lives were so notorious functioned as a particularly pungent form of social and political commentary. The invocation of both blackguard protagonists and authors reinforced the element of social shaming and inversion, while the common trope of the \u201cbiting the biter\u201d (implying that it is no crime to con, outwit, or despoil those who prey on others) was readily adaptable to a Tory or \u201cCountry\u201d satirical program.

French humor can be very difficult for non-natives to understand or appreciate, but an instructor's linguistic and cultural guidance with various texts can make it easier to understand and can help students gain some insight into that national characteristic known as \"gallic spirit.\" The article suggests sources of humor and ideas for using them in class.\n      </p>", "The occurrence of 3 forms of humor, responsive, productive, and hostile, was assessed during the activities of 30 nursery school children, aged 3-5 years. The results indicated that the 3 forms were not significantly correlated, providing evidence for the view that humor has multiple aspects and is not a unitary trait. By grouping 14 situations and activities according to the predominant humor form (responsive, productive, mixed), it was shown that the nature of ongoing activities contributed significantly to the pattern of humor exhibited. Furthermore, the analysis by situation revealed significant sex differences-girls displayed more examples defined as responsive humor, while boys scored a higher frequency of hostile joking.\n      </p>", "What is narrative humor? With this question in mind, my essay (in two parts) reviews several studies of narrative and humor. Part 1 discusses Edmond Wright (2005), who argues that both humor and narrative crucially require audiences or readers to switch between \"intentional perspectives\": between the intentions, goals, beliefs, motivations, emotions, and so forth of different agents or participants. Although an important idea, it does not explain the difference between humor and narrative or the composite concept of narrative humor. My essay shares Wright's intentionalist thrust but points out differences between humor and narrative. While narrative has minimally two layers of intentionality (oriented to the action and to its presentation), humor need not have them. While humor always requires agents to perceive incongruity and induces (or confirms) feelings of superiority in them, narrative is not defined by incongruity and superiority (although it can create those effects). An intentionalist description of narrative humor\u2014the composite concept\u2014now emerges: humor is narrative when it creates and/or exploits incongruity and superiority relations between the participants (\"agents\") of narrative texts: author, narrator, reader, spectator, character. Thus to explain narrative humor is to show how narrative enables its participants (\"agents\") to produce humor. I analyze some types of narrative humor: \"metanarrative humor,\" \"comic narrative suspense,\" and \"comic narrative surprise.\" Some analysts add \"comic character\" and \"comic action logic\" as forms of narrative humor. This is wrong, because narrative is not just story (actions, characters) but discourse (narration) about story, although it is true (and relevant) that narrators can back- or foreground themselves and their characters. The narrator's degree of fore- or backgrounding (i.e., of perceptibility) may influence the type of humor perceived in narrative (e.g., narratorial sarcasm or irony, dramatic irony). Finally, I point out that the notion of narrative perspective complicates Wright's (or any other) definition of comic narrative in terms of \"pleasure\" or \"happy ending.\" Part 2 of this essay will argue that such intentionalist analysis is more basic than the psychoanalytic concepts that Alenka Zupan\u010di\u010d (2008) brings to bear on comedy. Also, the intentionalist framework will be contrasted there with Salvatore Attardo's (2001) and Isabel Ermida's (2008) less intentionalist (\"script-based\") views on narrative humor.\n      </p>", "The primary aim of this study was to investigate the use of humor as a masking device for deceptive advertising claims. Content analysis on a total of 238 ads assessed whether humor was used to mask any deceptive claims. Deceptive claims were found in 73.5% of humorous ads, and 74.5% of these were masked by humor. The relationship between various forms of deceptive claims and humor types used was also assessed to determine whether specific humor types masked particular types of deceptive claims. It appears that all types of humor are used to mask the various types of deceptive claims investigated. Furthermore, specific types of humor are used to mask particular types of deceptive claims.\n      </p>", "This article presents several units from a course on German Humor offered at Washington University in St. Louis in the Spring of 2003 and 2006.
