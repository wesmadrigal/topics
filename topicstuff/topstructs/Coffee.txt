Biotechnology offers alternative strategies for generating new and improved coffee varieties, including those resistances to environmental extremes, pests, and diseases, low in caffeine, and with uniform fruit maturation. Large improvements in somatic embryogenesis, development of haploids, and scale-up of micropropagation have been accomplished in the last 5 yr. The recent identification of expressed sequence tags (EST) that are differentially expressed during the infestation of coffee plants by coffee leaf miners and the isolation and cloning of the promoter for the N-methyltransferase gene associated with caffeine production open up the possibility of producing varieties of coffee with new traits. This review provides a summary of in vitro biological advances and directions as to how they could be applied to improve the production and quality of coffee.\n      </p>", "This article explores the impacts of market shocks and institutional change on smallholder livelihoods, and the challenge of adaptation in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. The rapid decline in coffee prices since the dissolution of the International Coffee Agreement in 1989 has had widespread and profound impacts across coffee-producing regions. The data collected in the three case studies of this project confirm the severity of the impact, particularly in the Mexican and Guatemalan communities. They also illustrate the importance of the historical relationship between farmers and public institutions in defining farmers' perception of risk, their awareness of the nature of the changes they face, and thus the flexibility of their responses to present and future uncertainty. The project's findings indicate that the existence and development of local networks among farmers, service providers and information sources may be critical for facilitating adaptation, particularly in the context of economic liberalization and globalized agriculture.\n      </p>", "Background Coffee and tea consumption has been inconsistently associated with the risk of breast cancer. We examined the associations of caffeinated coffee and black tea consumption with the incidence of breast cancer, overall and by estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status of the tumor, in the Swedish Mamography Cohort. Methods We prospectively followed up 61,433 women who were cancer free at baseline in 1987-1990. Coffee and tea consumption was assessed with a food-frequency questionnaire administered at baseline and in 1997. Incident invasive breast cancer cases were ascertained by linkage with Swedish Cancer registers. Results Over a mean follow-up of 17.4 years, through December 2007, there were 2,952 incident cases of invasive breast cancer identified. Coffee consumption was not associated with risk of overall breast cancer (multivariate relative risk (RR) for \u22654 cups/day versus &lt;1 cup/day = 1.02; 95% CI, 0.87-1.20) or with any subtype defined by ER and PR status. Black tea consumption was significantly positively associated with risk of overall breast cancer and ER+/PR+ tumors. The multivariate RRs comparing \u22652 cups/day of tea with no consumption were 1.22 (95% CI, 1.05-1.42) for overall breast cancer and 1.36 (95% CI, 1.09-1.69) for ER+/PR+ tumors. Conclusion Findings from this prospective study do not support a role of coffee consumption in the development of breast cancer but suggest that black tea consumption may be positively associated with risk of ER+/PR+ tumors.\n      </p>", "The important advances in coffee biotechnological techniques which have been made particularly during the last 10 yr could benefit the coffee breeder in practice and open new perspectives for the development of new varieties. The molecular phylogeny of Coffea species has been established using DNA sequence data. The molecular markers have revealed an extremely reduced genetic diversity in Coffea arabica L. in comparison to C. canephora. However, wild accessions collected in the Ethiopian highlands appeared to constitute a valuable gene reservoir. A complete genetic linkage map of C. canephora was reported and additional ones are being constructed, particularly on C. arabica. The integration of Molecular Assisted Selection in coffee breeding promises to drastically increase the efficiency of breeding programs. Economically important genes of the caffeine biosynthetic pathway or genes encoding for seed storage proteins have been isolated. The high performance already achieved in the in vitro propagation process by somatic embryogenesis offers the possibility to mass propagate superior hybrids in different countries of both C. arabica (selected F\u2081 hybrids) and C. canephora (rootstock variety). Pilot productions by somatic embryogenesis currently permit preparation for commercial application. Somaclonal variation was observed. The percentage of the off-types can vary between 3 and 10% depending on the genotype. Seed cryopreservation enables a routine use for long-term conservation of coffee genetic resources. Transgenic plants have been obtained for the C. arabica and C. canephora cultivated species through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation which constitutes the technique now currently used to transfer directly genes in coffee plants.\n      </p>", "The effects of regular daily coffee consumption on liver enzymes were studied in a large number of subjects from the general population. In coffee drinkers, liver enzymes (gamma-glutamyl transferase, alanine-amino transferase, and alkaline phosphatase) and serum bilirubin were lower than in non-coffee-drinking subjects or in those consuming less than 3 cups daily. The hypothesis proposed is that liver enzymes are a target for caffeine contained in coffee.\n      </p>", "We studied avian foraging at two shaded coffee plantations in Ciales, Puerto Rico. Both coffee plantations contained patches of second-growth forest but differed in shade types; one was a rustic plantation with a species-diverse shade including many fruiting plant species and the other was a commercial polyculture shaded almost solely by Inga vera. We quantified foraging activity of five fruit-eating bird species (Euphonia musica, Loxigilla portoricensis, Nesospingus speculiferus, Spindalis portoricensis, and Vireo altiloquous) and monthly fruit abundance in the coffee plantation and adjacent second-growth forest habitats at each site. Fruits comprised more than 50 percent of the diets for four of five focal bird species. We found a significant difference in the number of foraging records for focal bird species between coffee and forest habitats in the commercial polyculture but found few differences between these habitats in the rustic coffee farm. Overall, foraging activity was positively correlated with the abundance of fruits across study sites. Bird foraging was concentrated on plant species in the genera Cecropia, Miconia, Schefflera, Phoradendron, and Guarea, which together accounted for over 50 percent of frugivory records. Plant species in such genera fruited over prolonged time periods and provided birds with a fairly constant fruit supply. Our findings underscore the importance of fruiting plant species in making coffee plantations suitable habitat for birds and suggest that native fruiting plants be incorporated in coffee farms for avian conservation. /// Estudiamos el forrajeo de aves frug\u00edvoras en dos plantaciones de caf\u00e9 de sombra en Ciales, Puerto Rico. Ambas plantaciones conten\u00edan parches de bosque de crecimiento secundario, pero se diferenciaban por el tipo de sombra: una era \"r\u00fastica\" con una gran diversidad de especies de sombra, incluyendo muchas especies de plantas frutales, y la otra era un \"policultivo comercial\" sombreada casi \u00fanicamente por Inga vera. En cada sitio, cuantificamos la actividad de forrajeo de cinco especies de aves frug\u00edvoras (Euphonia musica, Loxigilla portoricensis, Nesospingus speculiferus, Spindalis portoricensis, Vireo altiloquous), y la abundancia mensual de frutos en los cafetales y en los bosques adyacentes. Las frutas comprendieron m\u00e1s del 50 por ciento de la dieta de cuatro de las cinco especies de aves en estudio. Encontramos diferencias significativas en el n\u00famero de registros de forrajeo de especies de aves entre los habitats de caf\u00e9 y bosque en el policultivo comercial, pero encontramos pocas diferencias entre estos habitats en la granja de caf\u00e9 r\u00fastico. En general, la actividad de forrajeo estuvo positivamente correlacionada con la abundancia de frutos a trav\u00e9s de los sitios de estudio. El forrajeo de las aves estuvo centrado en especies de plantas de los g\u00e9neros Cecropia, Guarea, Schefflera, y Phoradendron, que juntas abarcaron por encima del 50 por ciento de los registros de frugivor\u00eda. Especies de plantas en estos g\u00e9neros fructificaron por un per\u00edodo de tiempo m\u00e1s prolongado y surtieron constantemente a las aves de frutas. Nuestros hallazgos resaltan la importancia de las especies de plantas frutales en convertir las plantaciones de caf\u00e9 en h\u00e1bitats adecuados para las aves, y sugiere que las plantas frutales nativas deberian ser incorporadas en las granjas de caf\u00e9 para la conservaci\u00f3n de las aves.\n      </p>", "The literature from 1990 to 2003 on the relation between coffee, decaffeinated coffee, tea and colorectal cancer risk has been reviewed. For the relation with coffee, three cohort (517 total cases) and nine case-control studies (7555 cases) analysed colon cancer; three cohort (307 cases) and four case-control studies (2704 cases) rectal cancer; six case-control studies (854 cases) colorectal cancer. For colon cancer most case-control studies found risk estimates below unity; the results are less clear for cohort studies. No relation emerged for rectal cancer. A meta-analysis, including five cohort and twelve case-control studies, reported a pooled relative risk of 0.76 (significant). Any methodological artefact is unlikely to account for the consistent inverse association in different countries and settings. Plausible biological explanations include coffee-related reductions of cholesterol, bile acids and neutral sterol secretion in the colon; antimutagenic properties of selected coffee components; increased colonic motility. Decaffeinated coffee was not related to either colon or rectal cancer in three case-control studies. No overall association between tea and either colon or rectal cancer risk emerged in seven cohort (1756 total cases of colon, 759 of rectal and 60 of colorectal cancer) and 12 case-control studies (8058 cases of colon, 4865 of rectal, 604 of colorectal cancer).\n      </p>", "Earlier research has implicated coffee drinking as a possible protective factor for suicide. We followed-up 43,166 subjects for the mean 14.6 years, and 213 suicides were committed. Daily coffee drinking had a J-shaped association with the risk of suicide. Using the Cox model we controlled for potential covariates, and found that among heavy coffee drinkers (\u22658 cups/day) the risk of suicide was 58% higher compared with more moderate drinkers.\n      </p>", "Over the past decade international organizations and developing countries have been trying to promote agricultural diversification among smallholders under the assumption that smallholders are too dependent upon a narrow range of crops. The International Coffee Organization and the Government of Indonesia have promoted agricultural diversification among coffee farmers to curb production and, thereby, increase prices. In South Sumatra, Indonesia, coffee smallholders diversify on their own initiative and depend upon numerous resource systems. They diversify out of coffee and even agriculture because other investments yield attractive returns and because further diversification within agriculture is often limited by agronomic and financial constraints.\n      </p>", "Was the decline in alcohol consumption, experienced in many countries during the nineteenth century, related to growth of the coffee culture? This question is approached first through a simple content analysis of qualitative data obtained from an empirical sociological study of inebriety in Norway in the 1850s by Norway's first sociologist, Eilert Sundt [1859], then by a time-series analysis of quantitative data on coffee and alcoholic beverages in Norway. The results confirm that coffee filled a cultural 'niche' created by the restrictive Norwegian alcohol policy in the nineteenth century. Sundt's qualitative data point clearly in this direction. Although the quantitative data -- particularly on coffee -- are far from ideal indicators of consumption, the results lend some credibility to the substitution hypothesis: The trends coincide fairly closely for the two beverages, and in the detrended series there are measurable signs of correlation when the confounding effects of economic development are controlled for. It is concluded that the political attempts to reduce alcohol problems in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, i.e. reduced availability and increased taxes, may have been alleviated by the growing popularity of coffee as an alternative, 'new' beverage for the population at large, and not just the higher social classes.\n      </p>", "The behavior of four coffee (Coffea canephora cv. Robusta) clones was evaluated in this work to define the conditions that would allow somatic embryogenesis to be induced at different seasons of the year. The objective was to have an adaptive methodology for in vitro propagation of these four coffee clones that were selected for their agronomic characteristics. The use of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and Picloram in the culture medium at concentrations between 2.07 and 4.14 \u00b5M resulted in high-frequency somatic embryogenesis when leaves were collected between April and June for genotype C-R, and between April and July for M-229. Callus from 28 to 35 d of induction showed better results throughout the whole regeneration process, particularly in liquid medium. There was a clear difference in the behavior of the clones evaluated.\n      </p>", "Shade coffee certification programs have emerged over the past six years to verify that coffee marketed as \"shade grown\" is actually grown on farms that provide higher quality habitat for biodiversity. In spite of good intentions and an increasing market, little consensus exists on whether current criteria can successfully identify coffee farms of conservation significance. This paper provides the first ecological evaluation and comparison of shade-grown coffee criteria used by major certification programs. Using vegetative data, we evaluated criteria developed by the Rainforest Alliance, the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center (SMBC), and the Specialty Coffee Association of America across a range of coffee agroecosystems in Chiapas, Mexico, to determine which management practices each program would certify. Fruit-feeding butterflies and forest bird species found in these coffee agroecosystems were compared with nearby forest reserves as indicators of biodiversity and conservation potential. These agroecosystems fall into three categories: rustic, commercial polyculture, and shaded monoculture. The rustic system contained significantly higher fruit-feeding butterfly diversity and an avifauna more similar to that found in forest reserves than the other systems. This was also the only agroecosystem that met the criteria for all certification programs, while the shaded monoculture fell short of all sets of criteria. This suggests that certification programs are succeeding in discriminating between the extremes of shade coffee production. Certification programs differed, however, in their treatment of the intermediate, commercial polyculture systems, reflecting different philosophies for conservation in managed ecosystems. Programs promoted by SMBC use high standards that would exclude all but the most diverse commercial polyculture or rustic systems to certify only those systems that support high levels of biodiversity. The program supported by the Rainforest Alliance only excludes the shaded monoculture while engaging the others in the move toward greater sustainability. The merits of each approach should be put to rigorous debate, and their ability to contribute to biodiversity conservation should be reflected in product marketing. This study suggests that further research can provide a stronger scientific basis and independent verification for the certification of green products that claim to enhance biodiversity conservation in tropical agroecosystems.\n      </p>", "Asia's only woman coffee taster, Sunalini Menon, is CEO of Coffee Lab, a Bangalore-based consultancy which boasts of state-of-the-art equipment and offers a gamut of seed-to-the-cup services: coffee evaluation, education, training, certification and advisory services. The lab also assists in the special preparations of coffee such as estate brands and specialty coffees based on plant strain, region of growth, and the intrinsic properties of various beans. Coffee, believes Menon, is a very sensitive living being that emotes. Palate-sensitivity and attention to detail are a good taster's key qualities. A good taster possesses a sharp acuity of taste, concentration, good memory power, descriptive terminology and communication skills. Formulating blends is a vital part of Menon's business. Where and how coffee is grown affects the size, density and flavor of the bean. Coffee has as many notes and flavors as wine and you have to feel it layer by layer, advises Menon. But the mind and palate need a break between tasting sessions\u2014eating a cracker or a piece of bread cleanses the palate. An hour before and after lunch are no-no for tasting sessions as are fatigue and poor health. Alcohol, tobacco and spicy food are to be avoided as well.\n      </p>", "Brazil is the largest economy in Latin America and the world's leading producer and exporter of coffee. Smallholders are the predominant producers of Brazilian coffee and have been significantly impacted by post-ISI (import substitution industrialisation) neoliberal reforms that swept the nation's agricultural sector beginning in the 1980s. These reforms stimulated increased coffee production while simultaneously diminishing state interventions, including agricultural subsidies, farmer credits, research and development programmes, extension services, and rural development initiatives. These changes were closely followed by major restructuring of the global coffee market and the elimination of international coffee export quotas. Our research joins a growing body of recent literature exploring how changes related to market liberalisation and globalisation affect localities and regions where producers supply coffee for conventional markets. Through a case study, we describe the impacts of neoliberal globalisation on the lives, livelihoods, and environment of small-scale coffee producers in Minas Gerais, Brazil. We explore how neoliberal reform, reflected in the specific historical, geographical, and environmental context of Brazilian coffee production, has resulted in the increased marginalisation of small-scale farmers, the degradation of soils, and overall rural decline.\n      </p>", "It is commonly thought that diverse agroecosystems are less prone to pest outbreaks because they support a high diversity of natural enemies. The idea that diversity stabilizes functional properties of communities to environmental perturbation is formalized in the ecological literature as the \"insurance hypothesis.\" Recently this hypothesis has been examined theoretically and in microcosm experiments. However it has not been tested empirically in an agroecosystem. Here we provide a test of the insurance hypothesis by examining insect predation by birds in coffee farms with different levels of plant diversity. Lepidopteran larvae were placed in coffee plants, and larval disappearance rates were measured within and outside bird exclosures in two farms with distinct levels of shade. Significant differences were found associated with the exclosure treatment, indicating that birds can potentially prevent pest outbreaks. Furthermore, the effect was significant only for the farm with a high floristic diversity, providing partial evidence in support of the insurance hypothesis.\n      </p>", "Tracheomycosis or coffee wilt has emerged as a major disease of robusta coffee in Uganda in the past 10 years. Coffee wilt historically has been associated with Fusarium xylarioides Steyaert (teleomorph Gibberella xylarioides Heim and Sacc.), a species that has been classified as a member of Fusarium section Lateritium. We investigated the molecular phylogenetics of fusarial coffee wilt isolates by generating partial DNA sequences from two protein coding regions, translation elongation factor 1-\u03b1 and beta-tubulin, in 36 isolates previously identified as F. xylarioides and related fusaria from coffee and other woody hosts, as well as from 12 isolates associated with a current coffee wilt outbreak in Uganda. These isolates fell into two morphologically and phylogenetically distinct groups. The first group was found to represent previously unidentified members of the Gibberella fujikuroi species complex (GFC), a clade that replaces the artificial Fusarium section Liseola. This group of isolates fit the original description of F. xylarioides, thus connecting it to the GFC. The second group, which was diverse in its morphology and DNA sequences, comprised four distinct lineages related to Fusarium lateritium. Our finding of unrelated species associated with coffee wilt disease has important implications regarding its epidemiology, etiology and control.\n      </p>", "Nest sites are a limiting resource for arboreal twig-nesting ants, and nest sites may be increasingly limited with habitat modification. One such habitat modification is the conversion of traditional coffee farms, where coffee is cultivated under a dense, diverse shade canopy, to more intensive production systems with reduced canopy cover and lower diversity, height, and density of shade trees. As a result of such management intensification, ant diversity declines. We ask here if: (1) nest sites are a limiting resource for arboreal twig-nesting ants in coffee farms, especially in intensively managed systems and (2) nest-site limitation is a mechanism causing loss of ant diversity with coffee management intensification. During 2000-2003, we investigated occupancy, species richness, and species composition of arboreal twig-nesting ants using natural (hollow coffee twig) and artificial (bamboo stem) nests in farms either with high or low diversity and density of shade trees. In both high- and low-shade sites ants occupied a majority (&gt;55%) of natural nests and occupied some (&gt;15%) artificial nests, and significantly more artificial nests were occupied in low-shade sites. In both high- and low-shade sites, ant richness was higher in artificial than in natural nests. More species occupied natural nests in low-shade sites, and more species occupied artificial nests in high-shade sites. Furthermore, species composition differed between nest types, with more ant species found more often or only in artificial nests. These results indicate that, although ants are not strongly nest-site limited in coffee agroecosystems, nest limitation increases somewhat with increasing management intensification. Reductions in numbers of nest sites may be a mechanism causing ant diversity loss with coffee management intensification. Interestingly, because relatively fewer species colonized artificial nests in the low-shade site, ants may be recruitment limited in the low-shade sites, possibly maintaining low ant richness in these sites.\n      </p>", "A variety of studies have established the value of shaded coffee plantations as habitat for birds. While the value of birds as biological controls in coffee has received some attention, the interactions between birds and other predators of insects have not been tested. We used exclosures to examine the effects of vertebrate predators on the arthropods associated with coffee, in particular the coffee leafminer (Leucoptera coffeella) and the flatid planthopper Petrusa epilepsis, in a shaded coffee plantation in Puerto Rico. We used a 2 * 2 factorial design with four treatments: exclusion of birds, lizards, birds and lizards, and control (no exclusion). Abundance of insects &gt;5 mm increased when birds or both birds and lizards were removed. Birds and lizards had an additive effect for insects &lt;5 mm and for all insects combined. Coffee leafminers showed a weak response to removal of predators while planthopper abundance increased significantly in the absence of avian predators. Arthropod predators and parasitoids did not differ significantly between treatments. Our findings suggest that vertebrate insectivores have an additive effect on insects in coffee and may help control abundances of some coffee pests. Equally important, we present evidence suggesting that they do not interfere with other known natural enemies of coffee pests.\n      </p>", "Coffee agroecosystems are critical to the success of conservation efforts in Latin America because of their ecological and economic importance. Coffee certification programs may offer one way to protect biodiversity and maintain farmer livelihoods. Established coffee certification programs fall into three distinct, but not mutually exclusive categories: organic, fair trade, and shade. The results of previous studies demonstrate that shade certification can benefit biodiversity, but it remains unclear whether a farmer's participation in any certification program can provide both ecological and economic benefits. To assess the value of coffee certification for conservation efforts in the region, we examined economic and ecological aspects of coffee production for eight coffee cooperatives in Chiapas, Mexico, that were certified organic, certified organic and fair trade, or uncertified. We compared vegetation and ant and bird diversity in coffee farms and forests, and interviewed farmers to determine coffee yield, gross revenue from coffee production, and area in coffee production. Although there are no shade-certified farms in the study region, we used vegetation data to determine whether cooperatives would qualify for shade certification. We found no differences in vegetation characteristics, ant or bird species richness, or fraction offorest fauna in farms based on certification. Farmers with organic and organic and fair-trade certification had more land under cultivation and in some cases higher revenue than uncertified farmers. Coffee production area did not vary among farm types. No cooperative passed shade-coffee certification standards because the plantations lacked vertical stratification, yet vegetation variables for shade certification significantly correlated with ant and bird diversity. Although farmers in the Chiapas highlands with organic and/or fair-trade certification may reap some economic benefits from their certification status, their farms may not protect as much biodiversity as shade-certified farms. Working toward triple certification (organic, fair trade, and shade) at the farm level may enhance biodiversity protection, increase benefits to farmers, and lead to more successful conservation strategies in coffee-growing regions.\n      </p>", "In order to evaluate the effects of Italian brewed coffee (moka) on cholesterol and serum lipoproteins, a randomized double-blind 14-week clinical trial was performed. After a coffee-free period of four weeks, 49 subjects drank coffee, caffeinated and decaffeinated, for ten weeks. There was no evidence that the Italian method of brewing coffee affects serum lipoproteins since no statistically significant differences were found.\n      </p>", "In spite of the attention that has been focused on the importance of traditional, shade coffee production for biodiversity, little is known about the relative conservation value of different systems of managing the shade canopy. We surveyed fruit-feeding butterfly species richness and vegetation structure on different shade coffee management systems in Chiapas, Mexico, that ranged from intensive commercial to traditional, rustic systems. The impact of management on the diversity and structure of the shade canopy in each coffee production system was quantified and compared using a Management Index. This Management Index revealed statistically significant differences between management systems that previously were distinguished by researchers using qualitative, \"gestalt\" categories. Butterfly species richness was found to decline as management intensity increased, but a significant drop was found between the rustic system and the other more intensive systems, corroborating the importance of preserving rustic, shade coffee production for the conservation of biodiversity. Fruit-feeding butterflies were found to be very sensitive to the intensification of management of the shade canopy, so they may be an effective way to monitor ecological changes that accompany intensification within the coffee agroecosystem. Additionally, the vegetation Management Index may prove useful for quantifying management practices to evaluate certification criteria for conservation benefits.\n      </p>", "The authors investigated the possible relation between habitual cigarette and coffee consumption and blood pressure (BP) levels in 7506 men and 2095 women. The study population were managers and employees examined in northern Italy between 1986-1988. In particular, the hypothesis of a substantial independence between smoking-BP and coffee-BP was tested. BP levels were corrected for age, body mass index, physical activity, and alcohol consumption by analysis of covariance. Significantly, smoking was inversely related to BP, both in men (SBP, P &lt; 0.001, DBP, P &lt; 0.001) and women (SBP, P = 0.001, DBP, P = 0.012). In particular, the BP of non-smoking men, SBP/DBP, was 131.0/83.5, whereas in male smokers up to and over 20 cigarette/day, BP was 128.1/82.0 and 128.1/82.1 respectively. Coffee consumption was related to BP levels in men (SBP, P &lt; 0.001; DBP, P = 0.009), but not in women (SBP, P = 0.320; DBP, P = 0.982). BP in male subjects was 131.3/83.5 in non-drinkers, 130.7/83.3 in those drinking 1-3 cups/day, 128.4/82.6 and 127.2/81.8 in drinkers of 4-5 and over 5 cups/day, respectively. No significant interactions were demonstrated, thus the relationship between habitual smoking and coffee consumption with BP appears to agree with an additive model.\n      </p>", "This paper employs a global value chains (GVC) perspective to recent developments in the coffee market, associated with the behavior of market structure in a context of widening spreads around declining prices and affirms that due to their imperfect inclusion in the global economy, primary markets have entered 'terminal crisis'. The paper asserts that while the role of state-territorial regimes of governance has noticeably weakened in the current ('terminal crisis') context, the combined strategic positioning of ('related') players, residing at highly imperfect, monopolized nodes has become the key shaper of development and this has had a de-stabilizing effect on the poorest. The paper observes that systemic crisis appears to be resolvable, subject to the ability of emerging new redistributive outcomes to reposition the coffee system at a qualitatively new equilibrium. In contributing to a more systematic (value-chain centered) line of enquiry on the relationship between development and inequality, the paper analytically expands key relationships in the GVC framework (using extra inputs from strategic management, economic trade and convention theory) and offers to policymaking a framework for 'combating' falling terms of trade in primary markets by means of new economic relations.\n      </p>", "Objective: Studies evaluating the relationships between coffee, tea and caffeine and ovarian cancer risk have given inconsistent results. We have examined these associations using data from an Australian population-based case-control study. Methods: Women with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) (n = 696) and control women selected from the Electoral Roll (n = 786) provided comprehensive reproductive and lifestyle data and completed a food frequency questionnaire. Results: Increasing coffee consumption was associated with a decreased risk of invasive EOC (p trend = 0.009) with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.51 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32-0.80) for consumption of \u22654 cups of coffee per day compared to non-drinkers. The association was significant only for serous and endometrioid/clear cell histological subtypes. There was no association with borderline tumours (OR: 1.20, 95% CI: 0.58-2.47). An inverse relationship was also seen between caffeine intake and EOC but tea consumption was not related to EOC (OR: 1.10 95% CI: 0.76-1.61 for \u22654 cups/day versus none). Conclusions: As tea contributed significantly to caffeine intake in this population we conclude that the association we observed with coffee is not due to caffeine, but to other components within coffee. We suggest future studies consider the type as well as the amount of each beverage consumed.\n      </p>", "This article examines recent transformations of the coffee landscape of northern Latin America through the optic of \"place as process.\" As coffee became the most important regional export crop, its \"place\" evolved. Coffee lands in northern Latin America now embrace 3.1 million hectares, often contiguous across international borders. Like many agricultural systems, coffee has succumbed to intensification, a process termed \"technification\" in the Latin American setting. The result is a landscape mosaic in which a traditional agroforest coffee system coexists with coffee lands transformed by modernization. The institutional forces behind this process, as well as some of its social and ecological consequences, are discussed.\n      </p>", "This article presents an impact assessment framework that allows for the evaluation of positive and negative local-level impacts that have resulted from \"responsible trade\" interventions such as fair trade and ethical trade. The framework investigates impact relating to (1) livelihood impacts on primary stakeholders; (2) socio-economic impacts on communities; (3) organizational impacts; (4) environmental impacts; (5) policies and institutional impacts; and (6) future prospects. It identifies relevant local-level stakeholders and facilitates the analysis of conflicting interests. The framework was developed in the context of, and is applied in this article to, the fair trade coffee industry in northern Nicaragua. It was designed, however, so that it can be applied across commodity sectors and responsible trade initiatives. It is able to do this by accommodating for differences in the social, environmental, political and institutional contexts of different areas, and by taking into account the distinct nature of an initiative's overall objectives, different levels of intervention, and the full range of stakeholders involved.\n      </p>", "Due to their dependence on a single crop, agricultural frontiers are often considered to be formed through phases of 'boom and bust'. These phases are closely related to fluctuations in world market prices of the commodity that constitutes the frontier's economic basis. This paper demonstrates how although migration patterns and economic growth are conditioned by world market dynamics, local socioeconomic outcomes within frontier regions are diverse. Frontier formation is far from a homogenous process that slowly incorporates all localities and communities in the same way. Dak Lak Province, in the Central Highlands of Vietnam, produces more than 50% of Vietnam's coffee. As Vietnam is the world's largest exporter of Robusta coffee, Dak Lak is highly embedded in the dynamics of the world coffee market. Planned settlement in Dak Lak started in the 1950s and has continued in phases orchestrated by the state's changing economic, social and political motives. Spontaneous immigration has dominated since the early 1990s when the coffee sector took off and regulations on population mobility were relaxed. This paper shows how household livelihoods differ substantially between four communes in Dak Lak Province due to different combinations of migrant and indigenous groups, the ease of transport to the main urban centres, and the timing of coffee planting in the settlements. These temporal and spatial variations in livelihoods both condition and are conditioned by the organisational set-up of the local coffee marketing chain.\n      </p>", "Coffee plantations have replaced many lower-montane forests in the Neotropics, and ongoing intensification is converting traditional polycultures with a variety of shade trees to plantations with no or monospecific shade trees. To evaluate the impact of coffee cultivation on epiphyte diversity, I surveyed vascular epiphytes on shade trees in nine different coffee plantations and compared records with those in four natural forests in central Veracruz, Mexico. Eighty-nine species occurred in coffee plantations, and 104 species occurred in natural forests. The number of epiphytic species in traditional polycultures with old shade trees, mostly of the genus Inga, was similar to that in forests, but plantations with small trees and sparse shade hosted fewer epiphytes than those with large trees. Epiphyte communities were, however, more homogeneous in coffee plantations than in forests, possibly because of a drier microclimate and the lack of large and long-lived trees. These results demonstrate the value of traditional polycultures for epiphyte diversity, show the importance of conserving large shade trees, and suggest that these coffee systems may not be suitable for all epiphytes.\n      </p>", "Over the last decade, historically low market prices for Coffea arabica have affected smallholder shade coffee-growing households throughout northern Latin America. In an effort to better understand household response to the coffee crisis and associated landscape changes, this paper examines agricultural production choices and land use patterns among Huastec Maya coffee-growing households. Using data compiled from 47 household interviews, I describe the cultural-geographical landscape in which the Huastec Maya land use system is embedded. In addition, I examine the economics of household production through a financial cost-benefit analysis and through an exploration of the relationship between land availability and land use patterns. Results show that economic inputs and returns from agriculture are highly variable, and that, in 2001, coffee cultivation was not a viable cash-generating strategy for most households. Land availability was found to have a significant effect on land use decisions, especially the proportion of land area devoted to fallow. Most importantly, however, the case study suggests that a purely economic approach does not suffice in explaining why the Huastec Maya continued to grow coffee in 2001, after years of low prices. Household production choices and livelihood strategies must also be viewed within a cultural context.\n      </p>", "In this paper I analyze the relationship between coffee labor relations and deforestation in Sao Paulo state, Brazil, using new empirical data from judicial archives and a microeconomic approach stressing transaction costs. Contractual planting, sharecropping, and mixed wage-piece rate schemes encouraged rapid conversion of forest and woodland (Cerradao) to coffee by a wide range of landowners. Factors of labor quality, costly supervision, information asymmetries, and risk shaped the labor relations that speeded the creation of coffee groves. Tensions existed within labor relations schemes regarding usufruct, debt, and the definition of work. The findings suggest that greater attention should be given to the particular nature of labor arrangements in affecting environmental resource use.\n      </p>", "We examined the relations between spontaneous abortion and the consumption of caffeine, individual caffeine-containing beverages (coffee, tea, and soda), and decaffeinated coffee in a prospective study of 5,144 pregnant women. We collected information about potential risk factors for spontaneous abortion, including consumption of caffeinated beverages and decaffeinated coffee before and during pregnancy, by interview in the first trimester. Neither total estimated caffeine nor individual caffeinated beverage consumption during the first trimester was associated with an appreciable increase in risk for spontaneous abortion. The adjusted odds ratio for consumption of greater than 300 mg per day of caffeine was 1.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.8-2.1] after adjustment for maternal age, pregnancy history, cigarette and alcohol consumption, employment, race, gestational age at interview, and marital and socioeconomic status. The adjusted odds ratio for spontaneous abortion related to consumption of three or more cups of decaffeinated coffee during the first trimester was 2.4 (95% CI = 1.3-4.7) in the same model. Although we could not demonstrate this with available data, we suspect that this association was due to bias resulting from the relations among fetal viability, symptoms of pregnancy such as nausea, and consumption patterns during pregnancy.\n      </p>", "Much of the remaining \"forest\" vegetation in eastern Chiapas, Mexico is managed for coffee production. In this region coffee is grown under either the canopy of natural forest or under a planted canopy dominated by Inga spp. Despite the large differences in diversity of dominant plant species, both planted and rustic shade coffee plantations support a high overall diversity of bird species; we recorded approximately 105 species in each plantation type on fixed radius point counts. We accumulated a combined species list of 180 species on repeatedly surveyed transects through both coffee plantation types. These values are exceeded regionally only by moist tropical forest. Of the habitats surveyed, shade coffee was second only to acacia groves in the abundance and diversity of Nearctic migrants. The two plantation types have similar bird species lists and both are similar in composition to the dominant woodland-mixed pine-oak. Both types of shade coffee plantation habitats differ from other local habitats in supporting highly seasonal bird populations. Survey numbers almost double during the dry season-an increase that is found in omnivorous migrants and omnivorous, frugivorous, and nectarivorous resident species. Particularly large influxes were found for Tennessee warblers (Vermivora peregrina) and northern orioles (Icterus galbula) in Inga dominated plantations.\n      </p>", "The coffee agroforestry system provides an ideal platform for the study of spatial ecology. The uniform pattern of the coffee plants and shade trees allows for the study of pattern generation through intrinsic biological forces rather than extrinsic habitat patchiness. Detailed studies, focusing on a key mutualism between an ant (Azteca instabilis) and a scale insect (Coccus viridis), conducted in a 45-ha plot in a coffee agroforestry system have provided insights into (1) the quantitative evaluation of spatial pattern of the scale insect Coccus viridis on coffee bushes, (2) the mechanisms for the generation of patterns through the combination of local satellite ant nest formation and regional control from natural enemies, and (3) the consequences of the spatial pattern for the stability of predator\u2014prey (host\u2014parasitoid) systems, for a key coccinelid beetle preying on the scale insects and a phorid fly parasitoid parasitizing the ant.\n      </p>", "1. A series of experiments involving artificial infestation of coffee trees with coffee berry borer were carried out in Chiapas, Mexico. Attacked berries were marked to identify time of infestation. 2. Berry samples were taken every 3-4 days for periods of up to 91 days and number of developmental stages present recorded. Two peaks of egg production occurred at about 10 and 50 days post-infestation. The second peak is probably the work of one or more daughters of the founding female. 3. Berries removed and placed on the ground 4 days after infestation, developed significantly (P &lt; 0.0001) larger numbers of eggs than berries remaining on the tree. 4. Mortality of the founding female was low once established in the endosperm. Very few dead immature stages were found though calculations based on egg-laying schedules suggest that mortality may be 30% after 30 days of development. Apparent mortality of adult progeny rarely exceeded 10%. The main causes of mortality were pathogens that either attacked the endosperm causing the female to abandon the berry in many cases, or attacked the insect directly. 5. Innate capacity for increase (r) was estimated as 0.065 per day; cohort generation time was 45 days, doubling time, 11 days.\n      </p>", "A large German population sample of 6820 men and 7258 women was used to investigate the relationship between coffee consumption, total serum cholesterol and HDL cholesterol. Analyses were conducted on men and women separately. Differences in age, body mass index, diastolic blood pressure, smoking habits, alcohol, fish, milk and tea consumption, physical activity and medication use were controlled for in the analyses. Interactions between coffee consumption and smoking habits in their relationship with serum cholesterol were part of the analyses. For men, a positive relationship between coffee consumption and total serum cholesterol was found among smokers and life-long abstainers but not in the group of ex-smokers. In women a relationship between coffee consumption and total serum cholesterol was also present, but very weak (only statistical significant in covariance analyses). Levels of HDL cholesterol did not correlate with coffee consumption in either men and women. Hypotheses concerning the peculiarities of the group of ex-smokers are developed, and supporting empirical evidence is given. It is suggested that the group of ex-smokers should always be analysed separately.\n      </p>", "This paper presents a meta-analysis of 22 studies of coffee use and myocardial infarction or coronary death. In the eight case-control studies, a fairly homogeneous increased risk was found among coffee users (geometric mean rate ratio of 1.42 for 5 cups per day vs none, with 95% confidence limits of 1.30,1.55, homogeneity P-value of 0.89). The 14 cohort studies tended to exhibit lower but very heterogeneous rate ratios, with a trend toward larger rate ratios in studies with longer follow-up periods and later publication dates (geometric mean rate ratio of 0.92 for the five cohort studies published up to 1981, 1.27 for the nine cohort studies published in 1986 or later; overall homogeneity P-value of 0.0008). The evidence thus remains ambiguous regarding both the existence and size of a coffee effect, and although a rate ratio of over 1.5 for 5 cups per day appears unlikely, stronger effects for 10-cup-per-day drinkers cannot be ruled out.\n      </p>", "We sought to identify the illness risk factors associated with consumption of decaffeinated coffee in a sample of 2,677 adults. Women who drank decaffeinated coffee exclusively were more likely than other women to consume vitamin supplements and cruciferous vegetables, to use seat belts routinely, and to exercise regularly. Among men, those who drank decaffeinated coffee exclusively were more likely than others to have a low body mass index and to consume a low-fat diet and cruciferous vegetables. We conclude that people who drink decaffeinated coffee differ from others in ways that might provide information about the risk of illnesses.\n      </p>", "Apolipoprotein B levels were studied in relation to cigarette smoking, coffee and alcohol consumption, physical activity, age and body mass index in 253 men aged 21-61 years. The mean apolipoprotein B level was 7.3 \u00b1 3.2 mg/dl and was higher for smokers compared with non-smokers. Considering the smokers of over 20 cigarettes/day and the non-smokers, this difference reached 12.6 \u00b1 4.3 mg/dl. A significant increase of 7.2 \u00b1 3.5 mg/dl in apolipoprotein B levels was observed in the subjects who drank over 3 cups of coffee/day compared with the remaining subjects, but the increase was only 4.3 \u00b1 3.7 mg/dl when we made a correction for cigarette consumption. Furthermore, for cigarette smoking and coffee consumption, there is apparently an interactive effect with BMI and/or age (vs apolipoprotein B levels). However, with a stepwise selection among explicative variables [age, BMI, smoking (yes/no) and coffee consumption (\u2264 3, &gt; 3 cups/day)] and all their interactions of first order, only the interaction between BMI and smoking (BMI*smoking: b\u00b1 ES (b) = 0.3029\u00b10.0303), and age and BMI (age*BMI), are significantly and positively related to serum levels of apolipoprotein B. Thus cigarette smoking, interacting with high BMI, appear related to higher apolipoprotein B levels.\n      </p>", "Objective We evaluated the bladder cancer risk associated with coffee consumption in a case\u2013control study in Spain and examined the gene\u2013environment interactions for genetic variants of caffeine-metabolizing enzymes. Methods The analyses included 1,136 incident cases with urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder and 1,138 controls. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were adjusted for area, age, gender, amount of cigarette smoking, and years since quitting among former smokers. Results The OR (95% CI) for ever consumed coffee was 1.25 (0.95\u20131.64). For consumers of 1, 2, 3, and 4 or more cups/ day relative to never drinkers, OR were, respectively, 1.24 (0.92\u20131.66), 1.11 (95% CI 0.82\u20131.51), 1.57 (1.13\u20132.19), and 1.27 (0.88\u20131.81). Coffee consumption was higher in smokers compared to never smokers. The OR for drinking at least 4 cups/day was 1.13 (0.61\u20132.09) in current smokers, 1.57 (0.86\u20132.90) in former smokers, and 1.23 (0.55\u20132.76) in never smokers. Gene-coffee interactions evaluated in NAT2, CYP1A2, and CYP2E1\u201302 and CYP1A1 were not identified after adjusting for multiple testing. Conclusion We observed a modest increased bladder cancer risk among coffee drinkers that may, in part, be explained by residual confounding by smoking. The findings from the gene\u2013coffee interactions need replication in further studies.\n      </p>", "Background: Coffee consumption has been associated with an excess bladder cancer risk, but results from epidemiological studies are inconsistent. This association has been long debated, in part due to the potential confounding by smoking. We examined the risk associated with coffee consumption in nonsmokers in a pooled analysis of ten European bladder cancer case-control studies. Methods: The pooled data set comprises 564 cases and 2929 hospital or population controls who had never smoked. They were enrolled in ten studies conducted in Denmark, Germany, Greece, France, Italy and Spain. Information on coffee consumption and occupation was re-coded following standard criteria. Unconditional logistic regression was applied adjusting for age, study center, occupation and gender. Results: Seventy-nine percent of the study population reported having drunk coffee, and 2.4% were heavy drinkers, reporting having drunk on average ten or more cups per day. There was no excess risk in ever coffee drinkers (OR = 1.0, 95% CI 0.8-1.3) compared to never drinkers. The risk did not increase monotonically with dose but a statistically significant excess risk was seen for subjects having drunk ten or more cups per day (OR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.0-3.3). This excess was seen in both men and women. There was no evidence of an association of the risk with duration or type of coffee consumption. The pooled results were not dependent on the findings of any specific study, but they depended on the type of controls with an overall excess risk observed only for studies using hospital controls. Conclusion: Nonsmokers who are heavy coffee drinkers may have a small excess risk of bladder cancer. Although these results cannot be attributed to confounding by smoking, the possibility of bias in control selection cannot be discarded. On the basis of these results, only a very small proportion of cancers of the bladder among nonsmokers could be attributed to coffee drinking.\n      </p>", "Laboratory data suggest that caffeine or some components of coffee may cause DNA mutations and inhibit tumor suppressor mechanisms, leading to neoplastic growth. However, coffee consumption has not been clearly implicated in the etiology of human postmenopausal ovarian cancer. This study evaluated the relationship of coffee and caffeine intake with risk of epithelial ovarian cancer in a prospective cohort study of 29,060 postmenopausal women. The participants completed a mailed questionnaire that assessed diet and health history and were followed for ovarian cancer incidence from 1986 to 2004. Age-adjusted and multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios were calculated for four exposure variables: caffeinated coffee, decaffeinated coffee, total coffee, and total caffeine to assess whether or not coffee or caffeine influences the risk of ovarian cancer. An increased risk was observed in the multivariate model for women who reported drinking five or more cups/day of caffeinated coffee compared to women who reported drinking none (HR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.10-2.95). Decaffeinated coffee, total coffee, and caffeine were not statistically significantly associated with ovarian cancer incidence. Our results suggest that a component of coffee other than caffeine, or in combination with caffeine, may be associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer in postmenopausal women who drink five or more cups of coffee a day.\n      </p>", "To support themselves through coffee production, family farmers must make intricate and informed decisions often based on factors beyond their control. The booms and busts of the world coffee market are not new to Costa Rican coffee farmers, but with the failure in 1989 of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) to reach a new agreement, coffee-producing households must again cope with low coffee prices. In P\u00e9rez Zeled\u00f3n farming families must also contend with an expanding population, scarcity of land, and difficulties in marketing alternative crops. To survive, they have combined coffee production with wage labor, household microenterprises, temporary migration, and higher education. Rather than foreshadowing the demise of the family farm, such flexibility can allow small farmers to persist. But to do so they require the continued support of the state.\n      </p>", "Slaveholders manipulated the spatial organization of plantations to their advantage in an effort to control the actions of enslaved workers. Slave workers, on the hand, always found ways to resist planter hegemony. Cuban slaveholders, not only employed surveillance measures comparable to those found elsewhere in the Americas, but they also housed enslaved people in prison-like quarters. Using both archaeological data and written sources, this essay examines plantation slavery in Cuba by analyzing the dialectal relationship between slaveowners' control of plantation space and enslaved laborers' resistance of that control.\n      </p>", "Coffee agroecosystems have recently undergone a dramatic intensification in Colombia, a megadiverse country, especially in terms of the nature of shade cover. We tested for changes in the composition, ecological associations, and diversity of ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) along a gradient of intensification of coffee production in the Colombian Andes. We surveyed 16 farms in two regions, classified into four management types: (1) forest (no agriculture), (2) organic polygeneric shaded coffee, (3) monogeneric shaded coffee, and (4) sun coffee (unshaded). Forty sampling units (20 1 m2 plots on the ground and 20 coffee bushes) were established at each farm between 2001 and 2002. We sampled with a mini-winkler litter extraction technique and through visual searching. Organic polygeneric shaded-coffee plantations contained significantly higher ant species richness, and their ant assemblages resembled the forest patches more than any other management type. The number of statistically significant associations among ant species dropped with production intensification, as did the number of ant species involved in such associations. The network of ant associations in shaded systems transformed into an extremely simplified network in sun coffee, with a few dominant ants extending almost entirely throughout the crop. Intensification of coffee agriculture not only caused loss of litter ant species (especially forest species) but also a reduction in the complexity of the ant assemblage in the leaf litter of this agroecosystem.\n      </p>", "Managed forest ecosystems like shade coffee supply valuable ecological services. Yet little is known about the drivers and characteristics of clearing in such systems. We present a spatial econometric analysis of land cover in a shade coffee region in southern Mexico. We find that plots close to large cities are less likely to be cleared all other things being equal-the opposite of the pattern usually observed in natural forests. In addition, we find that membership in coffee-marketing cooperatives, farm size, and certain soil types are associated with tree cover, while proximity to small town centers is associated with clearing.\n      </p>", "Widespread loss of primary habitat in the tropics has led to increased interest in production landscapes for biodiversity conservation. In the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot in India, shade coffee plantations are located in close proximity to sites of high conservation value: protected and unprotected forests. Coffee is grown here under a tree canopy that may be dominated by native tree species or by nonnative species, particularly silver oak (Grevillea robusta). We investigated the influence of properties at the local scale and the landscape scale in determining bird communities in coffee plantations, with particular emphasis on species of conservation priority. We used systematic point counts in 11 coffee plantation sites and analyzed data in a randomized linear modeling framework that addressed spatial autocorrelation. Greater proportion of silver oak at the local scale and distance to contiguous forests at the landscape scale were implicated as factors most strongly driving declines in bird species richness and abundance, while increased basal area of native tree species, a local-scale variable, was frequently related to increased bird species richness and abundance. The influence of local-scale variables increased at greater distances from the forest. Distance to forests emerged as the strongest predictor of declines in restricted-range species, with 92% reduction in the abundance of two commonly encountered restricted-range species (Pompadour Green Pigeon and Yellow-browed Bulbul) and a 43% reduction in richness of bird species restricted to Indian hill forests within 8 km of forests. Increase in proportion of silver oak from 33% to 55% was associated with 91% reduction in the abundance of one commonly encountered restricted-range species (Crimson-fronted Barbet). One conservation strategy is providing incentives to grow coffee in a biodiversity-friendly manner. One implication of our study is that plantations located at varying distances to the forest cannot be compared fairly for biodiversity friendliness by existing certification methodology. Another is that conservation of existing forests at the landscape scale is essential for maintaining higher biodiversity in coffee plantations. Incentive schemes that promote conservation of remnant forests at the landscape scale and biodiversity-friendly practices locally and that relate to coffee communities as a whole rather than individual planters are likely to be more effective.\n      </p>", "Relationships between coffee drinking and cancer incidence were examined in a 10-year complete follow-up of 21,735 men and 21,238 women aged 35-54 years. The study population participated in a cardiovascular screening in three counties in Norway during 1977-82. Data on coffee and smoking habits were based on information from a self-administered questionnaire. There was no association between coffee consumption and overall risk of cancer. A positive association was found between coffee drinking and risk of lung cancer, also after adjustment for age, cigarette smoking, and county of residence. Residual confounding by cigarette smoking and other lifestyle factors cannot be ruled out. A negative association was found with cancer of buccal cavity and pharynx and with malignant melanoma in women. No significant associations were found between coffee drinking and incidence of cancer of the pancreas or the bladder.\n      </p>", "Many traditional farmers and environmentalists subscribe to the popular idea that the natural world offers ecosystem services that contribute to the stability, productivity, and sustainability of agriculture. Opponents of this view argue that the farm is not an environment to be stewarded by romantic environmentalists, but rather is a battlefield on which the enemies of production must be vanquished. Contemporary research in ecosystem complexity offers a new platform on which to adjudicate between these two points of view. Through particular network structuring, nonlinearity, and stochasticity, and especially with the added dimension of space, recent theoretical and empirical research reveals that ecological systems persist and generate ecosystem services as a result of complex interacting components. Here we report on our research into the ecological dynamics of a collection of species related to key problems in pest control, a critical ecosystem service in coffee production.\n      </p>", "A linear-quadratic, dynamic feedback oligopoly model that nests various market structures is used to estimate the degree of competitiveness and the adjustment paths of the two largest coffee exporters, Brazil and Colombia. Their estimated behavior is relatively competitive. This subgame perfect dynamic model is compared to a standard static oligopoly model and the open-loop model (the dynamic generalization of the standard static model). Both classical and Bayesian tests of open-loop and feedback dynamic models are reported.\n      </p>", "Relative comparative advantage is measured by contrasting country ratios of the domestic resource costs per unit of foreign exchange earned by exporting coffee to the exchange rate. Uganda, Ethiopia, and Tanzania have strong relative comparative advantages in coffee vis-\u00e0-vis the Ivory Coast, largely because of higher opportunity costs of Ivoirian factors.\n      </p>", "Crop pollination by wild bees is an ecosystem service of enormous value, but it is under increasing threat from agricultural intensification. As with many ecosystem services, the mechanisms, scales, and species through which crop pollination is provided are too poorly understood to inform land-use decisions. I investigated the role of tropical forest remnants as sources of pollinators to surrounding coffee crops in Costa Rica. In 2001 and 2002 I observed bee activity and pollen deposition rates at coffee flowers along distance gradients from two fragments and one narrow riparian strip of forest. Eleven eusocial species were the most common visitors: 10 species of native meliponines and the introduced honeybee, Apis mellifera (hereafter Apis,). Bee richness, overall visitation rate, and pollen deposition rate were all significantly higher in sites within approximately 100 m of forest fragments than in sites farther away (maximum distance of 1.6 km). Apis visitation rates were constant across the distance gradient, however, and Apis accounted for &gt;90% of all floral visits in distant sites. The gradient from the riparian strip showed a similar drop in bee species richness with distance, but visitation rates were uniformly low along the gradient. Throughout the study area, Apis abundances declined sharply from 2001 to 2002, reducing visitation rates by over 50% in distant sites (where Apis was almost the only pollinator). In near sites, however, overall visitation rates dropped only 9% because native species almost entirely compensated for the Apis decline. Forest fragments (more so than the riparian strip) thus provided nearby coffee with a diversity of bees that increased both the amount and stability of pollination services by reducing dependence on a single introduced pollinator. Exploring the economic links between forest preservation and coffee cultivation may help align the goals of conservation and agriculture within many regions of global conservation priority.\n      </p>", "The aim of the study was to investigate NAT1, NAT2, GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1, SULT1A1, XRCC1, XRCC3 and XPD genetic polymorphisms, coffee consumption and risk of bladder cancer (BC) through a hospital-based case-control study. The study population included 197 incident BC cases and 211 controls. The association between genetic polymorphisms, coffee drinking and BC risk was assessed by logistic regression taking into account age, education, tobacco smoking and occupational exposures to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and aromatic amines. No association was found between the genetic polymorphisms investigated and BC risk according to coffee consumption apart of a significant increased BC risk among GSTP1 105-114 Val carriers heavy coffee drinkers (&gt; 3 cups/day) (OR 3.18, 95% CI 1.06-9.55). In conclusion our findings suggest a very limited role, if any, of genetic polymorphisms investigated in modulating the BC risk in coffee drinkers.\n      </p>", "Background To provide information about the association of coffee, black tea with gastric cancer risk. Methods Between 1985 and 2007, we conducted two case-control studies in northern Italy. Overall, cases were 999 subjects with incident, histologically confirmed gastric cancer and controls were 2,628 patients admitted to the same network of hospitals for acute non-neoplastic diseases. Odds ratios (OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for coffee (mostly espresso and mocha) and black tea consumption were estimated after allowance for socio-demographic data, smoking, and other major covariates of interest. Results When compared with non-coffee drinkers, the OR was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.73-1.22) for drinkers of one cup of coffee per day, 1.03 (95% CI: 0.80-1.32) for two, 1.07 (95% CI: 0.82-1.40) for three, and 1.24 (95% CI: 0.94-1.65) for four or more cups per day. No association was found with reference to duration of coffee consumption, or consumption of decaffeinated coffee. When compared with non-black-tea drinkers, the OR was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.56-1.42) for drinkers of two or more cups of black tea per day. Conclusions Our investigation, based on a uniquely large dataset, provides convincing evidence that coffee and black tea consumption is unlikely to be strongly associated with gastric cancer risk.\n      </p>", "Nerlovian supply functions are fitted to post-World War II coffee data for S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Supply shifts are permitted through the use of dummy variables, and recent specifications of irreversible functions are tested.

Risk factor information and biologic specimens from three large epidemiological studies, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHSII, and the New England based Case\u2013Control Study of ovarian cancer (NECC) were pooled resulting in 1,354 ovarian cancer cases and 1,851 controls for analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using conditional (NHS/NHS ) and unconditional (NECC) logistic regression. Coffee consumption was not associated with overall risk (OR = 0.99; 95% CI 0.77\u20131.28); however, there was a suggested increased risk of ovarian cancer among premenopausal women in the NECC only and an inverse association among postmenopausal women. Carrying one or both of the variant CYP19013 A or CYP19027 G alleles was associated with an 18% increased (P for trend = 0.02) and 15% decreased (P for trend = 0.05) risk of ovarian cancer, respectively. Variation in CYP1A1, CYP1A2, or CYP2A6 did not explain the inconsistent reports of coffee intake and risk. Furthermore, we did not observe any clear gene-environment interactions between caffeine metabolizing genes and ovarian cancer. Future studies evaluating mechanisms by which coffee mediates this relationship are warranted.\n      </p>", "Objectives: To assess the relation between cigarette smoking, alcohol, coffee, decaffeinated coffee and tea consumption, and the risk of non-fatal acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Design and setting: Hospital-based case-control study conducted in 1995-1999 in Milan, Italy. Patients: 507 cases with a first episode of non-fatal AMI, and 478 controls admitted to hospital for acute diseases. Methods: Information was collected by interviewer-administered questionnaires. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by multiple logistic regression. Results: Compared to alcohol non-drinkers the OR was 0.6 (95% CI: 0.4-0.9) in drinkers, and 0.5 in drinkers of &gt;3 drinks/day. The OR for &gt;1 drink/day of wine was 0.5, and those for beer, amari, grappa and spirits ranged between 0.4 and 0.6. Compared to never smokers, the OR was 2.2 (95% CI: 1.5-3.1) among current smokers, and 4.6 among current smokers of \u226525 cigarettes/day. The risk was similar to that of never smokers \u22655 years after cessation (OR: 1.1 after 5-9 years, 0.7 after \u226510 years). The OR was 2.3 for low tar cigarettes and 2.0 for high tar ones. The OR for coffee intake (expresso and mocha) was around unity up to 3 cups/day, but rose to 1.9 (95% CI: 1.1-3.3) for \u22656 cups/day. Moderate decaffeinated coffee and tea intake was not associated with AMI risk. Compared to non-smokers drinking \u22643 cups of coffee/day, the OR was 1.6 among non-smokers drinking &gt;3 cups of coffee/day and 3.3 (95% CI: 2.1-5.0) among current smokers drinking &gt;3 cups of coffee/day. Compared to alcohol drinkers with a coffee intake of \u22643 cups/day, alcohol non-drinkers with higher coffee intake had an OR of 2.2, and compared to non-smokers alcohol drinkers, the OR was 3.3 in current smokers alcohol non-drinkers. Conclusions: In this Italian population alcohol intake was inversely associated to AMI risk, while smoking and heavy (but not moderate) coffee drinking increased the risk.\n      </p>", "Foraging efficiency was studied by measuring the rate of tuna fish bait discovery by ants in unshaded and two types of shaded coffee systems. We also investigated the effect of weed biomass upon ant foraging efficiency. We found that the rate of discovery was faster in the coffee system with no shade than in systems with shade trees. The rate of discovery in the two types of shade systems (monospecific and polyspecific shade) was similar. Differences in the foraging rate between systems seem to be related to the composition of the ground ant community in each of the systems, and to cumulative factors such as plant diversity, microclimate and interspecific competition. No correlation was found between weed biomass and ant foraging efficiency. The results of this study support the idea of manipulating agroecosystem plant and structural diversity in order to enhance pest regulation by ants.\n      </p>", "We used data from a population-based case-control study to examine how use of tobacco products and consumption of alcohol, coffee, and caffeine relate to colon cancer in Utah. We hypothesized that low use of these substances is one factor contributing to the low colon cancer incidence in Utah and could help explain the low risk associated for colon cancer with being a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In females, we observed little or no increase in risk of colon cancer from smoking cigarettes or from consumption of alcohol, caffeine, or coffee. Males who used pipes, however, experienced an increased risk for colon cancer (OR = 4.1, 95% CI = 1.3-12.3). Risk for colon cancer associated with alcohol use was greatly attenuated after adjusting for caffeine and pipe use in males; males who consumed higher levels of caffeine during the two to three years prior to the interview were at higher risk than males who consumed low levels of caffeine (OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.0-4.2); similar associations were observed for coffee consumption. Nonuse of these substances could explain the low colon cancer incidence rates observed in members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Utah males.\n      </p>", "In order to assess the interaction between alcohol intake, tobacco smoking and coffee consumption in determining the risk of liver cirrhosis we carried out a hospital-based case-control study involving 115 patients at their first diagnosis of cirrhosis and 167 control patients consecutively enrolled in the General Hospitals of the Province of L'Aquila (Central Italy). The mean life-time daily alcohol intake (as g ethanol consumed daily) was measured by direct patient interviews, whose reproducibility was &gt; 0.80 and similar for cases and controls, as checked by interviewing the relatives of a sample of 50 cases and 73 controls. During the same patient's interview we also measured the mean consumption of coffee (daily number of cups of filtered coffee) and tobacco (life-time daily number of cigarettes smoked). A dose-effect relationship on the risk of cirrhosis was present both for alcohol intake - for which the risk was significantly increased above 100 g of daily intake - and for cigarette consumption. The latter did not however improve the goodness-of-fit of a logistic regression model including alcohol intake as covariate. By contrast, coffee consumption had a protective effect on the risk of cirrhosis and significantly improved the goodness-of-fit of such a model. Abstaining from coffee consumption determined both a significantly increased risk of cirrhosis, even for daily alcohol intake below 100 g, and a multiplicative effect with alcohol intake on this risk. In patients drinking \u2265 101 g ethanol daily the relative risk increased from 5.5 (95% confidence interval: 1.4-22.0) for coffee consumers to 10.8 (95% confidence interval: 1.3-58.1) for coffee abstainers. We conclude that: (1) tobacco smoking is likely to be a faint risk factor for cirrhosis, and studies on wider patients series should be performed for confirmation; (2) coffee drinking is associated with a reduced risk of cirrhosis. Whether coffee contains some hitherto unknown protective substances, or is just a marker of other life-style or dietary protective factors, deserves further clarification.\n      </p>", "We compared the species diversity of copronecrophagous beetles (Scarabaeinae), bats, and frogs in tropical montane cloud forest (original vegetation) and shaded coffee plantations (an agroecosystem common to the region) for a landscape in central Veracruz, Mexico. We sampled in three tropical montane cloud forest fragments and in three coffee plantations with traditional polyculture shade between 1998 and 2001. The three indicator groups responded differently to the transformation of tropical montane cloud forest into shaded coffee plantations. The species richness of frogs was one-fifth less in coffee plantations than in forest fragments, and only one-third of the frog species occurred in both forest fragments and coffee plantations. The number of beetle species and their abundance was significantly greater in coffee plantations than in the forest fragments, whereas species richness and species composition of bats were virtually the same in both habitats. The majority of the abundant species remained as such in both communities, but species that were less abundant were not scarce in both habitats. We attributed differences in the species assemblages to the differing degrees of penetrability of the borders of the two habitat types (especially for the coffee plantations) and to the differences in life-history traits among species. Shaded coffee plantations form a matrix that envelops the remaining fragments of cloud forest. Together they connect the forest fragments with the other habitats of the landscape and represent a highly functional resource for the preservation of biodiversity that serves as a complement to but not a substitute for cloud forest in this notably modified landscape.\n      </p>", "Consistent with field observations, sicklepod exhibited considerable tolerance to sulfentrazone, and coffee senna showed relatively high sensitivity to this herbicide in greenhouse tests. Germination was not inhibited in either species at up to 12.9 \u03bcM of the herbicide. However, the chlorophyll content of herbicide-treated coffee senna cotyledonary leaves was greatly reduced, and seedlings died within 10 d after treatment, while sicklepod seedlings were not visibly affected. Shoot height of coffee senna was inhibited 90% by sulfentrazone at 0.5 kg ai ha\u207b\u00b9, while the growth of sicklepod was not affected up to 2.0 kg ai ha\u207b\u00b9. Root uptake of radiolabeled sulfentrazone was 74% greater in coffee senna than sicklepod, but the amount of radioactivity recovered from the shoots of both species after 12 h was not different. Eightythree percent of the parent compound remained in coffee senna leaf tissue after 9 h root exposure to the herbicide. In contrast, sicklepod took up relatively less sulfentrazone through the root and metabolized sulfentrazone in the foliage more rapidly than coffee senna, with 91.6% of the herbicide being metabolized during the first 9 h of exposure. These results suggest that the tolerance of sicklepod to sulfentrazone is primarily due to a relatively high rate of metabolism of the herbicide compared to coffee senna.\n      </p>", "Clinical and epidemiological studies on cancer etiology seldom treat coffee drinking as a potential effect modifier. Yet caffeine exerts significant effects upon a large variety of physiologic, cellular and molecular systems. Caffeine, 'the world's most popular drug', is also a fundamental research tool, widely used in clinical studies on drug metabolism, and in experimental studies on cell cycle checkpoints, DNA repair, and apoptosis, among many other. Caffeine can profoundly alter cell cycle checkpoint function and several mechanisms of DNA repair, as well as carcinogen metabolism. The impact of caffeine on cell cycle checkpoint function occurs in spite of it being nonmutagenic in traditional mutagenesis assays. A complex body of biologic evidence suggests that caffeine-containing beverages can both enhance and antagonise potentially carcinogenic exposures. However, most pathways leading to the ultimate effects in human beings remain unknown. It is unclear whether any of the hundreds of compounds contained in coffee and tea exert a direct and significant carcinogenic effect per se in any human tissue at usual conditions of use. Reasons exist to consider that coffee may sometimes be an indirect, positive confounder. The study of interactions between caffeine-containing beverages and environmental agents in well defined groups of healthy and diseased people could yield new insights into checkpoint signal transduction and other mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Information on the use of caffeine-containing beverages should more often be integrated in studies on the role of gene-environment interactions in the pathogenesis of cancer.\n      </p>", "1. Coffee is produced in tropical regions of the world, largely in Latin America. Coffee cultivation techniques range from traditional systems, where coffee grows under a diverse canopy of shade trees (shade-coffee plantations), to modern systems, where coffee grows without any type of shade (sun-coffee plantations). Shade-coffee plantations provide refuge for forest fauna in otherwise deforested landscapes. The conservation value of these agro-ecosystems depends upon their structural and floristic diversity. 2. The way coffee producers manage the vegetation, including the epiphytic component, may profoundly affect the value of plantations for conserving biological diversity. Shade-coffee certification programmes have emerged to verify that coffee advertised as 'shade grown' is actually grown on highly biodiverse plantations. Although these programmes universally encourage epiphyte protection from pruning (a common practice), there has been no experimental evaluation of the importance of epiphytes in supporting faunal diversity. We report the effect of experimentally removing epiphytes on the bird assemblage in a shade-coffee farm near Coatepec, Veracruz, Mexico. 3. We established two matching pairs of epiphyte removal and control plots. We compared bird diversity and abundance, based on daily censuses during the breeding and non-breeding season. We used existing information on the way in which birds use epiphytes as foraging and nesting substrates to explain the presence of different species in plots with epiphytes. 4. Plots without epiphytes tended to be less diverse than plots with epiphytes, but rarefaction analysis and ANOVA showed no significant differences in species richness between treatments in any of the seasons. Mean bird abundance was significantly higher in plots with epiphytes during both seasons, and a multidimensional scaling analysis showed that bird community structure differed between the two treatments. 5. Eighteen forest bird species were significantly more abundant in plots with epiphytes. Three non-forest species were more common in plots without epiphytes. Resident bird species that used epiphytes as a nesting substrate were significantly more abundant in plots with epiphytes. 6. When epiphytes are removed, canopy cover, foraging substrates, nest sites and nest materials are eliminated and microclimatic conditions change. This could increase predation on adult birds and nests, increase intra- and interspecific competition, and decrease individual survivorship. 7. Synthesis and applications. This is the first experimental assessment of the importance of epiphytes for birds. Shade-coffee plantations with epiphytes maintain higher abundance and diversity of the inhabitant bird fauna than plantations without epiphytes. This study reinforces the value of positive epiphyte management as an important factor in shade-grown coffee certification, where the goal is to promote biodiversity conservation.\n      </p>", "The potential inverse association between coffee intake and serum \u03b3-glutamyltransferase (GGT) was examined in a cross-sectional study involving 1353 Japanese male office workers aged 35-59 years in Osaka, Japan. Those who had serum aminotransferases exceeding the normal range and/or who had been administered medical care for, or had a past history of, liver disease were excluded. Multiple linear regression analysis and analysis of covariance were used to control for confounding variables (age, body mass index, alcohol use, and cigarette smoking) and to examine possible interactions. From the linear regression analysis, coffee intake was inversely related to serum GGT levels independently of age, body mass index, alcohol intake, and cigarette smoking. All of the latter variables were also independently and positively associated with serum GGT levels. When the interactions between coffee and each of four covariates on serum GGT were evaluated by adding each interaction term to the above regression model, significant negative interactions were observed for age and cigarette smoking. From the analysis of covariance, lower levels of serum GGT associated with coffee consumption were more evident in the older age group and at the higher levels of cigarette smoking. These findings suggest that coffee consumption is inversely related to serum GGT and that coffee may inhibit the inducing effects of aging and possibly of smoking on serum GGT in the liver.\n      </p>", "The study aims to examine the relationship between habitual coffee consumption and blood pressure. The subjects were 3336 male self-defense officials aged 48-56 years, who received a preretirement health examination at the Self-Defense Forces Fukuoka Hospital between October 1986 and December 1992. Average coffee intake in the past year was ascertained by a self-administered questionnaire. A significant inverse relation between habitual coffee consumption and blood pressure was found with and without adjustment for alcohol use, cigarette smoking, body mass index, glucose tolerance, and green tea intake. Green tea, another major source of caffeine intake in Japanese, was unrelated to blood pressure. The adjusted mean differences per cup of coffee consumed per day were -0.6 mmHg (95% confident interval [CI]: -0.9 to -0.3, p = 0.0001) in systolic blood pressure and -0.4 mmHg (95% CI: -0.5 to -0.2, p = 0.0002) in diastolic blood pressure. Habitual coffee drinkers had lower blood pressure than non-drinkers at any levels of alcohol use, cigarette smoking, obesity, and glucose intolerance. Our findings consolidate the previous observation that habitual coffee consumption was associated with lower blood pressure.\n      </p>", "A study on the reliability of information on smoking habits and coffee drinking collected via interview was conducted among 500 subjects enrolled in a case-control study on bladder cancer in Brescia, North Italy. A total of 215 cases (incident and prevalent) and 285 controls were interviewed personally in the hospital setting by a first interviewer, and then re-interviewed by telephone by either the same interviewer or another one. Agreement between the first and second interview was evaluated using the kappa statistic and the intra-class correlation coefficient and via multiple logistic regression modelling. No important differences in reliability were found according to sex, education or case/control status, while agreement was better among subjects below 65 than among older ones, and among incident than prevalent cases. A slightly better agreement was found among subjects interviewed twice by the same interviewer than those interviewed by two different individuals, which may reflect the presence of inter-observer reliability for the latter. Overall, these results show a very high reliability of data on smoking and a fairly high reliability regarding coffee drinking as collected through face-to-face interviews.\n      </p>", "To test the hypothesis that coffee consumption and cigarette smoking are associated with time to conception, we analyzed data collected from 1,341 primigravidas participating in the Child Health and Development Studies in the San Francisco Bay Area between 1959 and 1966. Women were interviewed in person about their reproductive and medical history, habits (smoking, coffee and alcohol consumption), and sociodemographic characteristics. Logistic regression models showed that after adjusting for covariates, women who smoked cigarettes had about one-half the fertility [odds ratio (OR) = 0.5-0.6] of nonsmoker-noncoffee drinkers for times to conception of 6 and 12 months, regardless of whether they drank coffee. On the other hand, coffee consumers who did not smoke did not have decreased fertility compared with nondrinkers who did not smoke (adjusted OR = 1.0-1.2). Coffee drinking did not increase the risk of delayed conception among smokers over the risk posed by the smoking exposure by itself (adjusted OR = 0.6-0.8). We observed an effect of smoking even at low doses (1-9 cigarettes per day). The present study adds to the evidence of an association between cigarette smoking and reduced fertility.\n      </p>", "Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine the hypothesis that tea and coffee consumption have a protective effect against development of digestive tract cancers. Methods: A comparative case-referent study was conducted using Hospital-based Epidemiologic Research Program at Aichi Cancer Center (HERPACC) data from 1990 to 1995 in Nagoya, Japan. This study comprised 1,706 histologically diagnosed cases of digestive tract cancers (185 esophagus, 893 stomach, 362 colon, 266 rectum) and a total of 21,128 non-cancer outpatients aged 40 years and over. Logistic regression was used to analyze the data, adjusting for gender; age; year and season at hospital-visit; habitual smoking and alcohol drinking; regular physical exercise; fruit, rice, and beef intake; and beverage intake. Results: The odds ratio (OR) of stomach cancer decreased to 0.69 (95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 0.48-1.00) with high intake of green tea (seven cups or more per day). A decreased risk was also observed for rectal cancer with three cups or more daily intake of coffee (OR = 0.46, CI = 0.26-0.81). Conclusions: The results suggest the potential for protective effect against site-specific digestive tract cancer by consumption of green tea and coffee, although most associations are limited only to the upper category of intake and have no clear explanation for site-specificity.\n      </p>", "A Sunbury, Ohio, coffee processing plant uses spray irrigation for the treatment and disposal of about 151 500 ${\\rm m}^{3}$ (40 mil. gal) of wastewater each year. About 40.5 ha (100 ac) of a field that primarily consists of clover and reed canary grass are used for the application. Data from a 4-year evaluation of the site are presented. The limiting factor for application capacity was the hydraulic capacity of the site, not the nitrogen or organic loading rates. High organic loadings and the applied wastewater were assimilated on the site and very little runoff occurred. The hydrogeologic conditions at the site limited vertical percolation of water contaminants. The operational cost of the system was about $\\$0.528/{\\rm m}^{3}$ ($0.002/gal) of wastewater treated.\n      </p>", "Interest in shade-grown coffee is now increasing because of declining coffee prices in the world market and an increasing trend toward \"green consumerism.\" It is therefore important to understand farmers' perception of the role of shade trees in coffee fields, an area that has not received deserving attention in research agendas. On the basis of detailed interviews involving both \"open-ended\" and \"closed\" questions with 83 small-scale coffee farmers in the Peninsula of Nicoya, Costa Rica, we found that characteristics that farmers considered important were mostly comparable to those stated in the literature. But some differences were also noted; examples included tree height (considered important by farmers, but not in literature) and leaf size (mentioned in literature, but not by farmers). Some tree species that were not considered beneficial as coffee shade trees were still retained in the fields because of the additional benefits they provided. Eighty-eight percent of farmers were interested in incorporating more trees, especially fruit trees, into their coffee plantations. The results of the study underscore the need for research on the little-studied area of interaction between coffee plants and fruit trees.\n      </p>", "I examined the effects of two farm management variables, shade-tree species and crop structure, on the winter (dry season) arthropod and bird communities in a Jamaican shade coffee plantation. Birds and canopy arthropods were more abundant in areas of the plantation shaded by the tree Inga vera than by Pseudalbizia berteroana. The abundance of arthropods (potential pests) on the coffee crop, however, was unaffected by shade-tree species. Canopy arthropods, particularly psyllids (Homoptera), were especially abundant on Inga in late winter, when it was producing new leaves and nectar-rich flowers. Insectivorous and nectarivorous birds showed the strongest response to Inga; thus the concentration of birds in Inga may be a response to abundant food. Coffee-tree arthropod abundance was much lower than in the shade trees and was affected little by farm management variables, although arthropods tended to be more abundant in dense (unpruned) than open (recently pruned) areas of the plantation. Perhaps in response, leaf-gleaning insectivorous birds were more abundant in dense areas. These results underscore that although some shade coffee plantations may provide habitat for arthropod and bird communities, differences in farm management practices can significantly affect their abundances. Furthermore, this study provides evidence suggesting that bird communities in coffee respond to spatial variation in arthropod availability. I conclude that I. vera is a better shade tree than P. berteroana, but a choice in crop structures is less clear due to changing effects of prune management over time.\n      </p>", "This paper analyses the complex web of factors that are behind the current crisis in the global coffee market. Although there has been wide coverage in the press of tumbling prices for 'green' coffee and their repercussions on rural livelihoods in producing countries, not much has been said on the long-term changes that have taken place in the global coffee marketing chain. This has resulted in the widespread belief that the coffee crisis is simply about oversupply. This paper shows that changes in the international coffee trade regime, in regulation at the domestic level in producing countries, and in corporate strategies have also been at the root of the crisis. Finally, it gives specific policy directions to constructively address the emerging imbalances.\n      </p>", "The association between tobacco smoking, the consumption of coffee and alcohol and bladder cancer was investigated in a hospital-based case-control study in Brescia, northern Italy. A total of 172 incident cases (135 men and 37 women) and 578 controls (398 men and 180 women) were enrolled. As expected, cigarette smoking was strongly associated with bladder cancer. The odds ratios (OR) for coffee drinking adjusted for age, education, residence and cigarette smoking in current drinkers were 2.6 (95% confidence interval, CI: 1.1-6.1) in men and 5.2 (95% CI: 1.0-30.4) in women. A dose-response relationship was found in men, with the highest risk in the highest category of exposure: drinkers of more than 5 cups per day had an OR of 4.5 (95% CI: 1.2-16.8). The ORs for current alcohol drinkers were 2.1 (95% CI: 1.0-4.8) in men and 3.4 (95% CI: 1.2-9.7) in women; according to grams of ethanol drunk per day (grams/day, g/d) the ORs were: 1.7 (1-20 g/d), 1.6 (21-40 g/d), 4.3 (41-60 g/d) and 4.6 (61+ g/d) in men and 3.1 (1-20 g/d) and 3.9 (21+ g/d) in women. These results suggest that regular consumption of both coffee and alcohol can be independently associated with an increased bladder cancer risk.\n      </p>", "After oil, coffee is the most traded commodity and the largest source of export earnings in the developing world. Yet coffee farmers are hurting. They are paid record-low prices, due both to a global market glut and to modest consumption growth. Some analysts say coffee, like any other commodity, is simply subject to the swings of a competitive market. This notion is cold comfort to countries such as Nicaragua and Burundi, which rely heavily on coffee exports. The coffee cartel of the 1980s failed. What now? Producing countries are urging coffee companies to help find ways to stabilize the market, including a fund to help small farmers.\n      </p>", "A possible protective effect of coffee or caffeine intake in the formation of gallstones has been suggested in some epidemiological studies. We examined the relation of coffee, green tea, and caffeine intake to gallstone disease in middle-aged Japanese men, distinguishing known gallstones from unknown diagnosed gallstones. Study subjects were 174 cases of gallstones as determined by ultrasonography, 104 cases of postcholecystectomy, and 6889 controls of normal gallbladder in the total of 7637 men who received a health examination at four hospitals of the Self-Defense Forces (SDF). Of the 174 cases of prevalent gallstones, 50 had been aware of having gallstones. Previously diagnosed gallstones and postcholecystectomy were combined as known gallstone disease. The consumption of coffee and green tea was ascertained by a self-administered questionnaire, and caffeine intake was estimated. Statistical adjustment was done for body mass index, smoking, alcohol use, rank in the SDF, and hospital. Coffee and caffeine intake were associated each with a statistically significant increase in the prevalence odds of known gallstone disease, but unrelated to newly diagnosed gallstones. Adjusted odds ratios of known gallstone disease were 1.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-2.8) for coffee consumption of five cups or more per day vs. no consumption and 2.2 (95% CI: 1.3-3.7) for caffeine intake of 300 mg/day or more vs. less than 100 mg/day. The consumption of green-tea showed no material association with either unknown gallstones or known gallstone disease. The findings do not support a hypothesis that coffee drinking may be protective against gallstone formation.\n      </p>", "Studies have documented biodiversity losses due to intensification of coffee management (reduction in canopy richness and complexity). Nevertheless, questions remain regarding relative sensitivity of different taxa, habitat specialists, and functional groups, and whether implications for biodiversity conservation vary across regions. We quantitatively reviewed data from ant, bird, and tree biodiversity studies in coffee agroecosystems to address the following questions: Does species richness decline with intensification or with individual vegetation characteristics? Are there significant losses of species richness in coffee-management systems compared with forests? Is species loss greater for forest species or for particular functional groups? and Are ants or birds more strongly affected by intensification? Across studies, ant and bird richness declined with management intensification and with changes in vegetation. Species richness of all ants and birds and of forest ant and bird species was lower in most coffee agroecosystems than in forests, but rustic coffee (grown under native forest canopies) had equal or greater ant and bird richness than nearby forests. Sun coffee (grown without canopy trees) sustained the highest species losses, and species loss of forest ant, bird, and tree species increased with management intensity. Losses of ant and bird species were similar, although losses of forest ants were more drastic in rustic coffee. Richness of migratory birds and of birds that forage across vegetation strata was less affected by intensification than richness of resident, canopy, and understory bird species. Rustic farms protected more species than other coffee systems, and loss of species depended greatly on habitat specialization and functional traits. We recommend that forest be protected, rustic coffee be promoted, and intensive coffee farms be restored by augmenting native tree density and richness and allowing growth of epiphytes. We also recommend that future research focus on potential trade-offs between biodiversity conservation and farmer livelihoods stemming from coffee production. /// Diversos estudios han documentado las p\u00e9rdidas de biodiversidad debido a la intensificaci\u00f3n del manejo de caf\u00e9 (disminuci\u00f3n de la riqueza y complejidad del dosel).

Revisamos cuantitativamente los datos de estudios de biodiversidad de hormigas, aves y \u00e1rboles en agroecosistemas de caf\u00e9 para abordar las siguientes preguntas: \u00bfLa riqueza de especies declina con la intensificaci\u00f3n o con las caracter\u00edsticas individuales de la vegetaci\u00f3n? \u00bfHay p\u00e9rdidas significativas de riqueza de especies en los sistemas cafetaleros en comparaci\u00f3n con los bosques? \u00bfEs mayor la p\u00e9rdida en especies de bosque o en grupos funcionales particulares? y \u00bfLas aves o las hormigas son m\u00e1s afectadas por la intensificaci\u00f3n? En los estudios revisados, la riqueza de hormigas y aves declin\u00f3 con la intensificaci\u00f3n del manejo y con los cambios de vegetaci\u00f3n. La riqueza de especies de todas las hormigas y aves y la de especies de hormigas y aves de bosque fue menor en la mayor\u00eda de los agroecosistemas cafetaleros que en los bosques, pero el caf\u00e9 r\u00fastico (cultivado bajo dosel de bosque nativo) sustent\u00f3 la mayor p\u00e9rdida de especies, y la p\u00e9rdida de especies de hormigas, aves y \u00e1rboles de bosque aument\u00f3 con la intensificaci\u00f3n del manejo.

However, the role of such features in habitat selection and demography of individual species has not been established. Understanding the mechanisms of habitat selection requires both experimental manipulation of habitat structure and detailed estimation of the behavioral and demographic response of animals, e.g., changes in movement patterns and survival probabilities, Such studies have not been conducted in natural tropical forest, perhaps because of high habitat heterogeneity, high species diversity, and low abundances of potential target species. Agroforestry systems support a less diverse flora, with greater spatial homogeneity which, in turn, harbors lower overall species diversity with greater numerical dominance of common species, than natural forests. Furthermore, agroforestry systems are already extensively managed and lend themselves easily to larger scale habitat manipulations than protected natural forest. Thus, agroforestry systems provide a good model environment for beginning to understand processes underlying habitat selection in tropical forest animals. Here, we use multistate, capture\u2014recapture models to investigate how the experimental removal of epiphytes affected monthly movement and survival probabilities of two resident bird species (Common Bush-Tanager [Chlorospingus ophthalmicus] and Golden-crowned Warbler [Basileuterus culicivorus]) in a Mexican shade coffee plantation. We established two paired plots of ephiphyte removal and control. We found that Bush-Tanagers were at least five times more likely to emigrate from plots where epiphytes were removed compared to control plots. Habitat-specific movement patterns were not detected in the warbler. However, unlike the Golden-crowned Warbler, Common Bush-Tanagers depend upon epiphytes for nest sites and (seasonally) for foraging. These dispersal patterns imply that active habitat selection based on the presence or absence of epiphytes occurs in C. ophthalmicus on our study area. Survival rates did not vary with habitat in either species. Interestingly, in both species, survival was higher in the nonbreeding season, when birds were in mixed-species flocks. Movement by Common Bush-Tanagers into areas with epiphytes occurred mostly during the breeding season, when mortality-driven opportunity was greatest.\n      </p>", "The genetic modification of Coffea arabica fruits is an important tool for the investigation of physiological characteristics and functional validation of genes related to coffee bean quality traits. In this work, plants of C. arabica cultivar Catua\u00ed Vermelho were successfully genetically modified by bombardment of embryogenic calli. Calli were obtained from 90% of the leaf explants cultivated in a callogenesis-inducing medium modified with 20 \u03bcM 2, 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). The resulting calli were bombarded with the pBI426 vector containing a uidA and nptII gene fusion that was driven by the double CaMV35s promoter. Kanamycin-selected embryos were positive for \u03b2-glucuronidase (GUS) activity in histochemical assays and for target gene amplification by polymerase chain reaction. Integration of the nptII gene was confirmed by Southern blot and showed a low copy number (one to three) of insertions. Transformed plants showed normal development and settled fruits. GUS expression was assessed in the flower and fruit organs demonstrating the capacity of the double CaMV35s promoter to drive long-term stable expression of uidA in C. arabica fruit tissues. Moreover, we obtained a T\u2081 progeny presenting 3:1 Mendelian segregation of the uidA gene. This investigation is the first to report exogenous gene expression in coffee fruits and transgenic inheritance in C. arabica plants.\n      </p>", "Objectives: Coffee, tea, and fluid consumption have been thought to influence bladder cancer incidence. In a large prospective study, these associations were investigated. Methods: In 1986, cohort members (55-69 years) completed a questionnaire on cancer risk factors. Follow-up was established by linkage to cancer registries until 1992. The multivariable case-cohort analysis was based on 569 bladder cancer cases and 3123 subcohort members. Results: The incidence rate ratios (RR) for men consuming &lt; 2 cups of coffee/day was 0.89 (95% CI 0.51-1.5) using the median consumption category (4- &lt; 5 cups/day) as reference. This RR increased to 1.3 (95% CI 0.94-1.9) for men consuming \u22657 cups/day, although no clear dose-response association was found. The RRs decreased from 1.2 (95% CI 0.56-2.7) for women consuming &lt; 2 cups of coffee/day to 0.36 (95% CI 0.18-0.72) for women consuming \u22655 cups/day compared to the median consumption category (3- &lt; 4 cups/day). Men and women who abstained from drinking tea had a RR of 1.3 (95% CI 0.97-1.8) compared to those consuming 2- &lt; 3 cups of tea per day (median consumption category). The RR for men and women comparing highest to lowest quintile of total fluid consumption was 0.87 (95% CI 0.63-1.2). Conclusion: The data suggest a possible positive association between coffee consumption and bladder cancer risk in men and a probable inverse association in women. Tea consumption was inversely associated with bladder cancer. Total fluid consumption did not appear to be associated with bladder cancer.\n      </p>", "A case-control study on gastric cancer was carried out between 1987 and 1989 in four regions of Spain. Three hundred and fifty-four cases of histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma were included (235 men and 119 women). For each case, a control was selected, matched by sex, age, and area of residence, from the same hospital as the case. No association was observed with smoking, nor with the consumption of coffee or tea. The usual consumption of alcohol was associated with gastric cancer in men (odds ratio = 1.54, 95 percent confidence interval = 1.03-2.31), but there was no dose-response relationship. No association was observed in women. All estimations were carried out taking into account the effect of the dietary factors associated with gastric cancer. In accordance with previous evidence, the association observed between gastric cancer and alcohol appears not to be causal.\n      </p>", "The method of penetration of fungi through the host cuticle by means of cutinase versus mechanical pressure exerted by melanized appresoria has been the subject of debate. Colletotrichum kahawae Bridge &amp; Waller infects green coffee berries in Africa, inducing 70-80% losses. Turgor pressure (TP) of the appresoria was estimated in vitro to be 2.6 MPa, about twice the osmotic pressure (OP) of the green berries. Appresoria exposed in vitro to polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution with OPs of 7.0 MPa and above immediately collapsed. However, collapsed appresoria subjected to OP as high as 46.5 MPa could recover. Green berries inoculated with conidial suspensions, if subjected to OP of 28.5 MPa, showed 7% of them with necrotic lesions. Total inhibition of infection was achieved at 46.5 MPa. The OP of PEG solutions applied to inoculated green fruit decreased to the OP of the green berries in 48 h. The resistance of appresoria to osmotic stress, combined with the rapid dilution of PEG by solutes (water) from the fruit might explain the rate of infection even at very high OP. Unmelanized appresoria induced by tricyclazole showed TPs as low as one-quarter of melanized ones and, as a consequence, the percentage of infection on leaves and green berries was much lower. Cutinase was present in conidial mucilage and in extracellular fluids of germinated conidia in vitro and in planta. Cutinase was induced by growing the fungus in Czapek-Dox medium if cutin was used as the sole carbon source. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate, a cutinase inhibitor, totally inhibited cutinase activity of culture filtrates and extracellular fluids but did not prevent infection. It is suggested that the TP of C. kahawae appresoria might play a major role in coffee cuticle penetration, according to our results.\n      </p>", "Les liens entre la production du caf\u00e9 dans les pays en voie de d\u00e9veloppement et sa consommation dans les pays d\u00e9velopp\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 l'objet de tensions fr\u00e9quentes.

We apply a global commodity chain framework to understand these problems and to propose possible solutions. Imbalances on international spot markets are related to the easy access to coffee production and trade, climatic drawbacks in large producing countries and supply mismatches with changing consumers' preferences. Hedgers and speculators in futures markets cause additional price volatilities. Big multinational roasters and retailers control the transmission of material, value and information streams in the strategic parts of the chain by their market power and extra-market coordination tools. The outcomes are high consumers' prices and very low growers' prices. A sustainable solution for both the market imbalances and the asymmetric income distribution could not be reached by the present governance structure of the coffee chains. There is a need for the strengthening of vertical coordination by sharing information, reorientation of coffee institutions in producing countries and introduction of intra-chain surplus redistribution to support the weakest links.\n      </p>", "The sociological literature on social movement organizations (SMOs) has come to recognize that under neoliberal globalization many SMOs have moved from an emphasis on the state as the locus of change toward a focus on corporations as targets. This shift has led some SMOs to turn to forms of market-based private regulatory action. The use of one such tactic\u2014voluntary, third-party product certification\u2014has grown substantially, as SMOs seek ways to hold stateless firms accountable. This article explores the case of the international fair trade movement, which aims to change the inequitable terms of global trade in commodities for small farmers, artisans, and waged laborers. Drawing from interviews with a range of fair trade participants, document analysis, and media coverage, the article describes fair trade's growing relationship with multinational coffee firms, particularly Starbucks and Nestl\u00e9. It explores intra-movement conflicts over the terms for and the effects of corporate participation in fair trade, and illuminates tensions between conceptualizations of fair trade as movement, market, and system. The article makes two arguments. First, while fair trade has succeeded partially in reembedding market exchange within systems of social and moral relations, it has also proved susceptible to the power of corporate actors to disembed the alternative through a process of movement co-optation. Second, it argues that co-optation takes a unique form in the context of social movements whose principal tools to achieve social change are certification and labeling: it occurs primarily on the terrain of standards, in the form of weakening or dilution.\n      </p>", "Because of concern about the potential adverse effects of consuming caffeinated beverages during pregnancy, pregnant women may choose to replace caffeinated with decaffeinated coffee. In a population-based study of 7,855 livebirths in California's San Joaquin Valley, we examined the relation of maternal decaffeinated and caffeinated coffee consumption during pregnancy to measures of fetal growth and gestational duration. Mothers answered a questionnaire in the hospital at the time of completing the birth certificate. Compared with women who drank neither decaffeinated nor caffeinated coffee, those who consumed only decaffeinated coffee showed no increased odds of small-for-gestational age birth, low birth weight, or preterm delivery, nor lowered mean birth weight or shortened mean gestational age. Women who consumed caffeinated coffee alone had an adjusted odds ratio of 1.3 [95% confidence limits (CL) = 1.0, 1.7] for preterm delivery, whereas those who consumed both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee had an adjusted odds of 2.3 (95% CL = 1.3, 4.0). When caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee were considered as continuous variables, we found a reduction in adjusted mean birth weight of -3.0 gm per cup per week (95% CL = -5.9, -0.6) for caffeinated coffee and an increase of +0.4 gm per cup per week (95% CL = -3.7, 4.5) for decaffeinated coffee.\n      </p>", "Data from a population-based, case-control study of 149 cases of cancer of the exocrine pancreas (excluding insulinomas) and 363 controls were used to test the hypothesis that coffee consumption increased the risk of cancer of the exocrine pancreas. Because of the high mortality from cancer of the pancreas, all information was obtained from proxy respondents for cases and controls. Increased risk was present for coffee drinkers [odds ratio (OR) = 2.38], cigarette smokers (OR = 2.27), and alcohol users (OR = 1.60), but the effect for alcohol disappeared after adjustment for cigarette use. Risk increased with the amount of coffee drunk with an OR of 2.38 in the those having at least 50,000 lifetime cups. This gradient was present in both men and women, and in cigarette smokers and nonsmokers. Increased risk was present for users of regular and decaffeinated coffee, but the risk was higher for users of decaffeinated coffee than users of regular coffee. Cigarette smoking, after controlling for coffee consumption, was an independent risk factor for pancreatic cancer, with odds ratios in the heaviest smokers of 2.71 (95% confidence interval = 1.41-5.21).\n      </p>", "We studied the effect of coffee consumption on birthweight, preterm births, and congenital malformations. From April 1985 to April 1987, 11,858 pregnant women out of 13,815 in two Danish cities responded to a mailed questionnaire on eating and drinking habits during pregnancy. Data on pregnancy outcomes were recorded from medical files. Maternal coffee consumption of four cups a day or more was associated with a moderate decrease in birthweight, especially among smokers. The associations between coffee consumption and preterm births or congenital malformations were very weak.\n      </p>", "The distribution of epiphytes differs between branches within tree crowns as well as within habitats. Where the original forests have been lost, shade coffee plantations can be important refuges for epiphytes, but are not suitable for all species. To understand what affects habitat quality, we transplanted 1440 seedlings each of two orchids, one, Lycaste aromatica, restricted to forests, the other, Jacquiniella teretifolia, common on trees in coffee plantations and in forests. Seedling mortality and growth were compared between three forests, three young and three old coffee plantations to test for differences between habitats and to analyse which habitat features affect growth and mortality. In J. teretifolia there was no clear pattern of habitat effect on mortality (c. 0.08 mo\u22121), but the production of new shoots was higher in coffee plantations than in forests. In L. aromatica, growth rates as well as seedling mortality increased over time. During the last census growth rates in forests (1.8 mm mo\u22121) were significantly higher than in old (0.9 mm mo\u22121) and young (1.2 mm mo\u22121) coffee plantations, and seedling mortality was about four times higher in old (0.10 mo\u22121) and young (0.11 mo\u22121) coffee plantations than in forests (0.025 mo\u22121), which may explain the natural absence of L. aromatica from coffee plantations. Mortality in L. aromatica at individual sites was negatively correlated with bryophyte cover on branches (Pearson r = \u22120.75) and positively with lichen cover (r = 0.70) and canopy openness (r = 0.75). Branch cover with non-vascular epiphytes, whether directly responsible by improving the water supply to epiphytes or indicative of differences in microclimate, may be a useful indicator of suitable habitats for vascular epiphytes.\n      </p>", "A survey of the vascular flora of Coffee County, Alabama was conducted from June 1999 through April 2001. Coffee County includes 173,235 ha and is located in the southeastern section of the state, entirely within the Coastal Plain Province. To increase the diversity of taxa collected, an attempt was made to sample all major habitats within the county. Also, a search of pertinent literature was conducted, and the herbaria of Troy State University (TROY), Auburn University (AUA), and The University of Alabama (UNA) were searched for taxa not collected during this study. A total of 797 taxa, representing 460 genera and 147 families, were reported for Coffee County. Asteraceae was the largest family with 96 species, followed by Poaceae with 70 species and Fabaceae with 61 species. Quercus was the largest genus with 16 species, followed by Rhynchospora with 10 species. Twelve of the species documented here are globally or state ranked for rarity of occurrence.\n      </p>", "We examined the use of Venezuelan shade-coffee plantations by the Cerulean Warbler (Dendroica cerulea) and other Neotropical migrants. Cerulean Warblers were commonly observed as pairs in mixed-species flocks. Average (\u00b1 SE) flock size was 13 \u00b1 2 species with 22 \u00b1 3 individuals. Average flock territory size was 2.5 \u00b1 0.2 ha. No differences were detected in foraging behavior (maneuvers, location, or success) among adult males, adult females, and immature birds. Adult males were often observed visiting flowers of canopy trees. The results of this study indicate that shade coffee plantations may provide suitable wintering habitat for Cerulean Warblers although comparisons with other habitats are needed.\n      </p>", "Studies of biological diversity have focused mainly on undisturbed ecosystems, effectively neglecting potential losses due to changes in areas already altered by human intervention. In this study we test the hypothesis that measures of biological diversity change significantly with changes in agricultural practices. In particular, we examine differences in measures of ant species diversity correlated with changes in vegetational complexity associated with the modernization of Costa Rica's coffee agroecosystem. We examine patterns of within-habitat $(\\alpha)$ and between-habitat $(\\beta)$ diversity in the ant community. Ants were sampled in 16 coffee farms falling on a gradient of vegetational and structural complexity. Percentage of shade created by the canopy was used as an index of vegetational complexity. As a partial indicator of the food resource base, arthropods were sampled using pitfall traps. The diversity $(S, H'$, and $E)$ of ground-foraging ants decreased significantly with the reduction of vegetational diversity. However, no significant changes were recorded for the diversity of the ants on the surface of coffee bushes. Similarity indices $(I)$ showed a high degree of similarity among ant communities in coffee monocultures but a low degree of similarity among farms with high vegetational diversity. We discuss several possible mechanisms leading to reduced ant diversity.\n      </p>", "Drawing on the work of Pierre Bourdieu and Judith Butler, we develop a detailed ethnography of a social space in a major law school and explore its socialization of the students there. \"Coffee House\" is a weekly social event sponsored by Canadian law firms and offering free drink and food to the students present. We argue that this event and the actors involved profoundly change student identities and alter educational aspirations. Although the students themselves insist that \"nothing is going on,\" our ethnography suggests that in \"Coffee House\" identity is developed through performances, and in the accumulation of symbolic capital, until ultimately students come to feel their future career path is not a matter of choice, but destiny. We explore the important work of Bourdieu through this setting, but ultimately we resist his determinism, and suggest instead that, following the work of Butler, identity is a more complicated and fluid dynamic between space, repetition, and performance. It appears that a personal unconscious transformation among law students attending Coffee House is underway; yet opportunities to change the meaning of this space and these performances remain.\n      </p>", "In the nineteenth century, coffee transformed the economic, social, and political landscapes of Central America. This paper examines the introduction and expansion of coffee cultivation in Nicaragua in light of several key factors that conditioned its growth. From its earliest stages to the development of its most important coffee region, the North-Central Highlands, transport linkages and active government promotion were the most important elements facilitating the expansion of coffee cultivation in Nicaragua. These conclusions allow Nicaragua's early coffee economy to be placed in the context of coffee cultivation throughout the rest of the isthmus.

A large risk factor for these diseases is the presence of the metabolic syndrome. It is known that the risk of DM II can be decreased by coffee consumption. Therefore, we examined the association between coffee consumption and the components of the metabolic syndrome. Prospective data from the Amsterdam Growth and Health Longitudinal Study (AGAHLS) is used to analyse the associations between coffee consumption (averaged over a period from 27 till 42 years) and the components of the metabolic syndrome (at the age of 42 years). This was done by linear regression analyses and associations were adjusted for physical activity, energy intake, alcohol consumption and smoking behaviour. The results showed that moderate and high (&gt; 2 cups/day) coffee consumption was significantly associated with lower HDL in women. For men, coffee consumption was not associated with any of the components of the metabolic syndrome.\n      </p>", "The abundance of epiphytes has been assumed to be important in explaining the high diversity of tropical canopy arthropods. In this study we assessed the possible role that the presence of epiphytes may have on the diversity and abundance of canopy insects in an experimental study conducted in a coffee plantation in Coatepec, Veracruz, Mexico. Epiphytes were removed from trees in one of two plots in two sites of the coffee plantation. In each plot we collected insects from three Inga jinicuil trees by knockdown insecticide fogging. Insects were sorted to morphospecies, counted and measured. Trees with epiphytes had significantly higher numbers of species and individuals and insects larger than 5 mm were also more species-rich and abundant in trees with epiphytes. The magnitude of the enhancement was surprisingly large with the epiphyte plot samples having on average 90% more individuals and 22% more species than plots without epiphytes. These differences were even greater for large (&amp;gt 5 mm) insects (184% and 113% respectively). Our results support the tenet that epiphytes provide valuable resources to arthropods, which we have illustrated for canopy insects in shade trees of coffee plantations.\n      </p>", "Most work on the effects of land-cover change on tropical birds has focused on forest-interior birds because these species are assumed to be the most severely affected by forest loss. However, even species that use human-altered habitat types may be severely affected by forest loss. White-throated Robins (Turdus assimilis) frequently nest in coffee and pasture in southern Costa Rica, although several lines of evidence suggest the species could not exist solely in agricultural habitat. We used radio-telemetry to examine the area and proportion of different habitat types used by adult White-throated Robins. Mean area of use for the tracking period was $0.26 km^2$ and varied from 0.07 to $0.58 km^2$ . No robins had areas of use solely in either primary forest or agricultural cover, although individuals were initially captured in both primary forest and a coffee plantation. All areas of use contained some forest, pasture, and coffee or regenerating forest. The mean percentages of the habitat types used by the birds were fairly equal with 30% forest, 33% pasture, and 38% coffee or regenerating forest. Our results, combined with other evidence, indicate that the White-throated Robin uses multiple habitat types but that it may require some threshold level of forest to sustain viable populations. /// La $mayor\\acute{i}a$ de los trabajos en cambios en la cubierta de suelo en areas tropicales se ha enfocado en aves del interior de bosques, los cuales se creen han sido los m\u00e1s afectados por la $deforestaci\\acute{o}n$ .

Over a period of 15 months during 1991-1992 in Athens, Greece, we identified 380 women who had a multiple birth that was delivered in one of the six larger maternity hospitals in the area. We selected as controls 380 livebirth singleton pregnancies delivered at the same hospitals immediately following a multiple pregnancy. All mothers were interviewed in the maternity wards or at home, and zygosity was ascertained through the similarity method. The odds ratio for ovulation-inducing drugs was not elevated for monozygotic twins, but it was 9-fold for dizygotic twins and 90-fold for triplets or quadruplets. We excluded drug-induced pregnancies, twins of indeterminable zygosity, and all triplets from further analyses. We found no remarkable association between any of the study variables and the occurrence of monozygotic twins, with the exception of an increasing trend with age. For dizygotic twins, we found weak associations in the expected directions with maternal age (positive) and height (positive) as well as with parity and number of induced abortions (positive). A history of oral contraceptive use was inversely, but weakly, associated with dizygotic twinning. Each cup of coffee per day was associated with an increment in the odds ratio of 1.23-fold (95% confidence interval = 1.05-1.43). Restriction of the analysis to dizygotic twins of different gender increased the point estimate of the odds ratio to 1.31 for each cup of coffee consumed daily.

Seeds germinated equally with or without light, and pretreatment with red or far-red light did not affect germination. Optimum temperature for germination was 25 C, and a high germination percentage (&gt; 70%) occurred from 12.5 to 30 C. The low temperature threshold for germination was between 10 and 12.5 C, whereas the upper threshold was near 45 C. Coffee senna germination in response to moisture stress and solution pH differed at 15 and 30 C. At -0.4 MPa, no germination occurred at 15 C, whereas 15% germination occurred at 30 C. Optimum germination was at pH 6, but further increases in pH had a more negative effect on germination at 15 C than at 30 C. Coffee senna germination ranged from 9 to 12% at pH 3, but was 0% at pH 10, which indicates that coffee senna germination was more tolerant of acidic than basic solutions. Depth-mediated emergence inhibition was sigmoidal, with greatest emergence on the soil surface. Emergence from 2- to 10-cm depths reached 95% of the total emergence 1 to 3 d earlier in a sandy loam than in a sand soil. Mean emergence depth was 1.7 cm in the sand and 2.4 cm in the sandy loam soil. Knowledge gained from this research will be instrumental in developing a better understanding of the requirements for coffee senna germination and emergence, allowing further development and improvement of integrated weed management strategies specific to this troublesome weed.\n      </p>", "We studied avian attendance at swarms of Eciton burchelli and Labidus praedator (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Ecitoninae) over 5-mo periods in both 1996 and 1997, at elevations between 1400 m and 1800 m in western Panama. We conducted area searches for swarms of raiding ants and attendant birds in intact forest, traditional shade coffee habitats both adjacent to and distant from forest, and in sun coffee habitats, quantifying the size and composition of attendant flocks. All habitats except sun coffee supported numerous army ant swarms and thus a diverse assemblage of ant-following birds. A total of 411 swarming occasions attracted 126 bird species of 28 families. Of the 103 resident species, two were obligate ant-following birds, the Ruddy Woodcreeper (Dendrocincla homochroa) and the Gray-headed Tanager (Eucometris penicillata). Of the remaining species, 18 were wintering Nearctic migrants, and five were transient Nearctic migrants. Nearctic migrant species composed a greater percentage of the attendant species in shade coffee habitats as compared to forest. Several species of forest resident birds that correspond with particular foraging guilds, such as understory bark insectivores, including D. homochroa, regularly occurred in adjacent shade coffee but were never observed at swarms in distant shade coffee. Army ants may therefore be a mechanism for bringing forest birds into shade coffee, but only to a point. In western Panama, mid-elevational traditional shade coffee plantations can provide additional habitat for the diverse avifauna that attend army ant swarms. With increasing distance from large areas of continuous forest, however, the value of traditional shade coffee habitats is lessened for certain components of the bird community. Thus, protection of these habitats adjacent to intact forest should receive priority. Additionally, current transformation of coffee-growing practices, including the removal of shade trees to grow coffee in full sun, will negatively affect army ants and their associated avian followers.\n      </p>"], "words": {"managed": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "global": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "branches": {"number": 1, "prob":
