{"total_words": 111, "documents": ["When forced by prodding to run continuously, Centruroides hentzi (Banks 1901) (Scorpiones, Buthidae) lost over 70% of initial speed within 30 s and moved fitfully, if at all, after 90 s. A lack of behavioral response to alternative stimuli presented after two mins of prodding suggested that the scorpions were physiologically fatigued. Mean whole body D-(-)-lactate concentration increased from resting values of 0.6 \u00b5mol/g to 4 \u00b5mol/g at exhaustion, an approximately 6.5-fold change. It is unlikely that scorpions accumulate significant amounts of other anaerobic products. Whole body lactate accumulations in C. hentzi are lower than those found in species of spiders, crabs and terrestrial ectothermic vertebrates that are more specialized for running. This difference may be the result of proportionately more non-locomotory body mass in the bodies of scorpions compared to these other animals and not due to lower rates of anaerobic metabolism within locomotory muscles.\n      </p>", "Even though human legs allow a wide repertoire of movements, when people travel by foot they mostly use one of two locomotor patterns, namely, walking and running. The selection of these two gaits from the plethora of options might be because walking and running require less metabolic energy than other more unusual gaits. We addressed this possibility previously using numerical optimization of a minimal mathematical model of a biped. We had found that, for a given step-length, the two classical descriptions of walking and running, 'inverted pendulum walking' and 'impulsive running', do indeed minimize the amount of positive work required at low and high speeds respectively. Here, for the case of small step-lengths, we establish the previous results analytically. First, we simplify the two-dimensional particle trajectory problem to a one-dimensional 'elevator' problem. Then we use elementary geometric arguments on the resulting phase plane to show optimality of the two gaits: walking at low speeds and running at high speeds.\n      </p>", "It is known that muscular force is reduced in old age. We investigate what are the effects of this phenomenon on the mechanics of running. We hypothesized that the deficit in force would result in a lower push, causing reduced amplitude of the vertical oscillation, with smaller elastic energy storage and increased step frequency. To test this hypothesis, we measured the mechanical energy of the centre of mass of the body during running in old and young subjects. The amplitude of the oscillation is indeed reduced in the old subjects, resulting in an approximately 20% smaller elastic recovery and a greater step frequency (3.7 versus 2.8 Hz, p = 1.9 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2075, at 15-17 km h\u207b\u00b9). Interestingly, the greater step frequency is due to a lower aerial time, and not to a greater natural frequency of the system, which is similar in old and young subjects (3.6 versus 3.4 Hz, p = 0.2). Moreover, we find that in the old subjects, the step frequency is always similar to the natural frequency, even at the highest speeds. This is at variance with young subjects who adopt a step frequency lower than the natural frequency at high speeds, to contain the aerobic energy expenditure. Finally, the external work to maintain the motion of the centre of mass is reduced in the old subjects (0.9 versus 1.2 J kg\u207b\u00b9 m\u207b\u00b9, p = 5.1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076) due to the lower work done against gravity, but the higher step frequency involves a greater internal work to reset the limbs at each step. The net result is that the total work increases with speed more steeply in the old subjects than in young subjects.\n      </p>", "In this note we make two points, from which follows a suggestion for running uphill: (1) an athlete's energy needs in running up a slope of gradient \u03b8 at a speed V may be considered to have three additive elements: that needed to stay alive; that needed to run at a speed V on the level; that needed to lift the body at a rate V sin \u03b8. (2) corresponding to Naismith's rule of 1 to 8, in whole numbers, for walking or running in mountainous country (1 foot of ascent is equivalent to 8 feet on the level), the rule for running on a treadmill is 1 to 3 and the rule for running on roads is 1 to 4 or 5. This result suggests that, if possible, a runner should zigzag up slopes steeper than 1 in 8 on the fells and zigzag up slopes greater than 1 in 4 or 5 on roads.\n      </p>", "A series of treadmill experiments is described concerned with a runner's speed, heart-rate and the gradient. Together with the results of similar experiments, some of them carried out over 50 years ago, the results suggest that for a given heart-rate, log(speed) is linearly related to gradient, and that for a given gradient, heart-rate is linearly related to speed. The results suggest: (1) that athletes who run p% faster on the level will run p% faster up a slope, if they maintain the same heart-rate; (2) that athletes will use the same number of heart beats running up a hill of uniform slope no matter how fast or slowly they run; (3) that athletes should run directly up any slope of less than about 20&lt;sup&gt;\u26ac&lt;/sup&gt; and try to zigzag up slopes greater than this.\n      </p>", "A number of mathematical theories to describe the momentum and energy balances associated with running have been advocated since the pioneering work of the British biologist A. V. Hill in the 1920s. Since the various models lead to quite different conclusions and predictions about the balances associated with running, it is instructive to examine critically the assumptions underlying them. So, for example, depending on the model employed, it has been predicted that, for a sprinter, the relative expenditure of energy in overcoming air resistance lies somewhere in the range of 2 to 16%. This wide range of values derives mainly from the various estimates of the propulsive force exerted during sprinting, indicating just how disparate the predictions among the models are. In the early 1970s Keller built on the ideas of Hill to develop a complete theoretical model for competitive running in which the goal of the athlete is to cover the race distance in a minimum amount of time (subject to certain constraints on the runner.) While the Hill-Keller model provides only a first approximation, in that no attempt is made to model separately the anaerobic and the aerobic pathways for energy conversion and only the simplest model for the resistance to motion is considered, it nevertheless gives a good overall representation of the world running records from 60 yds. to 10 km. Based on a careful appraisal of the various models, it is suggested here that approximately 3% of a sprinter's effort is spent on overcoming air resistance, a figure that is supported by an independent estimate derived from the long jump. An interesting consequence of the analysis is the feature that the benefits of sprinting at altitude cannot be accounted for wholly by the reduced air density, suggesting that there may be some physiological benefit to sprinting at altitude. As a special application of the estimate for the cost of overcoming air resistance, an appraisal has been made of the series of 100 m races run at the U.S. Olympic Trials in 1988 in which Florence Griffith-Joyner set a new world record. This record has been treated with great suspicion in the athletics community because of a questionable wind-gauge reading. It is shown here that the record was almost certainly wind aided, with a trailing wind of 4 $\\operatorname{ms}^{-1}$ or more.\n      </p>", "Maximum running speed is an important locomotor parameter for many animals-predators as well as prey-and is thus of interest to palaeobiologists wishing to reconstruct the behavioural ecology of extinct species. A variety of approaches have been tried in the past including anatomical comparisons, bone scaling and strength, safety factors and ground reaction force analyses. However, these approaches are all indirect and an alternative approach is to create a musculoskeletal model of the animal and see how fast it can run. The major advantage of this approach is that all assumptions about the animal's morphology and physiology are directly addressed, whereas the exact same assumptions are hidden in the indirect approaches. In this paper, we present simple musculoskeletal models of three extant and five extinct bipedal species. The models predict top speed in the extant species with reasonably good agreement with accepted values, so we conclude that the values presented for the five extinct species are reasonable predictions given the modelling assumptions made. Improved musculoskeletal models and better estimates of soft tissue parameters will produce more accurate values. Limited sensitivity analysis is performed on key muscle parameters but there is considerable scope for extending this in the future.\n      </p>"], "words": {"and": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "mathematical": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "walking": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "force": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "have": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "people": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "series": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "is": {"number": 4, "prob": 3.312505952159133e-05}, "in": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "it": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "patterns,": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "one": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "known": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "experiments": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "animals": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "human": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "namely,": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "old": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "centruroides": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "speed": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "even": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "forced": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "use": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "from": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "for": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "make": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "since": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "when": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "two": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "been": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "note": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "to": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "that": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "concerned": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "which": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "associated": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "legs": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "parameter": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "energy": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "pioneering": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "we": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "describe": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "run": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "suggestion": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "mostly": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "though": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "of": {"number": 5, "prob": 4.140632440198916e-05}, "number": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "repertoire": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "running": {"number": 4, "prob": 3.312505952159133e-05}, "important": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "they": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "foot": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "advocated": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "balances": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "with": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "by": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "a": {"number": 6, "prob": 4.968758928238699e-05}, "wide": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "movements,": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "described": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "this": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "follows": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "age": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "work": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "maximum": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "british": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "theories": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "allow": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "many": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "an": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "locomotor": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "the": {"number": 3, "prob": 2.4843794641193497e-05}, "reduced": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "travel": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}}}
