A mathematical programming model is developed which embodies (a) the integer nature of machinery decisions, (b) the stochastic nature of weather. (c) the joint selection of machinery and crop plans, and (d) selection among machinery sets rather than among individual machines. Optimal machinery and crop plans are determined for selected weather probability levels. The robustness of machinery sets over a range of weather conditions is evaluated by subjecting the distributions of outcomes for alternative machinery sets to stochastic dominance criteria. Bias of good-field-day distributions is also discussed.\n      </p>", "This paper is about technological relations and firm performance in the Swedish machinery industry. Taking its point of departure in the proliferating literature on the localized nature of learning and innovation processes, the paper sets out to answer three empirical questions: To what extent are firms integrated in localized production systems based on buyer-supplier relations? At what geographical level-local/regional, national or international-are the most important technological relations found? Is there a correlation between localized technological relations and the technological performance of firms? The results indicate that few firms display localized buyer-supplier relations. Rather, the industry is highly internationalized, with the most important customers and competitors located outside Sweden. In terms of technologically important relations, the domestic arena seems to be more important. The majority of the most important technological relations link the machinery producers to other actors in Sweden. Three out of four firms may be classified as predominantly local/regional or national in their technological relations, or technology profile. This survey therefore supports the notion that there exists both local/regional and national innovation systems. Finally, however, despite the fact that most firms are fairly locally embedded in their technology relations, there is no evidence that such embeddedness shows up as superior firm performance, in terms of technology level or innovative capacity.\n      </p>", "Soluble P loop NTPases represent a large protein family and are involved in diverse cellular functions. Here, we functionally characterized the first member of the Mrp/Nbp35 subbranch of this family, the essential Nbp35p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The protein resides in the cytosol and nucleus and carries an Fe/S cluster at its N terminus. Assembly of the Fe/S cluster requires the mitochondrial Fe/S cluster (ISC)-assembly and -export machineries. Depletion of Nbp35p strongly impairs the activity of the cytosolic Fe/S protein, isopropylmalate isomerase (Leu1p), whereas mitochondrial Fe/S enzymes are unaffected. Moreover, defects in the de novo maturation of various cytosolic and nuclear Fe/S proteins were observed in the absence of Nbp35p, demonstrating the functional involvement of Nbp35p in the biogenesis of extramitochondrial Fe/S proteins. Furthermore, Nbp35p genetically interacts with the closely similar P loop NTPase, Cfd1p, and the hydrogenase-like Nar1p, both of which were recently shown to perform a crucial function in cytosolic and nuclear Fe/S protein biogenesis. Hence, our study suggests that eukaryotic Nbp35 NTPases function in Fe/S protein maturation. The findings provide strong evidence for the existence of a highly conserved and essential machinery dedicated to assembling cytosolic and nuclear Fe/S proteins.\n      </p>", "A method is presented for identifying critical farm machinery in a linear programming context. The method uses a technical coefficient sensitivity analysis formula that overcomes problems associated with direct use of shadow prices for critical machinery identification.

The formation of the cotton textile machinery and firearms industrial districts in New England between 1790 and 1820 demonstrates the importance of initial conditions, including general education and skills levels, a growing economy, prosperous people, and social networks that communicate information and support cooperative ventures. The bridges across social networks of personnel and firms provide the means to acquire new technology. Internal social cohesion within a network supports exchanges, but even more critical to long-term growth of an industrial district are the bridges across social networks that have minimal redundancy. Those types of contacts maximize the diversity of information and open new possibilities for contacts. The cotton textile machinery and firearms industries in New England emerged in a prosperous agricultural economy with a deep set of skills in metalworking. Those preexisting metalworking skills supported growth and technological change in the new industries. At the same time, the new industries added to the richness of metalworking skills and the social networks that tied personnel and firms.\n      </p>", "The time of intelligent machines is upon us. But the United States is not actively pursuing this rich field of technological development. This is evidenced by the U.S. trade deficit of $9 billion in this market in 1977.

In this machinery, a critical interaction occurs between the unusual myosin motor MyoA and the MyoA-tail Interacting Protein (MTIP). Here we present one crystal structure that shows three different conformations of Plasmodium MTIP, one of these in complex with the MyoA-tail, which reveal major conformational changes in the C-terminal domain of MTIP upon binding the MyoA-tail helix, thereby creating several hydrophobic pockets in MTIP that are the recipients of key hydrophobic side chains of MyoA. Because we also show that the MyoA helix is able to block parasite growth, this provides avenues for designing antimalarials.\n      </p>", "Investment in machinery is a key component in the analysis of long-term economic growth during the spread of industrialization. This article offers consistent annual series on the magnitude of machinery imports per capita into all Latin American countries for the period 1890\u20131930. Analysis of these series shows that machinery imports diverged across countries from 1890 through 1913. After 1913 a number of the more backward countries experienced rapid growth in machinery imports. These large differences in machinery investment contributed to unequal development across the Latin American countries.\n      </p>", "A model is developed to analyze the effects of income tax policy on the optimal timing of replacement for farm machinery.

These sequences border exon/intron junctions and aid in the process of removing introns by the RNA splicing machinery. Although substantial research has been undertaken to understand the mechanism of splicing, little is known about the origin and evolution of these splice signal sequences. Based on the previously published theory that the primitive genes evolved in pieces from primordial genetic sequences to avoid the interfering stop codons, a ``stop-codon walk'' mechanism is proposed in this paper to have assisted in the evolution of coding genes. This mechanism predicts the presence of stop codons in splice-junction signals inside the introns. Evidence of the consistent presence of stop codons in the splice-junction signals, in a position where they are expected, is shown by the analysis of codon statistics in these signal sequences in the GenBank databank. The results suggest that the splice-junction signals may have evolved from stop codons as a consequence of a selective pressure to avoid stop codons during the original evolution of coding genes. They also suggest that other splice signals within the introns, such as the branchpoint sequence, may have evolved from stop codons for similar reasons.\n      </p>", "This paper analyzes the impact of firm networks on Japan's national border effect. We estimate gravity equations using data on Japan s international and interregional trade in four machinery industries (electrical, general, precision and transportation machinery). The machinery sector is the most important manufacturing sector for exports and outward foreign direct investment (FDI) in Japan. By taking into account international as well as interregional firm networks, we find that ownership relations usually enhance exports from parent firms to establishment. Consequently we can explain 15% (7%, 1% and 0.5%) of the decline in Japan's border effect from 1980 to 1995 in precision (transportation, general electrical) machinery sector by the increase of international networks.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "This article presents a comparative analysis of the institutional trajectories traced by women's policy agencies within government in the province of British Columbia in Canada and in the state of New South Wales in Australia.

The model suggests that certain socioeconomic characteristics of farm managers will influence their decision-making process. Several characteristics are hypothesized and tested using multivariate techniques (multivariate analysis of variance, range tests, and multiple comparisons). The analysis indicates that the soil zone, value of machinery inventory, operator's age, and operator's education influence the importance placed on each of 20 factors. On the basis of the analysis it was concluded that such a model of the farm management process can contribute to an understanding of farm management decisions. In addition, it was concluded that farm managers, farm machinery dealers, and extension agents had significantly different perceptions of the importance of these factors to farm managers.

Such relationships are said to be particularly important in the case of production process innovations. These theoretical ideas are subjected to empirical scrutiny through a postal survey and set of interviews with users of advanced manufacturing technologies in Southern Ontario. Given the premise that intensive interaction and collaboration between users and producers of advanced process technologies is necessary for successful technology implementation to occur, then the chronically underdeveloped state of the Ontario advanced machinery sector ought to create major difficulties for manufacturers there trying to implement leading-edge processes. The analysis indicates that \"closeness\" between user and producer, defined physically, organizationally, and \"culturally,\" is important for the successful implementation of these advanced technologies. The paper suggests a set of circumstances in which proximity of the user to the producer is most important. In doing so, it offers an interpretation of \"culture\" that goes beyond common language, codes of communication, and norms to incorporate shared workplace practices and training regimes.

In the take-back program for power tools in Germany, costs exceed revenues for recycling power tools. Systematic analysis of take-back alternatives can make take-back policies more attractive. For example, an alternative take-back system for power tools would combine profitable remanufacturing and unprofitable materials recycling. The profit from remanufacturing could cover the loss from recycling as well as the costs of reverse logistics, allowing the manufacturer a profit. Remanufacturing requires a continuous flow of returned postconsumer products. By buying back end-of-life products, firms could control the flow of returned products. We developed a model that allows us to determine the optimal amount to spend on buy-back and the optimal unit cost of reverse logistics. We can use the latter to select a suitable reverse-logistics system for end-of-life products. We apply our model to the remanufacturing take-back concept for power tools, using empirical data on the current take-back program.\n      </p>", "Structural evidence has accumulated suggesting that fusion and/or translocation factors are involved in plastid membrane biogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we have developed an in vitro system in which the extent of fusion and/or translocation is monitored by the conversion of the xanthophyll epoxide (antheraxanthin) into the red ketocarotenoid (capsanthin). Only chromoplast membrane vesicles from red pepper fruits (Capsicum annuum) contain the required enzyme. Vesicles prepared from the mutant yellow cultivar are devoid of this enzyme and accumulate antheraxanthin. The fusion and/or translocation activity is characterized by complementation due to the synthesis of capsanthin and the parallel decrease of antheraxanthin when the two types of vesicles are incubated together in the presence of plastid stroma. We show that the extent of conversion is dependent upon an ATP-requiring protein that is sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide. Further purification and immunological analysis have revealed that the active factor, designated plastid fusion and/or translocation factor (Pftf), resides in a protein of 72 kDa. cDNA cloning revealed that mature Pftf has significant homology to yeast and animal (NSF) or bacterial (Ftsh) proteins involved in vesicle fusion or membrane protein translocation.\n      </p>", "We developed a method for setting the work-in-process (WIP) levels for products manufactured in a plant that operates in a high-variety, low-volume environment. We implemented the method on a spreadsheet using Visual Basic macros and used an iterative algorithm to find the WIP levels needed to meet required throughputs for different products. We applied the method at Woodward Aircraft Engine Systems, Rockford, Illinois, which produces high-precision components with long setup times. Using the spreadsheet, plant supervisors can quickly analyze several alternate scenarios. They have reduced WIP levels in some cells to one third of their original values.\n      </p>", "The conflicting interests of the trade union in the introduction of machinery, 209.--Trade-union policies, 210.--Opposition to machinery, 211.--Reduction in wage rates of hand-workers, 214.--Employment of the hand-workers as machine operators, 218.--Reduction of inflow into the trade, 221.--Distribution of work, 224.--Conclusions, 227.\n      </p>", "In this study, the tolerance to salt stress of the photosynthetic machinery was examined in relation to the effects of the genetic enhancement of the unsaturation of fatty acids in membrane lipids in wild-type and $desA^{+}$ cells of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942. Wild-type cells synthesized saturated and mono-unsaturated fatty acids, whereas $desA^{+}$ cells, which had been transformed with the desA gene for the \u039412 acyl-lipid desaturase of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, also synthesized di-unsaturated fatty acids. Incubation of wild-type and $desA^{+}$ cells with 0.5 M NaCl resulted in the rapid loss of the activities of photosystem I, photosystem II, and the Na+/H+ antiport system both in light and in darkness. However, $desA^{+}$ cells were more tolerant to salt stress and osmotic stress than the wild-type cells. The extent of the recovery of the various photosynthetic activities from the effects of 0.5 M NaCl was much greater in $desA^{+}$ cells than in wild-type cells. The photosystem II activity of thylakoid membranes from $desA^{+}$ cells was more resistant to 0.5 M NaCl than that of membranes from wild-type cells. These results demonstrated that the genetically engineered increase in unsaturation of fatty acids in membrane lipids significantly enhanced the tolerance of the photosynthetic machinery to salt stress. The enhanced tolerance was due both to the increased resistance of the photosynthetic machinery to the salt-induced damage and to the increased ability of $desA^{+}$ cells to repair the photosynthetic and Na+/H+ antiport systems.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

We hypothesized that the invader has higher resource capture ability and utilization efficiency than the natives. No differences were detected among the eight populations of B. davidii in any of the traits evaluated, indicating that the invader did not evolve during range expansion, thus providing support to the general-purpose genotype hypothesis.

Leaf nitrogen content was not significantly different between the invader and the natives, but the invader allocated more nitrogen to the photosynthetic machinery than the natives. The increased nitrogen content in the photosynthetic machinery resulted in a higher resource capture ability and utilization efficiency in the invader. At the same intercellular CO\u2082 concentration, $\\left( {P_{\\max } } \\right)$ was significantly higher in the invader than in the natives, again confirming the importance of the higher nitrogen allocation to photosynthesis.

Overexpression of syntaxin 3, but not of syntaxins 2 or 4, caused an inhibition of TGN to apical transport and apical recycling, and leads to an accumulation of small vesicles underneath the apical plasma membrane. All other tested transport steps were unaffected by syntaxin 3 overexpression. Botulinum neurotoxin E, which cleaves SNAP-23, and antibodies against \u03b1-SNAP inhibit both TGN to apical and basolateral transport in a reconstituted in vitro system. In contrast, we find no evidence for an involvement of N-ethyl maleimide-sensitive factor in TGN to apical transport, whereas basolateral transport is NSF-dependent. We conclude that syntaxin 3, SNAP-23, and \u03b1-SNAP are involved in apical membrane fusion. These results demonstrate that vesicle fusion with the apical plasma membrane does not use a mechanism that is entirely unrelated to other cellular membrane fusion events, but uses isoforms of components of the SNARE machinery, which suggests that they play a role in providing specificity to polarized membrane traffic.\n      </p>", "By using high-density oligonucleotide arrays, we profiled gene expression in reward-related brain regions of rats that developed escalated cocaine intake after extended access to cocaine (6 h per day). Rats allowed restricted daily access to cocaine (only 1 h) that displayed a stable level of cocaine intake and cocaine naive rats were used for controls. Four analysis methods were compared: Affymetrix MICROARRAY SUITE 4 and MICROARRAY SUITE 5, which use perfect-match-minus-mismatch models, and DCHIP and RMA, which use perfect-match-only models to generate expression values. Results were validated by RT-PCR in individual animals from an independent replication of the experiment. A small number of genes was associated with escalated cocaine intake (ESC genes). Unexpectedly, of the brain regions examined [prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, septum, lateral hypothalamus (LH), amygdala, and ventral tegmental area], the LH was the most transcriptionally responsive in escalation of cocaine intake. Most of the ESC genes identified are also expressed during synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity and include genes that code for several presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins involved in neurotransmission. These results suggest that LH intrinsic circuitry undergoes a structural reorganization during escalation of cocaine use. This remodeling of LH circuitry could contribute to the chronic deficit in reward function that has been hypothesized to drive the transition to drug addiction.

It has a discernible body of concepts, methods, and recognizable objects of analysis. More importantly, its considerable archive of accumulated findings has a very high degree of redundancy-in the positive sense that researchers have continually replicated the findings of their colleagues. It ought, then, in every respect, to be the envy of the social sciences generally and not easily dismissed as an abstruse and recondite branch of language studies or \"discourse analysis\" concerned with merely trivial fragments of recorded talk as such. To help CA be respecified in this way, the present paper unearths a relatively unknown part of its history in the partial book manuscript of Harvey Sacks's \"Aspects of the Sequential Organization of Conversation,\" circulated in mimeo to colleagues in 1970. There we find innumerable appeals to the now well-recognized fact that the practical actions of everyday talk have significant, culturewide, formal structures that are the proper objects of the discipline.

Although this process is generally conserved in eukaryotes, important differences in the molecular architecture of the DNA replication machine and the function of individual subunits have been reported in various model systems. We have combined genome-wide bioinformatic analyses of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa) with published experimental data to provide a comprehensive view of the core DNA replication machinery in plants. Many components identified in this analysis have not been studied previously in plant systems, including the GINS (go ichi ni san) complex (PSF1, PSF2, PSF3, and SLD5), MCM8, MCM9, MCM10, NOC3, POLA2, POLA3, POLA4, POLD3, POLD4, and RNASEH2. Our results indicate that the core DNA replication machinery from plants is more similar to vertebrates than single-celled yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), suggesting that animal models may be more relevant to plant systems. However, we also uncovered some important differences between plants and vertebrate machinery. For example, we did not identify geminin or RNASEH1 genes in plants. Our analyses also indicate that plants may be unique among eukaryotes in that they have multiple copies of numerous core DNA replication genes. This finding raises the question of whether specialized functions have evolved in some cases. This analysis establishes that the core DNA replication machinery is highly conserved across plant species and displays many features in common with other eukaryotes and some characteristics that are unique to plants.\n      </p>", "Transcription and splicing of messenger RNAs are temporally and spatially coordinated through the recruitment by RNA polymerase II of processing factors. We questioned whether RNA polymerase I plays a role in the recruitment of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing machinery. During Xenopus laevis embryogenesis, recruitment of the rRNA processing machinery to the nucleolar domain occurs in two steps: two types of precursor structures called prenucleolar bodies (PNBs) form independently throughout the nucleoplasm; and components of PNBs I (fibrillarin, nucleolin, and the U3 and U8 small nucleolar RNAs) fuse to the nucleolar domain before components of PNBs II (B23/NO38). This fusion process is independent of RNA polymerase I activity, as shown by actinomycin D treatment of embryos and by the lack of detectable RNA polymerase I at ribosomal gene loci during fusion. Instead, this process is concomitant with the targeting of maternally derived pre-rRNAs to the nucleolar domain. Absence of fusion was correlated with absence of these pre-rRNAs in nuclei where RNA polymerase II and III are inhibited. Therefore, during X. laevis embryogenesis, the recruitment of the rRNA processing machinery to the nucleolar domain could be dependent on the presence of pre-rRNAs, but is independent of either zygotic RNA polymerase I transcription or the presence of RNA polymerase I itself.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Retained transmembrane proteins are often sequestered into specialized ER subdomains, but the relevance of such sequestration to proteasomal degradation has not been explored. We used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a model ERAD substrate, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), to explore whether CFTR is sequestered before degradation, to identify the molecular machinery regulating sequestration, and to analyze the relationship between sequestration and degradation. We report that CFTR is seqyestered into ER subdomains containing the chaperone Kar2p, and that sequestration and CFTR degradation are disrupted in sec12&lt;sup&gt;ts&lt;/sup&gt; strain (mutant in guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for Sar1p), sec13&lt;sup&gt;ts&lt;/sup&gt; strain (mutant in the Sec13p component of COPII), and sec23&lt;sup&gt;ts&lt;/sup&gt; strain (mutant in the Sec23p component of COPII) grown at restrictive temperature. The function of the Sar1p/COPII machinery in CFTR sequestration and degradation is independent of its role in ER-Golgi traffic. We propose that Sar1p/COPII-mediated sorting of CFTR into ER subdomains is essential for its entry into the proteasomal degradation pathway. These findings reveal a new aspect of the degradative mechanism, and suggest functional crosstalk between the secretory and the degradative pathways.\n      </p>", "Components of the DNA replication machinery localize into discrete subnuclear foci after DNA damage, where they play requisite functions in repair processes. Here, we find that the replication factors proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and RPAp34 dynamically exchange at these repair foci with discrete kinetics, and this behavior is distinct from kinetics during DNA replication. Posttranslational modification is hypothesized to target specific proteins for repair, and we find that accumulation and stability of PCNA at sites of damage requires monoubiquitination. Contrary to the popular notion that phosphorylation on the NH2 terminus of RPAp34 directs the protein for repair, we demonstrate that phosphorylation by DNA-dependent protein kinase enhances RPAp34 turnover at repair foci. Together, these findings support a dynamic exchange model in which multiple repair factors regulated by specific modifications have access to and rapidly turn over at sites of DNA damage.\n      </p>", "The TATA box sequence in eukaryotes is located about 25 bp upstream of many genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and some genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III (Pol III). The TATA box is recognized in a sequence-specific manner by the TATA box-binding protein (TBP), an essential factor involved in the initiation of transcription by all three eukaryotic RNA polymerases. We have investigated the recognition of the TATA box by the Pol II and Pol III basal transcription machinery and its role in establishing the RNA polymerase specificity of the promoter. Artificial templates were constructed that contained a canonical TATA box as the sole promoter element but differed in the orientation of the 8-bp TATA box sequence. As expected, Pol II initiated transcription in unfractionated nuclear extracts downstream of the \"forward\" TATA box. In distinct contrast, transcription that initiated downstream of the \"reverse\" TATA box was carried out specifically by Pol III. Importantly, this effect was observed regardless of the source of the DNA either upstream or downstream of the TATA sequence. These findings suggest that TBP may bind in opposite orientations on Pol II and Pol III promoters and that opposite, yet homologous, surfaces of TBP may be utilized by the Pol II and Pol III basal machinery for the initiation of transcription.\n      </p>", "Ricardo is shown to be right that machinery can hurt wages and reduce output.

When the vibration response is driven predominantly by friction forces, rotordynamic stability becomes a serious issue. This paper introduces a theory for model-based verification of dynamic stability in rotor systems with stator contact and rub. Generalized multi-degree-of-freedom linear models of rotor and stator lateral vibration are considered, combined with contact models that account for finite clearance and Coulomb friction. State-space conditions for global stability as well as stability of contact-free synchronous whirl responses are derived using Lyapunov's direct method. This leads to feasibility problems involving matrix inequalities that can be quickly verified using numerical routines for convex optimization. Parametric studies involving flexible rotor models indicate that tight bounds on regions of stability can be obtained. A case study involving a realistic machine model illustrates how design optimization based on the theory might be used to overcome instability problems in real machines.\n      </p>", "The endosomal sorting complex ESCRT-III, which is formed by the structurally related CHMP proteins, is engaged by HIV-1 to promote viral budding. Here we show that progressive truncations into the C-terminal acidic domains of CHMP proteins trigger an increasingly robust anti-HIV budding activity. Together with biochemical evidence for specific intramolecular interactions between the basic and acidic halves of CHMP3 and CHMP4B, these results suggest that the acidic domains are autoinhibitory. The acidic half of CHMP3 also interacts with the endosome-associated ubiquitin isopeptidase AMSH, and the coexpression of AMSH or its CHMP3-binding domain converts wild-type CHMP3 into a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 release. Point mutations in CHMP3 that prevent binding to AMSH abrogate this effect, suggesting that binding to AMSH relieves the autoinhibition of CHMP3. Collectively, our results indicate that CHMP proteins are regulated through an autoinhibitory switch mechanism that allows tight control of ESCRT-III assembly.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Generating rosters for sugarcane harvesters manually is difficult because the mills have a large number of harvesters and tight capacities in the transportation facilities. The Cooperative Research Centre for Sustainable Sugar Production conducted a participatory research process with five mills in the Australian sugar industry to develop models to optimize harvester rosters. Embedded in the research process and underpinned by action learning was the development of a novel integer-programming model, its validation, and its implementation. The participatory research overcame barriers to implementation of the rosters produced by the model and allowed the five participating mills to realize benefits in terms of more efficient transport operations.\n      </p>", "Finn-Power Italia produces automated machines for sheet metal bending, which it sells in more than 60,000 configurations, obtained by combining several options. Furthermore, designers often modify the product. Bending machines can produce very different products, from baking ovens to panels for ventilation systems for cruise ships. We developed and implemented a method of using planning bills and product modularity to deal with high product variety and frequent modifications. Planning bills are an artificial grouping of components used to simplify forecasting and material planning.

Here a chimeric F box protein (CFP) was engineered to achieve selective eradication of pathogenic \u03b2-catenin in colorectal cancer. We show that CFP specifically searches for and subsequently links the abnormal \u03b2-catenin to the cellular SCF ubiquitination complex. Introduction of the CFP to colorectal cancer cells induced targeted ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation of nuclear and cytoplasmic free \u03b2-catenin while preserving its normal cellular adhesion counterpart.

Thus, dynamin may generate the motive force for contraction by filament sliding in dividing chloroplasts, in addition to pinching-off the membranes.\n      </p>", "We provide a systematic examination of the differences between Internet and in-person auction prices for used tractors. A hedonic model estimated with transactions pooled between eBay and in-person auctions reveals statistically distinct price surfaces for the two auction venues and predicts significantly lower prices for comparable equipment sold on eBay, though this difference is attenuated for tractors fully covered by eBay's buyer protection program and is fully absent for the most frequently traded tractor. An endogenous venue selection model reveals that larger, more valuable tractors from states with more valuable stocks of machinery are more likely to be offered on eBay.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
