{"total_words": 1001, "documents": ["Free-roaming cats (e.g., owned, semi-feral, and feral) impact wildlife worldwide through predation, competition, and disease transmission. Baseline ecological information necessary for population management is lacking. We radiocollared free-roaming cats (feral, n = 30; semi-feral, n = 14; owned, n = 10) in Caldwell, Texas, USA between October 2004 and November 2005 and compared population demographics among sex and ownership classification. We found ranges and movements declined across ownership classes whereas survival and fecundity increased. Our findings suggest that human interactions (e.g., feeding) may result in high, localized free-roaming cat densities, which may concentrate feral cat impacts and should be considered when evaluating population control strategies.\n      </p>", "Using indirect immunofluorescence assays, sera from cats in Zimbabwe (n = 119) and South Africa (n = 52) were found to contain antibodies reactive with Rickettsia conorii (34% and 19% respectively) and R. typhi (7% and 10% respectively). These results indicate that cats may become infected with members of the spotted fever and typhus groups of rickettsiae and that cats can, therefore, be used as indicators of the presence of these organisms.\n      </p>", "Activity patterns of free-ranging cats in Brooklyn, New York, varied with neighborhood, season, and hour of the night. Standardized partial-regression analysis identified temperature, humidity, precipitation, and hour as accounting for 32.6% of feral-cat activity. Cats in the area of private homes included free-ranging pets while those in the area of multiple dwellings were commonly feral. Regardless of neighborhood, nighttime activity was bimodal with peaks occurring at 0100 h and at sunrise. Activity levels declined throughout the autumn and increased in the spring.\n      </p>", "Recently, the domestic cat has been implicated in numerous outbreaks of Q fever in humans. To determine if cats in southern Africa are infected with the agent of Q fever we tested sera from cats in South Africa and Zimbabwe by indirect fluorescence for antibodies reactive with phase II Coxiella burnetii antigen (Nine Mile strain). Reactive antibodies were detected at titres of \u2265 1/40 in sera from cats in South Africa (1/52, 2%) and Zimbabwe (15/119, 13%). Our results indicate that cats in southern Africa are infected with C. burnetii and should be considered as sources of infection for humans.\n      </p>", "This study was undertaken to determine whether Haemobartonella felis (Mycoplasma haemofelis), the causative bacterial agent of feline infectious anemia, infects nondomestic cats. Routine complete blood count and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed to detect the gene for 16S ribosomal RNA for the organism. Sixty-four blood samples were collected from 54 nondomestic cats, including tigers (Panthera tigris), cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), lions (P. leo), mountain lions (Felis concolor), snow leopards (P. unica), and a jaguar (P. onca). Some cats were sampled on two or three different dates. Two tigers were positive for H. felis by PCR analysis. As previously described in domestic cats, the parasitemia appears to be intermittent in nondomestic cats.\n      </p>", "The formulation of diets that are both easily handled and nutritionally well balanced poses a problem in the feeding of performing exotic cats. This study was conducted to develop a diet suitable for this purpose. A literature search was conducted, and skeletal muscles from horses, dairy cattle, and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) were analyzed for macro- and micro-nutrients. Results from these analyses, together with information from the literature and data on various nutrient supplements, were entered into two computer-based animal diet evaluation programs. The most limiting nutrients in muscle were calcium and vitamins A, D, and E, but phosphorus, copper, manganese, and folacin also were deficient compared to estimates of nutrient requirements. Requirements for exotic cats were estimated from the National Research Council recommendations for growing domestic cats. The simplest diet created to meet these nutrient requirements was composed of horse meat, steamed bone meal, and the multi-vitamin--mineral supplements Centrum\u2122 or Sentral-Vite\u2122.\n      </p>", "Thirty-three captive leopard cats, Leopardus tigrinus, were anesthetized with xylazine (1\u20132 mg/kg) and ketamine (10 mg/kg), and electrocardiograph (ECG) tests were recorded in all leads with 1 cm = 1 mV sensibility and 25 mm/sec speed repeating DII lead at 50 mm/sec speed with the same sensibility. Results expressed by mean and standard deviation were: heart rate (HR) = 107 \u00b1 17 (bpm); P-wave = 0.048 \u00b1 0.072 (s) \u00d7 0.128 \u00b1 0.048 (mV); PR interval = 0.101 \u00b1 0.081 (s); QRS compound = 0.053 \u00b1 0.012 (s) \u00d7 1.446 \u00b1 0.602 (mV); QT interval = 0.231 \u00b1 0.028 (s); R-wave (CV6LL) = 1.574 \u00b1 0.527 (mV); R-wave (CV6LU) = 1.583 \u00b1 0.818 (mV); heart rhythm: normal sinus rhythm (15.2%), sinus rhythm with wandering pacemaker (WPM) (60.6%), sinus arrhythmia with WPM (24.2%); electric axis: between +30\u00b0 and +60\u00b0 (6.1%), +60 (6.1%), between +60\u00b0 and +90\u00b0 (57.6%), +90\u00b0 (9%), between +90\u00b0 and +120\u00b0 (21.2%); ST segment: normal (75.7%), elevation (18.2%), depression (6.1%); T-wave polarity (DII): positive (100%); T-wave (V10): absent (6.1%), negative (63.6%), positive (18.2%), and with interference (12.1%). Through ECG data comparison with other species, unique features of Leopardus tigrinus' (leopard cat) ECG parameters were detected. Some of the study animals presented with an R-wave amplitude that was indicative of left ventricle overload according to patterns for normal domestic cats (Felis cati). Echocardiographic exams revealed normal heart cavities' function and morphology. The aim of this study was to establish some electrocardiographic parameters of captive L. tigrinus.\n      </p>", "1. Introduced predators account for a large part of the extinction of endemic insular species, which constitutes a major component of the loss of biodiversity among vertebrates. Eradication of alien predators from these ecosystems is often considered the best solution. 2. In some ecosystems, however, it can generate a greater threat for endemic prey through what is called the `mesopredator release'. This process predicts that, once superpredators are suppressed, a burst of mesopredators may follow which leads their shared prey to extinction. 3. This process is studied through a mathematical model describing a three species system (prey-mesopredator-superpredator). Analysis of the model, with and without control of meso- and superpredators, shows that this process does indeed exist and can drive shared prey to rapid extinction. 4. This work emphasizes that, although counter-intuitive, eradication of introduced superpredators, such as feral domestic cats, is not always the best solution to protect endemic prey when introduced mesopredators, such as rats, are also present.\n      </p>", "Toxoplasma gondii oocysts are highly infective to intermediate hosts including humans, pigs, and mice, but are considered less infective for cats, the definitive host. To determine infectivity of T. gondii oocysts for cats, 20 2- to 3-mo-old T. gondii-free cats in groups of 4 were fed graded doses of oocysts estimated to have 1, 10, 100, 1,000, or 10,000 mouse infective oocysts of the VEG strain of T. gondii. Feces of cats were examined for at least 35 days after feeding oocysts. All cats were killed, necropsied, their sera were tested for T. gondii antibodies, and tissues were bioassayed in mice. Three of the 4 cats fed 10,000 oocysts, 3 of the 4 cats fed 1,000 oocysts, and 2 of the 4 cats each fed 100 oocysts shed 7.3-162 million T. gondii oocysts in their feces, with a prepatent period of 18-44 days. Based on bioassay and antibody production, all 4 cats fed 10,000 oocysts, 3 of 4 cats fed 1,000 oocysts, 2 of 4 cats fed 100 oocysts, and 0 of 8 cats fed 1 or 10 oocysts acquired T. gondii infection. Antibodies to T. gondii were detected by the modified agglutination test in all 9 bioassay-proven T. gondii-infected cats and in none of the 11 cats without demonstrable T. gondii. In a series of other experiments, the age of the cat at the time of oocyst feeding and the administration of corticosteroids were found to have no influence on the prepatent periods after ingestion of oocysts. A review of published and unpublished data indicated that the minimum prepatent period to shedding of oocysts after the ingestion of oocysts by cats is 18 days.\n      </p>", "Natural and experimental infections of cats with Dirofilaria immitis have been reported. Experimental infections of D. immitis in cats with the subsequent detection of microfilaremia and immediate skin hypersensitivity to antigen of D. immitis were produced. Cutaneous nodules and chylothorax were also detected in some infected cats. Adult worm recoveries were low and dead worms were found in some cats indicating the unsuitability of the cat as a host for D. immitis. However, one successful mosquito passage of D. immitis from a cat to a dog was accomplished.\n      </p>", "In contrast to small- and medium-sized seabirds, California Brown Pelicans are little affected in their nesting colonies by introduced small predators such as domestic cats and rats. Conflicts between small introduced mammals and smaller to medium-sized seabirds dictate nonetheless that control and eradication of such predators are highly desirable goals. In one unusual instance where cats regularly preyed-on nestling Brown Pelicans, this occurred only on the colony periphery. The few large pelican young taken by these cats represented, however, the largest prey item known to be taken by feral cats.\n      </p>", "Sporulated Hammondia hammondi oocysts were fed to 66 mice. Beginning the 1st day after feeding and continuing for 11 days, 6 mice were killed each day and fed to a different cat. Feces of cats fed mice were examined for oocysts. The first 9 cats, fed 6 mice each from day 1 to 9, did not shed oocysts within 50 days. Cats fed mice on days 10 and 11, shed H. hammondi oocysts after 6 days. These data indicate that tachyzoites are not infectious to cats and that the cysts are formed by the 10th day in mice fed oocysts. In other experiments, it was shown that in mice fed oocysts, H. hammondi occurred less frequently in the spleen, liver, lungs, and mesenteric lymph nodes than in the brain and muscle. Muscle was found to be more heavily infected than brain. Further, pregnant mice were fed H. hammondi oocysts and the mice delivered were raised by their mothers, weaned, and then fed to cats. The cats did not shed oocysts indicating the absence of congenital infection. H. hammondi oocysts were noninfectious to chickens.\n      </p>", "Antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii were determined in serum samples from 275 domestic cats from a mobile spay and neuter clinic from 8 counties in Ohio. The modified agglutination test incorporating whole formalinized tachyzoites and mercaptoethanol was used to determine antibodies. Antibodies to T. gondii were found in 133 (48%) out of 275 cats: in titers of 1:25 in 24, 1:50 in 37, and 1:500 or more in 72. The highest prevalence (62% of 78) was in outdoor cats. The prevalence of T. gondii antibodies in 48% of cats suggests widespread contamination of the rural environment with oocysts.\n      </p>", "The in-vivo interferon response of the cat was investigated, since this species suffers from several viral diseases that may be influenced by interferon. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic acid (poly 1:C) were used as stimulators of interferon. The interferon levels in serum were found to be markedly elevated in specific-pathogen-free cats within 6 hr after iv stimulation by NDV, as determined by protection against the CPE of vesicular stomatitis virus in cultures of Crandell feline kidney cells. Interferon in feline serum has characteristics similar to interferon produced by other species of animals. The interferon response of cats to poly I:C was irregular. The titers of interferon in serum were lower than those produced by NDV except when toxic doses of poly I:C were used. Poly I:C toxicity developed within a few hours after injection, with initial signs of mucoid diarrhea, weakness, and trembling followed by death or by gradual recovery requiring several days.\n      </p>", "Antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii were determined in serum samples of 502 domestic cats from Brazil by the modified agglutination test (MAT), using formalin-fixed whole tachyzoites and mercaptoethanol. Antibodies (MAT \u2265 1:20) were found in 132 (26.3%) of 502 cats. With respect to origin, antibodies were found in 26.7% of 430 stray cats from S\u00e3o Paulo, 10% of 40 stray cats from Guarulhos, and 40.6% of 32 cats from a cat breeder in S\u00e3o Paulo. Antibody titers were: 1:20 in 10 cats, 1:25 in 40 cats, 1:50 in 73 cats, and \u2265 1:500 in 9 cats. Exposure rates of T. gondii in cats from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil are similar to that in domestic cats in North America.\n      </p>", "The development of a European isolate of Echinococcus multilocularis was compared in cats and dogs at the end of the prepatent period. Echinococcus multilocularis established in all dogs and cats, but worm recovery was significantly greater from dogs than from cats. Overall, worms in cats were not as advanced as those in dogs in terms of development and maturation, but there was no evidence of retarded development or stunted forms. These results confirm that dogs are highly susceptible to E. multilocularis, whereas cats have lower and more variable recovery rates. However, because cats produce thick-shelled eggs of E. multilocularis after experimental and natural infections, they have to be regarded as potential sources of infection both for intermediate and accidental hosts, including humans. However, their general role in the epidemiology of the infection has yet to be determined.\n      </p>", "In the present study, each of 43 cats was fed with a single metacercaria of Paragonimus pulmonalis and 2 cats (controls) with 2 metacercariae. They were killed 22-372 days postinfection. In the test group, 18 (41.9%) cats were infected, as well as the 2 cats in the control group. Among the 18 worms recovered from the test group, 9 found in the lungs were mature, whereas 5 mature and 4 immature worms were in the pleural cavity. Most eggs from worms encased in a cyst were passed in the feces. However, eggs from worms in the pleural cavity were only found on the lung surface and pleural cavity. Mature worms in cysts seemed to exhibit higher egg production capacity than those in the pleural cavity. Paired mature worms from a cyst laid more eggs than a single encysted mature worm in vitro at room temperature.\n      </p>", "Cats that have shed Toxoplasma gondii oocysts are considered to be immune to reshedding of oocysts. To investigate if this immunity persists in cats for 6 yr, 12 4-6-mo-old cats without T. gondii antibodies were inoculated orally with tissue cysts of the ME-49 strain (6 cats) and the TS-2 strain (6 cats) of T. gondii. All of them shed \u226520 million oocysts between 4 and 13 days after feeding tissue cysts. Two cats became ill between 11 and 13 days after primary infection; 1 died on the 13th day, and the other had to be killed on the 1 lth day because of generalized acute toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasma gondii oocysts were not found on the hair of 10 cats examined 7 days after cats had shed millions of oocysts. On day 39 after primary infection, 5 cats (2 infected with the ME-49 strain and 3 infected with the TS-2 strain) were challenged orally with tissue cysts of the ME-49 strain. None of the challenged cats shed oocysts. One cat died due to causes unrelated to toxoplasmosis. Seventy-seven months after primary infection, the remaining 9 cats were challenged orally with tissue cysts of the P89 strain of T. gondii. Four of these 9 cats re-shed T. gondii oocysts; 3 of them had been challenged also at 39 days after primary infection. Two control cats housed together with chronically infected cats for 6 yr remained seronegative for T. gondii; both of these shed oocysts after challenge with the P89 strain.\n      </p>", "Normal and asymptomatic feline immunodeficiency virus (FlV)-infected adult cats were inoculated orally with Toxoplasma gondii tissue cysts to assess differences in clinical disease, T. gondii serologic test results, hematologic results, and oocyst shedding. There was no difference between FIV-naive and FIV-infected cats in terms of clinical illness and duration of oocyst shedding following primary exposure. Both groups of cats developed significant decreases in neutrophil counts following primary inoculation with T. gondii; FIV-infected cats that were neutropenic prior to inoculation with T. gondii developed the most profound decreases in neutrophil numbers. Both FIV-naive and FTV-infected cats became lymphopenic during acute T. gondii infection; however, only FIV-naive cats developed lymphocytosis in the recovery stage. FTV-infected cats had lower total CD4+ and higher total CD8+ T-lymphocyte counts than FTV-naive cats prior to inoculation with T. gondiit but changes in these lymphocyte subsets were similar between groups of cats during the first several weeks after inoculation. Toxoplasma gondii infection had neither an ameliorating nor enhancing effect on T-lymphocyte subset abnormalities in FIV-infected cats during acute or chronic infection. Both groups of cats developed comparable levels of T. gondii-specific IgM and IgG antibodies and T. gondii antigen-specific lymphocyte blastogenic responses following primary inoculation. Both groups of cats were fed T. gondii tissue cysts 66 wk following primary exposure and both groups were solidly immune as evidenced by a lack of oocyst shedding and only minor changes in IgM but not IgG antibodies.\n      </p>", "Infectivity of bradyzoites of the VEG strain of Toxoplasma gondii was compared in cats and mice. For this, tissue cysts were separated from brains of infected mice using a Percoll gradient, and bradyzoites were released by incubation in acidic pepsin solution. After filtration through a 3-\u00b5m filter, bradyzoites were counted and diluted 10-fold in RPMI tissue culture medium. Dilutions estimated to have 1, 10,100, and 1,000 bradyzoites were fed to cats and inoculated into mice, orally or subcutaneously (s.c). Three experiments were performed. In experiment 1, 2 of 2 cats fed 1,000 bradyzoites, 1 of 2 cats fed 100 bradyzoites, 1 of 4 cats fed 10 bradyzoites, and 1 of 4 cats fed 1 bradyzoite shed millions of oocysts; 1,000 bradyzoites were infective to all 4 inoculated mice s.c. but not to 4 mice inoculated orally, and 100 bradyzoites were infective to 2 of 4 mice injected s.c. but not to 4 mice inoculated orally. All 16 mice (8 oral, 8 s.c.) injected with 1 or 10 bradyzoites were negative for T. gondii. In experiment 2, 1 of 4 cats fed 10 counted bradyzoites shed oocysts; the same inocula were not infective to 4 mice injected s.c. In experiment 3, 3 of 4 cats fed 1,000 bradyzoites shed oocysts and the inocula were infective to 10 of 10 mice s.c. and 4 of 10 mice orally; 4 of 4 cats fed 100 bradyzoites shed oocysts and the inocula were infective to 6 of 10 mice s.c. and 0 of 10 mice orally; 10 bradyzoites were not infective to cats and mice. Results indicate that bradyzoites are more infective to cats than to mice, and cats can shed millions of oocysts after ingesting just a few bradyzoites.\n      </p>", "Cats naturally infected with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) develop an AIDS-like syndrome whereas experimentally infected cats do not. To investigate the role of cofactors in the development of this disease in cats, 7 specific pathogen-free (SPF) and 12 random-source (RS) cats were infected with FIV. Over 4 years, infected cats developed similar phenotypic and functional immune abnormalities characterized by early and chronic inversion of CD4\u207a:CD8\u207a cell ratios and significantly decreased mitogen responses compared with controls. Beginning 18-24 months after infection, 10 RS cats developed chronic clinical disease typical of feline AIDS, including stomatitis and recurrent upper respiratory disease; 4 SPF cats also developed chronic clinical disease, 2 with neurologic disease and 2 with B cell lymphomas. Thus, immunologic background is important in the type of disease that develops in cats infected with FIV, and FIV represents a promising animal model for studying the immunopathogenesis of AIDS in humans.\n      </p>", "Migration and development of Paragonimus kellicotti were studied in cats killed between 1 and 265 days after feeding 15-20 metacercariae from the hearts of naturally infected crayfish. Metacercariae excysted in the intestine and appeared in the peritoneal cavity within 24 hr. Some young flukes penetrated the diaphragm and migrated to the pleural cavity during the first week, but the majority penetrated the pleura between 10 and 14 days. No flukes were found in the pleural cavity after 23 days postinfection. By 4 weeks postinfection, the flukes were well established within lung parenchyma, mainly in the right caudal lobe, where most of their growth occurred. Eggs first were seen in flukes on the 34th day postinfection and in feces 2 days later. Estimated daily ova production ranged from 1,000 to 2,000 eggs/fluke/day.\n      </p>", "Observations are reported on the pairing of Paragonimus kellicotti Ward, 1908, in laboratory infections of 19 domestic cats. In four of six cases in which single metacercariae were fed 8 weeks previous to subsequent reexposure to another metacercaria, the worms were able to locate one another and become established in the lung cyst of the definitive host and the infections became patent. The role of pairing and the attraction between worms is discussed.\n      </p>", "As part of a long-term study on immunity to oocyst shedding, 12 4-6-mo-old cats were inoculated orally with tissue cysts of the ME-49 strain (6 cats) or the TS-2 strain (6 cats) of Toxoplasma gondii. Two cats fed the ME-49 strain died or were killed because of acute toxoplasmosis 12 and 13 days after inoculation (DAI), respectively. On day 39 after primary infection, 5 cats (2 infected with the ME-49 strain and 3 infected with the TS-2 strain) were challenged orally with tissue cysts of the ME-49 strain. One cat died following rechallenge infection due to causes unrelated to toxoplasmosis. Seventy-seven months after primary infection, the remaining 9 cats were challenged orally with tissue cysts of the P89 strain of T. gondii. Blood samples were obtained weekly or monthly and sera were analyzed for antibodies to T. gondii using the modified agglutination test (MAT), the Sabin-Feldman dye test (DT), and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for IgM (IgM-ELISA) or IgG (IgG-ELISA). The MAT was performed using both formalin-fixed (FF) and acetone-fixed (AF) tachyzoites. The MAT (FF) was the most sensitive test; cats seroconverted within 14 DAI and high titers (\u2265 10,000) persisted &gt;6 yr, although cats had no clinical signs. The MAT titers using the AF detected recent exposure and titers declined sharply after 2 mo postinoculation. DT and ELISA titers were lower and developed slower than MAT titers. Fluctuations in antibody titers were limited to 8-fold during the 6-yr observation period. Anamnestic serum antibody responses were seen in 2 cats after the final challenge, but not after first challenge.\n      </p>", "The movements of 10 house cats (4 desexed females, 5 desexed males and 1 intact male) living on the edge of a suburb adjoining grassland and forest/woodland habitat, and a neighbouring colony of seven farm cats, were examined using radio-telemetry over nine months. Nocturnal home range areas of the suburban cats varied between 0.02 and 27.93 ha (mean 7.89 ha), and were larger than diurnal home range areas (range 0.02 to 17.19 ha - mean 2.73 ha). Nocturnal home range areas of cats from the farm cat colony varied between 1.38 and 4.46 ha (mean 2.54 ha), and were also larger than diurnal home range areas (range 0.77 to 3.70 ha - mean 1.70 ha). Home ranges of cats in the farm cat colony overlapped extensively, as did those of cats living at the same suburban residence. There was no overlap of home ranges of female cats from different residences, and little overlap between males and females from different residences. Four of the suburban house cats moved between 390 m and 900 m into habitat adjoining the suburb. Polygons describing the home ranges of these animals were strongly spatially biased away from the suburban environment, though the cats spent the majority of their time within the bounds of the suburb. Movements further than 100-200 m beyond the suburb edge were always made at night. There is evidence that home range sizes and spatial movement patterns of house cats are largely determined by: a) the density and spatial distribution of cats utilising separate food resources, b) the personality and social dominance of individual cats, c) the location of favoured hunting and resting/sunning sites, and, d) barriers such as busy roads.\n      </p>", "The tachyzoite-induced cycle of Toxoplasma gondii was studied in 46 cats. Tachyzoites of the M-7741 or Me-49 strain of T. gondii were administered orally to cats by pouring into the mouth or by stomach tube, or by intraintestinal inoculation. Ten weaned cats that had been inoculated with tachyzoites directly in the intestine were killed 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, or 25 days later, and their tissues were studied histologically and bioassayed in mice. Toxoplasma gondii was demonstrable in the blood of 8 cats and in other tissues of all these 10. Four out of five 1- to 8-day-old cats fed tachyzoites by stomach tube became infected with T. gondii. and 1 became ill because of toxoplasmosis. All 19 weaned cats fed tachyzoites (poured into the mouth) became infected, and 6 died of acute toxoplasmosis 9-15 days after being fed T. gondii. Six out of 12 weaned cats fed tachyzoites by stomach tube became infected but were asymptomatic. Overall, 12 out of 26 cats observed for 19 days or more shed oocysts with a prepatent period (pp) of 19 days or more, with the sole exception of 1 cat that shed oocysts with a pp of 5 days. Enteroepithelial stages of T. gondii were not found in any cat before oocysts were shed. Cats shed up to 360 million oocysts in a day, and oocysts were shed for 4-6 days.\n      </p>", "In research facilities, cats are routinely ignored as a potential source of salmonella infection. Over a period of 18 months, 142 cats received from commercial vendors for use in research were screened for enteric Salmonella. Salmonella was isolated from 15 animals, an incidence of 10.6%. Five (29%) of the 17 shipments contained animals that were positive for Salmonella. The serotypes isolated were Salmonella derby, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella anatum, Salmonella enteritidis, and Salmonella bredeney.\n      </p>", "Cats are important in the epidemiology of Toxoplasma gondii because they are the only hosts that can excrete environmentally resistant oocysts. The prevalence of T. gondii was determined in 58 domestic cats from 51 homes from Santa Isabel do Ivai, Paran\u00e1 State, Brazil where a water-associated outbreak of acute toxoplasmosis had occurred in humans. Antibodies to T. gondii were found with the modified agglutination test in 49 of 58 (84.4%) cats at a serum dilution of 1:20. Tissues (brain, heart, and skeletal muscle) of 54 of these cats were bioassayed in T. gondii-free, laboratory-reared cats; T. gondii oocysts were excreted by 33 cats that were fed feline tissues. Brains from these 54 cats were bioassayed in mice; T. gondii was isolated from 7. Skeletal muscles and hearts of 15 cats were also bioassayed in mice; T. gondii was isolated from skeletal muscles of 9 and hearts of 13. The results indicate that T. gondii localizes in muscle tissue more than the brains of cats. In total there were 37 T. gondii isolates from 54 cats. Most isolates of T. gondii were virulent for mice. Genotyping of the 37 isolates of T. gondii, using the SAG2 locus, revealed that 15 isolates were type I and 22 were type III. The absence of type II genotype in cats in this study is consistent with the previous studies on T. gondii isolates from Brazil and is noteworthy because most T. gondii isolates from the United States are type II. These findings support the view that Brazilian and North American T. gondii isolates are genetically distinct. This is the first report of genotyping of T. gondii isolates from the domestic cat.\n      </p>", "To assess the possible role of the domestic cat as a source of human infection with Toxoplasma gondii, cats belonging to U. S. Forces families were obtained from installations in the Kanto Plain (Tokyo) area. A total of 90 cats of all ages were examined for serum antibodies by the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT), for tissue cysts by mouse inoculation, and for fecal oocysts by microscopic examination and mouse inoculation. Forty (44%) had antibodies to toxoplasma, and the organism was isolated from tissues of 11%. An isolation was made from feces of 1 adult cat. This indicates that domestic cats could be a significant source of soil contamination with infectious oocysts in U.

He took great pleasure in interacting with cats, observing their habits, and learning from their supple, graceful movements. In Chatography, Aron Vinegar studies the Ch\u00e2teau de Pierrefonds, restored in the mid-nineteenth century by Viollet-le-Duc, and argues that the crucial issues at stake in Viollet-le-Duc\u2019s understanding of restoration may be gleaned from his drawings of cats and war machines that demonstrate an interest in movement, unruly forces, and affect, rather than equilibrium and balance. This reading enables us to question the prevalent understanding of Viollet-le-Duc as a structural rationalist, and to appreciate the complex relation between architecture and representation.\n      </p>", "At various time periods after an initial exposure to 50 Brugia malayi larvae on one hind foot, cats were reexposed to an additional 50 larvae in one of 3 ways: on the previously infected limb only, on the contralateral, uninfected limb only, or on both hind limbs simultaneously. At the time of reexposure, uninfected controls were exposed to 50 larvae on one hind foot in a similar manner. From 2 to 4 weeks after reexposure to larvae, the cats were necropsied and the appropriate lymph nodes and vessels examined for adult or developing worms. An existing infection in one limb did not influence early migration or development of larvae introduced into the contralateral leg. Previous infection in the same limb did not consistently result in decrease in the number of developing larvae from the second exposure but did alter the distribution of larvae. In repeat infections, larvae were consistently located in a more distal area of the limb than were larvae from an initial infection at a comparable time.\n      </p>", "Extracts prepared from adult worms of Paragonimus kellicotti contain a minimum of five soluble precipitating antigens.

Fifteen cats, two African lions (Panthera leo), two Amur tigers (Panthera tigris altaica), one Amur leopard (Panthera pardus orientalis), two clouded leopards (Neofelis nebulosa), two caracals (Felis caracal), one bobcat (Felis rufus), and five fishing cats (Felis viverrinus), housed at Brookfield Zoo were fed nonirradiated and irradiated raw diets containing horse meat with cereal products and fortified with nutrients: Nebraska Brand Feline and/or Canine Diet (Animal Spectrum, North Platte, Nebraska 69103, USA). Baseline data were obtained during a 2-wk control period (nonirradiated diets), which was followed by a 4-wk period of feeding comparable irradiated diets. Feed intake and fecal consistency data were collected. An estimated radiation dose range of 0.5-3.9 kilograys reduced most microbial populations, depending on specific diet and microbe type. Irradiation had no overall effect on either feed consumption or fecal consistency in captive exotic cats, regardless of species, age, sex, or body mass. Data indicate that irradiation of frozen horse meat-based diets (packaged in 2.2-kg portions) result in microbial destruction in these products but that product storage time between irradiation and sampling may also affect microbial reduction. However, irradiation would be an appropriate method for reducing potentially pathologic bacteria in raw meat fed to exotic cats.\n      </p>", "Immunity to Toxoplasma gondii, as measured by oocyst shedding, was studied in cats. In 3 trials, 12 3-mo-old T. gondii-free cats were fed tissue cysts of the ME-49 strain of T. gondii. All cats shed T. gondii oocysts for approximately 1 wk starting 3-5 days after ingesting tissue cysts. One cat became ill because of toxoplasmic pneumonia and was killed 17 days after inoculation. The remaining cats remained clinically normal. Approximately 3 mo after primary infection, these 11 cats (immune) and 11 age-matched or littermate uninfected cats (nonimmune) were challenged orally with tissue cysts of the ME-49 strain. In trials 1 and 3, 1 immune and 1 nonimmune cat were killed at 36 hr, 60 hr, 5 days, and 12 days after challenge and the development of T. gondii in intestines was studied histologically; in trial 2, cats were killed at 36 hr, 60 hr, and 5 days only. None of the \"immune\" cats shed oocysts after challenge. Asexual T. gondii types were found at 36 and 60 hr and at 5 days, indicating partial development of T. gondii in the intestine of immune cats. There were no significant differences in lymphocyte CD4+/CD8+ from spleen, popliteal, and mesenteric lymph nodes of immune cats compared to nonimmune cats.\n      </p>", "Bartonella species are responsible for chronic bacteremia in domestic cats, which raises a question about the antiquity of the relationship between Bartonella species and cats that act as reservoirs for the organism. The sequencing of Bartonella pap31 and groEL genes from the dental pulp of cats dating from the 13th to 16th centuries identified the presence of B. henselae genotype Houston; the observation of a unique mutation in the results of PCR assays for Bartonella species ruled out modern DNA contamination of the dental pulp samples. We conclude that cats had bacteremia due to B. henselae 800 years ago.\n      </p>", "Antibodies to Neospora caninum and Sarcocystis neurona were determined in serum samples of 502 domestic cats from Brazil using direct agglutination tests with the respective antigens. Antibodies to S. neurona were not found in 1:50 dilution of any serum in the S. neurona agglutination test, suggesting that domestic cats from S\u00e3o Paulo city were not exposed to S. neurona sporocysts from opossums. Antibodies to N. caninum were found in 60 (11.9%) of 502 cats with titers of 1:40 in 36 cats, 1:80 in 18 cats, 1: 160 in 5 cats, and 1:800 in 1 cat using the Neospora agglutination test (NAT). Antibodies to N. caninum were confirmed by Western blotting in the sera of 10 cats with NAT titers of 1:80 to 1:800; this finding suggests that at least 10 cats had N. caninum-specific antibodies confirmed by 2 tests.

After either bilateral occipitotemporal lesions (with a split of the tectal commissure) or bilateral area 17, 18, and 19 lesions, the cats could see with each eye only from the midline to 90\u00b0 ipsilateral. A cat that became nearly totally blind as a result of bilateral occipitotemporal decortication had a subsequent tectal split which enabled it to see with each eye from the midline to 90\u00b0 ipsilateral.\n      </p>", "Eighteen 12-week-old specific pathogen-free cats, blood culture- and serum antibody-negative for Bartonella henselae, were randomly allocated to groups and were intravenously inoculated with $10^{10}$ (group 1), 10\u2078 (group 2), or 10\u2076 (group 3) B. henselae or with saline (group 4) or were not inoculated (group 5). Cats were humanely killed at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 weeks after inoculation. All B. henselae-inoculated cats were bacteremic by 2 weeks after infection. Bacteremia persisted until 32 weeks after infection in 1 cat. Cats in groups 1 and 2 had fever (&gt;39.7\u00b0C) and partial anorexia by 2 weeks after infection that lasted 2-7 days. All infected cats had Bartonella-specific IgM and IgG serum antibodies and lymphocyte blastogenic responses. Histopathologic lesions were observed in multiple organs of infected cats through 8 weeks after infection. Cats were readily infected with B. henselae by intravenous inoculation, developed histopathologic lesions that apparently resolved, and developed B and T lymphocyte responses to infection.\n      </p>", "A dose-response relationship was established in normal unanesthetized cats for emetic incidence, latency to onset of vomiting, and duration of emetic activity over a period of 24 h after whole-body exposure to &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt; Co radiation at selected doses between 7.5 and 90 Gy. Each episode of vomiting, i.e., retching and expulsion, was recorded oscillographically as its characteristic intrathoracic pressure waveform by means of a catheter inserted some days before into the superior vena cava. The \u03b3-radiation dose of 45 Gy evoked vomiting optimally with an incidence of 92% and an average onset time of 98 min. When administered to animals prepared chronically with surgical ablation of the area postrema, the same dose of radiation evoked vomiting in four of five test cases and with an average time to onset that was not by either measure significantly different from normal. Vomiting was also elicited in all of six normal cats exposed to an intestinal dose of 45 Gy X radiation with the head shielded. The same form of irradiation evoked vomiting in two of three chronically postremectomized cats. Successful ablation of the area postrema was determined functionally by emetic refractoriness to an injection of digitalis and confirmed for completeness by histological examination. It is concluded that the area postrema is not an essential element in the reflex mechanism of radiation-induced vomiting and, therefore, no physiological basis exists for dependence on a centrally acting chemogenic factor in radioemesis.\n      </p>", "Cats are essential in the life cycle of Toxoplasma gondii because they are the only hosts that can excrete the environmentally resistant oocysts in nature. Nothing is known of the prevalence of Toxoplasma gondii in cats from Sri Lanka. Serum samples from 86 cats from Colombo, Sri Lanka, were tested for antibodies to T. gondii using the modified agglutination test; antibodies were found in 26 (30.2%) cats with titers of 1:25 in 4, 1:50 in 4, 1:100 in 3, 1:400 in 2, 1:800 in 3, 1:1,600 in 4, and 1:3,200 or higher in 6 cats.

The presence of the earliest stages in 7 cats was tested in mice. The tissues of 25 cats were studied histologically; 17 were bioassayed by feeding them to cats to determine, by the length of the prepatent period, whether bradyzoites were present. Based on previous studies, a short (3-10 days) prepatent period indicated that bradyzoites were present in an oral inoculum and a long (&gt;21 days) prepatent period indicated the presence of tachyzoites only. Tissues from 14 cats were also bioassayed in mice for the presence of bradyzoites, using their resistance to pepsin as indicator. Six were studied by both methods. Based on these criteria, tachyzoites predominated in extraintestinal organs during the first 14 days after infection. They were found as early as 4 hr in mesenteric lymph nodes where their number reached 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; after 6 and 9 days; they were present after 1 day in all levels of the small intestine and after 6 days in the liver, lung, and blood. Bradyzoites were first detected 10 days after oocyst feeding; they predominated by the third week of infection and were present up to 41 days. Enteroepithelial stages were found histologically only in 2 cats, 24 and 41 days after inoculation. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that after feeding oocysts, T. gondii multiplies first as tachyzoites followed after 10-15 days by the development of bradyzoites in tissue cysts, which after variable intervals may initiate the enteroepithelial cycle.\n      </p>", "The major ways in which man acquires toxoplasmosis are through handling and consumption of raw meat and contact with feces (in litterpans and soil) from cats infected with Toxoplasma gondii. To prevent toxoplasmosis, certain steps should be taken. Meat should be heated throughout to 150 F (66 C) before consumption, and hands should be washed with soap and water after handling meat to remove any toxoplasma organisms contaminating the skin. Infection of indoor cats can be prevented by feeding them dry, canned, or boiled food and by restraining them from hunting. To the extent that diet cannot be controlled, an indoor cat's litterpan should be cleaned daily, feces should be flushed down the toilet, and the pan should be disinfected with boiling water. A person should wear disposable gloves while performing these tasks. Since soil contaminated by oocysts from T. gondii in feline feces is difficult to disinfect, contaminated sand in children's sandboxes should be disposed of, and gloves should be worn while one is working with soil that may contain feces from cats. Pregnant women should avoid cats whose source of food is unknown and should not empty litter pans, as toxoplasmosis can be transmitted to infants in utero.\n      </p>", "Spinal cord damage in neonatal cats has different effects on different spinal pathways. Corticospinal projections exhibit anatomical plasticity, forming an aberrant pathway that bypasses the lesion. In contrast, brainstem-spinal pathways undergo massive retrograde degeneration. Neither of these responses occurs in adult cats. Sparing of motor function is found in cats operated on as neonates but not in cats operated on as adults, and appears to depend on the plasticity of the corticospinal tract.\n      </p>", "Corticosteroids were administered to produce Pneumocystis carinii infection in cats. Six of 10 cats, injected intramuscularly for 97-141 days with 2 mg/cat twice weekly of betamethasone sodium phosphate, developed a light infection with P. carinii. Six of 7 cats, injected intramuscularly for 11-168 days with 10-25 mg/cat weekly of prednisolone acetate, also developed a light infection with P. carinii. There was no significant difference in the infection rate between the sexes and ages of the cats. Using Giemsa staining and Gomori's methenamine silver nitrate stain, P. carinii organisms were indistinguishable morphologically from human and rat P. carinii. The cysts and trophozoites were usually present singly or in small groups, and they always were adhering to the periphery of alveoli. The inflammatory changes were inconspicuous except for the fact that alveolar macrophages often were seen. Corticosteroid-treated cats should be useful in the study of experimental P. carinii infection. This is the first reported case of experimentally induced P. carinii infection in cats.\n      </p>", "Cat exposure has been directly associated with the development of human Bartonella henselae infections, resulting in cat-scratch disease, bacillary angiomatosis, or bacteremia. The prevalence of serum antibody titers to B. henselae was determined for selected pet cats from 33 geographic locations throughout the United States and several areas in western Canada. Seroprevalences paralleled increasing climatic warmth (P &lt;.02) and annual precipitation (P &lt;.03). These warm, humid areas with the highest seroprevalence would also have the highest number of potential arthropod vectors. The southeastern United States, Hawaii, coastal California, the Pacific Northwest, and the south central plains had the highest average prevalences (54.6%, 47.4%, 40.0%, 34.3%, and 36.7%, respectively). Alaska, the Rocky Mountain-Great Plains region, and the Midwest had low average prevalences (5.0%, 3.7%, and 6.7%, respectively). Overall, 27.9% (175/628) of the cats tested were seropositive. The seroprevalence of B. henselae in cats varies throughout the United States and appears to be influenced by climate.\n      </p>", "Congenital deafness results in abnormal synaptic structure in endings of the auditory nerve. If these abnormalities persist after restoration of auditory nerve activity by a cochlear implant, the processing of time-varying signals such as speech would likely be impaired. We stimulated congenitally deaf cats for 3 months with a six-channel cochlear implant. The device used human speechprocessing programs, and cats responded to environmental sounds. Auditory nerve fibers exhibited a recovery of normal synaptic structure in these cats. This rescue of synapses is attributed to a return of spike activity in the auditory nerve and may help explain cochlear implant benefits in childhood deafness.\n      </p>", "Five neonatal Pallas' cats (Otocolobus manul) at the Oklahoma City Zoo died from toxoplasmosis with concurrent herpesvirus infection. These multiple infections suggested underlying immunodeficiency, perhaps caused by concurrent infection with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV); so blood samples were collected for serology, serum protein electrophoresis, lymphocyte proliferation assays, and cytokine analysis by reverse transcriptase--quantitative competitive polymerase chain reaction (RT-qcPCR). Resulting data were compared with data from FIV-infected and control domestic short-haired cats. In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures were propagated to detect FIV virus by both RT-qcPCR and detection of reverse transcriptase activity. Serum protein electrophoresis showed that four of six Pallas' cats had increased alpha\u2082 globulins. At least two Pallas' cats had decreased lymphoproliferation responses to mitogen, and all three tested animals exhibited defective interleukin-12 gene expression. Although these clinical and laboratory findings suggested an immunodeficiency syndrome, FIV infection could not be confirmed. On the basis of repeated blood test results, it can be concluded that nutritional, metabolic, or other systemic problems probably did not contribute to the disease syndrome. Further investigation of other possible causes of immunodeficiency, including a possible genetic component, in this population is needed.\n      </p>", "Development of immunity to the shedding of oocysts was examined in 75 kittens that survived infection with the three stages of Toxoplasma gondii. Of 16 kittens fed bradyzoites in cysts, 94% were immune and did not shed oocysts. Of seven injected with tachyzoites 86% were immune. Of 18 fed sporozoites only 11% were immune, but following injection, 54% of 12 were immune. After the administration of either bradyzoites or tachyzoites from nonoocyst-producing strains, only 9% of 22 were immune. Considering all inocula, immunity was present in 93% of kittens that had previously shed oocysts, 25% of those that only develop antibody, and none that had neither shed nor developed an antibody titer. After a second challenge with a different isolate, a similar percentage of immunity was observed. Infection with killed tachyzoites, alone, or together with Freund's complete or incomplete adjuvants was followed by immunity in only one of 24 kittens. Eighty-five percent of 13 kittens were immune, after they had been treated prophylactically with 200 mg/kg monensin, or 60 mg/kg cat sulfadiazine combined with 1 mg/kg cat of pyrimethamine; oocyst shedding had been suppressed in all. It is concluded that cats can be immunized against oocyst shedding by infections where oocysts are produced, or where developmental stages are suppressed by chemoprophylaxis, but not if entero-epithelial stages are absent, as in the oocyst-less strain examined.\n      </p>", "In many studies of the mammalian brain, subjective assessments of connectivity patterns and connection strengths have been used to subdivide the cortex into separate but linked areas and to make deductions about the flow of information through the cortical network. Here we describe the results of applying statistical analyses to quantitative corticocortical connection data, and the conclusions that can be drawn from such quantitative approaches. Injections of the tracer WGA-HRP were made into different visual areas either side of the middle suprasylvian sulcus (MSS) in 11 adult cats. Retrogradely labelled cells produced by these injections were counted in selected coronal sections taken at regularly spaced intervals (1 mm) through the entire visual cortex, and their cumulative sums and relative proportions in each of 16 recognized visual cortical areas were computed. The surface dimensions of these areas were measured in each cat, from contour lines made on enlarged drawings of the same sections. A total of 116 149 labelled neurons were assigned to all visual cortical areas in the 11 cats, with 5212 others excluded because of their uncertain location. The distribution of relative connection strengths, that is, the percentage of labelled cells per cortical area, was evaluated using non-parametric cluster analyses and Monte Carlo simulation, and relationships between connection strength and area size were examined by linear regression. The absolute size of each visual cortical area was uniform across individual cats, whereas the strengths of connections between the same area pairs were extremely variable for injections in different animals. The overall distribution of labelling strengths for corticocortical connections was continuous and monotonic, rather than inherently clustered, with the highest frequencies presented by the absent (zero density) and the very-low-density connections. These two categories could not, on analytical grounds, be separated from each other. Thus it seems that any subjective description of corticocortical connectivity strengths by ordinal classes (such as 'absent','weak','moderate' or 'strong') imposes a categorization on the data, rather than recognizes a structure inherent in the data themselves. Despite the great variability of connections, similarities in the distribution profiles for the relative strengths of labelled cells in all areas could be used to identify clusters of different injection sites in the MSS. This supported the conclusion that there are four connectionally distinct subdivisions of this cortex, corresponding to areas 21a, PMLS and AMLS (in the medial bank) and to area PLLS (in the lateral bank). Even for tracer deposits in the same cortical subdivision, however, the strength of connections projecting to the site from other cortical areas varied greatly across injection in different individual animals. We further demonstrated that, on average, the strength of connections originating from any given cortical area was positively and linearly correlated with the size of its surface dimensions. When analysed by specific injection site location, however, this relationship was shown to hold for the individual connections to the medial bank MSS areas, but not for connections leading to the lateral bank area. The data suggest that connectivity of the cat's visual cortex possesses a number of uniform global features, which are locally organized in such a way as to give each cortical area unique characteristics.\n      </p>", "Background. In vitro data suggest that innate immune function in human immunodeficiency virus type 1infected patients is compromised; however, in vivo studies are lacking. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection in cats provides an excellent model to explore innate immune function in vivo. The innate response against Listeria monocytogenes is well understood, making it a useful immune probe. Methods. Recombinant L. monocytogenes carrying eukaryotic expression plasmids for feline tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-10, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, and IL-15 were created to determine whether specific cytokines would modulate innate immune function. L. monocytogenes was delivered subcutaneously, and local lymph nodes were evaluated for size, cell subpopulations, and L. monocytogenes burden. Two months later, memory responses were evaluated by IFN-\u03b3 enzyme-linked immunospot assay. Results. FIV-positive cats had significantly less lymph-node enlargement and a greater L. monocytogenes burden than FIV-negative control cats. TNF-\u03b1 improved listericidal activity in FIV-negative control cats but not in FIVpositive cats, whereas IL-10 modestly reduced function in FIV-negative control cats. IFN-\u03b3 improved memory responses but not clearance of L. monocytogenes. IL-15 improved innate function in FIV-positive cats and increased the percentage of natural killer cells. Conclusions. Lentivirus infection impairs innate immune function in vivo, and IL-15 can significantly restore function. We hypothesize that altered dendritic-cell function and increased regulatory T cell activity may underlie the innate immune defect in HIV infection.\n      </p>", "The objective was to develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of Cryptosporidium parvum IgG in the serum of cats. The ELISA was an indirect ELISA using soluble C. parvum oocyst antigens and a peroxidase-labeled anti-feline IgG secondary antibody. Sera from cats with Toxocara felis, Giardia spp., Aelurostrongylus abstrusus, Isospora felis, Isospora rivolta, Toxoplasma gondii, or Taenia spp. infections were assayed in specificity studies. Following optimization, the ELISA and fecal examination for oocysts were performed on samples from 170 client-owned or humane society source cats and 1 cat inoculated orally with C. parvum oocysts. Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts were detected in feces (4/170; 2.4%), and C. parvum IgG was detected in serum (26/170; 15.3%) from naturally exposed cats. The seroprevalence data suggest that some cats in the geographical area studied were exposed to C. parvum, but persistent oocyst shedding was less common. The ELISA is not useful for predicting oocyst shedding in individual cats.\n      </p>", "Spondyloarthropathy was documented for the first time in 14 (3.7%) of 386 large cats, affecting eight species belonging to three genera. The limited distribution of joint erosions, associated with spine and sacroiliac joint pathology, was indistinguishable from that occurring in humans with spondyloarthropathy of the reactive type. This form of inflammatory arthritis is almost twice as common as osteoarthritis (for fields as a whole), and animal wellbeing may be enhanced by its recognition and by initiation of specific treatment.\n      </p>", "Transitional cell carcinomas (TCC) of the urinary bladder were diagnosed in four related fishing cats (Prionailurus viverrinus). The major clinical sign in each case was persistent hematuria unresponsive to medical therapy. Cystotomy and biopsy provided an antemortem diagnosis in three of the fishing cats before euthanasia because of progression of clinical signs. The diagnosis was made in the fourth cat after euthanasia because of renal failure. Hematuria improved temporarily in one of the cats diagnosed antemortem and treated with piroxicam and carboplatin. Attempts to isolate a herpesvirus in two of the cats failed. Histopathologic appearance of the TCC was similar to that described for other species. TCC metastasis to the lungs was noted at necropsy in one cat; metastatic disease was not noted in the other fishing cats on gross or histopathologic examination. TCC of the urinary bladder appears to be more prevalent in fishing cats than in other species of domestic or nondomestic felids.\n      </p>", "Dogs and cats are susceptible to experimental plague. Both species demonstrate bacteremia due to Yersinia pestis, formerly known as Pasturella pestis, as a result of the infection and thus may serve as the source of an infectious blood meal for fleas. The suppurating lesions developed by the cat indicate that there may be some risk of mechanical plague infection for those handling such animals. Despite this, the risk of infection of human beings due to contact with cats and dogs infected with plague is considered minimal. For the first time it has been experimentally established that, irrespective of the mode of infection, cats and dogs develop antibodies of high titer to the specific Fraction I antigen of Y. pestis. Such antibodies persist for at least 300 days in the sera of cats and dogs. The frequency with which such specific antibodies to Y. pestis can be detected in the sera of dogs that live in epidemic and natural plague foci indicates that serologic tests of canine sera for antibody to the plague bacterium should be an integral part of every survey and surveillance program.\n      </p>", "In congenitally deaf cats, the central auditory system is deprived of acoustic input because of degeneration of the organ of Corti before the onset of hearing. Primary auditory afferents survive and can be stimulated electrically. By means of an intracochlear implant and an accompanying sound processor, congenitally deaf kittens were exposed to sounds and conditioned to respond to tones. After months of exposure to meaningful stimuli, the cortical activity in chronically implanted cats produced field potentials of higher amplitudes, expanded in area, developed long latency responses indicative of intracortical information processing, and showed more synaptic efficacy than in na\u00efve, unstimulated deaf cats. The activity established by auditory experience resembles activity in hearing animals.\n      </p>", "In two experiments cats acquired a stimulus-controlled approach or avoidance response by observational or conventional shaping procedures. Observer cats acquired the avoidance response (hurdle jumping in response to a buzzer stimulus) significantly faster and made fewer errors than cats that were conventionally trained. Observer cats acquired the approach response (lever pressing for food in response to a light stimulus) with significantly fewer errors than cats that were conventionally trained. In some cases, observer cats committed one or no errors while reaching criterion.\n      </p>", "Thousands of pet cats die each year with dilated cardiomyopathy, the cause of which is unknown. Although taurine is present in millimolar concentrations in the myocardium of all mammals, taurine depletion has not previously been associated with a decrease in myocardial function in any species. In this study, low plasma taurine concentrations associated with echocardiographic evidence of myocardial failure were observed in 21 cats fed commercial cat foods and in 2 of 11 cats fed a purified diet containing marginally low concentrations of taurine for 4 years. Oral supplementation of taurine resulted in increased plasma taurine concentrations and was associated with normalization of left ventricular function in both groups of cats. Since myocardial concentrations of taurine are directly related to plasma concentrations and low plasma concentrations were found to be associated with myocardial failure in cats, a direct link between decreased taurine concentration in the myocardium and decreased myocardial mechanical function is proposed.\n      </p>", "Similar to human immunodeficiency virus, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) induces immunodeficiency and enhanced susceptibility to secondary pathogens. To explore cytokine alterations in lentivirus immunodeficiency, constitutive mRNA expression was measured in lymph nodes of healthy and FIV-infected cats before and after challenge with Toxoplasma gondii. Cytokine mRNA expression was similar in control and FIV-infected cats during the first 10 weeks after infection. At 16 weeks, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and interleukin (IL)-IO mRNA were increased in FIV-infected cats. Challenge with T. gondii induced an increase in IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-12 in the lymph nodes of control cats, whereas IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 but not IL-2 or IL-12 increased in the lymph nodes of FIV-T. gondii coinfected cats. These results indicate that FIV immunodeficiency may derive from a failure to generate an IL-12-dependent type 1 response and that an elevated level of IL-10 mRNA expression is a predictor of lentivirus immunodeficiency.\n      </p>", "Sarcocystis inuris, obtained from laboratory and house mice, was transmitted experimentally to cats. When cysts in the skeletal muscle of mice were ingested by cats, bradyzoites developed directly into gametes in the intestinal mucosa of the cats. After five to 11 days, infectious sporulated sporocysts (8.5 \u00d7 10.3 [im) were shed by cats for up to three months. After ingestion of the sporocysts, S. muris multiplied first in the livers and then in the skeletal muscle of mice. Cysts in skeletal muscle attained a length of 5-6 mm and were visible to the naked eye. With heavy infections the cysts outlined major muscle groups. Lesions in mice were apparently the result of degeneration or rupture of cysts, with myositis and sometimes muscle necrosis, leading to locomotor impairment in heavy infection. S. muris required approximately 76 days of development in mice before becoming infectious for cats. S. muris is perpetuated by an obligatory two-host cycle (mouse-cat). Both cats and mice could be infected repeatedly. Rats, hamsters, and guinea pigs did not become infected.\n      </p>", "For determination of the importance of several factors affecting the vestibular toxicity of gentamicin in cats, several therapeutic regimens, routes of administration, and levels of dosage were examined. Cats were given high levels of gentamicin daily and observed for appearance of ataxia and impairment of the righting reflex. The time of appearance of ataxia was related to dosage. Death, attributed to renal toxicity, closely follows the appearance of ataxia after a dose of 60 mg/kg per day. At lower doses, there is a temporal separation between vestibular and renal toxicity. The renal damage is reversible, but the vestibular damage is not. Total dosage and duration of treatment appear to be more important factors than peak levels of drug in the serum with reference to time of appearance of ataxia at the dosage levels studied.\n      </p>", "The cellular responses of 8 kittens (4 inoculated orally with mouse brains containing Toxoplasma gondii cysts and 4 uninfected controls) were studied. Oocyst numbers, body weight, and rectal temperature were monitored daily. Blood was collected weekly for serology and mononuclear cell purification. At necropsy, peritoneal and alveolar macrophages, spleen, and lymph node cells were harvested. Infected cats shed oocysts 4-15 days postinfection, maintained normal body weight and rectal temperature, and developed anti-T. gondii immunoglobulin M and G. Infected cats had normal surface immunoglobulin-positive cell populations and peripheral blood lymphocyte functions. The infected cats differed in their cellular responses from control cats in that they developed circulating T. gondii antigen-specific lymphocytes, had increased interleukin 1 secretion by monocytes, had spleen and lymph node cells with depressed mitogenic responses and interleukin 2 production, and had macrophages with enhanced abilities in preventing the intracellular proliferation of T. gondii. Overall, the primary response of the cat to an infection with T. gondii appeared similar to that of other hosts.\n      </p>", "Adult cats were trained to discriminate between erect and inverted triangles after simultaneous ablation of cortical areas 17, 18, and most of 19 of both hemispheres. Postoperative training proceeded through a graded series of similar triangle pairs in which the members of each pair were equated for luminous flux.\n      </p>", "Cats are important in the epidemiology of Toxoplasma gondii because they are the only hosts that excrete environmentally resistant oocysts in feces. In the present study, hearts, serum, and feces from 36 feral cats from Addis Ababa area, Ethiopia, were examined for T. gondii infection. Antibodies to T. gondii were determined with the modified agglutination test (MAT, cutoff 1:25); 33 cats were seropositive. Hearts of all 36 cats were homogenized, digested in pepsin, and bioassayed in mice. Feces were examined for T. gondii oocysts by bioassay in mice. Viable T. gondii was isolated from heart of 26 by bioassay in mice and from 25 seropositive and 1 seronegative cats. Toxoplasma gondii was isolated from feces (oocysts) by bioassay in mice. In total, viable T. gondii was isolated from 27 of the 36 cats, and these isolates were designated TgCatEt1 to TgCatEt27. The high prevalence of T. gondii oocysts in feces of 8 (19.4%) of 36 cats is of high epidemiologic significance. This is the first report of isolation of viable T. gondii from any host in Ethiopia.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "Toxoplasma gondii and Bartonella spp. are zoonotic pathogens of cats. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLv) are related to human immunodeficiency virus and human leukemia virus, respectively, and these viruses are immunosuppressive. In the present study, the prevalence of antibodies to T. gondii, Bartonella spp., FIV, as well as FeLv and Dirofilaria immitis antigens was determined in sera from feral cats (Felis catus) from Cairo, Egypt. Using a modified agglutination test, antibodies to T. gondii were found in 172 (95.5%) of the 180 cats with titers of 1:5 in 9, 1:10 in 9, 1:20 in 3, 1:40 in 5, 1:80 in 5, 1:160 in 15, 1:320 in 22, and 1:640 or higher in 104. Thus, 57.4% had high T. gondii titers. Antibodies to Bartonella spp. were found in 105 (59.6%) of 178, with titers of 1:64 in 45, 1:128 in 39, 1:256 in 13, 1:512 in 3, 1:1,024 in 4, and 1:2,048 in 1 cat. Antibodies to FIV were detected in 59 (33.9%) of 174 cats. Of 174 cats tested, antigens to FeLv, and D. immitis were detected in 8 (4.6%) and 6 (3.4%) cats, respectively. The results indicate a high prevalence of T. gondii, Bartonella spp., and FIV infections in cats from Cairo, Egypt. This is the first report of Bartonella spp., and D. immitis infection in cats in Egypt.\n      </p>", "Feline asthma syndrome, previously recognized only in domestic cats, was diagnosed in three captive African lions (Panthera leo), one of which died as a result of the condition. Two of the lions displayed progressive signs for 7 yr, including severe bouts of coughing, wheezing, dyspnea, rhonchi, and tachypnea that were most severe during the spring and summer, and the third lion displayed acute signs only once. Scattered to diffuse increased interstitial markings, peribronchial cuffing, and focal atelectasis were visible in radiographs. At necropsy, multiple subpleural bullae, 2-3 cm in diameter, were scattered throughout the lung tissue. There were thick-walled bronchi and bronchioles filled with thick grayish mucus, and alveolar spaces were enlarged with severe, diffuse, banded multifocal areas of alveolar wall fibrosis. The lions had significantly elevated IgE type I immediate hypersensitivity responses to recognized aeroallergens. The captive management of lions should address the design and maintenance of allergen-free air supplies. Ventilation systems should be examined routinely and thoroughly cleaned of any residue. The frequency of examination should increase during the summer. Lions and other large cats should be routinely screened for IgE aeroallergen-specific titers, asthma cases should be treated promptly with prednisolone, and investigations of etiology should be initiated.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "To test if hematopoiesis can be maintained by the sequential activation of stem-cell clones, we performed autologous marrow transplantations with limited numbers of cells in cats heterozygous for the X chromosome-linked enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and observed the G6PD phenotypes of erythroid and granulocyte/macrophage progenitors over time. The animals were the female offspring of Geoffroy male and domestic female cats. In repeated studies of marrow from control animals (n = 5) or experimental animals prior to transplantation (n = 3), the percent of progenitors with domestic-type G6PD did not vary. After transplantation, the peripheral blood counts, marrow morphologies, frequencies of progenitors, and progenitor cell cycle kinetics returned to normal. However, abrupt and significant fluctuations were seen in the G6PD type of progenitors from each cat during the 1-1.5 years of observation. These data cannot be explained if there were either a large or constant population of active stem cells and thus imply, in a large-animal system, that hematopoiesis was maintained through clonal succession. A stochastic model was developed to estimate the numbers of active clones and their mean lifetimes.\n      </p>", "1. Introduced rabbits are known to have catastrophic effects on oceanic islands, either by direct destruction of the vegetative cover, or by the resulting disturbance of indigenous vertebrates. 2. Another dramatic effect, less well known, but potentially of major importance, is the hyperpredation process. This process, related to apparent competition, predicts that an introduced prey species, well adapted to high predation pressure, could induce the extinction of an indigenous prey, through the sudden increased population size of an introduced predator. In many island ecosystems, the simultaneous presence of introduced feral cats and rabbits is thus potentially a further threat for small vertebrates endemic of these islands. 3. Through a mathematical model, we tested this hypothesis, using a tri-trophic system comprising an indigenous prey (birds), an introduced prey (rabbits) and an introduced predator (cats), and we demonstrated the theoretical existence of the hyperpredation process. 4. In addition, the numerical analysis of the model allowed a quantification of this process. It shows that the conditions required for an indigenous species to cope with the hyperpredation process imply very high intrinsic growth rates and/or carrying capacity, as well as behavioural anti-predator response to the introduced predator. Since these conditions are unlikely to be met, this process is a further potential threat to most indigenous vertebrate prey. 5. Finally, our model shows that, although it can be induced by both types of adaptation together or alone, behavioural adaptations alone are more powerful in generating the hyperpredation process, than are life history traits adaptations.\n      </p>", "Relaxin, a 6-kDa polypeptide hormone, is excreted in the urine during pregnancy in several mammalian species. A recent study showed that detection of urinary relaxin using a bench-top serum assay (Witness\u00ae relaxin kit, Synbiotics Corp., San Diego, California 92127, USA) can be diagnostic for pregnancy in domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus), but it is unknown whether the bench-top kit is applicable with urine across felid species. Our objectives were to 1) examine modifications in urine processing to improve kit reliability in pregnant cats, 2) evaluate the impact of concentrating urine via filtration on relaxin detection, 3) assess the effect of sample freezing on relaxin concentrations, and 4) begin quantifying urinary relaxin levels in nondomestic felids. Urine and serum were collected from domestic cats and nondomestic cat species (Pallas' cat, Otocolobus manul; sand cat, Felis margarita; cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus; and lion, Panthera leo) at several times after breeding. Urine samples, subjected to various processing methods, were tested using the bench-top kit, and relaxin levels were later quantified via radioimmunoassay. For domestic cat urine samples, filtration and addition of protein/phosphate buffer improved the consistency of the relaxin kit for early pregnancy diagnosis. Urine freezing caused a slight (\u223c13%) but significant decrease in relaxin concentrations, but frozenthawed samples still tested positive with the bench-top kit. In nondomestic felids, urinary relaxin immunoreactivity during pregnancy was similar to or higher than that of pregnant domestic cats, suggesting that relaxin is a reliable cross-species marker of pregnancy. Urinary relaxin was detectable using the bench-top kit in pregnant Pallas' cats, but urine samples from other species tested negative, regardless of processing methods. Findings suggest that measurement of urinary relaxin is a promising approach for noninvasive pregnancy diagnosis in exotic felids, but further assessment of urinary relaxin profiles among cat species and modification of the bench-top relaxin kit are warranted to improve cross-species utility.\n      </p>", "Young cats were infected with Brugia malayi by administering 50 to 105 infective larvae to puncture wounds on the volar surface of one rear foot. At various times from 3 days to 69 weeks after exposure to the infective larvae, the animals were killed and the number and location of developing and mature worms recorded. Soon after infection a large proportion of the larvae could be recovered in the popliteal node. As the infection progressed, a substantial number of larvae left the popliteal lymph node and migrated distally in the lymphatic vessels toward the foot where infection had been initiated. In no instance was any appreciable migration to other body sites, including other lymph nodes, seen. In cats killed 7 weeks or longer after infection, 36 to 84% of the infecting dose was recovered at necropsy. The significance of these findings as they pertain to drug efficacy studies is discussed.\n      </p>", "Cats are important in the epidemiology of Toxoplasma gondii because they are the only hosts that excrete environmentally resistant oocysts in feces. In the present study, 115 viable T. gondii isolates from tissues of cats from Egypt were genotyped using 10 PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism markers (SAG1, SAG2, SAG3, BTUB, GRA6, c22-8, c29-2, L358, PK1, and Apico) and DNA from tachyzoites. Seven genotypes were recognized including the clonal Type II, Type III (2 genotypes), and 4 atypical genotypes. Ninety percent (103 of 115) of isolates were clonal, i.e., Type II (n = 61) and Type III (n = 42) strains. Of the 61 Type II strains, all had the Type II alleles at all loci, except for 2 strains that had al\u00edele I at Apico. Eight isolates were divided into 4 atypical genotypes. One of these genotypes (with 4 isolates) was previously reported in dogs from Sri Lanka and in sand cats from the United Arab Emirates. Four isolates had mixed infections. These results revealed a strong clonal population structure with the dominance of clonal Type II and III lineages of T. gondii in feral cats from Egypt.\n      </p>", "A collection (164) of isolates of Bordetella bronchiseptica made predominantly from cats (132) but also from dogs (15), pigs (12) and other species was examined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis following macrorestriction digestion with XbaI. Each isolate was analysed twice and the patterns were entirely reproducible. The isolates fell into 17 different strains (&gt; 3 bands different) and within strains there were numerous subtypes. Feline isolates fell into 12 of the 17 strains. In general, cats housed together had similar or identical strains and subtypes of B. bronchiseptica. There was no difference in the PFGE patterns of isolates made from carrier cats and those from cats with respiratory disease. Isolates from pigs and dogs were in general similar to the feline isolates and there was no great evidence for species specificity. The PFGE pattern of feline and canine isolates were more related to whether the animals were housed together rather than whether they came from dogs or cats.\n      </p>", "Histoplasma capsulatum was isolated from 22 of 50 cats and from 22 of 50 dogs obtained from Loudoun County, Virginia. Histoplasma was isolated most frequently from the cervical and peribronchial lymph nodes of both cats and dogs. Dissemination of the organism, as indicated by multiple positive cultures from numerous tissues, was present in 8 cats and 9 dogs, though none of these animals was considered to be clinically ill with histoplasmosis. Only one cat had a positive skin test. None of the cat serums had agglutinins for collodion particles sensitized with histoplasmin or complement-fixing antibodies for the whole yeast phase antigen of H. capsulatum. No characteristic gross or histopathological lesion was associated with isolation of H. capsulatum from the cats. Histoplasma was not found in histologic sections from any of the cats. Fourteen dogs had positive skin tests, 27 dogs had agglutinin titers of 1:20 or higher for collodion particles sensitized with histoplasmin, and 15 dogs had complement-fixation titers of 1:15 or higher for the whole yeast phase antigen of H. capsulatum. Neither the skin test nor either of the serologic tests gave a good index of whether or not H. capsulatum could be isolated from the dog. A variety of intrapulmonary and peribronchial lymph node lesions were found, but it was not established whether any of these lesions were caused by H. capsulatum. Histoplasma was found in histologic sections from 8 of the SO dogs. The organism was demonstrated in sections from 7 of these 8 dogs only by the use of a stain for polysaccharide. The limitations of the methods used for skin tests, serologic tests, and for obtaining cultures for fungi from animal tissues are discussed.\n      </p>", "Over a 34-mo period we studied 51 patients with Q fever and 102 control subjects (with various lower-respiratory-tract infections) who were matched for age, sex, and time of onset of infection. By univariate analysis (not adjusted for multiple comparisons), cases differed significantly from controls in the following activities: working on a farm; slaughtering or dressing animals; and contact with cats, cattle, and sheep. The strongest association was with exposure to stillborn kittens-11 of 51 cases vs. none of 102 controls (P &lt; .00000)-and with exposure to parturient cats (odds ratio, 10.3; 95% confidence interval, 3.5-31.8). Exposures to newborn animals (chiefly kittens) and stillborn kittens were significant risk factors by multivariate analysis, as were rural residence and slaughtering or dressing animals. In 13 Q fever incidents following exposure to parturient cats, 80 people became ill, 52 of whom had serological evidence of recent Coxiella burnetii infection (most of the others were not tested).\n      </p>", "Cats are pivotal in the transmission of Toxoplasma gondii. To develop a sensitive and specific serodiagnostic method for feline toxoplasmosis, surface antigen 2 (SAG2) of T. gondii was expressed in Escherichia coli and its diagnostic potential evaluated in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The ELISA with recombinant SAG2 (rSAG2) was able to differentiate very clearly between sera from cats experimentally infected with T. gondii and sera from normal cats. Serum samples collected from domestic cats in Japan were investigated by the ELISA, and the results were compared with those of a commercially available latex agglutination test (LAT) kit. Of the 192 samples screened, 42 (21.9%) were positive by ELISA. Among the 42 ELISA-positive samples, 39 were positive by LAT. There was a significant correlation between ELISA and LAT titers. All the 150 ELISA-negative samples were negative by LAT. These results indicate that the ELISA with rSAG2 expressed in E. coli should be a useful method for detection of T. gondii infection in cats.\n      </p>", "Cats are important in the epidemiology of Toxoplasma gondii because they are the only hosts that excrete environmentally resistant oocysts in feces. In the present study, 158 feral cats from Giza, Egypt, were examined for T. gondii infection. Antibodies to T. gondii were found in 97.4% with the modified agglutination test. Viable T. gondii was isolated from tissues (brain, heart, tongue) of 115 of 137 cats by bioassay in mice. These isolates were designated TgCatEg 1-115; none of these isolates was virulent to out-bred Swiss Webster mice. Of the 112 seropositive cats whose tissues were bioassayed individually, T. gondii was isolated from the hearts of 83 (74.1%), tongues of 53 (47.3%), and brains of 36 (32.1%). Toxoplasma gondii oocysts were not detected in rectal contents of any of the 158 cats, probably related to high seropositivity (chronic infection) of cats surveyed. The high prevalence of T. gondii in feral cats in Egypt reported here indicates a high environmental contamination with oocysts.\n      </p>", "Stilbazium iodide, which was effective against the mouse pinworm Syphacia obvelata, was tested against three species of hookworms, three of roundworms, and one of whipworm in 120 dogs and cats. Two or three 25 mg base/kg doses removed most Ancylostoma caninum, A. tubaeforme, Uncinaria stenocephala, Toxocara canis, and T. cati, but Toxascaris leonina was more resistant. The drug is active against Trichuris vulpis in dogs when it is given in courses of 3 to 6 doses of 25 mg base/kg or higher. Two or more courses may be necessary for puppies and for dogs having narrow cecal openings or extensively coiled ceca. Except for five dogs with atypical ceca, 24 of 29 dogs given these multiple doses averaged over 90% elimination of whipworms, with 18 of the 24 having complete clearance. Vomiting is negligible in these animals provided the dose is less than 50 mg base/kg. This compound is in human clinical trial against hookworms, ascaris, whipworms, and pinworms.\n      </p>", "Most isolates of Toxoplasma gondii can be grouped into 3 genetic lineages. In the present study, 67 isolates of T. gondii were obtained by bioassay in mice inoculated with brains and hearts of 96 asymptomatic chickens from an area highly endemic to human infection in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Of the 48 isolates genotyped using the SAG2 locus, 34 (70%) were of type I and 13 (27%) were of type III. No isolate of type II was recovered. Isolates from 1 chicken contained a type I and type III mixed infection, indicating natural multiparasite infection in the same animal. Cats fed mice infected with 11 type I strains shed 19-535 million oocysts in their feces, indicating that type I isolates can circulate in the environment.\n      </p>", "The CATS portfolio strategy is used to predict the stock performance of industry groups in the aftermath of macroeconomic shocks (tax reform, inflation, trade bills, etc.). Industries are classified into two basic groups--those with high sensitivity to a tax on capital (HC) and those with low sensitivity (LC). Each classification is further divided into two groups--industries that have the stronger attributes of their category (HCI and LCI) and those with the weaker attributes (HCII and LCII). The market may be divided into cycles according to the impact of a given macroeconomic shock. In high-CATS cycles, HC industries may be expected to outperform the overall market; in a low-CATS cycle, LC industries should outperform the market. Over the 21 years from 1965 through 1985, 41 of the 63 industries classified as HC outperformed the market by a statistically significant amount in high-CATS cycles or underperformed the market by a statistically significant amount in low-CATS cycles. Nineteen of the 35 LC industries had statistically significant results consistent with CATS expectations. Results were even stronger when applied exclusively to the HCI and LCI industries. Results indicate that differential performance between LC and HC industries tends to hold up even in declining markets. Thus, while the optimal strategy would be to be fully invested in Treasury bills during some cycles, portfolio managers constrained from doing so could still use the CATS strategy to identify industries that are likely to outperform the stock market (if not T-bills).\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "Cross-breeding between wild and free-ranging domestic species is one of the main conservation problems for some threatened species. The situation of wildcats (Felis silvestris silvestris) in Europe is a good example of this critical phenomenon. Extensive hybridization was described in Hungary and Scotland, contrasting with occasional interbreeding in Italy and Germany. First analyses in Portugal revealed a clear genetic differentiation between wild and domestic cats; however, four hybrids were detected. Here, we extended the approach to Iberian Peninsula using multivariate and Bayesian analyses of multilocus genotypes for 44 Portuguese wildcats, 31 Spanish wildcats and 109 domestic cats. Globally, wild and domestic cats were significantly differentiated ($F_{\\text{ST}}=0.20,p&amp;lt;0.001$) and clustered into two discrete groups. Diverse clustering methods and assignment criteria identified an additional hybrid in Portugal, performing a total of five admixed individuals. The power of admixture analyses was assessed by simulating hybrid genotypes, which revealed that used microsatellites were able to detect 100, 91 and 85% of first-generation hybrids, second-generation genotypes and backcrosses, respectively. These findings suggest that the true proportion of admixture can be higher than the value estimated in this study and that the improvement of genetic tools for hybrids detection is crucial for wildcat conservation.\n      </p>", "We used radio-telemetry and collar-mounted activity sensors to compare home range size, habitat use, and activity patterns of owned and unowned free-roaming cats on the outskirts of Champaign -Urbana, Illinois, USA. Owned cats (3 M, 8 F) had smaller home ranges than unowned cats (6 M, 10 F), but we failed to detect consistent differences in home range size between the sexes or among seasons. Home ranges of unowned cats included more grassland and urban area than predicted based on availability in all seasons, and farmsteads were selected in fall and winter. Within home ranges, unowned cats shifted their use of habitats among seasons in ways that likely reflected prey availability, predation risk, and environmental stress, whereas habitat use within home ranges by owned cats did not differ from random. Unowned cats were more nocturnal and showed higher overall levels of activity than owned cats. Space use and behavioral differences between owned and unowned cats supported the hypothesis that the care a cat owner provides influences the impact a cat has on its environment, information that is important for making decisions on controlling cat populations.\n      </p>", "Similar to human immunodeficiency virus type 1, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) replicates in the thymus of infected animals, causing marked alteration in thymic lymphocyte subpopulations. The immune phenotype and cytokine patterns in the thymus and secondary lymphoid tissues of FIV-infected cats were investigated. FIV infection caused an acute-stage transient reduction in CD4CD8 double-positive thymocytes, a marked increase in CD8 single-positive thymocytes, and formation of thymic B cell lymphoid follicles. Interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and interleukin (IL)-10 mRNA were up-regulated in both the thymus and lymph nodes of FIV-infected cats. Analysis of purified CD4 and CD8 cells revealed that CD4 cells produced most of the IL-10, whereas IFN-\u03b3 was produced by both subsets. Quantitative-competitive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that thymocytes, especially CD4CD8 thymocytes, had much greater levels of gag mRNA than did lymph node T cells. Thus, overexpression of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 is a feature of the thymus and secondary lymphoid tissues of FIV-infected cats.\n      </p>", "1. Because predators threaten the survival of endangered prey in many places, predator management is a widespread conservation tool. At the same time, the effects of predators on their prey are greatly influenced by landscape structure. Therefore, the management of landscapes could be an alternative to predator regulation. 2. A spatially explicit presence/absence model (a stochastic one-layer cellular automaton) was used to investigate two different predator-prey systems that were subject to changes in the number and size of habitat patches in a model landscape. 3. The first scenario included grey-sided voles Clethrionomys rufocanus, Norwegian lemmings Lemmus lemmus and small mustelids (stoats Mustela erminea and weasels M. nivalis) interacting in a tundra landscape. In the second scenario, the effect of habitat perforation by human settlements with subsidized predators (house cats Felis silvestris catus) on the dynamics of lemmings (as surrogate for endangered prey) was studied. 4. Both the total area of lemming habitat and the degree of fragmentation were important determinants of the population size and persistence of lemmings. A qualitative change in the effect of fragmentation was observed when the area of lemming habitat decreased from 70% (positive effect) to 50% (negative effect). When lemming habitat covered 50% or less of the landscape, fragmentation had a negative effect on lemming population size and viability, even though habitat area did not decrease. 5. The spatial configuration of settlements as predator sources was important. A few evenly spaced predator sources had less negative effect on lemming populations than the same proportion of predator habitat that was randomly distributed, which in turn had less effect than many evenly spaced patches. 6. Including predator management in the model did not decrease the predators' negative impact on the population size and persistence of the endangered prey when settlements occurred in many small patches. 7. It is concluded that predator management is not a viable strategy to combat the threat to the survival of endangered prey, but that careful planning of landscape pattern could compensate for negative predation effects. The location and size of patches of predator habitat should be optimized in order to minimize the negative effects of predators visiting adjacent areas of natural habitat.\n      </p>", "The CATS (capital tax sensitivity) approach to portfolio selection calls for switching between stocks in response to macroeconomic events that affect the relative rates of taxation on labor and capital. The Fat CATS approach combines the mechanical trading rules of the CATS approach with expert investment advice to signal switches between stocks and Treasury bills and, within stocks, between companies with high sensitivity to taxes on capital and those with low sensitivity. Hypothetical results obtained with the Fat CATS strategy are encouraging. The Fat CATS approach outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in 16 of 21 years between 1965 and 1985. The average annual rate of return on the Fat CATS portfolio over this period was 13.2 per cent. One dollar invested according to the Fat CATS strategy in January 1965 would have grown to $12.59 by December 1984. Over that period, the same investment in the S&amp;P 500 would have grown to only $1.86.\n      </p>"], "words": {"routinely": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "background": {"number": 1,
