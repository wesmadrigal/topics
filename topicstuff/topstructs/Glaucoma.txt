Although the treatment of extreme levels of high intraocular pressure (p &gt; 35 mm) reduces the risk of glaucoma it is not known if the treatment of mild and moderate intraocular pressure prevents the onset of glaucoma. A bibliographic search in Medline CD-ROM was performed from 1967 to 1995, as well as in SIGLE CD-ROM. The keywords used were 'glaucoma prevention' and 'glaucoma suspects'. After the search 18 papers which treated moderate and mild intraocular pressure were selected. Of all these papers, those that used the same methodology; randomization and timolol as treatment, were chosen. The possibility of publication bias was controlled by plotting effect size vs. number of papers, as well as effect size vs. year of publication. A meta-analysis using two methods, weighted zetas and adding zetas, was performed. The combined effect size was -6.25%, and the weighted effect size was -6.45%. We computed the pooled z by two methods: adding Zs and adding weighted Zs. The Z obtained by adding Zs has a value of 2.31120 p = 0.0177, one tail). Using the method of adding weighted Zs we obtained a value of 2.4201 (p = 0.0082, one tail). Our results show that the treatment with timolol of patients with mild and moderate intraocular pressure may help to prevent the onset of glaucoma.\n      </p>", "Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the major type of glaucoma. To discover genetic markers associated with POAG, we examined a total of 1,575 Japanese subjects in a genome-wide association study (stage 1) and a subsequent study (stage 2). Both studies were carried out at a single institution. In the stage 1 association study, we compared SNPs between 418 POAG patients and 300 control subjects. First, low-quality data were eliminated by a stringent filter, and 331,838 autosomal SNPs were selected for analysis. Poorly clustered SNPs were eliminated by a visual assessment, leaving 255 that showed a significant deviation (P &lt; 0.001) in the al\u00edele frequency comparison. In the stage 2 analysis, we tested these 255 SNPs for association in DNA samples from a separate group of 409 POAG and 448 control subjects. High-quality genotype data were selected and used to calculate the combined p values of stages 1 and 2 by the Mantel-Haenszel test. These analyses yielded 6 SNPs with p &lt; 0.0001. All 6 SNPs showed a significant association (P &lt; 0.05) in stage 2, demonstrating a confirmed association with POAG. Although we could not link the SNPs to the annotated gene(s), it turned out that we have identified 3 genetic loci probably associated with POAG. These findings would provide the foundation for future studies to build on, such as for the metaanalysis, to reveal the molecular mechanism of the POAG pathogenesis.\n      </p>", "Study objective-The aim was to examine a possible association of amount of sunshine and risk for acute closed angle glaucoma. Design-This was a retrospective analysis of hospital discharge registry data, linked to meteorological data for the same period. Setting-The study was a national survey using hospital discharge data for the whole of Finland over a 10 year period. Participants-All subjects with the acute closed angle glaucoma diagnosis from the hospital discharge registry were collected for the years 1972 to 1982. A total of 1796 patients were found. Measurements and main results-Meteorological data from two cities in Finland, Helsinki and Oulu, were collected for the same years from the Finnish Meteorological Institute. A peak incidence of acute closed angle glaucoma was noted whenever the number of hours without sunshine increased. A regression analysis including incidence of acute closed angle glaucoma as a dependent variable, and sex, mean temperature, mean air pressure, mean humidity, total amount of rain per month, and mean sunshine hours as independent variables, was constructed. Sex and sunshine hours best explained the variation in incidence in a covariate model. No other meteorological variate could improve the model fit. Conclusions-The result confirms that the number of hours without sunshine is positively associated with the incidence of acute closed angle glaucoma, when other meteorological variables are controlled for.\n      </p>", "Objectives. The authors identify demographic and clinical characteristics associated with noncompliance in patients beginning medical therapy for the treatment of glaucoma in a managed care setting. Methods. The authors describe a retrospective cohort study in a group-model health maintenance organization in Massachusetts. Patients were members of the health maintenance organization who were newly initiated on topical drug therapy to treat open-angle glaucoma during the period January 1, 1987 through December 31, 1990, who met eligibility requirements, and who had evidence of health services utilization for a 12-month follow-up period. For all study subjects, we determined the number of days without available therapy for glaucoma during the 12-month period. Study subjects who did not fill prescriptions adequate to provide medication to cover at least 80% of days during the study period were considered noncompliant. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess demographic and clinical factors independently associated with noncompliance among patients initiated on medical therapy for the treatment of glaucoma. Results. Of 616 subjects who met inclusion criteria, 152 (24.7%; 95% confidence interval, 21.3%-28.1%) met the study definition for noncompliance. These patients had an average number of days without therapy during the 12-month study period of 103.9 \u00b1 70.0 days compared with 6.8 \u00b1 19.5 days for those categorized as compliant. Of a variety of selected demographic and clinical characteristics, having fewer visits with an ophthalmologist during the study period (&lt;2) was most strongly related to noncompliance (odds ratio 2.99; 95% confidence interval 2.03, 4.40). There were no differences in average intraocular pressure between the compliant and noncompliant groups during the study period. Conclusions. Noncompliance with prescribed medical therapy for glaucoma was found to be common in a managed care setting characterized by essentially unrestricted access to health care and medications. It remains difficult to identify noncompliant patients based on demographic and clinical characteristics. The use of automated prescription data to identify noncompliant patients is feasible in large managed health care insurance programs where such data are collected routinely for administrative purposes.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Radiographic abnormalities included osteolysis of the scleral ossicles in both eyes and ossicle separation in the left eye. Because of severe debilitation and a poor prognosis for rehabilitation, the bird was euthanized. Pathologic diagnoses included pyogranulomatous endophthalmitis, scleral ossicle osteomyelitis, splenic lymphoid depletion, and long bone osteomyelitis.

Methods In a cross-sectional study of patients with colorectal cancer (N = 162), glaucoma (N = 100), rheumatoid arthritis (N = 168), systemic sclerosis (N = 56) and systemic lupus erythematosus (N = 56), we assessed specific disease severity and used the Symptom Distress Checklist (SCL-90) for psychologic dimensions. Outcome was assessed with the WHO Quality of Life Instrument, Short Form using hierarchical regression to determine independent correlates of HRQOL. Results After adjustment for demographic features, stage of cancer and pain (final models), the SCL-90 somatization score was the only psychologic distress covariate significantly correlated to physical HRQOL in all diseases (Betas between \u20130.33 and \u20130.49) except in systemic sclerosis and scleroderma, where depression was also a correlate. In glaucoma patients, the SCL-90 somatization score was the only significant covariate for physical HRQOL in the final model. Conclusions Since reported number of bodily symptoms is both associated with physical HRQOL and treatable in its own right, our findings suggest a possible new avenue to improve the HRQOL in patients with chronic physical disease. Whether this offers greater benefit than treatments for anxiety and depression needs further research.\n      </p>", "Objective Open angle glaucoma is one of the most common causes of blindness in industrialised nations. Treatments to lower ocular pressure are widely used in glaucoma prevention and treatment, despite conflicting evidence. Design We performed meta-analyses to reassess the effectiveness of pressure lowering treatment to delay the development of glaucoma in ocular hypertension, as well as progression of manifest open angle glaucoma. Data sources Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Selection of studies Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials with a concurrent untreated control group and information on time to glaucomatous changes to visual field and optic disc. Trial reports were reviewed independently by two investigators in an unblinded standardised manner. Results Meta-analysis of trials in ocular hypertension showed a significant preventive effect of reducing intraocular pressure on progression to glaucoma (hazard ratio 0.56, 95% confidence interval 0.39 to 0.81, P = 0.01; number needed to treat 12). Pooled data of studies in manifest glaucoma showed a significant delay of visual field deterioration (0.65, 0.49 to 0.87, P = 0.003; NNT = 7), with subgroup analysis showing a larger effect in patients with raised pressure and a reduced effect in normal tension glaucoma (subgroup comparison: not significant). Conclusions Lowering intraocular pressure in patients with ocular hypertension or manifest glaucoma is beneficial in reducing the risk of visual field loss in the long term.\n      </p>", "The effect of different educational methods on the proportion of appointments broken by clients in a glaucoma screening program at the White Memorial Medical Center in Los Angeles, Calif., was tested. A total of 186 clients suspected of having glaucoma were randomly assigned to one of four educational methods. Each method was presented by the same nurse on an individual basis, in a private room, uninterrupted by intrusions. The four methods were: (a) minimal information method, (b) intensive indepth method, (c) facilitating or \"problem-solving\" method, and (d) control or no-information method. These four methods were also contrasted with the traditional referral method, in which a secretary interpreted test results to the patient and made return appointments in a busy office subject to normal interruptions without using any planned educational presentations. No statistically significant differences were found in the rates of broken appointments among patients exposed to the four educational methods. A statistically significant difference, however, was found between clients exposed to the four educational methods and clients exposed to the traditional referral method. This difference possibly resulted from the manner of presenting the information rather than from what the patients were told. The crucial elements of personal attention and \"tender loving care\" were apparently inherent in the four educational methods but missing in the highly impersonal, hastily conducted referral.\n      </p>", "The development of the devastating neurodegenerative condition, Alzheimer's disease, is strongly associated with amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) deposition, neuronal apoptosis, and cell loss. Here, we provide evidence that implicates these same mechanisms in the retinal disease glaucoma, a major cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, previously associated simply with the effects of intraocular pressure. We show that A\u03b2 colocalizes with apoptotic retinal ganglion cells (RGC) in experimental glaucoma and induces significant RGC apoptosis in vivo in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We demonstrate that targeting different components of the A\u03b2 formation and aggregation pathway can effectively reduce glaucomatous RGC apoptosis in vivo, and finally, that combining treatments (triple therapy) is more effective than monotherapy. Our work suggests that targeting the A\u03b2 pathway provides a therapeutic avenue in glaucoma management. Furthermore, our work demonstrates that the combination of agents affecting multiple stages in the A\u03b2 pathway may be the most effective strategy in A\u03b2-related diseases.\n      </p>", "Objective To evaluate whether \u03b2 radiation may offer a practical method of improving surgical success for glaucoma drainage surgery in South Africa. Design Double blind, randomised controlled trial. Setting Three public hospitals in South Africa. Participants 450 black Africans with primary glaucoma. Interventions Trabeculectomy with 1000 cGy \u03b2 radiation or standard trabeculectomy without \u03b2 radiation (placebo). Main outcome measures Primary outcome measure was surgical failure within 12 months (intraocular pressure &gt; 21 mm Hg while receiving no treatment for ocular hypotension). Secondary outcomes were visual acuity, surgical reintervention for cataract, and intraoperative and postoperative complications. Results 320 people were recruited, \u03b2 radiation was given to 164; 20 (6%) were not seen again after surgery. One year after surgery the estimated risk of surgical failure was 30% (95% confidence interval 22% to 38%) in the placebo arm compared with 5% (2% to 10%) in the radiation arm. The radiation group experienced a higher incidence of operable cataract (18 participants) than the placebo group (five participants; P = 0.01). At two years the estimated risks with placebo and \u00e2 radiation were, respectively, 2.8% (0.9% to 8.3%) and 16.7% (10.0% to 27.3%). Conclusion \u03b2 radiation substantially reduced the risk of surgical failure after glaucoma surgery. Some evidence was, however, found of an increased risk for cataract surgery (a known complication of trabeculectomy) in the \u03b2 radiation arm during the two years after surgery. Trial registration ISRCTN62430622.\n      </p>", "The development of the anterior segment of the mammalian eye is critical for normal ocular function, whereas abnormal development can cause glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness in the world. We report that orphan G protein-coupled receptor 48 (Gpr48/LGR4) plays an important role in the development of the anterior segment structure. Disruption of Gpr48 causes a wide spectrum of anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD), including microphthalmia, iris hypoplasia, irdiocorneal angle malformation, cornea dysgenesis, and cataract. Detailed analyses reveal that defective iris myogenesis and ocular extracellular matrix homeostasis are detected at early postnatal stages of eye development, whereas ganglion cell loss, inner nuclear layer thinness, and early onset of glaucoma were detected in 6-month-old &lt;tex-math&gt;$Gpr48^{-/-}$&lt;/tex-math&gt; mice. To determine the molecular mechanism of ASD caused by the deletion of Gpr48, we performed gene expression analyses and revealed dramatic down-regulation of Pitx2 in homozygous knockout mice. In vitro studies with the constitutively active Gpr48 mutant receptor demonstrate that Pitx2 is a direct target of the Gpr48-mediated cAMP-CREB signaling pathway in regulating anterior segment development, suggesting a role of Gpr48 as a potential therapeutic target of ASD.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Analyses of sequence tagged site (STS) content and haplotype sharing between families affected with chromosome 1q-linked open angle glaucoma (GLC1A) were used to prioritize candidate genes for mutation screening. A gene encoding a trabecular meshwork protein (TIGR) mapped to the narrowest disease interval by STS content and radiation hybrid mapping. Thirteen glaucoma patients were found to have one of three mutations in this gene (3.9 percent of the population studied). One of these mutations was also found in a control individual (0.2 percent). Identification of these mutations will aid in early diagnosis, which is essential for optimal application of existing therapies.\n      </p>", "Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma causes loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and damage to the optic nerve. Although IOP is controlled pharmacologically, no treatment is available to restore retinal and optic nerve function. We evaluated the effects of NGF eye drops in a rat model of glaucoma. We also treated 3 patients with progressive visual field defects despite IOP control. Glaucoma was induced in rats through injection of hypertonic saline into the episcleral vein. Initially, 2 doses of NGF (100 and 200 \u00b5g/mL) were tested on 24 rats, and the higher dose was found to be more effective. Glaucoma was then induced in an additional 36 rats: half untreated and half treated with 200 \u00b5g/mL NGF QID for 7 weeks. Apoptosis/survival of RGCs was evaluated by histological, biochemical, and molecular analysis. Three patients with advanced glaucoma underwent psychof unctional and electrofunctional tests at baseline, after 3 months of NGF eye drops, and after 3 months of follow-up. Seven weeks of elevated IOP caused RGC degeneration resulting in 40% cell death. Significantly less RGC loss was observed with NGF treatment (2,530 \u00b1 121 vs. 1,850 \u00b1 156 RGCs/mm\u00b2) associated with inhibition of cell death by apoptosis. Patients treated with NGF demonstrated long lasting improvements in visual field, optic nerve function, contrast sensitivity, and visual acuity. NGF exerted neuroprotective effects, inhibiting apoptosis of RGCs in animals with glaucoma. In 3 patients with advanced glaucoma, treatment with topical NGF improved all parameters of visual function. These results may open therapeutic perspectives for glaucoma and other neurodegenerative diseases.\n      </p>", "Human aqueous humour was found to contain a substance which contracted the rat stomach strip.

Sexual functioning was assessed on one scale from the Swedish health-related quality of life survey (SWED-QUAL), adapted from the medical outcomes study (MOS). Both sexual functioning in general and specific sexual items were studied. Values were adjusted for non-respondents and standardised to the Swedish population. Response rates in the samples were 54-64% among men and 22-41% among women, decreasing with age for women. General sexual functioning decreased with age and was most apparent in patients with diabetes and angina pectoris, while glaucoma patients reported better results than the SPS. Loss of male erectile function was as common in diabetes (30%) as in angina pectoris (29%) and significantly higher than in the SPS (20%) (p &lt; 0.001). Besides age, significant factors for erectile dysfunction were, in diabetes, the presence of microvascular complications, treatment with long-acting nitroglycerine and psychiatric disease, and in angina, the presence of diabetes and peripheral artery disease.\n      </p>", "Here, we use a mouse model (DBA/2J) to readdress the location of insult(s) to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in glaucoma. We localize an early sign of axon damage to an astrocyte-rich region of the optic nerve just posterior to the retina, analogous to the lamina cribrosa. In this region, a network of astrocytes associates intimately with RGC axons. Using BAX-deficient DBA/2J mice, which retain all of their RGCs, we provide experimental evidence for an insult within or very close to the lamina in the optic nerve. We show that proximal axon segments attached to their cell bodies survive to the proximity of the lamina. In contrast, axon segments in the lamina and behind the eye degenerate. Finally, the $Wld^{s}$ allele, which is known to protect against insults to axons, strongly protects against DBA/2J glaucoma and preserves RGC activity as measured by pattern electroretinography. These experiments provide strong evidence for a local insult to axons in the optic nerve.\n      </p>", "Oral glucose 75 g was given to 352 patients with chronic glaucoma, acute glaucoma, or ocular hypertension and 73 patients without glaucoma. The proportion of patients with shallow anterior chambers who showed an abnormal response was significantly greater than that in patients with deep anterior chambers and in the control group (p &lt;0.005). The probability of developing an abnormal response to oral glucose tests increased as the depth of the anterior chamber decreased; these two variables showed a significant negative linear correlation (r=\u22120.79, p &lt;0.001). The high prevalence of autonomic dysfunction in patients with shallow anterior chambers and glaucoma may explain this association. Because of this, acute glaucoma should be regarded as a symptom of diabetes.\n      </p>", "Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide. Although a number of genetic loci have shown association or genetic linkage to monogenie forms of POAG, the identified genes and loci do not appear to have a major role in the common POAG phenotype. We seek to identify genetic loci that appear to be major risk factors for POAG in the Afro-Caribbean population of Barbados, West Indies. We performed linkage analyses in 146 multiplex families ascertained through the Barbados Family Study of Glaucoma (BFSG) and identified a strong linkage signal on chromosome 2p (logarithm of odds score = 6.64 at \u03b8 = 0 with marker D2S2156). We subsequently performed case-control analyses using unrelated affected individuals and unaffected controls. A set of SNPs on chromosome 2p was evaluated in two independent groups of BFSG participants, a discovery group (130 POAG cases, 65 controls) and a replication group (122 POAG cases, 65 controls), and a strong association was identified with POAG and rs 12994401 in both groups (P &lt; 3.34 E-09 and P &lt; 1.21E-12, respectively). The associated SNPs form a common disease haplotype. In summary, we have identified a locus with a major impact on susceptibility to the common POAG phenotype in an Afro-Caribbean population in Barbados. Our approach illustrates the merit of using an isolated population enriched with common disease variants as an efficient method to identify genetic underpinning of POAG.\n      </p>", "           ", "Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) affects 33 million individuals worldwide and is a leading cause of blindness. In a study of 54 families with autosomal dominantly inherited adult-onset POAG, we identified the causative gene on chromosome 10p14 and designated it OPTN (for \"optineurin\"). Sequence alterations in OPTN were found in 16.7% of families with hereditary POAG, including individuals with normal intraocular pressure. The OPTN gene codes for a conserved 66-kilodalton protein of unknown function that has been implicated in the tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 signaling pathway and that interacts with diverse proteins including Huntingtin, Ras-associated protein RAB8, and transcription factor IIIA. Optineurin is expressed in trabecular meshwork, non-pigmented ciliary epithelium, retina, and brain, and we speculate that it plays a neuroprotective role.\n      </p>", "Here, we show that high-dose \u03b3-irradiation accompanied with syngeneic bone marrow transfer can confer complete protection against glaucoma in a mouse model. Because bone marrow genotype was unaltered by this procedure, it was not the causative agent. The neuroprotection is robust and highly reproducible. Glaucoma-prone DBA/2J mice received a single treatment at 5-8 weeks of age and were protected from glaucomatous retinal ganglion cell degeneration out to 14 months of age (oldest assessed). By 12-14 months, retinal ganglion cell degeneration is usually very severe and essentially complete in the majority of untreated DBA/2J mice. To assess reproducibility, three groups of mice were treated at different times, and the results were essentially the same each time. Considering all experiments, the vast majority of treated mice had no detectable glaucomatous neuro-degeneration. A beneficial effect of treatment including high-dose radiation is unprecedented, and we are not aware of any other neuroprotective effects this substantial. Because of the robust protective effect, this treatment offers another tool for studying mechanisms of neuroprotection.\n      </p>", "In a series of Caucasian patients over the age of 40 years, the number of individuals unable to recognize the bitter taste of phenylthiourea (8.1 mg/100 ml) was found to be 28 percent in a \"normal\" eye clinic population (446 individuals), 17 percent in a series of 155 patients with angle-closure glaucoma, and 53 percent in 211 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma.\n      </p>", "The problem of decreasing the amount of testing for vision loss in persons susceptible to glaucoma is formulated as an integer optimization problem.

In the present case, greater and more precise knowledge about hymenostome holotrichs than was possible in the past has demanded revision of the tetrahymenine family Tetrahymenidae, rapidly becoming too heterogeneous. The part of the revision specifically treated here includes the establishment and characterization of the Glaucomidae n. fam.; of Epenardia n. g., with type-species E. myriophylli (Penard, 1922) n. comb.; and of Glaucoma dragescui n. sp., new member of Glaucoma, type-genus of the new family.

The genus Glaucoma, in revision, is reduced to eight \"good\" species: the type-species, G. scintillans; the new species, G. dragescui; and G. avellana, G. chattoni, G. frontata, G. intermedia, G. kirki, and G. macrostoma.\n      </p>", "An ongoing, statewide glaucoma detection program has been in operation in Oklahoma for 3 years. Individual screening clinics are located in county health departments and operated by public health nurses. Based on results of Schiotz tonometry, patients are divided into referral, borderline, and negative groups. The borderline groups are rechecked every year and the negative groups every 2 years. Of 9,646 persons screened to date, 1.6 percent were given a confirmed or pending diagnosis by the referral ophthalmologists. Secondary glaucoma evaluation was implemented recently in order to lower the false positive referral rate. A Glaucoma Evaluation Center was established for this purpose. Located at the University of Oklahoma Medical Center, the evaluation center functions jointly with the university and the State health department. A tonographic evaluation of the referral criteria used in the program demonstrated that 43 percent of 54 consecutively referred patients were more than 2 standard deviations from the mean level; that is, the referrals were justified. This correlates well with the fact that 41 percent of the 54 referred patients were found to have clinical evidence of glaucoma on subsequent ophthalmological evaluation.\n      </p>", "Open-angle glaucoma (OAG) is the commonest cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Apart from an increased intraocular pressure (IOP), oxidative stress and an impaired ocular blood flow are supposed to contribute to OAG. The aim of this study was to determine whether the dietary intake of nutrients that either have anti-oxidative properties (carotenoids, vitamins, and flavonoids) or influence the blood flow (omega fatty acids and magnesium) is associated with incident OAG. We investigated this in a prospective population-based cohort, the Rotterdam Study. A total of 3502 participants aged 55 years and older for whom dietary data at baseline and ophthalmic data at baseline and follow-up were available and who did not have OAG at baseline were included. The ophthalmic examinations comprised measurements of the IOP and perimetry; dietary intake of nutrients was assessed by validated questionnaires and adjusted for energy intake. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was applied to calculate hazard ratios of associations between the baseline intake of nutrients and incident OAG, adjusted for age, gender, IOP, IOP-lowering treatment, and body mass index. During an average follow-up of 9.7 years, 91 participants (2.6%) developed OAG. The hazard ratio for retinol equivalents (highest versus lowest tertile) was 0.45 (95% confidence interval 0.23\u20140.90), for vitamin B1 0.50 (0.25\u20140.98), and for magnesium 2.25 (1.16\u20144.38). The effects were stronger after the exclusion of participants taking supplements. Hence, a low intake of retinol equivalents and vitamin B1 (in line with hypothesis) and a high intake of magnesium (less unambiguous to interpret) appear to be associated with an increased risk of OAG.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

We now report cleavage of the autoinhibitory domain of the protein phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) in two rodent models of increased IOP. Cleaved CaN was not detected in rat or mouse eyes with normal IOP. In in vitro systems, this constitutively active cleaved form of CaN has been reported to lead to apoptosis via dephosphorylation of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Bad. In a rat model of glaucoma, we similarly detect increased Bad dephosphorylation, increased cytoplasmic cytochrome c(cyt c), and RGC death. Oral treatment of rats with increased IOP with the CaN inhibitor FK506 led to a reduction in Bad dephosphorylation and cyt c release. In accord with these biochemical results, we observed a marked increase in both RGC survival and optic nerve preservation. These data are consistent with a CaN-mediated mechanism of increased IOP toxicity. CaN cleavage was not observed at any time after optic nerve crush, suggesting that axon damage alone is insufficient to trigger cleavage. These findings implicate this mechanism of CaN activation in a chronic neurodegenerative disease. These data demonstrate that increased IOP leads to the initiation of a CaN-mediated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in glaucoma and support neuroprotective strategies for this blinding disease.\n      </p>", "Three aspects of size selective feeding by the scuticociliate Cyclidium glaucoma were studied in continuous cultivation systems. Firstly, grazing-induced changes in abundance, biomass, and size structure of a bacterial community were investigated. Secondly, we studied possible grazing-protection mechanisms of bacteria as a response to permanent presence of the predator. And finally, we were looking for potential feedback mechanisms within this predator-prey relationship, i.e., how the ciliate population reacted to a changed, more grazing-protected bacterial community. The first stage of the cultivation system consisted of the alga Cryptomonas sp. and the accompanying mixed bacterial community. These organisms were transferred to two second stage vessels, a control stage without ciliates and a second one inoculated with C. glaucoma. After the first week, the abundance of bacteria in the latter decreased by 60% and remained stable until the end of the experiment (65 d), whereas bacterial biomass was less affected (393 \u03bcg C L-1 during 0-7, 281 \u03bcg C L-1 afterwards). The mean bacterial cell volume doubled from 0.089 \u03bc m3 to 0.167 \u03bc m3, which was mainly due to increasing cell widths. During the whole investigation period formation of colonies or filaments was not observed, but we found a clear feedback of ciliates on bacterial size. An increase in bacterial cell volume was always followed by a decline of the predator population, resulting in a yet undescribed type of microbial predator-prey relation. Literature and our own data on the optimal food size range grazed by C. glaucoma showed that bacterial cell width rather than length was responsible for that observed phenomenon. Finally, we suggest that uptake rates of spherical latex beads give only limited information on truly ingestible prey volumes and that prey geometry should be considered in future studies on size selective feeding of protists.\n      </p>", "Objective To identify socioeconomic risk factors for first presentation advanced glaucomatous visual field loss. Design Hospital based case-control study with prospective identification of patients. Setting Three hospital eye departments. Participants Consecutive patients newly diagnosed with glaucoma (n = 220). Cases (late presenters) were those presenting with advanced glaucoma (n = 110), controls were those with early glaucoma (n = 110). Results Median underprivileged area scores were higher among late presenters (29.5; interquartile range 9.0-42.2) than in the control group (21.3; 6.1-37.4) (P = 0.035). Late presenters were more likely to be of lower occupational class (odds ratio adjusted for age and referral centre 20.1 (95% confidence interval 2.6 to 155) for group III compared with group I-II and 86.0 (11.0 to 673 for group IV-V compared with group I-II), to have no access to a car (2.2; 1.2 to 4.0), to have left full time education at age 14 or less (7.5; 2.3 to 24.7), and to be tenants rather than owner occupiers (local authority tenants 3.2; 1.7 to 5.8, private tenants 2.1; 0.7 to 5.8). Effects of deprivation were partly accounted for by family history of glaucoma, time since last visit to an optometrist, and lack of an initial diagnosis of glaucoma by an optometrist. Conclusions Area and individual level deprivation were both associated with late presentation of glaucoma. Existing evidence shows that late presentation is an important risk factor for subsequent blindness. Deprived groups thus seem to be at greater risk of going blind from glaucoma. Material deprivation may be associated with more aggressive disease as well as later presentation.\n      </p>", "A 5-wk-old female dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) was clinically diagnosed with bilateral corneal dermoids, incomplete congenital cataracts, a left persistent hyaloid artery (PHA), and a ventricular septal defect (VSD).

Design\u2014A prospective survey covering 5% of all sight tests performed by optometrists in England and Wales over six months, with analysis of referred patients. Setting\u2014241 optometrists' practices in areas representative of England and Wales in socioeconomic terms. Subjects\u2014Of 275 600 people attending for a sight test, 1505 were referred with suspected glaucoma (0.9% of those aged over 40). Outcomes were recorded for 1228 patients, 1103 (90%) of whom attended for examination by a consultant ophthalmologist (8% on a private basis). The analysis was confined to the 704 cases in which the information on diagnosis was received directly from a consultant or general practitioner. Main outcome measures\u2014Diagnoses reported by consultant ophthalmologists. Waiting times before an appointment for examination by a consultant ophthalmologist. Results\u2014Glaucoma was confirmed in 283 of the 704 referred patients, and another 222 patients were considered to require further monitoring. In all, 112 (41%) of 275 confirmed cases of glaucoma were in patients with intraocular pressures \u226530 mm Hg. At all levels of intraocular pressure the accuracy of referral was greater when the optometrist also recorded the presence of suspicious optic discs or loss of visual field, or both; but only 331 (47%) out of the 704 referred patients had been tested with a field screener. The median waiting time for an NHS clinic appointment was nine weeks. Almost a 10th of confirmed cases of glaucoma were in people in a high risk category for glaucoma who had to wait at least 14 weeks for an appointment. Conclusions\u2014Closer cooperation, especially at the local level, among consultants, general practitioners, and optometrists is needed to improve testing and referral for suspected glaucoma. Optometrists should be encouraged to perform all the three main tests\u2014ophthalmoscopy, tonometry, and perimetry\u2014in patients before referral and to report precisely on reasons for referral to help prioritisation. The optometrist's referral letter to the general practitioner should always be passed on to the consultant. Similarly, the diagnosis should always be reported back to the optometrist.\n      </p>", "Carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity plays an important role in controlling aqueous humor production in the eye and in regulating intraocular pressure. Prior studies identified the soluble isozymes CA II and CA I in the human eye and also suggested a distinct membrane-associated CA. We used an antibody to CA IV, the membrane-anchored isozyme from human lung, to study CA IV in eye tissues and to compare its distribution with that of CA II. We found intense immunostaining for CA IV associated with endothelial cells of one specific uveal capillary bed, the choriocapillaris. CA IV was not detected in endothelial cells of the contiguous capillaries of the iris or in endothelial cells of other vessels. Immunoreactivity for CA IV was also intense in epithelial and fiber cells of the lens but was not detectable in the neuroretina, the ciliary process (except for capillaries), and the cornea, all sites where immunostaining with anti-CA II antibody was intense. These studies indicate that the membrane-associated CA in human eye, which was suspected from histochemical studies, is CA IV. Defining the physiological role of this ocular isozyme remains a challenge.\n      </p>", "A clear demonstration of the role of melatonin and its receptors in specifie retinal functions is lacking. The present study investigated the distribution of MT1 receptors within the retina, and the scotopic and photopic electroretinograms (ERG) and retinal morphology in wildtype (WT) and MT1 receptor-def icient mice. MT1 receptor transcripts were localized in photoreceptor cells and in some inner retinal neurons. A diurnal rhythm in the dark-adapted ERG responses was observed in WT mice, with higher a-and b-wave amplitudes at night, but this rhythm was absent in mice lacking MT1 receptors. Injection of melatonin during the day decreased the scotopic response threshold and the amplitude of the a-and b-waves in the WT mice, but not in the $MT^{ - / - } $ mice. The effeets of MT1 receptor deficiency on retinal morphology was investigated at three different ages (3,12, and 18 months). No differences between $MT^{ - / - } $ and WT mice were observed at 3 months of age, whereas at 12 months $MT^{ - / - } $ mice have a significant reduction in the number of photoreceptor nuclei in the outer nuclear layer compared with WT controls. No differences were observed in the number of cells in inner nuclear layer or in ganglion cells at 12 months of age. At 18 months, the loss of photoreceptor nuclei in the outer nuclear layer was further accentuated and the number of ganglion cells was also significantly lower than that of controls. These data demonstrate the functional significance of melatonin and MT1 receptors in the mammalian retina and create the basis for future studies on the therapeutic use of melatonin in retinal degeneration.\n      </p>", "Background: Latinos have one of the highest rates of visual impairment associated with eye disease in the United States. Although little is known about the prevalence and risk of undetected eye disease (UED) in this population, it is known that Latinos encounter disproportionate barriers in accessing health care, which may influence the burden of UED. Objective: To estimate the burden and to evaluate factors associated with UED among Latinos, a majority of whom were Mexican-American. Research Design: Population-based, cross-sectional study. A detailed interview and eye examination were performed on participants. Subjects: A sample of 6357 Latinos (95% of whom had Mexican ancestry), aged \u226540, in 6 census tracts in Los Angeles, California. Main Outcome Measure: UED (macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, cataract, and refractive error) was defined as those persons with eye disease and no reported history of that eye disease. Results: Fifty-three percent (3349 of 6357) of the participants had eye disease. Sixty-three percent (2095 of 3349) of them had UED. Major risk factors for UED included older age [odds ratio (OR): 4.7 (age \u226580)], having diabetes mellitus (OR: 3.3), never having had an eye examination (OR: 2.4), being uninsured (OR: 1.6), lower educational attainment (OR: 1.4), and low acculturation (OR: 1.3). Conclusions: These findings provide evidence of the burden of UED among Latinos. Interventions that address the modifiable risk factors (lack of insurance, never having had an eye examination, etc.) may improve detection of eye disease and decrease the burden of visual impairment in this high-risk minority population.\n      </p>", "Objective\u2014To assess changes, if any, in the numbers of referrals and outcome of glaucoma referrals to the hospital eye service since the introduction of the sight test fee on 1 April 1989.

The ciliary process epithelium was found to be enriched in an adenylate cyclase with pharmacological characteristics indicative of a predominance of \u03b2 2-adrenergic receptors. The results are consistent with the possibility that the adrenergic nervous system may regulate aqueous humor production through a direct effect on secretion.

Cytoplasmic RNA granules (RGs) function in the posttranscriptional control of gene expression, but the extent of RG involvement in organogenesis is unknown. We describe two human cases of pediatric cataract with loss-of-function mutations in TDRD7 and demonstrate that Tdrd7 nullizygosity in mouse causes cataracts, as well as glaucoma and an arrest in spermatogenesis. TDRD7 is a Tudor domain RNA binding protein that is expressed in lens fiber cells in distinct TDRD7-RGs that interact with STAU1-ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). TDRD7 coimmunoprecipitates with specific lens messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and is required for the posttranscriptional control of mRNAs that are critical to normal lens development and to RG function. These findings demonstrate a role for RGs in vertebrate organogenesis.\n      </p>", "The functional morphology of the mouth apparatus for the suspension-feeding tetrahymenine ciliate Glaucoma was analyzed from a series of SEM photographs in conjunction with studies on feeding currents in living cells.

Sino-Indian medical contacts developed with the spread of Buddhism in the early centuries of the Christian era. Soon after, Chinese historical and medical texts as well as popular literature began to reflect the influence of Indian medicine, especially ophthalmology. Two works which appeared between the eighth and the twelfth centuries A.D. were attributed to N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, suggesting their connection with the Indian medical tradition. A case study of glaucoma-like diseases in these texts is followed by a comparison of passages from these works, as well as from those which appeared immediately before and after them in China, with corresponding passages in Indian medical texts. Inferences are drawn regarding the nature of the influence of Indian ophthalmology on the formative and developmental stages of Chinese ophthalmology.\n      </p>", "Purpose To identify vision Patient-Reported Outcomes instruments relevant to glaucoma and assess their content validity. Methods MEDLINE, MEDLINE in Process, EMBASE and SCOPUS (to January 2009) were systematically searched. Observational studies or randomised controlled trials, published in English, reporting use of vision instruments in glaucoma studies involving adults were included. In addition, reference lists were scanned to identify additional studies describing development and/or validation to ascertain the final version of the instruments. Instruments' content was then mapped onto a theoretical framework, the World Health Organization International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. Two reviewers independently evaluated studies for inclusion and quality assessed instrument content. Results Thirty-three instruments were identified. Instruments were categorised into thirteen vision status, two vision disability, one vision satisfaction, five glaucoma status, one glaucoma medication related to health status, five glaucoma medication side effects and six glaucoma medication satisfaction measures according to each instruments' content. The National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25, Impact of Vision Impairment and Treatment Satisfaction Survey-Intraocular Pressure had the highest number of positive ratings in the content validity assessment. Conclusion This study provides a descriptive catalogue of vision-specific PRO instruments, to inform the choice of an appropriate measure of patient-reported outcomes in a glaucoma context.\n      </p>", "Mutations in the cytochrome P450 family 1, subfamily B, polypeptide 1 (CYP1B1) gene are a common cause of human primary congenital glaucoma (PCG). Here we show that $Cyp1b1^{-/-}$ mice have ocular drainage structure abnormalities resembling those reported in human PCG patients. Using $Cyp1b1^{-/-}$ mice, we identified the tyrosinase gene (Tyr) as a modifier of the drainage structure phenotype, with Tyr deficiency increasing the magnitude of dysgenesis. The severe dysgenesis in eyes lacking both CYP1B1 and TYR was alleviated by administration of the tyrosinase product dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa). Tyr also modified the drainage structure dysgenesis in mice with a mutant Foxc1 gene, which is also involved in PCG. These experiments raise the possibility that a tyrosinase/L-dopa pathway modifies human PCG, which could open new therapeutic avenues.\n      </p>", "Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy with cupping of the optic disk, degeneration of retinal ganglion cells, and characteristic visual field loss. Because elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor for progression of glaucoma, treatment has been based on lowering IOP. We previously demonstrated inducible nitric-oxide synthase (NOS-2) in the optic nerve heads from human glaucomatous eyes and from rat eyes with chronic, moderately elevated IOP. Using this rat model of unilateral glaucoma, we treated a group of animals for 6 months with aminoguanidine, a relatively specific inhibitor of NOS-2, and compared them with an untreated group. At 6 months, untreated animals had pallor and cupping of the optic disks in the eyes with elevated IOP. Eyes of aminoguanidine-treated animals with similar elevations of IOP appeared normal. We quantitated retinal ganglion cell loss by retrograde labeling with Fluoro-Gold. When compared with their contralateral control eyes with normal IOP, eyes with elevated IOP in the untreated group lost 36% of their retinal ganglion cells; the eyes with similarly elevated IOP in the aminoguanidine-treated group lost less than 10% of their retinal ganglion cells. Pharmacological neuroprotection by inhibition of NOS-2 may prove useful for the treatment of patients with glaucoma.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
