The software was first employed in a project involving the documentation of paneling from five period rooms prior to their conservation. It enabled conservators to document accurately alterations such as restorations and surface damage. The use of the software in the museum has expanded to include the manipulation of digital images to aid their visual interpretation for research purposes; analysis enhancement; accurate comparison of related objects; and as an education tool. The authors outline the materials and equipment most commonly used and conclude with case studies illustrating the range and depth of the possibilities for using image manipulation software in furniture conservation.\n      </p>", "Visual estimates of vegetation concealing bird nests have typically been used to assess the importance of nest concealment to predators. We developed a new method that more accurately quantifies nest concealment. During the breeding season of 2001, we took digital pictures of 63 nests from 3 vantage points (1 m above the nest, 1 m at the level of the nest, and 1 m below the nest); we imported the pictures into Adobe Photoshop\u2122 (Adobe Systems Incorporated, San Jos\u00e9, Calif.) and determined percent of nest concealment by dividing the number of vegetation pixels by the number of total nest pixels. We compared this method with visual estimates for each nest by the 4 authors and another method counting squares on a transparent grid over photographs. Of 45 paired t-tests, 29% resulted in significant differences between individual observer estimates and between individual observer estimates and the 2 other methods. In contrast, there were no differences between trials using the Adobe Photoshop method. We also found inconsistencies among individual observer estimates and methods in evaluation of nest concealment between depredated and nondepredated nests. We suggest that the Adobe Photoshop method improves repeatability over visual estimates, thus providing a more accurate assessment of the importance of nest concealment and a more accurate basis on which to evaluate management decisions.\n      </p>", "In this article a theoretical connection is described between Brockelman's (2001) reading of collage as an art form that captures the relationship between the modern and postmodern, and a proposed role for digitally manipulated photography in educational research. Tracing the tension Brockelman posits between fragmented and universalizing meaning, the paper argues that a social semiotic approach can be brought to photographs created by or about children in schools. This approach, which understands photographs as a resource in the construction of meaning, describes a number of functionalist dimensions that images can serve in meaning making. The paper gives examples of several overt digital manipulations to research photographs and asks the reader to consider their effectiveness in creating a selective realism that, like collage, both promises and questions its own readability.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Lichens growing on flat-faced quartzite boulders in two glacier forefields were photographed and the images were transferred to a computer. Barren rock was digitally removed using Adobe Photoshop and Idrisi geographic information system (GIS) software was used to measure thallus size, perimeter, compactness, and total lichenized area. Replicate analyses show that the technique produces reproducible results that allow a user to distinguish very small differences in lichen coverage and obtain other quantitative measures of a lichen population. The technique is suitable for use with smooth, evenly illuminated surfaces where there are clear color differences between the various lichens and the substrate is a uniform color. Excellent results can be obtained using a 35 mm film camera, inexpensive flash units, a film or print scanner and DOS based versions of Idrisi that permit batch processing of images. The technique can be used to examine lichen colonization patterns and explore new approaches in lichenometric dating.\n      </p>", "Chris Davis and Jennifer Davis embrace the teaching environment of their science and technology magnet school.

In this study, we examine whether the presence of residual 8-oxoguanine can be detected in mammalian cells after exposure to ionizing radiation. MOLT-4 human leukemia cells and CHO-K1 Chinese hamster cells were acutely irradiated in vitro with 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 1.0 Gy \u03b3 radiation at room temperature. The amounts of 8-oxoguanine and total DNA in the cell nucleus were detected by fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled avidin, which binds specifically and directly to 8-oxoguanine, and propidium iodide, respectively. The intensity ratios between these two fluorescent dyes were then taken as indices to measure the content of 8-oxoguanine within individual cells. We found an apparent dose-dependent increase in the amount of 8-oxoguanine accumulated in cells of both lines. Moreover, the content of 8-oxoguanine decreased from 2 to 20 h after irradiation in CHO-K1 cells, which may reflect the time-dependent repair processes at the 8-oxoguanine lesions. This novel approach may provide a sensitive tool for in situ measurement of 8-oxoguanine in cells or even in the human body after exposure to ionizing radiation.\n      </p>", "A well-planned photography studio and digital workflow can make effective, state-of-the-art documentation possible for conservators who possess little or no digital imaging experience.

Frond size was measured directly in situ, aiming at recruitment data. These data were correlated to temperature, salinity and nutrients. During the sampling period, algal coverage showed no clear pattern of seasonal variation and could not be related to the environmental variables studied. Although no statistically significant variation was found, we observed lower percent cover during the summer. During the winter and early spring, there is a trend toward increased coverage and mean frond size, which is probably related to lower temperatures.

One potential solution to these challenges is the use of ground-based photographic technology. Our objective was to develop a photo-based technique that could be used to monitor changes in willow (Salix spp.) biomass over time and estimate changes in biomass associated with herbivory. We focused on young willows (\u2264 2 m in height) because this size class represents a critical life history stage for establishment of willow clumps. In August 2000 and 2001, we harvested 25 willow (Salix boothii Dorn.) clumps and clamped them in front of a fluorescent orange photoboard (150 \u00d7 200 cm). Clumps were defoliated of leaves and tips of current annual stem growth (referred to as \"biomass\") by hand in 4 to 7 increments and photographed before and after each removal. Images were scanned to digital format and the degree of photoboard obstruction was determined with Adobe\u00ae Photoshop\u00ae 4.0 software. Regression analysis indicated that visual obstruction of the photoboard was a good predictor of total clump biomass (r2=0.89, P &lt; 0.01) as well as biomass remaining following sequential defoliations (r2=0.92, P &lt; 0.01). These results suggest our technique provides a reliable index of both willow biomass and utilization within the size class of willow tested. Results might differ with larger willows and increased woody biomass. The technique minimizes observer bias and provides a permanent photo record that can be reanalyzed at a later date if necessary. /// La cuantificaci\u00f3n en campo de la biomasa de plantas le\u00f1osas frecuentemente es dif\u00edcil por razones que incluyen una morfolog\u00eda irregular de las plantas, variabilidad entre observadores y la falta de t\u00e9cnicas estandarizadas.

En agosto del 2000 y 2001 se corto un grupo de 25 varetas de \"Willow\" (Salix boothii Dorn.), se juntaron y expusieron en una mesa fotogr\u00e1fica de 150 \u00d7 200-cm a fluorescencia naranja. Las varetas fueron manualmente defoliadas y se eliminaron los brotes del crecimiento del ultimo a\u00f1o (citado como biomasa) en incrementos de 4 a 7 y fotografiados antes y despu\u00e9s de cada corte. Las im\u00e1genes fueron registradas en un formato digital y el grado obstrucci\u00f3n de la tabla de fotograf\u00eda fue determinado usando el programa Adobe\u00ae Photoshop\u00ae 4.0. El an\u00e1lisis de regresi\u00f3n indic\u00f3 que la obstrucci\u00f3n visual de la tabla de fotograf\u00eda fue un buen estimador de la biomasa total del grupo de varetas ( r2=0.89, P &lt; 0.01) as\u00ed como de la biomasa remanente posterior a defoliaciones secuenciales (r2=0.92, P &lt; 0.01). Los resultados sugieren que nuestra t\u00e9cnica provee un \u00edndice confiable tanto de la biomasa como de la utilizaci\u00f3n del \"Willow\" de dentro de clase de tama\u00f1o evaluada. Los resultados pueden diferir en \"Willow\" grandes y mayor biomasa le\u00f1osa. La t\u00e9cnica minimiza sesgos del observador y provee un registro fotogr\u00e1fico permanente que puede ser re-analizado en fechas posteriores de ser necesario.\n      </p>", "Estimating detection error, as well as the magnitude of other potential survey biases, is essential when sampling efforts play a role in the estimation of population size and management of wildlife populations. We quantified visual biases in aerial surveys of nesting wading birds (Ciconiiformes) in colonies in the Florida Everglades using a negative binomial count regression model to compare numbers of nests in quadrats counted on the ground with numbers estimated from aerial photographs of the same quadrats. The model also allowed the determination of degree of difference between monitoring results based upon such factors as nest density, vegetative cover, and nest turnover rates. Aerial surveys of White Ibis (Eudocimus albus) colonies underestimated the true number of nests found during ground counts by 11.1%, and underestimates were significatly greater (P = 0.047) in a colony with high nest turnover. Error rates did not differ for quadrats that varied in the density of White Ibis nests did not differ, and visual bias did not increase with vegetative complexity (P = 0.73). Estimates of nest density in colonies of Great Egrets (Ardea alba) based on aerial surveys were higher than ground counts for 38% of the quadrats sampled, and mean visual bias was 23.1%. Species misidentification likely contributed to visibility bias for Great Egrets in our study, with some Snowy Egrets almost certainly mistaken for Great Egrets in aerial photos. Biases of the magnitude we observed fro Great Egrets and White Ibises can mask true population trends in long-term monitoring and, therefore, we recommend that detection probability be explicitly evaluated when conducting aerial surveys of nesting birds. /// Es esencial poder estimar el error de detecci\u00f3n, as\u00ed como la magnitud de otros tipos de errores al realizer muestreos cuando estos son usados para estimar el tama\u00f1o poblacional y manejar las poblaciones. Cuantificamos los errores de observaci\u00f3n en las muestras tomadas desde el aire de aves Ciconiiformes en colonias en los Everglades de Florida, usando un modelo de regresi\u00f3n binomial negativo de conteo para comparar los n\u00fameros de nidos en cuadrantes contadas desde la tierra con los n\u00fameros de nidos estimados usando fotograf\u00edas a\u00e9reas de los mismos cuadrantes.

Los muestreos a\u00e9reos subestimaron el verdadero numero de nidos en colonias de Eudocimus albus (encontradas durante conteos hechas en la tierra) por el 11.1% y estas subestimaciones fueron significativamente mas grandes (P = 0.047) en una colonia con una alta tasa de renovaci\u00f3n de nidos. Las tasas de error no variaron entre los cuadrantes cuales ten\u00edan diferentes densidades de nidos de E. albus y el error asociado con la observaci\u00f3n visual no incremento con la complejidad de la vegetaci\u00f3n (P = 0.73). Las estimaciones de la densidad de nidos en las colonias de Ardea alba basadas en muestreos a\u00e9reos fueron mas altas que los conteos hechos en tierra para 38% de los cuadrantes muestreados; el error promedio de la observaci\u00f3n visual fue 23.1%.

A largo plazo, los errores del tama\u00f1o que observamos en el monitoreo pueden enmascarar los patrones verdaderos de patrones poblacionales y por eso recomendamos que la probabilidad de detecci\u00f3n sea expl\u00edcitamente evaluado al tomar muestras a\u00e9reas de aves que nidifican en colonias.\n      </p>", "Through the example of a specific blog, this article locates a category of online discourse termed the \"vernacular web.\" Because the definitive trait of the vernacular is its distinction from the institutional, the vernacular web emerges in specific network locations as a communal invocation of alternate authority.

Visual obstruction methods (i.e., Robel pole and Nudd's coverboard) are common and useful techniques for quantifying vegetation structure; however, both rely on ocular estimations, which can be highly variable between observers. Our objectives were to 1) compare measurement and observer variation for visual obstruction among the two standard methods and the digital image method we developed using a digital camera; and 2) compare the performance of the Robel pole and digital image to estimate standing crop. The mean variation across the five observers using the digital image method (6.8%) was significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05) than both the Nudds' coverboard (32.1%) and the Robel pole (52.2). There were no significant differences among locations for the digital image method; however, there were for both the Robel pole and Nudds' cover board (P &lt; 0.05). The digital image method provided a better estimate of standing crop (r\u00b2 = 0.89) compared to the Robel pole (r\u00b2 = 0.68), accounting for 21% more of the observed variation in biomass. Long-term research programs that utilize seasonal field technicians to quantify habitat structure with a visual obstruction method could benefit from implementing use of the digital image method we developed. The low measurement error observed with this technique relative to the more traditional methods compared in this study might limit yearto-year and within-year variability of habitat structure data collected by numerous technicians with a high annual turnover. /// Los paisajes con una hetrogeneidad estructural o con muchos parches pueden sostener poblaciones diversas y estables de fauna silvestre.

The color information collected during lightfastness measurement (as CIE L*a*b* values) with a micro-fading tester can be transformed to RGB values, and color swatches representing the original and faded colors displayed on a computer monitor. Such demonstration of the appearance changes can help to visualize the degree of color change and the precise nature of that change, which may not be simple lightening of the color but could also include hue or chroma changes. Judging the visual impact of a light-induced color change requires viewing the altered color in its context within a particular image. Digital renderings of paintings were created with Adobe Photoshop and Matlab, using a number of fugitive colors, the fading characteristics of which had been recorded with prolonged microfading tests of 100-1920 minutes in duration depending on the light dosage required for the color to no longer be changing. Based on this information describing the appearance of each of the colors as it changes with light exposure, simulations of the \"virtually faded\" painting were generated, representing the image appearance with incremental light exposure. Such virtually faded simulations can offer insight into the severity of particular light-induced color changes, allow targeting of crucial color areas that might warrant tracking in a color monitoring program, and inform discussions about the \"end of exhibition life\" of an object and appropriate exhibition rotation policies. /// La d\u00e9coloration virtuelle des objets d'art: simuler la d\u00e9coloration future des artefacts en visualisant les r\u00e9sultats de tests de micro-d\u00e9coloration R\u00c9SUM\u00c9 Dans cet article, on discute de l'importance de visualiser les changements de couleur des colorants lorsqu'ils sont expos\u00e9s \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re visible, et on utilise ces informations pour cr\u00e9er un objet d'art d\u00e9color\u00e9 virtuellement.

We describe a protocol for generating rapid counts of nucleated erythrocytes from digital micrographs of thin blood smears that can be used to estimate intensity of hematozoan infections in nonmammalian vertebrate hosts. This method takes advantage of the bold contrast and relatively uniform size and morphology of erythrocyte nuclei on Giemsa-stained blood smears and uses ImageJ, a java-based image analysis program developed at the U.S. National Institutes of Health and available on the internet, to recognize and count these nuclei.

The Ras-induced dissolution of actin stress fibers is blocked by the specific PKC inhibitor GF109203X at concentrations which inhibit the activity of the atypical aPKC isotypes \u03bb and \u03b6, whereas lower concentrations of the inhibitor which block conventional and novel PKC isotypes are ineffective. Coexpression of transforming Ha-Ras L61 with kinase-defective, dominant-negative (DN) mutants of aPKC-\u03bb and aPKC-\u03b6, as well as antisense constructs encoding RNA-directed against isotype-specific 5\u2032 sequences of the corresponding mRNA, abrogates the Ha-Ras-induced reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Expression of a kinase-defective, DN mutant of cPKC-\u03b1 was unable to counteract Ras with regard to the dissolution of actin stress fibers. Transfection of cells with constructs encoding constitutively active (CA) mutants of atypical aPKC-\u03bb and aPKC-\u03b6 lead to a disassembly of stress fibers independent of oncogenic Ha-Ras. Coexpression of (DN) Rac-1 N17 and addition of the phosphatidylinositol 3\u2032-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 are in agreement with a tentative model suggesting that, in the signaling pathway from Ha-Ras to the cytoskeleton aPKC-\u03bb acts upstream of PI3K and Rac-1, whereas aPKC-\u03b6 functions downstream of PI3K and Rac-1. This model is supported by studies demonstrating that cotransfection with plasmids encoding L61Ras and either aPKC-\u03bb or aPKC-\u03b6 results in a stimulation of the kinase activity of both enzymes. Furthermore, the Ras-mediated activation of PKC-\u03b6 was abrogated by coexpression of DN Rac-1 N17.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Invasive S. typhimurium strains invade RAW264.7 macrophages in 2 h with 7- to 10-fold higher levels than noninvasive strains. Invasive S. typhimurium and Salmonella typhi, independent of their ability to replicate intracellularly, are cytotoxic to RAW264.7 macrophages and, to a greater degree, to murine bone marrow-derived macrophages. Here, we show that the macrophage cytotoxicity mediated by invasive Salmonella is apoptosis, as shown by nuclear morphology, cytoplasmic vacuolization, and host cell DNA fragmentation. S. typhimurium that enter cells causing ruffles but are mutant for subsequent intracellular replication also initiate host cell apoptosis. Mutant S. typhimurium that are incapable of inducing host cell membrane ruffling fail to induce apoptosis. The activation state of the macrophage plays a significant role in the response of macrophages to Salmonella invasion, perhaps indicating that the signal or receptor for initiating programmed cell death is upregulated in activated macrophages. The ability of Salmonella to promote apoptosis may be important for the initiation of infection, bacterial survival, and escape of the host immune response.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Vibrio cholerae persists in aquatic environments predominantly in a nonculturable state. In this study coccoid, nonculturable V. cholerae O1 in biofilms maintained for 495 days in Mathbaria, Bangladesh, pond water became culturable upon animal passage. Culturability, biofilm formation, and the wbe, ctxA, and rstR2 genes were monitored by culture, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA), and multiplex PCR. DFA counts were not possible after formation of biofilm. Furthermore, wbe, but not ctxA, were amplifiable, even after incubation for 54 and 68 days at room temperature (\u224825\u00b0C) and 4\u00b0C, respectively, when no growth was detectable. Slower biofilm formation and extended culturability were observed for cultures incubated at 4\u00b0C, compared with \u224825\u00b0C, suggesting biofilm production to be temperature dependent and linked to loss of culturability. Small colonies appearing after incubation in microcosms for 54 and 68 days at 25\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C, respectively, were wbe positive and ctxA and rstR2 negative, indicating loss of bacteriophage CTX\u03a6. The coccoid V. cholerae O1 observed as free cells in microcosms incubated for 495 days could not be cultured, but biofilms in the same microcosms yielded culturable cells. It is concluded that biofilms can act as a reservoir for V. cholerae O1 between epidemics because of its long-term viability in biofilms. In contrast to biofilms produced in Mathbaria pond water, V. cholerae O1 in biofilms present in cholera stools and incubated under identical conditions as the Mathbaria pond water biofilms could not be cultured after 2 months, indicating that those V. cholerae cells freshly discharged into the environment are significantly less robust than cells adapted to environmental conditions.\n      </p>", "Arthrophycus alleghaniensis is a well-known trace fossil common in the lower Silurian of the Appalachian Basin, eastern U.S.A. Despite the distinctive morphology of this trace, with few exceptions, hypotheses about the nature of the tracemaker have not extended beyond that of a long-bodied, segmented organism. A single organic compression of a long-bodied arthropod discovered in shale interbedded with sandstones containing A. alleghaniensis in the Silurian (Llandovery) Tuscarora Formation at Mann Narrows, Pennsylvania is described. The specimen preserves evidence of two trunk tagmata: an anterior tagma with tergites extending into broad, rectangular pleurae, and a posterior tagma bearing long, curved spines. Head and appendages are not preserved. The new arthropod, Pleuralata spinosa n. gen. n. sp., matches the size and general morphology required for an A. alleghaniensis tracemaker. Precise systematic affinities of this new arthropod could not be determined. This discovery supports the conclusion that the tracemakers of various Arthrophycus ichnospecies are likely poorly preserved, and presently unknown, members of the Ecdysozoa.\n      </p>", "This essay analyzes Chris Marker's recent exhibition and book of photographs Staring Back. This project joined together black and white photographs of political demonstrations from the 1960s to the present and portraits from Marker's oeuvre. Some of the images are actual photographs and some were extracted from Marker's film and video footage and altered digitally using Photoshop and Painter. The first part of the essay focuses on the way the 'people' are represented in these images in relation to current political philosophy, mainly the writings of Etienne Balibar, Giorgio Agamben, Jacques Ranci\u00e8re, and Gilles Deleuze's cinema books. The second part is concerned with individual portraits and the face in relation to Deleuze's concept of the 'affection image' and the cinematic close-up. The essay argues that what unites these two groups of images is an epistemological and political move beyond identity. On the one hand these images suggest 'a new politics of the image' because they indicate that 'virtuality' is not simply the outcome of the technological digital revolution in image production in which the indexical status of analogical photography is eliminated, but of a different way of thinking and making visual images beyond what Deleuze calls 'representation,' a form of thought that is based on notions of resemblance, truth, and identity. On the other hand they offer 'a new image of the people' because they show that in the current age politics can only exist beyond the realm of identities, precisely in the possibility, as Balibar argues, of creating transnational forms of citizenship.\n      </p>", "Volatile compounds, which frequently play important roles in plant-insect interaction, can be produced either by flowers to attract pollinators or by leaves to deter herbivores. The specialized structures associated with odor production differ in these two organs. The European dwarf palm Chamaerops humilis represents a unique intermediate between these two. In previous work, its leaves were shown to produce volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that attract pollinators only during flowering. Because the leaf sinuses look like a gland, the sinus was examined histologically and with environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) for evidence that the sinus emits VOCs. Volatile compounds emitted by the different parts of the leaf were extracted by washes and headspace then analyzed by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). The sinus does not have the expected gland-like structure; the VOCs are actually produced by the whole leaf, even if the composition of the VOCs emitted by the sinus slightly differs. Thus, attraction of pollinators does not result from specialized secreting cells in leaves of flowering European dwarf palms. The results are discussed in the context of a convergent evolution of leaves toward petals.\n      </p>", "Bacteria have long been thought of as little more than sacks of homogeneously distributed enzymes. However, recent cytological studies indicate that bacteria are compartmentalized with proteins involved in processes such as cell division, motility, chemotaxis, and development located at distinct sites. We have used the green fluorescent protein as a reporter to determine the cellular distribution of the extracellular protein secretion (eps)-encoded type II secretion complex responsible for extracellular secretion of cholera toxin and hemagglutinin/protease in Vibrio cholerae. Real-time monitoring of green fluorescent protein fused to EpsM in living cells indicated that, like the single polar flagellum, the Eps complex is located at the old pole after cell division. Eps-dependent protease secretion was also visualized in single cells by fluorescence microscopy by using intramolecularly quenched casein. This analysis demonstrated that active protease secretion is focused at the poles and colocalizes with the site of the polar Eps apparatus. These results suggest that the type II secretion complex is responsible for directed delivery of virulence factors during cholera pathogenesis.\n      </p>", "For over a decade, design culture portals have hosted online resources such as tutorials, examples of compelling design and links to other design-related websites. Although now surpassed by other social media, portals can be viewed as significant communication centres and virtual gathering spaces. These design-culture community websites have also exposed the tensions between production and consumption, professional and amateur practices, work and play and expression/exploration and service. Evolving practices, enabled by networked technologies, have supported a reputation-based system of knowledge building and resource distribution that allow for modest, open creative cultural production to grow outside the commercial realm. While this parallel practice has promoted an expansion of our notion of creative production, it has also been fed in part by corporate mythologies that contribute to the precarious nature of contemporary creative work. The community's designed artefacts, including shared resources and tools such as the portal itself, have subsequently revealed struggles over cultural production in the early Web design era and, perhaps, a more nuanced view of the creative knowledge worker.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Two types of enantiostyly occur: monomorphic enantiostyly, in which individuals exhibit both stylar orientations, and dimorphic enantiostyly, in which the two stylar orientations occur on separate plants. To evaluate architectural or developmental constraints on the evolution of both forms of enantiostyly, we examined inflorescence structure and floral development among unrelated enantiostylous species. We investigated relations between the position of left- and right-styled flowers and inflorescence architecture in four monomorphic enantiostylous species, and we examined the development of enantiostyly in nine monomorphic and dimorphic enantiostylous species from five unrelated lineages. The location of left- and right-styled flowers within inflorescences ranged from highly predictable (in Solanum rostratum) to random (in Heteranthera mexicana). There were striking differences among taxa in the timing of stylar bending. In Wachendorfia paniculata, Dilatris corymbosa, and Philydrum lanuginosum, the style deflected in the bud, whereas in Heteranthera spp., Monochoria australasica, Cyanella lutea, and Solanum rostratum, stylar bending occurred at the beginning of anthesis. Comparisons of organ initiation and development indicated that asymmetries along the left-right axis were expressed very late in development, despite the early initiation of a dorsiventral asymmetry. We suggest that the evolution of dimorphic enantiostyly from monomorphic enantiostyly may be constrained by a lack of left-right positional information in the bud.\n      </p>", "A series of experiments is described, the aim of which is to identify the optimum spectral band and detector configuration for the visualization of underdrawings. First, the visualization of underdrawings is investigated using three detector systems operating in different infrared spectral bands from 0.9 to 2.5\u03bcm. Visibility analysis is applied to the examination of eight test panels, each having a rectangle of paint covering six different underdrawing materials. These data demonstrate that the combined optical properties of the pigment and the underdrawing material determine which spectral band gives the optimum visualization of the underdrawing. The peak visibilities of different combinations occur between 1.0 and 2.5\u03bcm. These results suggest that camera systems having uniform spectral responsivity across the 1.0 to 2.5\u03bcm band would be most useful for infrared reflectography (IRR). Second, the imaging properties of each camera system are investigated. Comparison of the modulation transfer function (MTF) and signal-to-noise ratio for the vidicon and the platinum silicide (PtSi) camera systems shows that the latter is much closer to a theoretically perfect system. Finally, the applicability of the visibility studies and MTF modeling to the IRR application is demonstrated by the examination of two paintings with the PtSi camera, which renders dramatically improved images of underdrawings and paint changes, as compared to reflectograms obtained with the vidicon camera. The implications of this study, including the potential use of infrared reflectography as a method of non-destructive analysis, are discussed. /// On d\u00e9crit une s\u00e9rie d'exp\u00e9riences destin\u00e9e \u00e0 identifier la bande spectrale optimale et la forme du d\u00e9tecteur pour la mise en \u00e9vidence des dessins sous-jacents.

Colony form in these taxa is a consequence of modular (polyp) replication, and if there is a tight integration among modular and supramodular traits (e.g. polyp aperture, inter-polyp spacing, branch thickness, internode and branch length), then changes at the module level may lead to changes in colony architecture. Alternatively, different groups of traits may evolve semi-independently (or conditionally independent). To examine the patterns of integration among morphological traits in Caribbean octocorals, we compared five morphological traits across 21 species, correcting for the effects of phylogenetic relationships among the taxa. Graphical modelling and phylogenetic independence contrasts among the five morphological characters indicate two groups of integrated traits based on whether they were polyp- or colony-level traits. Although all characters exhibited bivariate associations, multivariate analyses (partial correlation coefficients) showed the strongest integration among the colony-level characters (internode distance and branch length). It is a quantitative demonstration that branching characters within the octocorals studied are independent of characters of the polyps. Despite the universally recognized modularity of octocorals at the level of polyps, branching during colony development may represent an emergent level of integration and modularity.\n      </p>", "This paper reports on a remote sensing station specifically designed to investigate eolian processes at a beach\u2013dune system. The monitoring station is located at Greenwich Dunes, Prince Edward Island National Park, Prince Edward Island (Canada), and it is the second, improved generation of a previous system using continuous video and photographs. The setup consists of three digital single-lens reflex cameras, a two-dimensional sonic anemometer, two safires, erosion\u2013deposition pins, and an array of batteries and solar panels. The cameras run on a timer that takes pictures every hour. The images are rectified and analyzed using a combination of ArcMap 9.2 and PCI Geomatica software, which permits the generation of moisture maps, vegetation, ice and snow cover, shoreline position, and erosion\u2013deposition processes. The two-dimensional sonic provides continuous wind speed and direction, and the saltation probes record the intensity of transport events. The result is a large geodatabase of a time series of factors affecting eolian processes at the beach at a variety of temporal and spatial scales. This geodatabase can be queried, and it is a valuable tool for studying the frequency and magnitude of events delivering sediment from the beach to the dune and thus for improving our knowledge of sediment transport at coastal areas. Although the remote sensing station was initially conceived as a tool to measure subaerial processes, a full year of measurements shows large potential for the system to provide information on processes at the nearshore environment and ice dynamics. /// Este art\u00edculo describe una Estaci\u00f3n de Teledetecci\u00f3n especialmente dise\u00f1ada para la investigaci\u00f3n de procesos e\u00f3licos en el sistema duna\u2013playa.

H33342 enters cells and targets DNA at adenine-thymine-rich regions of the minor groove. Considerable membrane blebbing and ruffling occur in CHO cells within minutes after its addition to the culture medium in micromolar quantities. Blue vesicles are apparent in the cell cytoplasm, and by 30 min the nuclei are stained dark blue. Upon its binding to DNA, a visible emission shift of the dye can be observed with fluorescence microscopy. We have radioiodinated (125I) H33342 and specifically irradiated nuclear DNA by incubating CHO cells with $^{125}I-H33342$ at 37\u00b0 C and accumulating 125I decays at $-90\\textdegree C$ . At various times, the cells are thawed and assayed for survival (clonogenicity) and $DSB (\\gamma-H2AX)$ formation. $^{125}I-H33342$ decay leads to a monoexponential decrease in cell survival with a $D_0 of 122 ^{125}I$ decays per cell and a linear increase in DNA DSB induction (equivalent to $15 \\gamma-H2AX$ foci/cell). Cell death is not modified by the radioprotective effects of H33342 because we use considerably lower concentrations than those that provide a slight protection against $\\gamma radiation$ . We conclude that cell killing by $^{125}I-H33342$ and the induction of $\\gamma-H2AX foci$ are highly Correlated.\n      </p>", "This article discusses the perceptual phenomenon of visual indeterminacy in an art-historical and scientific context and considers the phenomenon's role in certain heightened states of awareness.

In organisms, the maintenance of tissue function rather than the survival of individual cells ultimately determines outcome following thermal challenge. We used MDCK kidney epithelial cells to compare alterations in chaperone activity (as a measure of cellular tolerance) and epithelial barrier function (as a measure of physiological tolerance) after thermal challenge. Quercetin, an inhibitor of heat shock factor-dependent transcriptional activity, both potentiated the effects of heat on naive monolayers and blocked conditioning of monolayers following moderate heat shock, suggesting a central role of heat shock protein (HSP) family members in the maintenance of epithelial integrity. We used MDCK cells that constitutively overexpressed HSP70 to demonstrate 2 functionally distinct components of the response of monolayers to thermal stress. The maintenance of epithelial barrier function during exposure to elevated temperatures is regulated by a complex network of processes that involve the actions of HSP70 but that are independent of alterations in chaperone activity as reflected by changes in the thermal inactivation/refolding of luciferase. In contrast, the restoration of barrier function following a heat stress is directly modulated by HSP70 in a manner that can be fully accounted for by changes in chaperone activity. This study demonstrates an important, albeit complex, protective role for heat shock proteins in the modulation of MDCK epithelial barrier function following a thermal stress.\n      </p>", "Fourteen adult specimens of Berlandina nubivaga (Simon 1878) (two females and twelve males) were collected in Aosta Valley (NW Italy) by pitfall traps mostly placed in alpine pastures at about 2000 m elevation.

Each member of the family is expressed in a small percentage of neurons that are confined to one of several spatial zones in the nose but are randomly distributed throughout that zone. This pattern of expression suggests that when the sensory neuron selects which OR gene to express it may be confined to a particular zonal gene set of several hundred OR genes but select from among the members of that set via a stochastic mechanism. Both locus-dependent and locus-independent models of OR gene choice have been proposed. To investigate the feasibility of these models, we determined the chromosomal locations of 21 OR genes expressed in four different spatial zones. We found that OR genes are clustered within multiple loci that are broadly distributed in the genome. These loci lie within paralogous chromosomal regions that appear to have arisen by duplications of large chromosomal domains followed by extensive gene duplication and divergence. Our studies show that OR genes expressed in the same zone map to numerous loci; moreover, a single locus can contain genes expressed in different zones. These findings raise the possibility that OR gene choice may be locus-independent or involve consecutive stochastic choices.\n      </p>", "Chimpanzees are the closest evolutionary cousins of humans, sharing &gt;99% identity in most protein sequences. Plasmodium falciparum is the major worldwide cause of malaria mortality. Plasmodium reichenowi, a morphologically identical and genetically very similar parasite, infects chimpanzees but not humans. Conversely, experimental P. falciparum infection causes brief moderate parasitization and no severe infection in chimpanzees. This surprising host specificity remains unexplained. We modified and enhanced traditional methods for measuring sialic acid (Sia)-dependent recognition of glycophorins by merozoite erythrocyte-binding proteins, eliminating interference caused by endogenous Sias on transfected cells, and by using erythroleukemia cells to allow experimental manipulation of Sia content. We present evidence that these remarkable differences among such closely related host-parasite pairs is caused by species-specific erythrocyte-recognition profiles, apparently related to the human-specific loss of the common primate Sia N-glycolylneuraminic acid. The major merozoite-binding protein erythrocyte-binding antigen-175 of P. falciparum apparently evolved to take selective advantage of the excess of the Sia N-acetylneuraminic acid (the precursor of N-glycolylneuraminic acid) on human erythrocytes. The contrasting preference of P. reichenowi erythrocyte-binding antigen-175 for N-glycolylneuraminic acid is likely the ancestral condition. The surprising ability of P. falciparum to cause disease in New World Aotus monkeys (geographically isolated from P. falciparum until arrival of peoples from the Old World) can be explained by parallel evolution of a human-like Sia expression pattern in these distantly related primates. These results also have implications for the prehistory of hominids and for the genetic origins and recent emergence of P. falciparum as a major human pathogen.\n      </p>", "Salmonids undergo a developmental transition from parr to smolt that involves a number of physiological and morphological changes. In recent years, my laboratory has studied shifts in red muscle function at this parr-smolt transformation (PST) in rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Parr red muscle has faster contraction kinetics than smolts, including faster rates of activation and relaxation and a faster maximum shortening velocity. At PST, a transition in swimming behavior is also observed, with lower tailbeat frequencies and longer EMG duty cycles in the older smolts. Lastly, there is molecular correlate to changes in kinetics and behavior. During PST, there is a developmental reduction in the number of myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms in the red muscle of rainbow trout. Since MHC composition of muscle can determine contractile properties, these molecular results suggest a mechanism for the transition in red muscle kinetics and steady swimming. The red muscle of parr is more likely to contain the fast-twitch or white isoform of MHC, resulting in faster contractile properties of that muscle and higher tailbeat frequencies during steady swimming. Lastly, experimental work supports the conclusion that the shift in kinetics causes the observed shift in swimming behavior.\n      </p>", "The aborigines of Taiwan represent the indigenous inhabitants of the island at the time of the arrival of the Chinese from the mainland. Linguistically, the aboriginal Taiwanese are related to the Malayo-Polynesianspeaking inhabitants of Indonesia and the Philippines. Three tribes occupied lowland areas while six tribes occupied highland areas. Previous studies indicate that genetic markers associated with malaria occur in lowland populations. Though the GM haplotypes are demonstrated to be very useful in the measure of population affinities, the possibility of malarial selection on this locus could affect studies of population affinity. The present work is a case study to see whether a subdivided insular population under a possible selective load will provide divergent clustering analysis depending on the population sampled. Immunoglobulin allotype (GM and KM) profiles were generated on 230 lowland and 407 highland Taiwan Aborigines from the nine tribes. highly significant difference in GM haplotype distribution was detected between lowland and highland populations (adjusted G = 69.408, 2 df [degrees of freedom], \u00f1 &lt; 0.00001). There were no significant differences in KM*1 frequency by altitude. The Taiwan Aboriginal GM and KM frequencies were compared to data from Indonesians, Vietnamese, Thai, Malay, Chinese from Taiwan, and Ryukyu Islanders from Okinawa using cluster analysis. The lowland populations plot among the Thai (N, NC) and Malayan Aborigines. In contrast, the highland and total Taiwan Aborigine samples plot with the Indonesian, Vietnamese, and Malayan Negrito samples. Thus, depending on the populations of Taiwan Aborigines used, different conclusions could be reached. The highland population supports the published linguistic ties; however, the lowland population does not support the linguistic relationship with Indonesian populations but is more closely related to Thai and Malays, or reflects a similar selection history.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "To evaluate the role of Methanosaeta spp. in a variety of anaerobic environments, small-subunit rRNA targeted oligonucleotide hybridization probes were developed and experimentally characterized. The probes were designed to be genus specific for Methanosaeta and species specific for Methanosaeta concilii and Methanosaeta thermophila. The temperature of dissociation was determined for each probe. Probe specificities were determined using a diverse collection of Archaea and through an evaluation of probe nesting using samples from a variety of anaerobic bioreactors. Cell fixation and hybridization conditions for fluorescence in situ hybridizations were also evaluated. Although permeability of methanogens was variable, M. concilii cells could be permeabilized using a range of paraformaldehyde and ethanol based fixation conditions. Using the newly designed probes together with previously designed probes for methanogens, it was determined that Methanosaeta spp. were the dominant aceticlastic methanogens in a variety of anaerobic bioreactors when acetate concentrations were low. Their levels were higher in bioreactors with granular sludge than in those with flocculent sludge. In lab-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors, the levels of M. concilii rRNA were as high as 30% of the total rRNA.\n      </p>", "Conservation and management of snow leopards (Uncia uncia) has largely relied on anecdotal evidence and presence-absence data due to their cryptic nature and the difficult terrain they inhabit. These methods generally lack the scientific rigor necessary to accurately estimate population size and monitor trends. We evaluated the use of photography in capture-mark-recapture (CMR) techniques for estimating snow leopard population abundance and density within Hemis National Park, Ladakh, India. We placed infrared camera traps along actively used travel paths, scent-sprayed rocks, and scrape sites within 16- to &lt;tex-math&gt;$30\\text{-}{\\rm km}^{2}$&lt;/tex-math&gt; sampling grids in successive winters during January and March 2003-2004. We used head-on, oblique, and side-view camera configurations to obtain snow leopard photographs at varying body orientations. We calculated snow leopard abundance estimates using the program CAPTURE. We obtained a total of 66 and 49 snow leopard captures resulting in 8.91 and 5.63 individuals per 100 trap-nights during 2003 and 2004, respectively. We identified snow leopards based on the distinct pelage patterns located primarily on the forelimbs, flanks, and dorsal surface of the tail. Capture probabilities ranged from 0.33 to 0.67. Density estimates ranged from 8.49 (SE = 0.22) individuals per 100 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 2003 to 4.45 (SE = 0.16) in 2004. We believe the density disparity between years is attributable to different trap density and placement rather than to an actual decline in population size. Our results suggest that photographic capture-mark-recapture sampling may be a useful tool for monitoring demographic patterns. However, we believe a larger sample size would be necessary for generating a statistically robust estimate of population density and abundance based on CMR models.\n      </p>", "We describe a method to quantify color in complex patterns on insects, using a combination of standardized illumination and image analysis techniques.

Live specimens were photographed in a light-box with standardized lighting and a color standard. Digital images were processed in LensEye\u00ae software to determine the percentage of selected colors. No significant differences were found in the percentage of blue between yellow and dark morph females, but the percentage of orange hues between P. g. glaucus and P. g. maynardi differed significantly.

Current models propose that ligand binding to heterodimeric Notch (hNotch) induces a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) proteolytic release of the Notch extracellular domain (NECD), which is subsequently shed and/or endocytosed by DSL ligand cells. We provide evidence for NECD release and internalization by DSL ligand cells, which, surprisingly, did not require ADAM activity. However, losses in either hNotch formation or ligand endocytosis significantly decreased NECD transfer to DSL ligand cells, as well as signaling in Notch cells. Because endocytosis-defective ligands bind hNotch, but do not dissociate it, additional forces beyond those produced through ligand binding must function to disrupt the intramolecular interactions that keep hNotch intact and inactive. Based on our findings, we propose that mechanical forces generated during DSL ligand endocytosis function to physically dissociate hNotch, and that dissociation is a necessary step in Notch activation.\n      </p>", "In mammals, olfactory stimuli are detected by sensory neurons at two distinct sites: the olfactory epithelium (OE) of the nasal cavity and the neuroepithelium of the vomeronasal organ (VNO). While the OE can detect volatile chemicals released from numerous sources, the VNO appears to be specialized to detect pheromones that are emitted by other animals and that convey information of behavioral or physiological importance. The mechanisms underlying sensory transduction in the OE have been well studied and a number of components of the transduction cascade have been cloned. Here, we investigated sensory transduction in the VNO by asking whether VNO neurons express molecules that have been implicated in sensory transduction in the OE. Using in situ hybridization and Northern blot analyses, we found that most of the olfactory transduction components examined, including the guanine nucleotide binding protein \u03b1 subunit (G&lt;sub&gt;\u03b1 olf&lt;/sub&gt;), adenylyl cyclase type III, and an olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel subunit (oCNC1), are not expressed by VNO sensory neurons. In contrast, VNO neurons do express a second olfactory CNG channel subunit (oCNC2). These results indicate that VNO sensory transduction is distinct from that in the OE but raise the possibility that, like OE sensory transduction, sensory transduction in the VNO might involve cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels.\n      </p>", "Cerebellar granule cells are the most abundant neurons in the brain, and granule cell precursors (GCPs) are a common target of transformation in the pediatric brain tumor medulloblastoma. Proliferation of GCPs is regulated by the secreted signaling molecule Sonic hedgehog (Shh), but the mechanisms by which Shh controls proliferation of GCPs remain inadequately understood. We used DNA microarrays to identify targets of Shh in these cells and found that Shh activates a program of transcription that promotes cell cycle entry and DNA replication. Among the genes most robustly induced by Shh are cyclin D1 and N-myc. N-myc transcription is induced in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, so it appears to be a direct target of Shh. Retroviral transduction of N-myc into GCPs induces expression of cyclin D1, E2F1, and E2F2, and promotes proliferation. Moreover, dominant-negative N-myc substantially reduces Shh-induced proliferation, indicating that N-myc is required for the Shh response. Finally, cyclin D1 and N-myc are overexpressed in murine medulloblastoma. These findings suggest that cyclin D1 and N-myc are important mediators of Shh-induced proliferation and tumorigenesis.\n      </p>", "Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is a long-day plant whose flowering is enhanced when the photoperiod is supplemented with far-red light, and this promotion is mediated by phytochrome. A chemically mutagenized dwarf cultivar of barley was selected for early flowering time (barley maturity daylength response [BMDR]-1) and was made isogenic with the cultivar Shabet (BMDR-8) by backcrossing. BMDR-1 was found to contain higher levels of both phytochrome A and phytochrome B in the dark on immunoblots with monoclonal antibodies from oat (Avena sativa L.) that are specific to different members of the phytochrome gene family. Phytochrome A was light labile in both BMDR-1 and BMDR-8, decreasing to very low levels after 4 d of growth in the light. Phytochrome B was light stable in BMDR-8, being equal in both light and darkness. However, phytochrome B became light labile in BMDR-1 and this destabilization of phytochrome B appeared to make BMDR-1 insensitive to photoperiod. In addition, both the mutant and the wild type lacked any significant promotion of flowering in response to a pulse of far-red light given at the end of day, and the end-of-day, far-red inhibition of tillering is normal in both, suggesting that phytochrome B is not involved with these responses in barley.\n      </p>", "An exceptionally well-preserved white shark fossil (Carcharodon sp.) is described here from the early Pliocene (ca. 4 Ma) Pisco Formation of southwestern Peru. This specimen preserves 222 teeth and 45 vertebrae as well as fragmentary jaws. The teeth show characters of Carcharodon, including weak serrations and a symmetrical first anterior tooth that is the largest in the tooth row. This dentition also shows a character of Isurus with a distally inclined but mesially slanted intermediate tooth. Although the Pisco specimen demonstrates characters of both Isurus, also known form the Pisco Formation, and modern Carcharodon carcharias, it is assigned to the genus Carcharodon and referred to herein as Carcharodon sp. While Carcharodon sp. From the Pisco Formation shows numerous diagnostic characteristics shared with C. carcharias, it differs from the extant species in having a distal inclination of the intermediate tooth. The precaudal vertebral centra of the Pisco Carcharodon preserve distinctive dark and light incremental bands that, based on calibration with oxygen isotopes, indicate annular growth couplets. The fossil shark was at least 20 (\u00b11) years old at the time of its death. Based on measurements of teeth and vertebral centra, this specimen is estimated to have had a minimum total body length of 4.80-5.07 m, similar to estimates for modern older individuals of C. carcharias. Relative to the extant Carcharodon carcharias, the Pisco Carcharodon sp. grew at a slower rate. The fossil record of lamnoid sharks preserved in the Pisco Formation demonstrates that the modern white shark is more closely related to Isurus (I. hastalis) than it is to the species Carcharodon megalodon, and the latter is therefore best allocated to the genus Carcharocles.\n      </p>", "The feasibility of creating new enzyme activities from enzymes of known function has precedence in view of protein evolution based on the concepts of molecular recruitment and exon shuffling. The enzymes encoded by the Escherichia coli genes purU and purN, N&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;-formyltetrahydrofolate hydrolase and glycinamide ribonucleotide (GAR) transformylase, respectively, catalyze similiar yet distinct reactions. N&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;-formyltetrahydrofolate hydrolase uses water to cleave N&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;-formyltetrahydrofolate into tetrahydrofolate and formate, whereas GAR transformylase catalyses the transfer of formyl from N&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;-formyltetrahydrofolate to GAR to yield formyl-GAR and tetrahydrofolate. The two enzymes show significant homology (\u2248 60%) in the carboxyl-terminal region which, from the GAR transformylase crystal structure and labeling studies, is known to be the site of N&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;-formyltetrahydrofolate binding. Hybrid proteins were created by joining varying length segments of the N-terminal region of the PurN gene (GAR binding region) and the C-terminal (N&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;-formyltetrahydrofolate binding) region of PurU. Active PurN/PurU hybrids were then selected for by their ability to complement an auxotrophic E. coli strain. Hybrids able to complement the auxotrophs were purified to homogeneity and assayed for activity. The specific activity of two hybrid proteins was within 100- to 1000-fold of the native purN GAR transformylase validating the approach of constructing an enzyme active site from functional parts of others.\n      </p>", "To investigate the relation between lake type and bacterioplankton community composition, five Swedish lakes, which differed from each other in nutrient content and water color, were studied. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rDNA was used to examine community composition. The DGGE-patterns of the different samples were analyzed in relation to physical, chemical, and biological data from the lakes by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). The three variables found to most strongly correlate with the DGGE patterns were biomasses of microzooplankton, cryptophytes, and chrysophytes, suggesting that these biota had an impact on bacterioplankton community structure. Two of the three factors were, in turn, significantly correlated to parameters associated with the trophic status of the lakes, indicating that the nutrient content of the lakes, at least indirectly, influenced the structure of the bacterioplankton community. The relation to water color was less pronounced.\n      </p>", "MutS and MutL homologs have been implicated in multiple genetic stabilization pathways. The activities participate in the correction of DNA biosynthetic errors, are involved in cellular responses to certain types of DNA damage, and serve to ensure the fidelity of genetic recombination. We show here that the rate of CAD (carbamyl-P synthetase/aspartate transcarbamylase/dihydroorotase) gene amplification is elevated 50- to 100-fold in human cell lines deficient in MLH1 or MSH6, as compared with mismatch repair-proficient control cells. Fluorescence in situ hybridization indicates that these amplification events are the probable consequence of unequal sister chromatid exchanges involving chromosome 2, as well as translocation events involving other chromosomes. These results implicate MutS\u03b1 and MutL\u03b1 in the suppression of gene amplification and suggest that defects in this genetic stabilization function may contribute to the cancer predisposition associated with mismatch repair deficiency.\n      </p>", "Etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor widely used in cancer therapy, is suspected of inducing secondary tumors and affecting the genetic constitution of germ cells. A better understanding of the potential heritable risk of etoposide is needed to provide sound genetic counseling to cancer patients treated with this drug in their reproductive years. We used a mouse model to investigate the effects of clinical doses of etoposide on the induction of chromosomal abnormalities in spermatocytes and their transmission to zygotes by using a combination of chromosome painting and 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. High frequencies of chromosomal aberrations were detected in spermatocytes within 64 h after treatment when over 30% of the metaphases analyzed had structural aberrations (P &lt; 0.01). Significant increases in the percentages of zygotic metaphases with structural aberrations were found only for matings that sampled treated pachytene (28-fold, P &lt; 0.0001) and preleptotene spermatocytes (13-fold, P &lt; 0.001). Etoposide induced mostly acentric fragments and deletions, types of aberrations expected to result in embryonic lethality, because they represent loss of genetic material. Chromosomal exchanges were rare. Etoposide treatment of pachytene cells induced aneuploidy in both spermatocytes (18-fold, P &lt; 0.01) and zygotes (8-fold, P &lt; 0.05). We know of no other report of an agent for which paternal exposure leads to an increased incidence of aneuploidy in the offspring. Thus, we found that therapeutic doses of etoposide affect primarily meiotic germ cells, producing unstable structural aberrations and aneuploidy, effects that are transmitted to the progeny. This finding suggests that individuals who undergo chemotherapy with etoposide may be at a higher risk for abnormal reproductive outcomes especially within the 2 months after chemotherapy.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "In the early days of computer graphics, artists had to learn programming in order to use the new technology.

During apoptosis this balance is altered, leading to an extensive fragmentation of the mitochondria. Here, we describe a novel assay of mitochondrial dynamics based on confocal imaging of cells expressing a mitochondrial matrix-targeted photoactivable green fluorescent protein that enables detection and quantification of organelle fusion in living cells. Using this assay, we visualize and quantitate mitochondrial fusion rates in healthy and apoptotic cells. During apoptosis, mitochondrial fusion is blocked independently of caspase activation. The block in mitochondrial fusion occurs within the same time range as Bax coalescence on the mitochondria and outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, and it may be a consequence of Bax/Bak activation during apoptosis.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Continuous exposure to oxygen is essential for nearly all vertebrates. We found that embryos of the zebrafish Danio rerio can survive for 24 h in the absence of oxygen (anoxia, 0% O2). In anoxia, zebrafish entered a state of suspended animation where all microscopically observable movement ceased, including cell division, developmental progression, and motility. Animals that had developed a heartbeat before anoxic exposure showed no evidence of a heartbeat until return to terrestrial atmosphere (normoxia, 20.8% O2). In analyzing cell-cycle changes of rapidly dividing blastomeres exposed to anoxia, we found that no cells arrested in mitosis. This is in sharp contrast to similarly staged normoxic embryos that consistently contain more than 15% of cells in mitosis. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that blastomeres arrested during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. This work indicates that survival of oxygen deprivation in vertebrates involves the reduction of diverse processes, such as cardiac function and cell-cycle progression, thus allowing energy supply to be matched by energy demands.\n      </p>", "In the course of a study on the early events of cambial derivative differentiation in Populus \u00d7 euramericana, seasonal changes in the pattern of pectin methylesterase (PME, EC 3.1.1.11) isoforms were followed. During the resting season, cell wall extracts contained mainly alkaline isoforms with an Mr around 55 kDa and optimal pH between 5.6 and 6.0. Neutral isoforms with an Mr around 35 kDa and optimal pH between 6.0 and 6.6 predominated in the extracts during the period of high meristematic activity. In the active cambial initials and in their immediate derivatives, the enzymes were immunolocalized exclusively in the dictyosomes. In older cells, they were present both in dictyosomes and in wall junctions. These results indicate that exportation of neutral PMEs towards the walls might be considered as an early marker of differentiation in cambial derivatives.\n      </p>", "Pore surface properties control oil recovery. This is especially true for chalk reservoirs, where pores are particularly small. Wettability, the tendency for a surface to cover itself with fluid, is traditionally defined by the angle a droplet makes with a surface, but this macroscopic definition is meaningless when the particles are smaller than even the smallest droplet. Understanding surface wetting, at the pore scale, will provide clues for more effective oil recovery. We used a special mode of atomic force microscopy and a hydrophobic tip to collect matrices of 10,000 force curves over 5-x 5-\u03bcm\u00b2 areas on internal pore surfaces and constructed maps of topography, adhesion, and elasticity. We investigated chalk samples from a water-bearing formation in the Danish North Sea oil fields that had never seen oil. Wettability and elasticity were inhomogeneous over scales of 10s of nanometers, smaller than individual chalk particles. Some areas were soft and hydrophobic, whereas others showed no correlation between hardness and adhesion. We conclude that the macroscopic parameter, \"wetting,\" averages the nanoscopic behavior along fluid pathways, and \"mixed-wet\" samples have patches with vastly different properties. Development of reservoir hydrophobicity has been attributed to infiltrating oil, but these new results prove that wettability and elasticity are inherent properties of chalk. Their variability, even on single particles, must result from material originally present during sedimentation or material sorbed from the pore fluid some time later.\n      </p>", "Dissociated remains of the acanthodian Poracanthodes punctatus are described from Upper Silurian (Pridoli) limestones of the Roberts Mountains Formation at Pete Hanson Creek, Eureka County, Nevada. The vertebrate microremains in sample residues comprise scales, a dentigerous jaw bone fragment, and a fin spine fragment assigned to P. punctatus, plus one possible acanthothoracid placoderm scale. Some macroremains from the same locality are also assigned to P. punctatus. This taxon has been nominated as a zone fossil for the Silurian vertebrate biozonal scheme, and its presence has been recorded throughout the circum-Arctic region. Identification of the taxon in Nevada extends its known geographic range.\n      </p>", "A major pathway of eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA) turnover begins with deadenylation, followed by decapping and 5' to 3' exonucleolytic decay. We provide evidence that mRNA decapping and 5' to 3' degradation occur in discrete cytoplasmic foci in yeast, which we call processing bodies (P bodies). First proteins that activate or catalyze decapping are concentrated in P bodies. Second, inhibiting mRNA turnover before decapping leads to loss of P bodies; however, inhibiting turnover at, or after, decapping, increases the abundance and size of P bodies. Finally, mRNA degradation intermediates are localized to P bodies. These results define the flux of mRNAs between polysomes and P bodies as a critical aspect of cytoplasmic mRNA metabolism and a possible site for regulation of mRNA degradation.\n      </p>"],
