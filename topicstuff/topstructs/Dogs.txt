{"total_words": 999, "documents": ["We compared over-winter body temperature (Tb) patterns for more than 6 months in adult (&gt;1 year) black-tailed (Cynomys ludovicianus) and Utah (C. parvidens) prairie dogs from colonies located along gradients of elevation in northern Colorado and southern Utah. In general, black-tailed prairie dogs entered torpor facultatively during winter, whereas Utah prairie dogs hibernated continuously for extended periods. Both black-tailed and Utah prairie dogs displayed significant differences in Tb patterns across elevations, with lower elevation populations entering more shallow and infrequent torpor than prairie dogs at higher elevations. Tb patterns of black-tailed prairie dogs followed 24-h cycles, as most prairie dogs entered into and aroused from torpor between 1100 and 1700 h and bout lengths were clustered around 24-h intervals and multiples thereof. Torpor in Utah prairie dogs did not display the same daily patterns; they entered into and aroused from torpor at all times of the day, and bout lengths were variable. Although black-tailed and Utah prairie dogs are closely related, mechanisms that stimulate and control torpor might differ between them.\n      </p>", "Once absent in much of Amazonia, dogs are now commonly used for hunting throughout the lowland Neotropics. Although some ethnographers have questioned their usefulness, dogs are particularly effective in pursuits of several mammalian prey species. The return rates of hunting with dogs appear to compare favorably with those of hunting with firearms, and dogs may be especially beneficial in anthropogenic habitats. There is considerable cross-cultural variation in the training and care of dogs. Good hunting dogs typically receive better care than their less-talented conspecifics. Mortality rates for dogs in the Neotropics are high, and the causes of death include malnutrition and attacks by other animals. Although isolated Neotropical societies may not have initially recognized the overall value of hunting dogs, a more likely explanation for the absence of dogs in prehistoric Amazonia is the high mortality of dog populations in the region. Additional research is needed to resolve ethnological questions about the use of dogs in the lowland Neotropics.\n      </p>", "Seventy-four healthy mixed-breed dogs were studied collecting behavioural data by means of 'focal animal sampling' and 'all occurrences' methods; the ethogram utilised consisted of more than 100 behavioural patterns. All dogs were taken outside the shelter for a walk to analyse their reaction to a novel environment. In addition, three faecal samples were collected from each dog on three consecutive days during daily routine, to measure the levels of cortisol metabolites (CM) to evaluate adrenocortical activity. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) identified five primary factors: 'subordination/aggressiveness', 'intraspecific dominance-activity', 'anxiety-sociability towards dogs', 'playfulness' and 'sociability towards humans'. Dogs that showed a confident-independent temperament in a familiar context (within the shelter), showed fear in novel situations (outside the shelter). Despite the absence of a proper control we hypothesise that the stress levels were low both behaviourally and physiologically: neither stereotypies nor inactivity and lack of interest in the surrounding environment was observed, and the median CM concentration was moderately low. Lower concentrations of faecal CM were recorded in dogs with a temperament 'sociable to human beings' which were also associated with a longer stay in the shelter.\n      </p>", "Officials in Fort Collins, Colorado, have encountered public disagreement over prairie dog (Cynomys spp.) management in the city but have lacked objective information about conflict with prairie dogs, as well as the knowledge levels and attitudes of the public. Using a survey of Fort Collins residents (n=87) living near prairie dog colonies and a random sample (n=559) of the city's general population, we assessed conflict with prairie dogs, compared attitudes toward prairie dogs and management preferences between residents near colonies and the general population, and tested for association between knowledge levels and attitudes toward prairie dogs and management preferences. Seventy percent of the respondents living adjacent to prairie dogs reported having problems with them; respondents with natural grassland or pasture land on their property were most likely to report problems. Compared to the general population, respondents living near colonies were more likely to express negative attitudes toward prairie dogs (P&lt;0.01), more likely to prefer poisoning prairie dogs over capturing and relocating (P&lt;0.01), and more knowledgeable about prairie dogs (P&lt;0.001). A management approach combining preservation and control was advocated by 84% of respondents living near prairie dogs and 68% of the general population. Among the general population, respondents with greater knowledge about prairie dogs were more likely to agree (P&lt;0.05) that the rodents keep hawks and eagles nearby and that destroying prairie dogs lowers the risk of disease for pets and the risk of injury to horses. Respondents with greater knowledge also were more likely to agree with using poisons to remove prairie dogs from an area (P&lt;0.001) and less likely to agree with using capture and relocation (P&lt;0.001). However, knowledge was not associated (P&gt;0.05) with attitudes toward prairie dogs or with acceptance of a management approach combining preservation and control.\n      </p>", "This study addressed behavioral responses by black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) to human intrusion in urban and rural environments in Boulder, Colorado. We expected that if prairie dogs habituate to repeated disturbances, they should allow a recurring human intruder to approach closer over time before sounding an alarm bark or initiating concealment. We also predicted that urban colonies could be approached more closely than rural colonies before displaying an avoidance response. Four colonies (2 rural and 2 urban) were approached MOO times over a 7-month period. Rather than exhibiting habituation, prairie dogs demonstrated increased responsiveness in concealment behavior, retreating to their burrows earlier, with recurring disturbances. Barking distances did not change consistently with repeated intrusion, but, over time, prairie dogs barked less frequently when performing their avoidance response, a result with implications for prairie dog management. Rural colonies had higher initial concealment distances, and these distances increased more rapidly with repeated intrusion than did concealment distances in urban colonies. Thus, rural prairie dogs may be more sensitive to human intrusion than urban prairie dogs.\n      </p>", "We investigated dogs' ability to take the visual perspective of humans. In the main study, each of two toys was placed on the dog's side of two small barriers (one opaque, one transparent). In experimental conditions, a human sat on the opposite side of the barriers, such that she could see only the toy behind the transparent barrier. The experimenter then told the dog to 'Bring it here!' (without designating either toy in any way). In the Back Turned control E also sat on the opposite side but with her back turned so that she could see neither toy, and in the Same Side control she sat on the same side as the dog such that she could see both toys. When toys were differentiable dogs approached the toy behind the transparent barrier in experimental as compared to back turned and same side condition. Dogs did not differentiate between the two control conditions. In a second study dogs were not sensitive to what a human had or had not seen in the immediate past. These results suggest that, even in the absence of overt behavioural cues, dogs are sensitive to others visual access, even if that differs from their own.\n      </p>", "Scent-matching dogs have previously been used to identify caged individual Amur tigers (Panthera tigris altaica) by fecal material (scat), but this technique has not been tested in the wild. We tested the hypothesis that trained dogs can identify individual tigers by unique characteristics present in scat. To conduct this work, we used 5 dogs and 58 scats from 25 known individual tigers in independent trials. Dogs correctly selected matched test scats at an average rate of 87% (SE \u00b1 1.4%, n - 521 trials). The average accuracy rates for 4 dogs increased to 98% (SE \u00b1 1.6%, n - 86 sets of repeated-trials) using repeated-trial tests. Each of 5 dogs made correct choices better than expected by chance (dog 1 \u03c7\u00b2\u2081 507.9, P \u2264 0.001; dog 2 \u03c7\u00b2\u2081 = 882.1, P \u2264 0.001; dog 3 \u03c7\u00b2\u2081 = 374.1, P \u2264 0.001; dog 4 \u03c7\u00b2\u2081 = 379.2, P \u2264 0.001; and dog 5 \u03c7\u00b2\u2081 = 103.9, P \u2264 0.001). Four dogs were able to match 11 scats deposited over a 4-year period from one tiger with an accuracy of 100% (n = 40 trails). This method may be a useful alternative to genetic analyses that are used in conjunction with scat-sampling schemes in studies for which DNA genotyping is impractical or ineffective. Used with mark-recapture surveys to estimate species abundance, scent matching dogs have the potential of being important tools in the study of wild Amur tigers, as well as other wildlife species.\n      </p>", "Recent genetic studies indicate that the wolf ancestors of New World dogs were domesticated in East Asia, about 15,000 cal. BP. Although archaeological evidence of the earliest American dogs is very scarce, they probably accompanied the Paleoindians who crossed Beringia and occupied North America after 13,500 cal. BP. By providing humans with hunting assistance and transport capability, as well as an emergency food source, dogs may have facilitated the very rapid expansion of Paleoindians. As hunters or as disease carriers, dogs may also have played a role in megafaunal extinction.\n      </p>", "Currently available methods of estimating northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) abundance are often expensive and time-consuming; therefore, additional research is necessary to develop new tools. Using Global Positioning System (GPS) and Geographic Information System technologies and distance-sampling theory, we developed a method of estimating bobwhite density during hunts with pointing dogs. Data collection occurred during the 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 hunting seasons in western Oklahoma and northern Texas, USA. We estimated effective strip width (ESW) of a bird dog's path using distance-sampling theory and point-to-flush distances. For coveys &gt;7 birds (n = 58), estimated ESW was 13.2 m (95% CI = 11.1-15.6 m). Area searched by one dog was its GPS path buffered by ESW. For \u22652 dogs, area searched was the union of the areas of individual dogs; taking the union eliminated between- or among-dog redundancy in searched areas. A point estimate of density was number of birds flushed on a hunt divided by searched area. During the 2005-2006 hunting season, bobwhite density averaged 1.4 birds/ha (\u00b10.28 SE; n = 33). Average density declined to 0.2 birds/ha (\u00b10.07 SE) during 2006-2007 (n = 46). Estimating bobwhite density with pointing dogs needs further testing and development, but the technique may prove useful in research and management.\n      </p>", "The prevalence of IgG antibodies to spotted fever group rickettsiae was studied by the indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay in a sample of 194 canine sera from different parts of Croatia. Dogs (n = 141) from urban and suburban-semirural environs from the middle part of the eastern coast of Adriatic sea, and dogs (n = 53) from Zagreb, the capital of Croatia located in the northern continental part of Croatia, were tested. The total of 88 (62.4%) dogs from southern coastal Croatia had antibodies to Rickettsia conorii, with a significantly higher prevalence (69.9%) in suburban-semirural areas. The prevalence rate of antibodies to Rickettsia conorii in canine sera from urban environment in the north of Croatia was 20.7%. The results show that the members of spotted fever group rickettsiae are present in both coastal and continental Croatia.\n      </p>", "Black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) were greatly reduced in number and range in the last century, which is of conservation concern because their activities promote habitat heterogeneity and enhance biodiversity in prairie ecosystems. Based on their behavioral ecology, we hypothesized that prairie dogs would expand into areas adjacent to active colonies where woody shrubs and other visual obstructions were reduced, and designed an experimental study to assess this possibility at Theodore National Park, North Dakota. A combination of controlled burns and brush removal was applied to 2-ha experimental plots at 3 different prairie dog study colonies where adjacent control plots were left untreated. Systematic behavioral observations and periodic colony mapping revealed a strongly disproportionate use of experimental compared to control plots by prairie dogs over a 1.5-year period. More prairie dogs ventured into experimental plots than into control plots and there were an average of 335 new burrows and a mean 50.3% expansion into experimental plot areas compared to an average of 69 new burrows and a mean 1.6% expansion in control plots. Our results indicate that it may be possible to facilitate restoration of black-tailed prairie dogs by habitat manipulations, ultimately benefiting multiple native species in prairie ecosystems.\n      </p>", "Accurate assessments of local population size of the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) are essential because of their overall decline and importance to prairie ecosystems. We describe the use of mark-resight methodology to estimate black-tailed prairie dog population size and density. Study colonies include isolated urban habitat fragments in Denver, Colorado, USA, and unfragmented control colonies in the Pawnee National Grassland, USA. We compare results from various mark-resight estimators to those derived from linear transformations of visual counts of active prairie dogs. Our results suggest that mark-resight methods are feasible in both urban and rural systems, and reveal extremely high densities for isolated prairie dogs in urban sites. Our methodology can be used to obtain reliable, unbiased estimates of local population size and density.\n      </p>", "This field report describes seven models for incorporating dogs into the school setting. Model one delineates how a special education teacher conducts a weekly dog-training program in her self-contained classroom. Model two explains how a teacher uses her three Labradors to assist in character education lessons, as well as in her special education resource room. Models three and four report how general education teachers have incorporated dogs at the middle and secondary levels. Models five, six and seven depict how school counselors at the elementary and secondary levels have included dogs in their practices. Lastly, the educators illustrated in this article provide suggestions for successfully incorporating a dog.\n      </p>", "This paper explores concepts of animality found among the Nuaulu of Seram, eastern Indonesia, with special reference to the position of dogs. It argues that it is insufficient to say that dogs are simply a preeminent case of the class \"domesticated animal,\" as this is weak in Nuaulu representations and practice. The relationship between humans and dogs is qualitatively unique, confounding symbolic generalisations. Nuaulu dogs are economically critical, companionable, and objects of sentiment, but when they underperform they are rejected and abused. Such contradictions indicate a tension between dependency (reflected in physical intimacy, anthropomorphization, naming, caring, prohibition on eating) and callousness (reflected in the manner of both their birth and death), which is linked to competing conceptions of animality.\n      </p>", "Gunnison's prairie dogs (Cynomys gunnisoni) are social North American ground squirrels whose social system has been shown to vary with food resource distributions, as predicted by the habitat variability--mating system model. We expanded this model to include the effects of variations in population densities, in addition to resource distributions, on both the social system and the individual mating strategies of Gunnison's prairie dogs. Specifically, we predicted that monogamy would be associated with uniform resources, regardless of population density, giving way to polygyny with increasing resource patchiness at intermediate densities, and to multiple males and females at high population densities. In addition, we predicted inbreeding at low densities and outbreeding at high densities on the basis of naturally low levels of genetic eity in this species. We tested these predictions by comparing social systems and mating strategies at two prairie dog colonies near Flagstaff, Arizona, during a 3-yr period of population increase. We observed variations in sociality to vary in the predicted fashion at both colonies, providing support for the plant patchiness--population density model.\n      </p>", "Noninvasive scat sampling methods can generate large samples sizes, collected over vast landscapes, ideal for addressing wildlife conservation and management questions. However, the cost of genotyping scat samples limits the accessibility of these techniques. We describe detection-dog methods for matching large numbers of scat samples to the individual, reducing or eliminating the need for sample genotyping. Three dogs correctly matched 25 out of 28 samples from 6 captive maned wolves (Chrysocyon brachyurus) of known identity. Sample scent-matching can increase overall accessibility and breadth of applications of noninvasive scat-collection methods to important landscape scale problems in wildlife sciences.\n      </p>", "The desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) is federally listed as \"threatened\" and is afforded protection in several U.S. states including California, Nevada, Utah, and Arizona. Numerous factors ranging from habitat destruction to disease are thought to contribute to the species' decline throughout its range. Data collection on desert tortoises in the wild is challenging because tortoises are secretive, and many age and size classes are virtually undetectable in the wild. Detection dogs have been used for decades to assist humans, and the use of dogs for wildlife surveys is of increasing interest to scientists and wildlife managers. To address the basic question of whether dogs could be used to survey for the desert tortoise, we quantified the reliability and efficacy of dogs trained for this purpose. Efficacy is the number of tortoises that dogs find out of a known population. Reliability is a measure of how many times a dog performs its trained alert when it has found a tortoise. A series of experimental trials were designed to statistically quantify these metrics in the field setting where dogs trained to locate live desert tortoises were tested on their ability to find them on the surface, in burrows, and in mark-recapture surveys. Results indicated that dogs are effective at and can safely locate desert tortoises with reliability on the surface and are capable of detecting tortoises in burrows under a range of environmental conditions. Dogs found tortoises at the same statistical rate at temperatures between 12\u00b0 and 27\u00b0C, relative humidity from 16% to 87%, and wind speeds up to 8 m/s. In both surface and burrow trials, dogs found &gt;90% of the experimental animals. In comparative studies with humans, dogs found tortoises as small as 30 mm, whereas the smallest tortoise located by human survey teams was 110 mm. Although not all dogs or dog teams meet the requirements to conduct wildlife surveys, results from this study show the promise in using dogs to increase our knowledge of rare, threatened, and endangered species through improved data collection methods.\n      </p>", "Eight dogs, having showed positivity to Rickettsia conorii in serum samples obtained during the spring and summer, were studied again by means of a second determination during the next winter, 4-10 months later. Serum titer became negative in six dogs, persisted high in one, and fell from 1:640 to 1:40 in another dog. This seasonal difference suggests a short persistence of antibodies in dogs after contact with R. conorii in the Mediterranean area.\n      </p>", "Social groups of philopatric female kin coupled with male-biased dispersal characterize many mammalian species. Such groups exhibit genetic properties, or gene dynamics (i.e., changes in genetic correlations), that potentially facilitate the evolution of group cohesion and cooperation. When groups fission, changes in gene dynamics occur that might affect cooperation. The distribution of females among coalitions newly formed via fission also may promote reproductive success by alleviating intraspecific competition. Families of black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus), called coteries, were observed during a 15-year study at Wind Cave National Park, South Dakota, and pedigrees of individuals were determined from livetrapping and electrophoretic analyses of paternity. We investigated the importance of coterie size, coterie density, and coancestry on the probability of fission; the effect of fissions on survivorship and territorial boundaries of coteries; and gene dynamics during and after fissions. Most new coteries occupied a subsection of the original territory. New coteries that contained a single female became extinct after about 1 year and their territories were usurped by adjacent coteries. Large coteries were more likely than smaller coteries to fission, but female coancestry within coteries usually did not influence the likelihood of fission, or the individuals that banded together in new groups. Members of new coteries interacted hostilely in the year after fission, but 1 or 2 generations elapsed before the new coteries became genetically distinct. We conclude that fission is probably driven by intraspecific competition within coteries rather than coancestry, and that coancestry does not explain the abrupt cessation of cooperation between individuals of the new coteries that result from fission.\n      </p>", "From the point of view of the human disease, dogs are the most important animal reservoir of Lyme borreliosis; therefore, they are used as 'sentinel animals'. In order to know the epidemiological characteristics of dogs with antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi, 146 canine sera samples collected during 1993-94 have been studied. The antibody detection was made by an indirect immunofluorescence method and confirmed by a haemagglutination test. Seventeen dogs (11.6%) were seropositive, of which seven were hunting dogs, three were shepherd dogs, five were domestic pets, one was a watchdog and one was a stray dog. Seven dogs had longhair phenotype, 2 medium length type, 4 hard-hair and the other 4 were short-haired. Twelve seropositive dogs were males and five were females. All seropositive dogs were more than 1 year old. The dogs with greater seroprevalence were those that harboured ticks more often than the rest. Spring and summer were the seasons when more ticks were observed. The seroprevalence found in dogs was similar to that previously obtained in humans in this area. This finding gave evidence to an intimate association between human and canine seroprevalence.\n      </p>", "Disease is increasingly recognized as a threat to the conservation of wildlife, and in many cases the source of disease outbreaks in wild carnivores is the domestic dog. For disease to spill over from a domestic to a wild population, three conditions must be satisfied: susceptibility of the wild species, presence of the disease agent in the domestic population, and contact between the two populations of interest. We investigated the potential for disease spillover from the domestic dog population to the wild carnivore population in the Isoso of Bolivia, an area of tropical dry forest contiguous with a national park. Using questionnaires and discussions with residents, we gathered data on the demography of dogs in the Isoso, including adult and neonatal mortality, litter size, and hunting frequency. We analyzed a large data set containing self-recorded information on hunting in various communities of the Isoso to determine the extent of dog participation in hunting and the duration of hunting trips. Finally, we took blood samples from dogs in the Isoso for a serosurvey of common canine pathogens. More than 95% of dogs had positive liters to canine distemper virus and canine parvovirus. There was also a high seroprevalence in dogs for other pathogens, a high population turnover of dogs (which may allow diseases to be maintained endemically), and frequent opportunities for contact between domestic and wild carnivores. Based on our results and the susceptibility of wild species previously reported in the literature, domestic dogs represent a disease risk for wildlife in the Bolivian Isoso.\n      </p>", "Black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colonies are important to many vertebrate populations in the shortgrass prairie ecosystem. Because it is often desirable to assess black-tailed prairie dog populations, and indirect methods generally are more economical than direct counts, we tested whether aboveground counts of black-tailed prairie dogs were related to burrow entrance densities. Higher densities of burrow entrances have been assumed to reflect higher prairie dog densities. We determined if maximum aboveground counts of black-tailed prairie dogs differed temporally in morning and evening in southwestern Kansas, compared maximum aboveground count data with burrow entrance densities, and evaluated the effect of juvenile prairie dog emergence on the temporal nature of morning and evening maximum aboveground counts. Average maximum aboveground counts varied temporally in the morning (P = 0.05) and evening (P = 0.03) but not in the morning with the emergence of juvenile prairie dogs (P = 0.23). Maximum counts were higher in the evening (P &lt; 0.001), and differed among low, medium, or high burrow entrance density areas (P = 0.02), but not linearly.\n      </p>", "This study addressed the initial effects of a reintroduction of Gunnison's prairie dogs (Cynomys gunnisoni) on resident small mammal and plant communities on the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge (SNWR), New Mexico. In spring 1997, 60 prairie dogs (36.8 kg live mass) were introduced onto a former prairie dog colony in a desert grassland site. Small mammals and vegetation were sampled on both a treatment (reintroduction site) and a control site (without prairie dogs) before and after the prairie dogs were reintroduced. We tested for differences in small mammal and plant community change during the 1st year of the colony's existence using repeated measures analysis of variance. Although prairie dog biomass was ca. 32 times greater than that of the resident rodent community (1.2 kg), reintroduction of prairie dogs had no significant effect on the resident small mammal and plant communities. Total biomass and abundance of rodents, and percent cover and species richness of plants did not change during the 1st year following reintroduction of prairie dogs. However, two rodent species showed significant differences in abundance between the prairie dog colony and the control site. The banner-tailed kangaroo rat (Dipodomys spectabilis) was significantly more abundant on the treatment site before and after reintroduction of prairie dogs. In contrast, the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) was significantly more abundant on the control site following reintroduction of prairie dogs. Habitat modifications made by the former prairie dog colony may be responsible for the habitat preferences observed by D. spectabilis and P. leucopus. Although reintroduction of prairie dogs had no observable influence on the resident small mammal and plant communities in the short-term, their influences may be more evident on a long-term time scale.\n      </p>", "Wildlife managers use carcass searches to assess mortality resulting from biological (e.g., diseases) and physical (e.g., structure collisions) sources. Carcass searches may occur over large areas and need to be completed rapidly because of scavenging and decomposition. However, small carcasses are often missed when dense vegetation is searched. We placed carcasses of house sparrows (Passer domesticus) in dense cover of residual and newly grown vegetation and compared searching efficiency of humans and canines. Dogs received no special training in searching for passerine carcasses. In 36 trials conducted in 5 \u00d7 40-m plots, human searchers found 45% (SD = 19) of the carcasses compared to 92% (SD = 13) for dogs (P=0.005). The ratio of recovered to missed carcasses was approximately 12:1 for dogs and 1:1 for humans. The improvement in searching efficiency using dogs was similar (P=0.58) between residual cover (searched in April) and new growth cover (searched in August). A greater rate of searching efficiency is obtained per unit of time by using dogs. Greater efficiency improves quantitative and qualitative assessments of avian mortality in the field.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "I measured rates of growth of individual Gunnison's prairie dogs (Cynomys gunnisoni) at three towns in the Moreno Valley, New Mexico; at an established prairie dog town (site 1) prior to a plague (Yersinia pestis) epizootic and at two towns reestablished after the epizootic (sites 2 and 3). Populations declined by &gt;99% during the epizootic. After the epizootic, adults had greater mass, and juveniles grew faster than before. At sites 2 and 3, juveniles had high interyear survival (39%), whereas at site 1, prior to plague, survival of juveniles was 17%. At sites 2 and 3, yearlings bred, whereas they did not at site 1. Mean litter size near the end of lactation was 1.5 at site 1 and 5.0 at sites 2 and 3. Application of observed demographic parameters to Leslie-matrix analysis indicated that projected size of population was declining (\u03bb = 0.829) at site 1 and was tripling annually (\u03bb = 2.905) at sites 2 and 3. The difference in \u03bb was mostly due to increased survivorship of juveniles and reproduction at an earlier age in the new towns.\n      </p>", "Conflicts between brown bears (Ursus arctos) and humans have occurred since both species first occupied habitats concurrently. Although the nature of bear-human conflicts has remained similar, methods for resolving them have improved with technological advances, to the extent that humans and bears now have a better chance of coexistence. Conflict-resolution techniques used in the United States and Russia differ due to the population status of brown bears in the 2 countries. Various techniques including aversive conditioning, deterrents, and relocation are commonly used in the United States; bears are removed from the population with the aid of Laika dogs in Russia. Combining techniques from both countries may significantly improve techniques previously used singularly. We discuss management implications for modifying grizzly bear behavior using Laika dogs and additional conditioning reinforcement techniques in the United States.\n      </p>", "Europe and North America share a similar history in the extirpation and subsequent recovery of large carnivore and ungulate species. Both continents face challenges and opportunities for managing human-wildlife conflict at the junction of livestock production and wildlife conservation. Predation of livestock and disease transmission between wildlife and livestock is an ongoing and escalating worldwide issue. In order to manage this conflict, producers need effective tools, and they have used livestock protection dogs (LPDs) for reducing predation for well over 2000 years. We review the history of the use of LPDs, including the loss of information on their use and the paucity of scientific research on their effectiveness. We discuss the potential for LPDs to be integral components in modern-day livestock husbandry and outline future directions to pursue.\n      </p>", "The general public often prefers nonlethality when dealing with problem black bears (Ursus americanus). We evaluated the efficacy of nonlethal deterrent techniques on 62 bears in the Lake Tahoe Basin of the Sierra Nevada range. We contrasted animals randomly assigned to a control (no treatment) group (n = 21), an experimental (treatment) group (n = 21), or a treatment + dog group (n = 20). Experimental bears were pepper-sprayed, shot with 12-gauge rubber buckshot and a rubber slug, and exposed to cracker shells. Bears in the treatment + dog group were chased by hounds in addition to the combination of other deterrents. We tested and modeled the effectiveness of deterrents and dogs using a survival analysis with Cox proportional hazards and ANOVA. Relative success was evaluated by the latency of time (days) between treatment and return to the urban patch (RUP). Predictor variables in the saturated model included age, weight, season, sex, distance moved, and treatment. Only treatment remained in the most parsimonious model. However, mean number of days until RUP did not vary among the 3 treatment levels (ANOVA, P = 0.55). In all but 5 of 62 cases, bears eventually returned to the urban patch in which they were captured; 33 of 62 bears (53%) returned within 1 month and 70% (n = 44) of all bears returned in \u226440 days. We conclude that in the Lake Tahoe Basin the most common nonlethal deterrents, used by agencies responsible for black bear management, are not very effective at altering bear behavior over periods of time &gt;1 month.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "Calodium hepaticum (syn. Capillaria hepatica), a nematode parasite commonly found in the liver of wild rodents, infects a wide variety of mammals, including humans. A retrospective study of black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) at the Baltimore Zoo showed that 5 of 21 (24%) of the prairie dogs submitted for postmortem examination between 1981 and 2001 had hepatic capillariasis, with all the infections diagnosed during or after 1997. Affected livers contained multifocal granulomas containing numerous eggs and occasional adult nematodes. Asymptomatic wild rats in the zoo with a high prevalence of infection may have served as a reservoir for the disease. Wild rodent control is essential to minimize exposure of susceptible exhibition animals as well as humans to C. hepaticum.\n      </p>", "Large body size is one of the best predictors of long life span across species of mammals. In marked contrast, there is considerable evidence that, within species, larger individuals are actually shorter lived. This apparent cost of larger size is especially evident in the domestic dog, where artificial selection has led to breeds that vary in body size by almost two orders of magnitude and in average life expectancy by a factor of two. Survival costs of large size might be paid at different stages of the life cycle: a higher early mortality, an early onset of senescence, an elevated baseline mortality, or an increased rate of aging. After fitting different mortality hazard models to death data from 74 breeds of dogs, we describe the relationship between size and several mortality components. We did not find a clear correlation between body size and the onset of senescence. The baseline hazard is slightly higher in large dogs, but the driving force behind the trade-off between size and life span is apparently a strong positive relationship between size and aging rate. We conclude that large dogs die young mainly because they age quickly.\n      </p>", "Genetic substructuring of a colony of black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) was examined using three different sources of information: allozyme alleles, pedigrees, and demography (a \"breeding-group\" model based on mating and dispersal patterns). Prairie dogs and their social breeding groups (called \"coteries\") were studied under natural conditions during a 15-year period. Prairie-dog coteries exhibited substantial genetic differentiation, with 15-20% of the genetic variation occurring among coteries. Mating patterns within the colony approximated random mating, and, thus, mates tended to originate from different coteries. Social groups of black-tailed prairie dogs resulted in genetic substructuring of the colony, a conclusion that was supported by estimates from allozyme alleles and colony pedigrees. Predictions of the breeding-group model also were consistent with and supported by estimates from allozyme and pedigree data. Some methodological problems were revealed during analyses. Although individuals of all ages usually are pooled for biochemical estimates of among-group genetic differentiation, our estimates of among-coterie variation from allozyme data were somewhat higher for young than for older prairie dogs, perhaps due to sampling effects caused by mating patterns and infanticide of offspring. Pedigree estimates of among-coterie genetic differentiation were significantly positive for young prairie dogs, adult females, and adult males. Those estimates were always more accurate for the offspring generation, however, because pedigree data were always more complete for young and genetic differences among coteries were diluted by virtually complete dispersal of males away from their natal coteries.\n      </p>", "1. The bacteriological findings on 3459 specimens from dogs in IS veterinary hospitals, 7 pounds and 4 boarding kennels in 8 different cities of Florida are presented. 2. Of 2438 specimens from hospitalized dogs, 525 (21.5%) yielded salmonella, as did 71 (7.8%) of 895 impounded dogs and 21 (16.6%) of 126 animals in boarding kennels. 3. There were 701 isolations of salmonella, representing 41 types from 618 positive specimens. 4. The proportion positive in different hospitals, pounds and boarding kennels varied markedly. 5. Localized outbreaks were observed in several hospitals. 6. Bacteriological surveys of the environment in two hospitals yielded the same salmonella types as those previously found in the dogs from prepared food, utensils, fresh livers, a dust pan and the floor of an exercise pen.\n      </p>", "Canine heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) is a nematode that naturally parasitizes in the pulmonary arteries and the right ventricle of domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) as final hosts. Japanese raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides viverrinus) also are known to be susceptible to infection by the parasite. However, prevalence of this infection among free-ranging raccoon dogs is low and so is the worm burden. To examine the susceptibility of the raccoon dog to D. immitis infection, 3 raccoon dogs and 2 beagles were inoculated 4 times with 25 third-stage larvae (L3s) of D. immitis at 3-wk intervals. Worms were recovered from 2 raccoon dogs and both domestic dogs. The average percentage of recovery (2.3%) of the raccoon dogs was almost 10 times lower (24.5%) than that of the domestic dogs, but there was no significant difference in the body length of worms recovered from 2 types of hosts. To examine microfilaremia, 2 raccoon dogs were infected with 100 L3s. Microfilaremia was observed for 180 days postinoculation (PI) but disappeared at about 300 days PI. The raccoon dog was mildly susceptible to infection with D. immitis, but surviving worms developed and matured normally.\n      </p>", "Combined grazing by black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) and bison (Bison bison) produces and maintains a series of changes in the vegetation of prairie dog colonies. However, because their grazing patterns differ in frequency and intensity through time, their individual impacts may be different. The objective of this study was to determine the individual and combined influences of these 2 herbivores in maintaining selected vegetation characteristics of a prairie dog colony in a mixed-grass prairie at Wind Cave National Park, S.D. This was assessed by monitoring plant responses during 2 years following exclusion from grazing by 1 or both species. In spite of their different grazing patterns, prairie dogs and bison had similar and independent (i.e., additive) effects in maintaining plant community structure. For example, total above-ground biomass increased 32-36% within 2 years of removal of each species, primarily as a result of increases in accumulation of graminoid biomass. Plant species diversity, equitability, and dominance concentration were similar in all treatments both years, although there were slight decreases in relative abundance of forbs and increases in relative abundance of graminoids in the second year after removal of grazers. Mean graminoid leaf nitrogen concentration (May to September) declined slightly but significantly after removal of prairie dogs (1.49 to 1.38%) in 1985, and after bison exclusion (1.64 to 1.50%) in 1986. We suggest that rate of vegetation change following removal of grazers depends upon weather conditions, plant species composition, and prior intensity and duration of grazing.\n      </p>", "We estimated black bear (Ursus americanus) population density in the Blue Mountains of northeastern Oregon based on summer mark-recapture surveys in 1996 and 1997. We developed a mark-recapture technique to estimate black bear density using houndsmen with dogs to detect bear scent on driving transects. We conducted 53 surveys and recorded 72 instances where dogs detected bear scent (a strike). We used strike frequency as a bear density index. Strike frequency did not differ between years; dogs detected bear scent at a rate of 1.47 strikes/20 km in 1996 and 1.18 strikes/20 km in 1997. We recorded each scent detection and pursued every bear to determine if the bear was marked or unmarked. On 55 occasions bears were treed after being pursued by dogs from transect routes; 33 of these were marked and 22 were unmarked. Applying the NOREMARK software, we estimated 59 bears in 1996 and 48 bears in 1997 in the 234-km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; survey area. We calculated a density of 25.2 bears/100 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 1996 and 20.5 bears/100 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 1997 in the survey area. This compares with a minimum known population density based on 3 years of marking bears prior to this study of 10.8 bears/100 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the 485 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; capture area that encompassed the survey area. We believe this technique holds promise as a practical tool for wildlife managers. Potential applications of this technique are to produce an index of black bear population trends or, in combination with other techniques, to more accurately assess density of a black bear population. The advantages, considerations, costs, concerns, and limitations of this technique are discussed.\n      </p>", "1. Specimens for bacteriological examination on normal family dogs were procured through community surveys, rabies immunization clinics and in veterinary hospitals (using dogs brought for immunization, bathing, boarding and surgical conditions). 2. A total of 1626 normal dogs were cultured; 244 (15.0%) were positive for salmonella. 3. The 41 types of salmonella encountered were widely distributed, but variations in prevalence were found. 4. There was no secure evidence as to the epidemiological significance to man of salmonella infections in the normal family dog.\n      </p>", "Data on the behavior of walk-hunters and pointing dogs aids in understanding and managing quail harvest. We collected Global Positioning System track logs and recorded behaviors of hunters and dogs on northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) hunts in Oklahoma (n = 43), Texas (n = 43), and Missouri (n = 7), USA, during the 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 hunting seasons. Hunter velocity averaged 0.8 \u00b1 0.03 (SE) m/second both seasons (n = 85) and pooled (95% CL overlap) velocity of bird dogs was 2.5 \u00b1 0.07 (SE) m/second (n = 154). Hunters spent 60.5 \u00b1 2.4% (SE) of their time walking in 2005-2006 (n = 45) versus 75.2 \u00b1 3.5% (SE) in 2006-2007 (n = 48); respective figures for ranging by dogs were 50.2 \u00b1 2.2% (n = 57) versus 82.0 \u00b1 1.3% (SE; n = 97). Mean duration of a hunt declined from 82.3 \u00b1 8.16 (SE) minutes (n = 45) to 50.2 \u00b1 5.1 (SE) minutes (n = 48) between seasons. Variation in bobwhite abundance was the primary cause of seasonal variation in hunter and dog behaviors because covey-associated activities declined as quail abundance declined. With our results and those of previous workers, managers have first-generation estimates of all variables in hunter-covey interface models for managing bobwhite harvest on discrete areas.\n      </p>", "The local resource enhancement (LRE) model predicts that in cooperatively breeding species, sex ratios will be biased in favor of the more helpful sex. In this study, we assess the assumptions underlying the LRE model in a population of cooperatively breeding wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) in Northern Botswana monitored over a 15-year period. In this population, litter size and pup survival to 1 year are strongly affected by pack size and the breeding female's age, but adult males have a stronger and more linear effect on females' reproductive performance than do adult females. This asymmetry in the benefits derived from male and female helpers is reflected in malebiased sex ratios in litters at the time pups emerge from the den. Sex ratio biases are most pronounced in the litters of the youngest mothers who live in significantly smaller packs than older females. The presence of potential rivals for the dominant female's position depresses pup production at the time of emergence, suggesting that competition among females for breeding positions may also contribute to the selective forces affecting birth sex ratios.\n      </p>", "1. Procedures used in the isolation of salmonella from dogs are described. 2. The relative efficacy of various laboratory procedures were compared. 3. Proteus organisms were observed as a prevalent contaminant in canine feces. 4. Of 8157 rectal swabs from dogs, 2252 (27.6%) were positive for salmonella. 5. The proportion positive in different groups or communities ranged from very low to very high. 6. A total of 53 serologic types, including three new types, were encountered. Multiple types were found in 412 specimens. 7. Salmonella types which were isolated frequently from dogs were also encountered frequently in man. 8. Evidence did not permit conclusions as to the significance of salmonella infections in dogs either as a source of spread to man or as a cause of disease in dogs.\n      </p>", "The distribution of Dirofilaria immitis and Dipetalonema reconditum in the state of Illinois was studied by examining 331 blood samples over the 2-year period, 1963-65. Blood samples were obtained from dogs residing in 42 of the 102 counties of Illinois. Dogs infected with D. immitus were found in 26 (61.9%) of the counties sampled and with D. reconditum in 17 (40.5%) of the counties sampled. A search of the Clinical Pathology Laboratory records revealed D. immitis in five and D. reconditum in three additional counties. A random sample of 55 dogs from the southern part of the state showed a prevalence of 29.1% infection with D. immitis. A random sample of 17 dogs from the northern part of the state showed no microfilariae. While D. immitis may occur throughout the state, it probably is more prevalent in the southern counties. Of 331 dogs examined from all parts of the state, 19.3% were infected with D. immitis and 3.6% with D. reconditum. However, the sample cannot be considered as random since the objective of the study was to find infected dogs. The infection rate with D. immitis remained below 5% in dogs younger than 4 years and then rose to between 14.7 and 26% for dogs up to 17 years of age. Infections with D. reconditum reached 12.5% in dogs 1 year old and then appeared to decline in prevalence in dogs older than 6 years. Published reports on the prevalence of filariids in dogs in the United States are reviewed and tabulated.\n      </p>", "Serum samples from 134 dogs from 22 cattle dairy farms in the northern region of Parana State, Brazil, were tested for antibodies to Neospora caninum in an indirect fluorescent antibody test. Antibodies (\u22651:50) to N. caninum were found in 29 (21.6%) of the 134 dogs, and seropositive dogs were found on 14 (63.6%) of the 22 dairy cattle farms. The antibody titers of dogs were 1:50 (3 dogs), 1:100 (7 dogs), 1:200 (7 dogs), 1:400 (6 dogs), and \u22651:800 (6 dogs). The low prevalence (9%) in &lt;1-yr-old dogs compared with the 2- to 3-fold higher prevalence in older dogs (17-29%) suggests postnatal exposure to N. caninum infection.\n      </p>", "Sequential changes in pathology were examined for scabies-infested dogs to determine the effects of infestation with Sarcoptes scabiei var. canis. During 8 wk of infestation with S. scabiei, the progression of the disease was evaluated weekly by skin scrape, clinical examination, and blood analyses. At 8 wk, selected organs were microscopically examined for histopathology. All infested dogs developed an advanced level of scabies infestation by 8 wk. Of the 36 blood parameters evaluated, only values for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) deviated significantly from the normal ranges for dogs. However, infested dogs had significantly (P &lt; 0.01) lower average hemoglobin and hematocrit concentrations after 8 wk of infestation compared to their values prior to infestation or to the values for the control dogs. Red blood cell levels for infested dogs dropped significantly (P &lt; 0.01) from preinfestation concentrations by week 8. Conversely, by 8 wk total white blood cell and neutrophil concentrations were significantly (P &lt; 0.01) greater than uninvested controls. Also, whereas average eosinophil concentrations were not statistically different for infested dogs compared to controls, some individual infested dogs exhibited eosinophilia at 4-8 wk of infestation. The ESRs for infested dogs were significantly (P &lt; 0.01) greater at week 6 and 8 than for experimental dogs prior to infestation or control dogs. All parameters except neutrophils had returned to preinfestation levels by 2 wk after treatment for scabies. Neutrophil concentrations were no longer significantly different by 4 wk posttreatment. There were no significant differences in serum enzyme, biochemical and electrolyte concentrations between infested and control dogs. Organ histopathology was essentially normal with none of the findings attributable to scabies infestation.\n      </p>", "One third of the dogs that appeared normal on external examination presented gross evidence of bacterial contamination of the tracheobronchial tree at autopsy. All of the dogs were found by bacteriologic examination to have contamination in the parenchyma of the lung. Occasional contamination of the tracheobronchial tree of normal dogs was determined by bacteriologic examination. Excessive contamination of this area was demonstrated bacteriologically in dogs presenting gross contamination. Bacteria was present in the blood in four of eleven normal dogs. Contamination of the blood stream was found more frequently in dogs showing gross contamination of the tracheobronchial tree. Miss Lois Day and Dr. C. M.

We examined how rodent and vegetation communities responded to prairie dog colonies and landcover at the Cimarron National Grassland in southwest Kansas, USA. We trapped rodents and measured vegetation structure on and off colonies in 2000 and 2003. We plotted two separate ordinations of trapping grids: one based on rodent counts and a second based on vegetation variables. We regressed three factors on each ordination: (1) colony (on-colony and off-colony), (2) cover (shortgrass and sandsage), and (3) habitat (factorial cross of colony \u00d7 cover). Rodent communities differed by colony but not cover. Vegetation differed across both gradients. Rodent responses to habitat reflected those of colony and cover, but vegetation was found to differ across cover only in the sandsage prairie. This interaction suggested that rodent composition responded to prairie dog colonies, but independently of vegetation differences. We conclude that burrowing and soil disturbance are more important than vegetation cropping in structuring rodent communities.\n      </p>", "This essay explores the representation of children and childishness in modern literature, focusing on Virginia Woolf's treatment of the Brownings' baby in Flush and on William Faulkner's portrayal of Benjy in \"The Sound and the Fury\". The essay uses the theories of Gilles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix Guattari to interrogate the metaphorical use of Freud's Oedipal triangle in the representative positioning of both children and dogs in these novels. It argues that both texts posit a child of indeterminate species, challenging ideas about the child as a knowable object that can be represented.\n      </p>", "Dogs have been found to be susceptible to infection with Leptospira pomona. Leptospirosis occurred following either subcutaneous or oral exposure. Leptospiras of both porcine and bovine origin established infection and the renal carrier state. Symptoms of leptospirosis were absent. In this respect canine infections resembled the mildest or subclinical form of the disease observed in goats, swine, or cattle. Pathological alterations were limited to the kidney and were observed in all dogs which developed serum agglutinins. The lesions were minimal in all but one. The pathogenesis of the disease was observed through hematological, bacteriological, serological, and histopathological techniques. Leptospiremia followed infection, usually occurring from the third through seventh days. The serum antibody response was marked in all infected dogs. Reactions for Lept. icterohemorrhagiae AB and Lept. canicola were constant findings, but the magnitude of the heterologous reactions never approached those for Lept. pomona. Urinary shedding of leptospiras commenced as early as the fifteenth day, and persisted for as long as 47 days. The microorganisms were detected in the kidneys of one dog 54 days after oral exposure. Since the renal carrier state can be established following oral exposure, the dog might be responsible, in some rare instances, for the transmission of Lept. pomona infection to other lower animals and possibly man. However, the dog's role as a significant reservoir host for Lept. pomona is probably slight.\n      </p>", "High genetic diversity of East Asian village dogs has recently been used to argue for an East Asian origin of the domestic dog. However, global village dog genetic diversity and the extent to which semif eral village dogs represent distinct indigenous populations instead of admixtures of various dog breeds has not been quantified. Understanding these issues is critical to properly reconstructing the timing, number, and locations of dog domestication. To address these questions, we sampled 318 village dogs from 7 regions in Egypt Uganda, and Namibia, measuring genetic diversity &gt; 680 bp of the mitochondria! D-loop, 300 SNPs, and 89 microsatellite markers. We also analyzed breed dogs, including putatively African breeds (Afghan hounds, Basenjis, Pharaoh hounds, Rhodesian ridgebacks, and Salukis), Puerto Rican street dogs, and mixed breed dogs from the United States. Village dogs from most African regions appear genetically distinct from non-native breed and mixed-breed dogs, although some individuals cluster genetically with Puerto Rican dogs or United States breed mixes instead of with neighboring village dogs. Thus, African village dogs are a mosaic of indigenous dogs descended from early migrants to Africa, and non-native, breed-admixed individuals. Among putatively African breeds, Pharaoh hounds, and Rhodesian ridgebacks clustered with non-native rather than indigenous African dogs, suggesting they have predominantly non-African origins. Surprisingly, we find similar mtDNA haplotype diversity in African and East Asian village dogs, potentially calling into question the hypothesis of an East Asian origin for dog domestication.\n      </p>", "Recolonization by wolves (Canis lupus) of areas of extensive sheep breeding in the French Alps in the early 1990s led to intense conflicts over losses of domestic livestock. We used data on depredations and sheep herd management from 45 pastures of the Mercantour Mountains of the French Alps to build models of attack and kill rates and to quantify the efficiency of using livestock-guarding dogs and of gathering or confining herds at night to prevent damage. Efficiency of livestock-guarding dogs was lowest when sheep were ranging freely and highest when sheep were confined at night. The effect of livestock-guarding dogs on depredations was heterogeneous across pastures. When sheep were confined at night, presence of 3 to 4 dogs was predicted to prevent a large majority (&gt;95%) of kills that would have occurred in the absence of dogs for 81% of pastures. No effect of dogs was found for the other 19% of pastures. Confining or simply gathering sheep at night in the presence of 5 livestock-guarding dogs was predicted to prevent most kills (94% and 79%, respectively) that would have occurred in similar conditions but with free-ranging sheep. Efficiency of each of these 2 techniques was drastically reduced when they were not used jointly. This study suggested that confining sheep in the presence of several livestock-guarding dogs can prevent a large majority of livestock losses to wolves in the southern French Alps.\n      </p>", "Five coyotes (Canis latrans) and 3 dogs were individually trained to run from a start box across a 6,400-m2 enclosure to a visual stimulus where they received a food reward. Candidate repellents were presented in the area of the visual stimulus, and their ability to inhibit the test animal's food-getting response was measured. Of the 45 candidate repellents tested, only \u03b2-chloro-acetyl chloride repelled all of the test animals; however, it is a strong irritant and lachrymator and would be impractical for use in close proximity to sheep. Cinnamaldehyde showed some promise as a repellent. However, no chemical odor was found that consistently would repel coyotes and dogs but not adversely affect sheep.\n      </p>", "Dirofilaria immitis is the causal agent of canine and feline cardiopulmonary dirofilariasis. Moreover, the existence of canine dirofilariasis implies a risk for human populations living in an endemie area in which, the parasite can cause pulmonary dirofilariasis. The Spanish epidemiological situation is not well understood, lacking data from many central and Northern provinces. In our study, epidemiological data on canine and human dirofilariasis for La Rioja (Northern Spain) have been obtained for the first time. The overall prevalence of D. immitis in dogs was 12% (9% of patent and 3% of occult infections), being 11-6% the seroprevalence of human residents in this province. The geographie distribution of both canine and human D. immitis infections in La Rioja is restricted to humid and irrigated areas near the Ebro Valley River, being absent in the rest of the province where h\u00fcls and mountains predominate.\n      </p>", "Examination of 120 stray dogs under 6 months of age disclosed 97% parasitized with one or more of the following helminths: Toxocara canis (93%); Ancylostoma caninum (50%); Dipylidium caninum (38%); Echinococcus granulosus (0.8%); and Taenia sp. (0.8%). Compared to what other workers have reported for the same area, the most significant difference was a threefold increase in dogs parasitized with Toxocara canis. In Mexico City dogs are infected with a number of helminths transmissible to man and their continued occurrence in the people of that city can be expected.\n      </p>", "Neospora caninum is an apicomplexan parasite that causes neonatal neuromuscular disease in dogs and abortions in cattle. Bovine neosporosis is a major production problem worldwide. The parasite is transmitted to cattle via oocysts excreted by dogs or by transplacental transmission. Dogs are the only proven definitive host for N. caninum. One of 3 dogs fed mouse brains containing tissue cysts of a wild-type N. caninum strain CK0160SC3B (CKO) excreted oocysts in its feces. Two of 3 dogs fed mouse brains containing tissue cysts from a cloned line of the CKO strain excreted N. caninum oocysts in their feces. The results indicate that a single N. caninum tachyzoite contains all the genetic information needed to produce the asexual and sexual cycles in the canine intestine.\n      </p>", "The relationship between vegetation cover and soil seed banks was studied in five different ungulate herbivore-prairie dog treatment combinations at three northern mixed-grass prairie sites in Badlands National Park, South Dakota. There were distinct differences in both the seed bank composition and the aboveground vegetation between the off-prairie dog colony treatments and the on-colony treatments. The three on-colony treatments were similar to each other at all three sites with vegetation dominated by the forbs Dyssodia papposa, Hedeoma spp., Sphaeralcea coccinea, Conyza canadensis, and Plantago patagonica and seed banks dominated by the forbs Verbena bracteata and Dyssodia papposa. The two off-colony treatments were also similar to each other at all three sites. Vegetation at these sites was dominated by the grasses Pascopyrum smithii, Bromus tectorum and Bouteloua gracilis and the seed banks were dominated by several grasses including Bromus tectorum, Monroa squarrosa, Panicum capillare, Sporobolus cryptandra and Stipa viridula. A total of 146 seedlings representing 21 species germinated and emerged from off-colony treatments while 3069 seedlings comprising 33 species germinated from on-colony treatments. Fifteen of the forty species found in soil seed banks were not present in the vegetation, and 57 of the 82 species represented in the vegetation were not found in the seed banks. Few dominant species typical of mixed-grass prairie vegetation germinated and emerged from seed banks collected from prairie dog colony treatments suggesting that removal of prairie dogs will not result in the rapid reestablishment of representative mixed-grass prairie unless steps are taken to restore the soil seed bank.\n      </p>", "Inoculation of immature dogs with Leptospira icterohemorrhagiae, CF-1, produced acute infections with symptoms classified as subclinical (28%), mild (25%), moderate (31%), or severe (17%). Jaundice, which occurred in 47% of the dogs, appeared to be due to hepatocellular injury. In severe or fatal disease, jaundice was accompanied by uremia. Clinical, biochemical, and gross pathological changes characteristic of the several levels of response have been described.\n      </p>", "Quail hunting consists of a complex set of behaviors that involve humans, pointing dogs, and wild birds. The recent development of models known as Hunter-Covey Interface (HCI) theory provides an opportunity to analyze how we perceive, understand, and manage quail hunting. There are 2 groups of HCI models: static and dynamic. The static HCI model predicts daily hunting mortality based on the velocity of the hunt and area covered during a hunt. The dynamic HCI models estimate the probability of flushing a covey given a set of circumstances that revolve around the potential rate of which quail learn to avoid hunters. We quantified the variables required to test whether the static and dynamic models of HCI theory provide meaningful results. We used spatial data on hunting velocity and area covered during &gt;100 quail hunts, along with estimates of quail population density, mortality, and movements from 2 areas in south Texas, to evaluate output from HCI models. The static model predicted average daily harvest rates that ranged from 5 to 50 birds. This average is within the range of average daily bag of south Texas quail hunters in groups of 2-4. Output from the dynamic models suggested that quail populations on our study areas were subjected to relatively low hunting intensities with a corresponding low avoidance behavior and learning rate, which is a scenario that matched 1 of 4 predictions by Guthery (2002). We found it difficult to meet basic assumptions of HCI theory. For example, hunting pressure was potentially redundant, coveys were not always randomly distributed in space, and the extent to which quail are naive at the beginning of a hunting season was unknown. However, both the static and dynamic HCI models appeared robust to violation of these assumptions. Application of HCI theory may provide meaningful results that can be used to manage quail hunting pressure, optimize harvest, and sustain populations.\n      </p>", "The serological presence of heartworm in dogs of Montana was studied in a 3-yr survey. Serum samples were provided by veterinary practitioners throughout Montana or were submitted to the state diagnostic laboratory. Sera from 3,490 dogs were tested using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for circulating adult heartworm antigen. Twenty-four serum samples were positive for heartworm antigen. Two were from dogs that had never been outside the state. Nineteen additional positive dogs, 7 of which presumably had never been out of the state, were reported through correspondence with veterinary practitioners. Because suitable vectors for Dirofilaria immitis exist in Montana, there is potential for propagation of heartworm.\n      </p>", "Oral administration of dimethyl sulfoxide to young dogs reduces relucency of the lens cortex, causing the normal central zone of the lens to act as a strong biconvex lens.\n      </p>", "Nodulisporic acid A (NSA) has been shown previously to be safe in dogs and to deliver &gt;90% flea control for 4 days following a single oral administration. Three newly prepared nodulisporamide derivatives were subsequently identified from an artificial membrane flea feeding system as exhibiting potency substantially greater than NSA. To determine if they have superior in vivo activity, these 3 nodulisporamides, as well as NSA, were evaluated in dogs at 15 mg/kg/os. Parasite challenges were made by placing 100 live Ctenocephalides felis fleas onto the dorsum of dogs every 48 hr and examining efficacy at each of those intervals over a 22-day period. Results showed that NSA produced &gt;90% efficacy at day 2 and 81% efficacy at day 4, and its residual flea killing fell to ~50% by day 6 posttreatment. All dogs treated with the 3 new experimental nodulisporamides were 100% protected from flea challenges to day 8 posttreatment, and 2 of the compounds continued to produce &gt;90% residual activity to 2 wk posttreatment. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that plasma profiles and half-lives of NSA and these 3 new compounds correlated closely with flea efficacy. These results demonstrate that specific substitutions to the pharmacophore of NSA can substantially increase the duration of activity against fleas.\n      </p>", "Dog bites are a medical problem for millions of people, children being the most common victims. Human deaths attributable to dog bite injury (not rabies) are relatively infrequent. There have been some epidemiologic reviews, but this study is the first attempt to arrive at an understanding of bites involving predation on human beings by conducting behavioral examinations under controlled conditions of the dogs involved, and by interviewing victims, witnesses, and people familiar with the animals. The three cases studied involved two fatalities and an attack that was nearly fatal. The victims were 11, 14, and 81. In each case, owned pet dogs consumed some human tissue. The severity of the victims' injuries was not the consequence of a single dog bite, but the result of repeated attacks by dogs behaving as a social group. Factors that might contribute to a dog's regarding human beings as potential prey were examined, including hunger, prior predation, group behaviors, defense of territory, previous interactions with people, the presence of estrous female dogs, and environmental stimuli. In two of the cases, it was possible, by using similar stimuli, to duplicate the circumstances at the time of the attack. The results of the observations showed the value of behavioral analysis and simulations methods in evaluating possible factors in dog attacks. Among the many factors probably involved in severe dog attacks are the size, number, and nutritional status of the dogs; the dogs' previous aggressive contacts with people; the victim's age, size, health, and behavior; and the absence of other human beings in the vicinity.\n      </p>", "Seventy-two Navajo ranchers were questioned about the role of mixed-breed dogs with their flocks. Navajos call their dogs \"sheep dogs\" but, unlike sheep dogs used by other ranchers to assist in herding and moving the flocks, Navajo dogs function primarily as guardians of sheep and goats to whom they have developed social bonds. This attraction is a result of raising dogs essentially from birth in visual, olfactory, auditory, and tactile association with sheep and goats. A minimum of handling of pups reduces the likelihood that they will bond strongly to humans. Mixed-breed dogs of the Navajo appear to exhibit all behavioral traits believed to be important in protecting flocks from predators, especially coyotes: they are attentive, defensive, and trustworthy. If ranchers choose to employ dogs, the rather simple Navajo recipe for training may serve them well. Mixed-breed dogs could be quickly deployed in a variety of ranching situations to help reduce predation on livestock.\n      </p>", "White et al. (2005) estimated the area occupied by \"active\" colonies of black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) in Colorado as 255,398 ha (95% Cl of \u00b19.5%) based on data collected with aerial transect surveys during 2001-2002 by staff of the Colorado Division of Wildlife (CDOW). During 2004 we conducted on-the-ground examinations of a sample of the colony intercept data used by White et al. (2005) and found evidence of misclassifications that would yield significant overestimation bias. We found that 25.4% of the total length of the colony intercepts we examined was incorrectly classified as being a prairie dog colony (these segments had no prairie dog burrows of any age). We also found that 50.3% of the length of examined intercepts fell on currently inactive colonies or portions of colonies (vacant burrows but no living priarie dogs) and only 24.3% fell on active prairie dog colonies with signs of living prairie dogs at our examinations 2 years after the survey reported by White et al. (2005). Further, in Bent and Kiowa counties, where plague (Yertsina pestus) and poisoning were active, we examined 36.9 km of reported active prairie dog intercepts and subjectively classified only 1.6% as active at normal-appearing prairie dog densities. Our fieldwork demonstrated that the estimate by White et al. (2005) was based on data with substantial errors as well as over-estimation biases that will be repeated if protocols are not modified for future surveys.\n      </p>", "The effect of feeding different numbers of Toxocara canis eggs on patent intestinal infections was studied in 45 ascarid-naive 62-64-day-old pups and 6 adult dogs. Twenty-four of 25 pups fed 10 to 1,000 eggs developed patent intestinal infections, whereas none of the 20 pups fed 10,000 eggs developed patent intestinal infection. Three of 6 presumably ascarid-naive dogs, 7, 10, and 52 months old fed 100 eggs each, developed intestinal infections.\n      </p>", "During the summers of 1982, 1983, and 1984, 269 sheep dogs from an area endemic for hydatid disease were examined for cestodes (Echinococcus granulosus and Taenia spp.). Each dog was given an oral purge of arecoline hydrobromide and then following purgation received a subcutaneous injection of praziquantel (Droncit\u00ae) . During the three-year study period, 205 dogs were examined one time only, 48 dogs were examined two of the three years, and 16 dogs were examined each of the three years (= 349 separate examinations). In 1982, 45 of 91 dogs examined (49.5%) harbored at least one species of cestode. Those data for 1983 and 1984 were 55 positive of 141 examined (39.0%) and 34 positive of 117 examined (29.1%), respectively. The marked drop in dogs infected during the second and third year of the study suggests that many sheep ranchers were implementing some of the control measures recommended for prevention of E. granulosus infections. The numbers of separate purgations showing specific cestodes detected in all positive dogs (some dogs naturally with more than one species of cestode) were: E. granulosus, 16 (4.6%); T. hydatigena, 34 (9.7%); T. ovis krabbei, 46 (13.2%); T. pisiformis, 47 (13.5%); and T. serialis, 24 (6.9%).\n      </p>", "Fifty-one of 62 sheep dogs in central Utah were successfully purged for diagnosis of cestodes in 1981. Tapeworms were identified in the purged fecal samples of 33 (64.7 percent) animals. Minimum infection rates in the dogs which were purged were: 9.8 percent for Echinococcus granulosus, 29.4 percent for Taenia pisiformis, 27.5 percent for T. ovis krabbei, 27.5 percent for T. hydatigena, and 2.0 percent for T. serialis. The prevalence of E. granulosus decreased from 27 percent in 1971 to 9.8 percent in 1981.\n      </p>", "Thiabendazole, mixed into commercial dog food at concentrations of 0.005, 0.01, and 0.025%, was fed three times daily to young dogs which were exposed to infection with Toxocara canis, Ancylostoma braziliense, Ancylostoma caninum, Strongyloides stercoralis, and Trichuris vulpis. All three levels of thiabendazole were effective in preventing patent infections of Ancylostoma and Toxocara. Hookworm eggs were never observed in the feces of dogs receiving any level of thiabendazole, nor were hookworm larvae ever recovered from cultures made from the feces of these dogs. Necropsy revealed that adult hookworms had developed only in the dogs receiving the lowest concentration of drug (0.005%); but supplementary studies indicated that infertile hookworms may develop in some dogs treated with 0.01 or 0.05% thiabendazole. The number of Strongyloides larvae recovered from the feces of dogs fed thiabendazole was much less than in the case of the untreated, exposed controls; at 0.025% recovery was virtually nil. At necropsy, adult Strongyloides were found in all but one of the treated dogs, but their number was appreciably smaller than in the controls. In dogs fed 0.025% thiabendazole, prophylaxis of Trichuris was essentially complete. Thiabendazole at 0.01% had no effect on the number of whipworms becoming established although the mean number of eggs produced was appreciably lower than in the controls. The feeding of 0.005% thiabendazole had no effect on the number of Trichuris eggs produced or the number of whipworms present at necropsy. The life cycles of four common intestinal parasites of the dog can thus be broken by the regular administration of thiabendazole in dog food. Since three of these helminths are pathogenic for man, these findings may have considerable public health importance.\n      </p>", "Demyelination was induced in 16 of 35 gnotobiotic dogs by infection with canine distemper virus from a naturally occurring case of demyelinating distemper. In addition, this infection induced absolute lymphopenia, which persisted for several weeks. Two forms of demyelinating disease occurred after infection. Eleven dogs developed neurological signs several weeks after infection and rapidly became moribund. They remained lymphopenic and had thymic atrophy and generalized lymphoid depletion. Hematogenous mononuclear inflammatory cells were not present in the brains of these dogs. In contrast, demyelination associated with nonsuppurative encephalitis was demonstrated in five of 24 dogs that survived the 12-week observation period. Lymphocyte counts were normal in the 24 surviving dogs by eight weeks after infection. A French strain of canine distemper virus induced demyelination in three of 17 gnotobiotic dogs, while no demyelination occurred in eight dogs inoculated with either Snyder-Hill or glial tissue culture-adapted (Lederle) canine distemper virus.\n      </p>", "The genus Cynomys and both of its subgenera, Cynomys (Cynomys) or black-tailed prairie dogs and Cynomys (Leucocrossuromys) or white-tailed prairie dogs, have their earliest fossil occurrences on the Great Plains (late Blancan for the genus and early Irvingtonian for both subgenera). However, the fossil record of prairie dogs is poor prior to the late Irvingtonian. Geographic distributions of the two subgenera during the late Irvingtonian and Rancholabrean were consistently different from Recent distributions. Cynomys (L.) niobrarius was widely distributed across the northern and central Great Plains and commonly co-occurred with the Cynomys (C.) new sp.-C. (C.) ludovicianus lineage on the latter. In contrast, the Cynomys (C.) new sp.-C. (C.) ludovicianus lineage lived in the central and southern Great Plains, but never further north. Both subgenera, represented by C. (L.) gunnisoni and C. (C.) ludovicianus, lived in the southern highlands of New Mexico during Wisconsin time. The Mexican black-tailed prairie dog, C. (C.) mexicanus, also may have lived in southern New Mexico during Wisconsin time. Biogeographic stability on the Great Plains throughout the late Irvingtonian and Rancholabrean suggests that glacial-interglacial fluctuations in climate and habitat were not sufficient to disrupt characteristic Pleistocene distribution patterns of Cynomys prior to the Holocene.\n      </p>", "Thirty-nine dogs were injected intramuscularly with either an Ethiopian strain or a Mexican strain of rabies virus. The excretion of rabies virus in the saliva was studied before and during illness. Nine of 17 dogs that died after injection with the Ethiopian strain had virus in the submaxillary glands. Four of these dogs excreted virus in the saliva up to 13 days before signs of disease were observed. Sixteen of 22 dogs that died after injection with the Mexican strain had virus in the submaxillary glands. Eight of these dogs also excreted virus in the saliva up to seven days before signs of disease were observed.

Both species demonstrate bacteremia due to Yersinia pestis, formerly known as Pasturella pestis, as a result of the infection and thus may serve as the source of an infectious blood meal for fleas. The suppurating lesions developed by the cat indicate that there may be some risk of mechanical plague infection for those handling such animals. Despite this, the risk of infection of human beings due to contact with cats and dogs infected with plague is considered minimal. For the first time it has been experimentally established that, irrespective of the mode of infection, cats and dogs develop antibodies of high titer to the specific Fraction I antigen of Y. pestis. Such antibodies persist for at least 300 days in the sera of cats and dogs. The frequency with which such specific antibodies to Y. pestis can be detected in the sera of dogs that live in epidemic and natural plague foci indicates that serologic tests of canine sera for antibody to the plague bacterium should be an integral part of every survey and surveillance program.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Of the dogs infected at less than one week of age, 85% died of acute encephalitis two to five weeks after infection. In contrast, only 28.5% of infected weanling and 33.3% of infected adult dogs died after receiving inoculations of R252-CDV. Furthermore, about one-half of the fatally infected wean!ing dogs developed chronic encephalitis characterized by infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells in areas where demyelination of the central nervous system had occurred. Age-related susceptibility correlated with in vitro responses of peripheral blood lymphocytes to phytomitogens.

In the present study, serum parasite antigen measurements were used to monitor the success of thiacetarsamide therapy in 2 controlled trials that involved 24 naturally infected dogs. Parasite antigen levels correlated significantly with adult worm burdens in untreated control dogs. Antigen levels fell dramatically by 8 wk after treatment in successfully treated dogs and were undetectable 12 wk after treatment in dogs that were parasitologically cured. Microfilarial counts exhibited seasonal periodicity in both treated and control dogs and were not useful in monitoring the success of adulticide therapy. Parasite antigen detection is quite useful in monitoring the efficacy of adulticide therapy for dogs infected with D. immitis.

Restoration often requires translocating animals to previously occupied areas. Workers should follow standard protocols for animal handling and care. Translocation involves selecting source populations and release sites, capturing and transporting animals, preparing release sites with attendant soft-release infrastructure, and monitoring and managing animals. Source populations should be free of plague and genetically appropriate for the translocation strategy. Release sites ideally have physical or historical evidence of previous occupancy, but also may be selected based on soils, slope, and vegetation. Capture, transport, and release of animals must comply with federal, state, and local regulations. Animals have been commonly captured with live traps, by flooding their burrows, or by using a specially adapted vacuum truck; those captured in plague-prone areas are treated to control fleas. Captives usually are hauled to release sites in covered pickup truck beds or trailers. High-quality release sites have short vegetation (&lt;12 cm tall) and pre-existing burrows; sites without these qualities may need modification. Retention baskets or fenced enclosures, sometimes combined with artificial underground nest chambers, have been used to reduce dispersal and predation. Control of predators may be needed prior to or following release. Post-release monitoring to detect and remedy potential problems such as dispersal and predation is recommended, and providing a food subsidy may reduce dispersal and elevate survival.\n      </p>", "Habitat loss, introduced disease, and government-sponsored eradication programs have caused population declines in all 5 species of prairie dogs. Black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) currently occupy only about 2% of an extensive geographic range (160 million hectares) and were recently considered for listing under the United States Endangered Species Act. Accurate estimates of density for populations of prairie dogs would be valuable for estimating range-wide abundance and for determining threats to species persistence, yet estimates of density using robust approaches (e.g., complete enumeration or mark-recapture) are rarely undertaken. We introduce a novel approach to estimating density of prairie dogs using mark-resight methods. Using mark-resight, mark-recapture, and 3 other indices, we estimated the abundance of prairie dogs on 3 reintroduced colonies over a 3-year period (2003-2005). We show that mark-resight is a superior approach to estimating abundance of prairie dogs, that average density estimates from the southern extremity of the species' range are considerably lower (11.3 prairie dogs/ha) than estimates from more northerly climes (X\u0304 = 18.3-90.3 prairie dogs/ha), and that population densities can fluctuate widely in accordance with local environmental conditions. We propose that resource agencies use mark-resight methods to obtain density estimates of prairie dog populations within diverse ecoregions, and couple these estimates with an assessment of the area occupied by prairie dog colonies to determine range-wide abundance.\n      </p>", "This paper synthesizes the data on prehistoric dogs (Canis familiaris) and other related canids in the eastern Great Basin. Data presented here suggest that domesticated dogs were relatively rare in the eastern Great Basin throughout the Holocene. Skeletal remains of dogs appear to be more commonly associated with sites in wetland habitats, a pattern previously identified in the western Great Basin. In these habitats, dogs may have been able to subsist with little or no assistance from humans.\n      </p>", "Four Komondor dogs were trained to attack captive coyotes and to stay within fenced sheep pastures. The dogs, used in pairs, were then evaluated on three ranches (65 to 330-ha pastures) to determine their potential in protecting sheep from coyote predation. Daily checks of sheep losses were made on each ranch for three consecutive 20-day periods: preceding placement of the dogs, during their time in pastures, and after their removal. Sheep kills by coyotes decreased significantly during and following use of the dogs, suggesting some potential for the deterrence of coyote predation-at least under fenced-grazing conditions.\n      </p>", "Charles Darwin first used the term 'survival of the fittest' in the 5th edition of The origin of species.

One clade of dog sequences was unique to the New World, which is consistent with a period of geographic isolation. This unique clade was absent from a large sample of modern dogs, which implies that European colonists systematically discouraged the breeding of native American dogs.\n      </p>", "We used a new high-performance liquid-chromatography assay to study the pharmacokinetics of pentamidine isethionate given intravenously to 10 dogs before and after surgically induced renal failure. The presurgery peak serum concentration of pentamidine averaged 867 ng/ml and by 6 hr had fallen to 30 ng/ml. After surgery the peak and 6-hr concentrations were 780 ng/ml and 28 ng/ml. Mean total body clearance of pentamidine before surgery was 46.7 ml/min per kg, of which only 2.0 ml/min per kg was due to renal clearance. After surgery, total body clearance was 40.0 ml/min per kg, even though renal clearance had fallen 80% - to 0.4 ml/min per kg. Two dogs with azotemia and two control dogs received 14 daily infusions of pentamidine. Kinetic parameters measured after the last dose were not significantly different from those after the first dose, and the amount of pentamidine recovered from tissues was similar for dogs with azotemia and controls. In summary, because renal clearance of pentamidine accounted for such a small proportion of total body clearance, none of the parameters measured was affected significantly by moderate azotemia.\n      </p>", "Black-tailed prairie dogs (Cymomys ludovicianus) are a species of concern and accurate estimates of occupied area are required to assess their status. We conducted aerial line-intercept surveys to estimate colony areas in Colorado, USA, 2006-2007. Optimal allocation based on results from a previous (2002) survey was used to distribute flight time to sample 28 counties. Uncorrected estimates of active and inactive colony areas from the aerial surveys were 329,529 (SE = 16,841) ha and 18,292 (SE = 2,366) ha, respectively. We attempted to ground-truth a randomly selected sample of 186 colony intercepts but gained complete access to only 150. Ground-truthing demonstrated that aerial surveys estimated only 96% of the true lengths of colony intercepts but overestimated the proportion of active colonies. Corrected estimates of active and inactive colony areas are 319,165 (SE = 20,105) ha and 42,422 (SE = 11,485) ha, respectively. Because ground-truthing was not conducted in the original 2002 survey, uncorrected estimates from this survey are the appropriate metric to be used for comparison to the 2002 data. Our estimates demonstrated a 29% increase (SE = 6.3) in area occupied since surveys were conducted in 2002. These results are useful to state and federal agencies and other conservation partners in determining the condition of the species when conducting status reviews.\n      </p>", "Scarce information is available about Neospora caninum oocysts and sporozoites, in part because only small numbers of oocysts have typically been produced by experimentally infected dogs. We hypothesized that 1 reason for low experimental production of oocysts is that dogs have been fed tissues from experimentally infected mice instead of tissues from cattle (which are natural intermediate hosts of N. caninum). In this study, 9 dogs were fed tissues from N. caninum-infected calves, and oocyst production was compared with 6 dogs that were fed infected mouse carcasses. The number of oocysts produced by dogs that ingested infected calf tissues (mean = 160,700) was significantly greater (P = 0.03) than the number of oocysts shed by dogs that ingested infected mice (mean = 5,400). The second goal of our experiment was to demonstrate cyclical oral transmission of N. caninum between dogs and cattle. As few as 300 oocysts were used to successfully infect calves, and tissues from these calves induced patent infections in 2 of 3 dogs; oocysts from 1 of these dogs were administered to another calf, and tissues from this calf subsequently induced a third dog to shed oocysts. Oocysts were confirmed to be N. caninum using a species-specific polymerase chain reaction technique. In addition, sporulated oocysts were used to recover N. caninum in vitro after digestion in an acid-pepsin solution and inoculation of cell monolayers.\n      </p>", "A 12-month study in central Alaska shows that family pets harbor a significant quantity of human intestinal pathogens. While previous investigators in Alaska have found that up to 7% of the dogs harbor either Salmonella or Shigella, this study found approximately 18% harboring these, plus an additional 9% harboring related, potentially pathogenic organisms. In addition, the study also shows that dogs in the area (1) can harbor multiple species of Salmonella at one time, (2) appear to act as transient carriers, and (3) do not necessarily show signs of intestinal infection when the organisms are present. The organisms were found in the animals throughout the year. As a result of the long severe winter the family pet usually lives in very close proximity to humans; thus it becomes a potential vector of some significance.\n      </p>", "Dogs are more skillful than great apes at a number of tasks in which they must read human communicative signals indicating the location of hidden food. In this study, we found that wolves who were raised by humans do not show these same skills, whereas domestic dog puppies only a few weeks old, even those that have had little human contact, do show these skills. These findings suggest that during the process of domestication, dogs have been selected for a set of social-cognitive abilities that enable them to communicate with humans in unique ways.\n      </p>", "Virtually all political theory and ethical systems presuppose the primacy of human beings. Abstract human beings have rights, privileges, legal standing, and-it is said-claims to our sympathy. Many political debates, therefore, center on questions of where these lines are to be drawn. But many humans do not behave this way. People, for example, may expend far more love, time, money, and energy on their pets' well-being than on abstract humans. If the choice is between an operation to save their dog's life, or saving a human life through the United Nations, for example, most will choose the former, even if put in such stark terms. This essay argues that people's love for their dogs transcends the human/animal barrier, that this love overturns assumptions about the role of abstraction in our lives, and that such attunement can be understood only via new formulations of the roles of ethics and philosophy.\n      </p>", "Sled or pack dogs have been perceived as an integral part of traditional life in the Eastern Arctic. This perception stems from our knowledge of the life way of recent Thule and modern Inuit peoples, among whom dog sledding has often been an important means of transportation. In contrast, the archaeological record of preceding Paleoeskimo peoples indicates that dogs were sparse at most, and probably locally absent for substantial periods. This pattern is real, not an artifact of taphonomic biases or difficulties in distinguishing dog from wolf remains. Analysis of securely documented dog remains from Paleoeskimo sites in Greenland and Canada underscores the sporadic presence of only small numbers of dogs, at least some of which were eaten. This pattern should be expected. Dogs did not, and could not, assume a conspicuous role in North American Arctic human ecology outside the context of several key features of technology and subsistence production associated with Thule peoples. /// On a toujours consid\u00e9r\u00e9 les chiens de tra\u00eeneau ou chiens de somme comme faisant partie int\u00e9grante de la vie traditionnelle dans l'Arctique oriental. Cette perception vient de nos connaissances sur le mode de vie des derniers Thul\u00e9s et des Inuits modernes, chez qui le tra\u00eeneau \u00e0 chiens a souvent repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un mode de transport majeur. En revanche, les donn\u00e9es arch\u00e9ologiques des peuples pal\u00e9oesquimaux qui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 Thul\u00e9s et Inuits r\u00e9v\u00e8lent que les chiens \u00e9taient tout au plus clairsem\u00e9s, et probablement absents localement pendant de longues p\u00e9riodes. Cette r\u00e9partition est bien r\u00e9elle et n'est pas le produit de distorsions taphonomiques ou de difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 faire la distinction entre les restes du chien et ceux du loup. L'analyse de restes canins proprement document\u00e9s trouv\u00e9s sur des sites pal\u00e9oesquimaux au Groenland et au Canada souligne la pr\u00e9sence sporadique de chiens en nombre toujours restreint, dont au moins quelques-uns \u00e9taient mang\u00e9s. Cette r\u00e9partition n'est pas surprenante, les chiens n'assumant pas -et ne pouvant assumer -un r\u00f4le \u00e9vident dans l'\u00e9cologie humaine de l'Arctique nord-am\u00e9ricain en dehors du contexte de diverses caract\u00e9ristiques cl\u00e9s de la technologie et de la production de subsistance associ\u00e9es aux Thul\u00e9s.\n      </p>", "Because of very real practical constraints, conditions in animal shelters are often reminiscent of those in early primate deprivation studies. Dogs are frequently surrendered to shelters because of behavior problems, and aspects of the shelter environment may induce anomalous behavior, increasing the chances that adopted dogs will be returned to the shelters. Comparative psychologists, psychobiologists, and other behavioral scientists possess the knowledge and techniques to help shelters intervene in this cycle. Experience suggests human interaction and the application of basic conditioning procedures can reduce the impact of the shelter environment, and ease the transition into the adoptive home. A program developed to meet these goals is described. Shelters can provide opportunities both for the training of students in animal-related exercises and for limited applied research. Behavioral scientists stand in a unique position to help transform conditions in animal shelters to the benefit of all involved.\n      </p>", "The sounds of black-tailed, white-tailed, and Gunnison's prairie dogs were studied in Colorado and Wyoming from February 1964 to June 1966. Observations, photographs, and tape recordings were made in the field and were supplemented by data collected from captive prairie dogs. The sounds of black-tailed prairie dogs were named and had the usual function as follows: (1) \"repetitious barks\" - alert; (2) \"chuckle\" - alert; (3) \"chatter barks\" - threat; (4) \"wee-oo\" - contact; (5) \"snarl\" - threat; (6) \"growl\" - threat; (7) \"scream\" - distress; (8) \"raspy purr\" - pleasure; and (9) \"tooth chatter\" - threat. The sounds of white-tailed prairie dogs were: (1) \"repetitious barks\" - alert; (2) \"chuckle\" - alert; (3) \"laughing barks\" - contact; (4) \"snarl\" - threat; (5) \"growl\" - threat; and (6) \"scream\" - distress. The sounds of Gunnison's prairie dogs were: (1) \"repetitious barks\" - alert; (2) \"rapid barks\" - apprehension; (3) \"chuckle\" - alert; (4) \"raspy chatter\" - contact; (5) \"snarl\" - threat; (6) \"growl\" - threat; (7) \"scream\" - distress; and (8) \"tooth chatter\" - threat.\n      </p>", "The excretory and secretory antigens from the evaginated scoleces of Taenia ovis were collected for 3 days in vitro, and used in an ELISA test to detect antibodies to T. ovis in the serum of dogs. When tested on sequentially collected sera, diagnostic ELISA values could be detected in many dogs 4 wk after infection, and remained for an average of a further 4 wk after worms were removed from dogs with an anthelmintic. Using an ELISA discriminant value that eliminated all false positives from 70 uninfected laboratory dog sera and from 57 uninfected farm dog sera, 54/62 true positives were found in sera from dogs infected with various numbers of T. ovis for various intervals. Sera from dogs infected with T. hydatigena gave 11/15 false positive reactions, whereas sera from 15 dogs infected with Echinococcus granulosus or 7 dogs infected with T. pisiformis were all negative. For T. ovis the test had a high repeatability, was not greatly influenced by the number of worms carried by the dog and higher titres were correlated with long-standing infections. Approximately 1,000 scoleces could be recovered from each experimentally infected sheep. Using the ELISA test with undiluted antigen and serum diluted 1:40, approximately 10 sera could be tested in duplicate with the excretions and secretions from each T. ovis scolex.\n      </p>", "For further elucidation of the pathogenesis of tropical canine pancytopenia (TCP), 14 German shepherd dogs were evaluated following infection with Ehrlichia canis, therapy with tetracycline, and challenge inoculation. Nine dogs developed severe chronic TCP, characterized by severe pancytopenia, hemorrhage, and secondary bacterial infection. In all dogs antibody titers increased for more than 80 days after infection, and all dogs developed hypergammaglobulinemia. Prolonged and incomplete hematologic recovery followed termination of infection by tetracycline therapy in dogs with severe chronic disease. After treatment levels of serum \u03b3-globulin returned to normal. A second inoculation of treated dogs with E. canis resulted in reinfection and hypergammaglobulinemia, but with variable increases in serum antibody. Results indicate that aplastic anemia may be important in the pathogenesis of severe chronic TCP, and that increasing antibody titers and hypergammaglobulinemia reflect persistent infection with E. canis. Differences in response to challenge may reflect underlying immunologic differences between dogs with severe disease and those that do not become seriously ill.\n      </p>", "A collection of dog bones recovered from a Thule culture site at Porden Point, Devon Island, N.W.T., was found to include abundant evidence of trauma consistent with the dogs having been repeatedly struck in the facial area. The proportional representation of bones found suggests that the Porden Point dogs ultimately formed part of the diet there. A survey of historical and ethnographic accounts of the treatment of dogs by various Inuit groups indicates that the beating of dogs to discipline them was quite common, although evidence from other sources suggests that this type of behaviour is related more to the realities of dog keeping anywhere rather than to Inuit culture in particular. The evidence concerning the use of dogs in the diet among the various Inuit groups suggests that this varied greatly. Detailed descriptions of the types of trauma found on the Porden Point skulls are provided, in the hope that it may prove possible to identify similar evidence from earlier cultures where the nature of dog use is less certain. /// Une collection d'os de chiens d\u00e9couverte \u00e0 un emplacement de culture Thul\u00e9 \u00e0 la pointe Porden dans l'\u00eele Devon (T. du N.-O.), contenait d'abondantes preuves de traumatismes semblant toutes indiquer que les chiens avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 frapp\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e sur le devant de la t\u00eate.

Post-vaccination titres measured by LPBE correlated closely with those found by RFFIT. Of 567 unvaccinated dogs tested using the LPBE, 42 (7\u00b74%) were seropositive, with titres exceeding 32. Of this group, 233 dogs were tested using the RFFIT and 115 (49\u00b74%) were seropositive, with titres exceeding 0\u00b75 IU/ml. Two lines of evidence pointed to the greater specificity of the LPBE when measuring rabies antibodies induced by natural infections: (a) no seropositive dogs were detected among the 162 unvaccinated dogs from the rabies-free island of Pemba, Tanzania, when using LPBE, whereas 15/145 (10\u00b73%) dogs of the same group were seropositive using RFFIT; (b) among Tanzanian dogs there was a close association between the location of rabies cases and location of seropositive dogs when using LPBE, but not when using RFFIT. These results suggest that LPBE may be of value in rabies seroepidemiological studies and could be developed as a reference technique for the detection of rabies antibody in domestic dogs.\n      </p>", "A new genus from the Miocene Rosebud formation in South Dakota and two new species from Miocene beds in Nebraska are described.
