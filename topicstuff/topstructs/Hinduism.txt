In many other religions, however, including Hinduism (the main though not only focus of this article), practice has a much larger role than conscience. Hinduism is not a voluntary association, and the structure of its practices, some of which are inegalitarian, makes exit very difficult. This makes liberal religious toleration an awkward fit for Hinduism; granting religious toleration in India undermines equality and autonomy in severe ways. Yet Hinduism is not without its virtues, and has historically been what I call externally tolerant-it has been relatively tolerant of other religions. Liberal toleration, by contrast, is internally tolerant-it is tolerant of religions that fit the Protestant model, while its tolerance of others is considerably more qualified. I briefly speculate at the end of the article about how to combine these two models of toleration.\n      </p>", "This paper argues against the current view that the apsidal form was Buddhist in origin and that apsidal Hindu temples are essentially Buddhist shrines subsequently converted to Hinduism. It also counters the linear view of religious change, which suggests that the Hindu temple came into its own after the decline of Buddhism in the fourth-fifth centuries AD. Instead, the paper establishes that the apsidal form was part of a common architectural vocabulary widely used from the second century BC onwards not only for the Buddhist shrine, but also for the Hindu temple and several local and regional cults. The historical development of the apsidal shrine is traced at three levels. One is at the macro-level of the Indian subcontinent from the second century BC to the nineteenth century AD. Second is the location of the apsidal form in the religious landscape of a particular site, viz. that of Nagarjunakonda in the lower Krishna valley in Andhra. Finally, the paper highlights the archaeological excavations conducted at the apsidal temple of Gudimallam also in Andhra to trace the history of the religious site from the second century BC to the twelfth century AD, the objective being to highlight the changing nature of the Hindu temple. The paper thus makes a case for plurality of religious beliefs and practices in ancient South Asia as against the prevailing view that these local and regional cults were gradually subsumed under the mantle of Sanskritization starting from the fourth-fifth centuries onwards.\n      </p>", "The experience of suffering forces people to face the question of evil, its origin and the role evil and suffering play in the world. The answers which Hinduism gives to such questions are as complicated as life itself and are found in philosophical and theological texts, in folk traditions, and in religion as it is actually practiced. Few make blind fate responsible for suffering and evil. For most Hindus God stands behind the lot which falls on mankind and all creation. Evil and suffering are considered to be an integral part of creation itself. Nor do people carry all the blame for evil. The role of demons, of ghosts, of gods and deities, with all of whom are associated both good and evil, is also ambivalent in this regard.\n      </p>", "This paper explores the roots of contemporary village religion. The eclectic nature and interaction of both rural and orthodox Puranic Hinduism have made any attempt to dissect the traditions difficult. The question arises as to which had the greatest impact, Puranic Hinduism or the non-Vedic cults, on the development of village religion. To answer this, this article will first establish the principal features of village Hinduism. Because of the constraints imposed by a short paper it will focus specifically on the ritual worship of the goddess in her various forms, through the development of an associated iconography. It will also explore historical continuity, through a study of texts, archaeological materials and evidence from ethno-archaeology. The paper concludes that rural religion represents an amalgam of local superstitions, non-Vedic cultic practice and orthodox Puranic Hinduism, which is itself an assimilation of many of these elements.\n      </p>", "This essay revisits a debate that took place in the social sciences over the \"sacred-cow controversy\" for the purpose of ecological musing. The debate was stimulated largely by Marvin Harris, whose cultural materialist position reduced the symbolism of the cow in Hinduism to a set of irrational beliefs. His alternative was to see the cow's sacredness in terms of a calculus of calories. Needless to say, his work led to criticism from both anthropologists and humanists. In the first part of the paper, I trace the history of the controversy, then move on to consider the cow herself from a Hindu point of view. Finally, I conclude with some theoretical remarks about the need for scholars of religion to be sensitive to both texts and contexts by blurring the theoretical boundaries between the fields of religion and anthropology.\n      </p>", "This paper is divided into six parts. The first presents a rudimentary definition of ethics based on Western philosophical theories, particularly their concern for articulating universal moral principles. The second examines the assumptions anchoring Western moral philosophies, and raises the question: are the philosophical presuppositions of modern Western philosophy consistent with the presuppositions of Hinduism? It concludes that the two are not entirely in agreement, particularly on the issue of personal and social identity. The third section locates areas in Hinduism that discursively concur with the concerns of Western ethicists, and explores the limits of the semblance. The fourth identifies problematic areas, and raises the question: should the idea of universal ethics be abandoned for Hinduism? The fifth section concludes that such abandonment would be hasty, and initiates a searching look into the Hindu epics for concepts that, while not identical with may still be parallel to some Western notions of ethics. The sixth looks at the content of normative Hindu morality, and generalizes on the basis of this content about the nature of \"Hindu ethics\".\n      </p>", "Unravelling the variegated existing tapestry of religious faiths is often complicated, particularly as the roots of some existing belief systems are thought to lie in processes set in force during a region's early historical, or sometimes even the prehistoric or protohistoric, period. Against this background, the present paper seeks to look at the archaeological and related evidence from one part of India - namely, the modern-day State of Rajasthan - and attempts to understand the available early data in the broader context and framework of the 'shaping' of the beliefs and practices that have, over time, come to form part of present-day 'Hinduism'.\n      </p>", "This paper uses archaeological evidence to identify some of the multiple religious strands and layers that mark the rich cultural landscape of ancient Mathura (in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh). Focusing on the four centuries between c. 200 BC and AD 200, it identifies what can be described in retrospect as an important stage in the early history of popular Hinduism. The paper highlights the importance of the old cults of the goddesses, yakshas, yakshis, nagas, nagis, and their interface with emerging Puranic pantheons. It delineates the architectural forms of early temples in the Mathura area, their sources of patronage and the religious dimensions of royal policy, bringing into focus the great resilience of some of the older cults.\n      </p>", "The purpose of this paper is to examine aspects of Hindu worship at Vijayanagara, which formed the capital of an empire from the mid-fourteenth century to AD 1565. While the earliest cult was that of a local goddess known as Pampa, this deity was absorbed in the pre-empire period into the pantheon of the great gods of Hinduism, through her marriage to Virupaksha (a form of Shiva) who soon superseded her in importance. Virupaksha was chosen as the tutelary deity of the Vijayanagara kings and state but, even after the collapse of the empire, the temple dedicated to him survived as the main cult centre at the site. There were other Shaiva deities as well such as Bhairava, Virabhadra and Ganesha, though Vaishnava cults were not prevalent at the site till the early-empire period. The earliest Vaishnava deity to be incorporated at Vijayanagara was Narasimha. The cult of Rama and the development of the Ramayana myths associated with the site was an early fifteenth-century phenomenon. In the sixteenth century, other Vaishnava deities, such as Vitthala, Krishna, Tiruvengalanatha and Ranganatha, gained in popularity. The paper also touches upon the cults of lesser divinities, folk deities such as Hanuman and Yellamma, and on the archaeological evidence of other religions such as Jainism and Islam at Vijayanagara.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "This article focuses on the contrast between the attempts of Sir William Jones and those of his fellow Orientalist, Nathaniel Halhed, to introduce the Hindu deities and their native devotees to a Western audience, both within the colony and in Europe. Contrasting representations of Muslim culture, the Brahman \u00e9lite, classical Hinduism, contemporary Hindu practices, and the goddess Durg\u0101 are shown to reveal either lamentable decline or dynamic continuity. Whereas Halhed, looking back to a pristine, monotheistic, and classical Hinduism, subscribed to the contemporary prejudice against popular ritual, Jones in his exposition of a syncretic East/West synthesis appreciated the continuity between ancient Sanskrit doctrinal texts and contemporary devotional ritual.\n      </p>", "Is there really a single ancient religion designated by the catch-all term 'Hinduism' or is the term merely a fairly recent social construction of Western origin? This paper examines the role played by Orientalist scholars in the construction of Western notions of Indian religion by an examination of the origins of the concept of 'Hinduism'. It is argued that the notion of 'Hinduism' as a single world religion is a nineteenth century construction, largely dependent upon the Christian presuppositions of the early Western Orientalists. However, exclusive emphasis upon the role of Western Orientalists constitutes a failure to acknowledge the role played by key indigenous informants (mostly from the br\u0101hma\u1e47a castes) in the construction of modern notions of 'the Hindu religion'. To ignore the indigenous dimension of the invention of 'Hinduism' is to erase the colonial subject from history and perpetuate the myth of the passive Oriental. The paper concludes with a discussion of the accuracy and continual usefulness of the term 'Hinduism'.\n      </p>", "In Hinduism great emphasis is given to visual interaction between deity and worshippers. Devotees wish to see and be seen by the gods, and believe that they will be benefited by doing so. Underlying this belief is a conception of \"seeing\" as an extrusive flow-of-seeing that brings seer and seen into actual contact. Under the right circumstances devotees are thereby enabled to take into themselves, by means of vision, something of the inner virtue or power of the deity, including the deity's own power of seeing. Evidence in support of this thesis is drawn from three sources: two modern religious movements and a popular religious film.\n      </p>", "The paper is conceptually divided into four parts. In the first part the widely held view that ancient Hinduism was not a missionary religion is presented. (The term ancient is employed to characterize the period in the history of Hinduism extending from fifth century B.C.E. to the tenth century. The term 'missionary religion' is used to designate a religion which places its followers under an obligation to missionize.) In the second part the conception of conversion in the context of ancient Hinduism is clarified and it is explained how this conception differs from the notion of conversion as found in Christianity. In the third part the view that ancient Hinduism was not a missionary religion is challenged by presenting textual evidence that ancient Hinduism was in fact a missionary religion, inasmuch as it placed a well-defined segment of its members under an obligation to undertake missionary activity. Such historical material as serves to confirm the textual evidence is then presented in the fourth part.\n      </p>", "The article presents Tamil folk narrators' views of demons in tales gathered by Tamil writers. The author points out the demons' supernatural power and its limits as well as their character traits. She stresses the impossibility of essentially defining the concept of demon because it partly overlaps with the concepts of animal, ordinary man, holy man, and god. Although the learned or folk origin of most demonconnected views cannot be ascertained, it is suggested that the demons' indomitable desire seems to be a learned Hindu idea projected on cross-culturally malevolent supernaturals.\n      </p>", "This article is the outcome of discussions with students in India who found difficulty in apprehending the Christian conception of God.

Gandhi did not separate religion from politics. He brought a religious ethic to politics rather than political militancy into religious communities. Meanwhile, Savarkar's Hindutva ideology was narrow and exclusivist in its conflation of janma bhoomi (motherland) and punya bhoomi (holy land). In spite of its pretensions to be nationalist and modern, its militant chauvinism and authoritarian fundamentalism make Savarkar's Hindutva the antithesis of Gandhi's Hinduism. I lindutva defines India as Hindu and wants all Indians to be Hindus. In contrast, Gandhi's Hinduism gives space to all. I his paper argues that the future of our multicultural, pluri religious people can only be even bloodier with the preclusions of Savarkar's Hindutva.

By stressing humanism and social concern as the core of religion, parochial tendencies that could lead to violence may be checked. How far does Hinduism have social concerns?

In 1924, they created the Clarkstown Country Club, where yoga was taught to affluent and influential clientele. The network created through this endeavor not only popularized yoga in the West but also advanced the reinvention of yoga as a science of health and well-being rather than as a religious practice.\n         This article suggests that the pair's success in marketing yoga coincided with a shift in gender roles underway at the turn of the century. Economic and cultural changes led to the rise of a \u201cNew Woman\u201d who was not only more financially independent but also more socially and sexually autonomous. At the same time, a crisis of masculinity led to the rise of the \u201cNew Man\u201d as men sought out new cultural forms through which to restore their sense of manhood. Bernard's success depended largely on his ability to capitalize on the perceived \u201cotherness\u201d of yoga, presenting it as a resource for Americans seeking to construct new forms of gender identity. Bernard borrowed from the physical culture movement and presented yoga as an antidote to the emasculating effects of modern society. DeVries taught a combination of yoga and sensual Orientalist dances that offered women a form of sexual autonomy and embodied empowerment. By utilizing these strategies, Bernard and DeVries helped lay important foundations for modern postural yoga and its associations with athleticism, physical beauty, and sexuality.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Preserving orthodox Hindu responses to the reforms advocated by the rational Hindu monotheism of the Brahmo Samaj and evangelical Christian missionaries, the newspaper stressed the unifying character of Hindu ritual, the spiritual significance of caste, and the traditional gender relations symbolized by widow immolation even after its 1829 abolition. The paper's greatest contribution to historians' understanding of the construction of Hinduism as a coherent entity is its clear testimony to the essential role played by Hindus themselves in that process, often associated with Orientalists and missionaries.\n      </p>", "The members of the Hare Krishna movement in Singapore have been subjected to state and social disapproval since the late seventies. In order to gain legitimate space and approval they have adopted various strategies of negotiating their identity within the social structure of Singapore. In this paper, we investigate the transformation of the relationship between State and Hare Krishna and popular Hinduism and Hare Krishna over the past four decades. This paper also serves as a documentation of the growth of the Hare Krishna movement in Singapore. It will be shown that Hare Krishna devotees, while cautious not to provoke the state into sanctioning them, have persisted in their devotional practices and gradually expanded in terms of numbers and social spaces. The social oppression they face has also caused them to re-negotiate their ambiguous identification with popular Hinduism. Interviews with them suggest that the negotiation of identity with Hinduism is complex. Although all of them have a similar understanding of the Hare Krishna philosophy, they employ different definitions of Hinduism and act accordingly.\n      </p>", "The late twentieth century has seen far-reaching changes in the translocal cultural regimes known as world religions.

Dharma\u015b\u0101stra, it is argued, should be viewed as a form of legal rhetoric and its formulations of \"dharma\" understood as paradigmatic for the Hindu tradition as a whole.

The Hindu missionaries, too, have shown an inordinate interest in converting the socially dominant and powerful Muslim Rajputs and not the 'lower' Muslim castes who form the majority of the Indian Muslim population.

Even after the emergence of the caste system, Hindu society still saw considerable occupational and social mobility. Moreover, Hinduism created legends to impress on the popular mind the invalidity of the caste system - a fact further reinforced by the constant efflorescence of reform movements throughout history.

Neither the popular nor the scholarly debate in modern India has paid sufficient attention to unmarried learned women in ancient Hindu texts. I examine the recurrent figure of Sulabha, a single woman and an intellectual-renunciant; I focus on her debate with philosopher-king Janaka in the epic Mahabharata. When Janaka uses anti-women arguments to critique Sulabha's unconventional behavior, Sulabha successfully establishes, on the basis of Hindu philosophical principles, that there is no essential difference between a man and a woman; she also demonstrates by her own example that a woman may achieve liberation by the same means as a man. In the same epic, a married woman wins her debate with a male sage, proving that even a woman following the conventional path of wifely devotion may equal or outdo a sage in wisdom and virtue.\n      </p>", "An 1895 riot in the South Indian town of Kalugumalai is analysed with reference to the spatial and cosmological issues which provided the idiom for \u00bf he conflict.

This article juxtaposes iconography and mythology; field data on worship in a Murukan temple in Kalugumalai, South India; and analytic concepts from western and Indian metaphysics, to examine what Gell termed the `ritual manipulation of time'. In Hindu cosmology, the materialization of divinity-a prerequisite for worship-is inseparably linked not only to the emergence of time but also to the devolution of divinity into gendered forms. Because gender differences play a central role in iconography, mythology and worship, Hinduism provides a rich cultural resource for debating the morality and practice of human kinship, sexuality and procreation. Not only are there significant homologies between human and divine kinship behaviour, but human marriage patterns in South India display the same blend of repetitive yet changing oscillation as do daily and annual temple liturgies.\n      </p>", "This paper examines the impact that the French principle of la\u00efcit\u00e9 has upon Indian and Hindu associations' production of messages about Hinduism in Guadeloupe, French West Indies. La\u00efcit\u00e9 is meant to protect the public arena so that all religious traditions may coexist privately. It is the principle that, for example, has restricted displays of Muslim identity in women by banning the headscarf (foulard) in public spaces such as national schools. In Guadeloupe, Indian and Hindu associations are forced to respond to French public policy in configuring their messages about Hinduism. To fit their messages within the context of la\u00efcit\u00e9, associations have chosen to present Indian culture and Hinduism as two entities; Indian culture has to do with dances and songs, whereas Hinduism is everything related to the temple. Beyond the appearance of la\u00efcit\u00e9 that Indian and Hindu associations cultivate, however, this paper suggests that they are deliberately creating understandings of Indian culture that are everyday more inclusive of Hinduism. Since the principle of la\u00efcit\u00e9 does not allow this religious minority to exist in a meaningful way, the minority has expanded the notion of la\u00efcit\u00e9 in order to survive.\n      </p>", "Over the past fifty years, a number of approaches to the recovery of the multiple pasts of Hinduism have held the field. These include that of the discipline of History of Religions as it is constituted in North America as well as those of the Hindu nationalists, the colonial and post-colonial historians, and the Subaltern Studies School. None of these approaches have proven satisfactory because, for methodological or ideological reasons, none have adequately addressed human agency or historical change in their accounts of the pasts out of which modern-day Hinduism has emerged. The Hindu nationalist historians hark back to an extended Vedic golden age in which religious practice remained unchanged until the corruptions spawned by the Turkish invasions of the eleventh century. Many Western indologists and historians of religion specializing in Hinduism never leave the unalterable ideal worlds of the scriptures they interpret to investigate the changing real-world contexts out of which those texts emerged. The colonial and postcolonial historians focus on the past two hundred years as the period in which all of the categories through which India continues to interpret itself-including Hinduism-were imposed upon it from without. Adducing examples of Hindu practitioners and thinkers from the colonial period, subaltern theorists and others argue that historical thought is itself alien to the authentic Indian mind. This article suggests a number of interpretive strategies for retrieving the multiple Hinduisms of the past and of the medieval period in particular as that time out of which most modern-day practices of Hinduism emerged. These include an increased emphasis on non-scriptural sources and a focus on regional traditions.\n      </p>", "Johnson's argument that social distance is the underlying dominant characteristic distinguishing church and sect is applied to Hinduism. So-called \"clean castes\" are seen as constituting a Hindu church and low castes are seen as each constituting separate sects. The locus of power in Hinduism is examined along with types of priests and congregations within the church as well as within low caste sects. The popular notion that Brahmins' power derives wholly from birth is rejected in favor of the view that at birth Brahmins inherit only the potential for religious authority and that maintenance of their power requires Brahmin priests to heed the wishes of their congregations.\n      </p>", "Hinduism has undergone several modifications in interpretation, practice, and organization in the United States in the process of being institutionalized as an American religion. While Hindu American spokespersons espouse a genteel pluralism and attempt to use Hinduism to secure a place at the American multicultural table, they also use the ideology of multiculturalism to justify and legitimize a militant Hindu nationalism. Drawing on this contradiction, the article develops a theoretical model to explain 1) why multiculturalism often seems to exacerbate \u00e9migr\u00e9 nationalism, and 2) why religion is often involved directly or indirectly in this process.\n      </p>", "This article describes the role of Hinduism in modern Indonesia and the ways in which it has been adapted to fit the government's definition of religion as a prophetic monotheism with revealed texts and a universal ethic. It gives a brief background on Indonesian history and analyzes the structure and theology of Agama Hindu Dharma Indonesia. It discusses whether a governmental reorganization of an ancient religion can be considered a new religious movement, and some approaches that might be useful from the field of religious studies. It suggests that the definition of new religious movement be changed to fit the case in which a modern religion considered to be a revealed religion also acts as a civil religion.\n      </p>", "This article examines the contemporary relationship between the \u0100rya Sam\u0101j and San\u0101tan Dharm movements among Hindus in India and abroad. Since their beginnings in the nineteenth century, the two loosely organized groups have disagreed about correct ritual practice, with the Arya Samaj promoting a simple \u201cVedic\u201d fire sacrifice, and those identifying as San\u0101tan Dharm accepting image worship as an integral aspect of Hindu practice. While Hindus whose families come from northwest India identify themselves, their families, and their practices as either Arya Samaji or Sanatani, fieldwork conducted in India and the United States from 1999 to 2009 suggests that the relationships between these two movements are more flexible than this discourse indicates. This article argues that the Arya Samaj and San\u0101tan Dharm positions have been combined within extended families, individual ritual practices, and transnational communities in more fluid ways than previously understood.\n      </p>", "The category of Hindu new religious movements is conventional and useful, but has imprecise boundaries. Scholars tend to include within it some groups that have claimed they are not Hindu (Arya Samaj, Ramakrishna Mission) or not religious (Transcendental Meditation). Within its wide range are world-affirming groups dedicated to transforming the physical and social world as well as world-transcending groups that find the status of the world doubtful and their purpose at another level or in another realm. The four articles in this special issue of Nova Religio on Hindu new religious movements represent several aspects of this category, and the potential for accommodation of basic differences, social harmony, and even world-transcendence.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "The quest to balance the material and the spiritual has a long history in the Hindu tradition, as it does in the West. While Hindus recognize desire to be a central human value, they also see it as a cause of human suffering. This tension persists within contemporary Hinduism, especially among an emergent middle class that seeks to balance spiritual fulfillment and worldly success. If we are to understand recent manifestations of Hinduism, we would do well to explore their roots in the colonial period. That is the goal of this essay, which explores the affinity between one early colonial version of Ved\u0101nta and the socioeconomic activities of its bourgeois promoters. Working from a rare set of Bengali discourses delivered at meetings of the Tattvabodhin\u012b Sabh\u0101 during its inaugural year (1839-40), this essay demonstrates how a rescripted Ved\u0101nta provided members with a worldview that legitimated both their spiritual concerns and their worldly activities.\n      </p>", "Hindu reform-inspired movements and artistic organizations produce a multicultural and multiethnic narrative for Malaysia that simultaneously asserts difference while negating both the state-sponsored and stereotypical boundaries of ethnic demarcation. An exacerbated uncertainty of identity among Indians and Malays, as perceived by elite Indians, produces a struggle for symbolic autonomy or transcendence from the ethnosymbolic ordering of the nation-state. This, ironically, manifests itself in a fetishistic hold of ethnic ideology, despite its ostensible negation by elite Hindus in Malaysia. This process is instructive for an understanding of the local contingencies of identity formation, particularly in its fixated-on form.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "At the x1=\"2558\" y1=\"568\" x2=\"4250\" y2=\"710\"core of worship in a large Hindu temple is the complex daily liturgy around which all other temple activities are structured, and upon which the order of the cosmos is said to depend.

Pre-modern states and communities in the region used natural phenomena to create a religious tradition, and then draw upon religion to form a socio-political organization. The present article attempts to explain how, in this mountainous region, the natural surroundings were the significant context within which belief systems and social structures operated. It examines the situation prevailing in the 19th and early 20th centuries in the small medieval principality of Kumharsain. Because of its semi-isolation, many of the village cults seem to have retained their roots in natural phenomena. Brahmanical orthodoxy later built upon indigenous beliefs as it spread to the countryside. The state deity was placed close to the rulers, while the indigenous village gods lived with the common folk. An intimate relationship existed between landscape, religious cults and social structure. Even today this relationship persists. It influences both local politics and decision-making processes in matters of development.\n      </p>", "The authors of the \"Sa\u1e43ny\u0101sa Upani\u1e63ads\", manuals of ascetic lifestyle and practice, recommend that wanderers renounce behavioral standards of their formerly Brahmin householder life, including ritual purity and familial duties. Patrick Olivelle argues that these ascetics are thereafter considered impure and corpse- or ghoul-like, clearly lacking in dharma. However, these Upanisads counsel pursuing mental purity and moral behavior, and modeling oneself after the perfection of the Absolute. This essay investigates ascetic notions of purity and identity, and virtues such as non-violence and kindness cultivated in forest isolation. Is ascetic dharma universal in intent, and is it conceptually opposed to householder dharma? What type of ethics is admired by the authors, what type deprecated? Olivelle's position is reevaluated, as is Jeffrey Kripal's notion that monistic mysticism does not support ethics adequately.\n      </p>", "This paper aims at the removal of an ethnocentric prejudice against magic. A few examples, taken from the authors' experience among Hindus and Christians, and their analysis show that the appreciation of symbolism plays an important role in the proper understanding of religion and magic. Magic is viewed as an integral part of religion, religion again as part of the culture it is embedded in. It is argued that the anthropological approach towards religion is instrumental in identifying and overcoming ethnocentrism\n      </p>", "Transplanting pilgrimage traditions, or the process of remaking the collective self in sacred places, requires new sacred places as worthy destinations. As people migrate from the lands where sacred places developed to those where such places may become only a distant memory, many communities attempt to recover their pilgrimage tradition by coopting sacred sites of host communities, maintaining links to their homeland, or re-creating sacred sites in the lands of resettlement through replication, (re)recognition, creating movable rituals, celebrating sites of sacred embodiment, and ritual historicizing. Examples taken primarily from Catholic and Hindu experiences in the Western Hemisphere illustrate this preliminary typology.

Initially, the article reviews general historiographical interpretations which have in recent years been developed to explain the Scottish relationship with British imperial development in India. Subsequently the article analyses in detail the religious contributions of Scottish Presbyterian missionaries of the Church of Scotland and the Free Church Missions to a Scottish sense of empire with a focus on their interaction with Hindu socio-religious thought in nineteenth-century western India. Previous missionary historiography has tended to focus substantially on the emergence of Scottish evangelical missionary activity in India in the early nineteenth century and most notably on Alexander Duff (1806-78). Relatively little has been written on Scottish Presbyterian missions in India in the later nineteenth century, and even less on the significance of their missionary thought to a Scottish sense of Indian empire. Through an analysis of Scottish Presbyterian missionary critiques in both vernacular Marathi and English, this article outlines the orientalist engagement of Scottish Presbyterian missionary thought with late nineteenth-century popular Hinduism.

C. or shortly thereafter is also the time of the development of monotheism in the Ancient Near East, and this development can be seen in the Rgveda. In general, it is argued that it is not conceivable that there should be a lapse of roughly 1500, or 1800 years between two comparable religions with comparable developments in areas which it has been demonstrated had trade with one another.

Music for a stick-dance performed annually in Bhaktapur, Nepal, articulates a variety of meanings through its performance in the context of the G\u0101\u012bj\u0101tr\u0101 festival. The musical structure provides an enabling framework through which the eschatological and emotional meanings of the festival, various social identities and \"anti-structural\" themes of burlesque and satire can be expressed through dance. But this \"structure\" is subject to recreation in performance, and has its own meanings. It articulates the social and religious configuration of urban space, and qualities of cyclicity, enclosure and intensification that permeate various domains of Newar cultural experience.
