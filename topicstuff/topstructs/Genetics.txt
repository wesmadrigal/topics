However, most accounts of the history of Drosophila genetics focus heavily on the \"boss and the boys,\" rather than the many other laboratory groups which also included large numbers of women. Using demographic information extracted from the Drosophila Information Service directories from 1934 to 1970, we offer a profile of the gendered division of labor within Drosophila genetics in the United States during the middle decades of the 20th century. Our analysis of the gendered division of labor supports a reconsideration of laboratory practices as different forms of work.\n      </p>", "The genetic basis of infection determines the dynamics of host-parasite coevolution and associated phenomena such as local adaptation and the evolution of sex and recombination. Here, we present parasite resistance as a two-step process in which hosts must first detect parasites and then eradicate them; failure at either step results in infection. The model incorporates 'matching-allele' (MA) genetics for detection and 'gene-for-gene' (GFG) genetics for eradication. We found that the oscillatory dynamics were similar to pure GFG genetics when the cost of Virulence' alleles was low, but resembled pure MA genetics when the cost was high. The magnitude of the cost that switched the dynamics from GFG dominated to MA dominated depended on the genetic architecture of defence (i.e. the number of GFG and MA loci).\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

By drawing from, and emending, earlier work of Balzer and Dawe (1986, 1997), the present account presents the three most important lines of development of classical genetics: the so-called Mendel's laws, linkage genetics and gene mapping, in the form of a theory-net. This shows that the set theoretic representation format used in the structuralist approach to the philosophy of science also applies to the domain of genetic theories. The reconstruction is intended to lend more clarity to the methodological, philosophical and didactical discussions of the foundations of genetics, and on the other hand to defend a formally, logically minded view of theories which seems to have become contested through the work of Feyerabend, Kuhn and Kitcher.\n      </p>", "Many prospective studies have reported associations between circulating C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), but causality remains uncertain. Studies of CHD are being conducted that involve measurement of common polymorphisms of the CRP gene known to be associated with circulating concentrations, thereby utilising these variants as proxies for circulating CRP levels. By analysing data from several studies examining the association between relevant CRP polymorphisms and CHD risk, the present collaboration will undertake a Mendelian randomisation analysis to help assess the likelihood of any causal relevance of CRP levels to CHD risk. A central database is being established containing individual data on CRP polymorphisms, circulating CRP levels, and major coronary outcomes as well as age, sex and other relevant characteristics. Associations between CRP polymorphisms or haplotypes and CHD will be evaluated under different circumstances. This collaboration comprises, at present, about 37,000 CHD outcomes and about 120,000 controls, which should yield suitably precise findings to help judge causality. This work should advance understanding of the relevance of low-grade inflammation to CHD and indicate whether or not CRP itself is involved in long-term pathogenesis.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Often called chemical genetics, this approach involves the screening of compounds that perturb a process of interest. In this scenario, each perturbing chemical is analogous to a specific mutation.

It shows on the one side that agricultural research and higher education institutions have played a key role in the development and institutionalization of genetics in France, whereas university biologists remained reluctant to accept this approach on heredity. But on the other side, plant breeders, and agricultural researchers, despite an interest in Mendelism, never came to see it as the breeders' panacea, and regarded it instead as of only limited value for plant breeding. I account for this judgment in showing that the plant breeders and Mendelism designed two contrasting kinds of experimental systems and inhabited distinct experimental cultures. While Mendelian geneticists designed experimental systems that allowed the production of definite ratios of different forms that varied in relation to a few characters, plant breeders' experimental systems produced a wide range of variation, featuring combinations between hundreds of traits. Rather than breaking this multiple variation down into simple elements, breeders designed and monitored a genetic lottery. The gene was a unit in a Mendelian experimental culture, an \"epistemic thing\" as Rheinberger put it, that could be grasped by means of statistical regularities, but it remained of secondary importance for French plant breeders, for whom the strain or the variety -- not the gene -- was the fundamental unit of analysis and manipulation.\n      </p>", "Multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis of the co-citation patterns of fortynine authors are used to investigate changes in the structure of Drosophila genetics literature over the years 1974-78 and 1979-83. This literature is shown to consist of a central set of author clusters representing classical genetics, surrounded by more specialized research clusters: developmental genetics, molecular genetics, neurogenetics, and population genetics. The co-cited author structure illustrates the general intellectual historical development of Drosophila genetics and is extremely stable over time. Visible changes in research patterns include the increased prominence of neurogenetics and the cross-cluster migration of individual authors. The overall stability derives from (1) the greater citation visibility and inertia of the author's oeuvre as the unit of analysis (in contrast to individual documents) and (2) temporal characteristics of the journal article as a formal archival record of research activity.

To prevent such abuse, it is essential to have clear, formal principles as well as algorithms for distinguishing genetics from eugenics. This work identifies essential distinctions between eugenics and genetics in the implied nature of the social contract and the importance ascribed to individual welfare relative to society. Rawls's construction of 'justice a fairness' is used as a model for how a formal systems of ethics can be used to proscribe eugenic practices. Rawls's synthesis can be applied to this problem if it is assumed that in the original condition all individuals are ignorant of their genetic constitution and unwilling to consent to social structures which may constrain their own potential. The principles of fairness applied of genetics require that genetic interventions be directed at extending individual liberties and be applied to the greatest benefit of individuals with the least advantages. These principles are incompatible with negative eugenics which would further penalize those with genetic disadvantage. These principles limit positive eugenics to those practices which are designed to provide absolute benfit to those individuals with least advantage, are acceptable to its subjects, and further a system of basic equal liberties. This analysis also illustrates how simple deviations from first principles in Rawls's formulation could countenance eugenic applications of genetic technologies.\n      </p>", "Low caloric intake (caloric restriction) can lengthen the life span of a wide range of animals and possibly even of humans. To understand better how caloric restriction lengthens life span, we used genetic methods and criteria to investigate its mechanism of action in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Mutations in many genes (eat genes) result in partial starvation of the worm by disrupting the function of the pharynx, the feeding organ. We found that most eat mutations significantly lengthen life span (by up to 50%). In C. elegans, mutations in a number of other genes that can extend life span have been found. Two genetically distinct mechanisms of life span extension are known: a mechanism involving genes that regulate dauer formation (age-1, daf-2, daf-16, and daf-28) and a mechanism involving genes that affect the rate of development and behavior (clk-1, clk-2, clk-3, and gro-1). We find that the long life of eat-2 mutants does not require the activity of DAF-16 and that eat-2; daf-2 double mutants live even longer than extremely long-lived daf-2 mutants. These findings demonstrate that food restriction lengthens life span by a mechanism distinct from that of dauer-formation mutants. In contrast, we find that food restriction does not further increase the life span of long-lived clk-1 mutants, suggesting that clk-1 and caloric restriction affect similar processes.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

We show that in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, simultaneous mutation of three genes, avr-14, avr-15, and glc-1, encoding glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) \u03b1 -type subunits confers high-level resistance to the antiparasitic drug ivermectin. In contrast, mutating any two channel genes confers modest or no resistance. We propose a model in which ivermectin sensitivity in C. elegans is mediated by genes affecting parallel genetic pathways defined by the family of GluCl genes. The sensitivity of these pathways is further modulated by unc-7, unc-9, and the Dyf (dye filling defective) genes, which alter the structure of the nervous system. Our results suggest that the evolution of drug resistance can be slowed by targeting antibiotic drugs to several members of a multigene family.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Furthermore, estimated rates of amino acid substitutions based on comparisons of the alpha hemoglobin chains of various mammals with that of the carp are about the same as those based on comparisons of the carp alpha and mammalian beta or the alpha and beta chains in mammals. These uniformities are regarded as evidence for the hypothesis that a majority of amino acid substitutions that occurred in these proteins are the result of random fixation of selectively neutral or nearly neutral mutations. Two implications of this possibility are discussed: (a) Random gene frequency drift is playing an important role in determining the genetic structure of biological populations and (b) genes in ``living fossils'' may be expected to have undergone as many DNA base (and therefore amino acid) substitutions as corresponding genes (proteins) in more rapidly evolving species.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

With widespread acceptance that nearly all behavioral variation reflects some genetic influence, current studies are investigating developmental changes in the nature and magnitude of genetic and environmental effects, the extent to which different behaviors are influenced by common genes, and different forms of gene-environment correlation and interaction. New designs, focused on assessment of unrelated children in the same households or neighborhood environments, and use of measured environmental variables within genetically informative designs, are yielding more incisive evidence of common environmental effects on behavior. What will be next? Behavior genetic techniques and analyses will be used to inform efforts to find genes altering susceptibility for disorder and dispositional genes affecting behavioral variation. The developing integration of behavioral and molecular genetics will identify genes influencing specific behavioral variation and enhance understanding of how they do so.

Population-specific human-genetics research has become commonplace but remains controversial, as its results can affect public and personal perceptions of the ethnic, national, and racial groups studied. Choice of populations for study has generally seemed a function of scientific, logistical, or economic factors. RESEARCH QUESTION. Has the identity of populations studied in the human-genetics research literature varied systematically, and, if it has, in what ways? METHODS. I searched the PubMed database for population-genetics reports, calculating for each a population score, a genetics score, and a mutation score. RESULTS. Some populations had been studied far more intensively than others. Many of the most frequently studied groups were ethnically defined and politically marginal in their home countries; some of these groups were involved in self-determination struggles. In the mutation-research literature, state-defined Muslim and Mediterranean populations prevailed. CONCLUSION. Study-population selection may in some cases be explained by, or may complicate, political predicament.\n      </p>", "Behavior genetics has demonstrated that genetic variance is an important component of variation for all behavioral outcomes, but variation among families is not. These results have led some critics of behavior genetics to conclude that heritability is so ubiquitous as to have few consequences for scientific understanding of development, while some behavior genetic partisans have concluded that family environment is not an important cause of developmental outcomes. Both views are incorrect. Genotype is in fact a more systematic source of variability than environment, but for reasons that are methodological rather than substantive. Development is fundamentally nonlinear, interactive, and difficult to control experimentally. Twin studies offer a useful methodological shortcut, but do not show that genes are more fundamental than environments.\n      </p>", "This study examines the dynamics of a competition and a host-parasite model in which the interactions are determined by quantitative characters. Both models are extensions of one-dimensional difference equations that can exhibit complicated dynamics. Compared to these basic models, the phenotypic variability given by the quantitative characters reduces the size of the density fluctuations in asexual populations. With sexual reproduction, which is described by modeling the genetics of the quantitative character explicitly with many haploid loci that determine the character additively, this reduction in fitness variance is magnified. Moreover, quantitative genetics can induce simple dynamics. For example, the sexual population can have a two-cycle when the asexual system is chaotic. This paper discusses the consequences for the evolution of sex. The higher mean growth rate implied by the lower fitness variance in sexual populations is an advantage that can overcome a twofold intrinsic growth rate of asexuals. The advantage is bigger when the asexual population contains only a subset of the phenotypes present in the sexual population, which conforms with the tangled bank theory for the evolution of sex and shows that tangled bank effects also occur in host-parasite systems. The results suggest that explicitly describing the genetics of a quantitative character leads to more flexible models than the usual assumption of normal character distributions, and therefore to a better understanding of the character's impact on population dynamics.\n      </p>", "We describe a strategy for quickly identifying and positionally mapping human homologs of yeast genes to cross-reference the biological and genetic information known about yeast genes to mammalian chromosomal maps. Optimized computer search methods have been developed to scan the rapidly expanding expressed sequence tag (EST) data base to find human open reading frames related to yeast protein sequence queries. These methods take advantage of the newly developed BLOSUM scoring matrices and the query masking function SEG. The corresponding human cDNA is then used to obtain a high-resolution map position on human and mouse chromosomes, providing the links between yeast genetic analysis and mapped mammalian loci. By using these methods, a human homolog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDC27 has been identified and mapped to human chromosome 17 and mouse chromosome 11 between the Pkca and Erbb-2 genes. Human CDC27 encodes an 823-aa protein with global similarity to its fungal homologs CDC27, nuc2+, and BimA. Comprehensive cross-referencing of genes and mutant phenotypes described in humans, mice, and yeast should accelerate the study of normal eukaryotic biology and human disease states.\n      </p>", "By use of human-mouse somatic cell hybrids, an autosomal gene linkage has been determined for the human loci controlling the phenotypes of lactate dehydrogenase-A (EC 1.1.1.27) and esterase-A4 (EC 3.1.1.2). These structural loci were not linked to the lactate dehydrogenase-B, peptidase-B linkage, the X chromosome, the E17 chromosome, or to nine other enzyme phenotypes examined.\n      </p>", "The rapid development of biological technology in recent years has generated an overwhelming quantity of highly complex genetical data. In retrospect it is perhaps now obvious that standard stochastic sampling algorithms were destined to fail when applied to the type of models that these data require. During this period, both the genetics and statistics research communities have developed a range of new algorithms that have endeavored to avoid these failures. This article presents a brief journey through the development of some of these algorithms. I hope to demonstrate that continued collaborative research and education in both genetics and statistics disciplines is crucial for the advancement of future sampling frameworks, and call on researchers in both fields to take up this challenge.\n      </p>", "We selected peptide aptamers from combinatorial libraries that disrupted cell-cycle arrest caused by mating pheromone in yeast. We used these aptamers as baits in two-hybrid hunts to identify genes involved in cell-cycle arrest. These experiments identified genes known to function in the pathway, as well as a protein kinase, the CBK1 product, whose function was not known. We used a modified two-hybrid system to identify specific interactions disrupted by these aptamers. These experiments demonstrate a means to perform \"genetics\" on the protein complement of a cell without altering its genetic material. Peptide aptamers can be identified that disrupt a process. These aptamers can then be used as affinity reagents to identify individual proteins and protein interactions needed for the process. Forward genetic analysis with peptide aptamer \"mutagens\" should be particularly useful in clucidating genetic networks in organisms and processes for which classical genetics is not feasible.\n      </p>", "Many sedentary, clonal marine invertebrates compete intensively with conspecifics for habitable space. Allorecognition systems mediate the nature and outcome of these intraspecific competitive interactions, such that the initiation of agonistic behavior and the potential for intergenotypic fusion depend strongly on the relatedness of the contestants. The dependence of these behaviors on relatedness, along with the extraordinary precision with which self can be discriminated from nonself, suggest that allorecognition systems are highly polymorphic genetically. However, allotypic specificity of this sort could be produced by any number of genetic scenarios, ranging from relatively few loci with abundant allelic variation to numerous loci with relatively few alleles per locus. At this point, virtually nothing is known of the formal genetics of allorecognition in marine invertebrates; consequently, the evolutionary dynamics of such systems remain poorly understood. In this paper, we characterize the formal genetics of allorecognition in the marine hydrozoan Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus. Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus colonizes gastropod shells occupied by hermit crabs. When two or more individuals grow into contact, one of three outcomes ensues: fusion (compatibility), transitory fusion (a temporary state of compatibility), and rejection (incompatibility, often accompanied by the production of agonistic structures termed hyperplastic stolons). Observed patterns of compatibility between unrelated, half-sib pairs, and full-sib pairs show that unrelated and half-sib pairs under laboratory culture have a very low probability of being fusible, whereas full sibs have a roughly 30% rate of fusion in experimental pairings. The genetic simulations indicate that roughly five loci, with 5-7 alleles per locus, confer specificity in this species. In ecological terms, the reproductive ecology of H. symbiolongicarpus should promote the cosettlement of kin, some of which should be full sibs, and some half sibs. Thus, there is potential for kin selection to play a major role in the evolution of the H. symbiolongicarpus allorecognition system. In genetic terms, this system conforms to theoretical predictions for a recognition system selected to distinguish among classes of kin, in addition to self from nonself.\n      </p>", "Explaining the causes of variation in the severity of malarial disease remains a major challenge in the treatment and control of malaria. Many factors are known to contribute to this variation, including parasite genetics, host genetics, acquired immunity, and exposure levels. However, the relative importance of each of these to the overall burden of malarial disease in human populations has not been assessed. Here, we have partitioned variation in the incidence of malarial infection and the clinical intensity of malarial disease in a rural population in Sri Lanka into its component causes by pedigree analysis of longitudinal data. We found that human genetics, housing, and predisposing systematic effects (e.g., sex, age, occupation, history of infections, village) each explained approximately 15% of the variation in the frequency of malarial infection. For clinical intensity of illness, 20% of the variation was explained by repeatable differences between patients, about half of which was attributable to host genetics. The other half was attributable to semipermanent differences among patients, most of which could be explained by known predisposing factors. Three percent of variation in clinical intensity was explained by housing, and an additional 7% was explained by current influences relating to infection status (e.g., parasitemia, parasite species). Genetic control of Plasmodium falciparum infections appeared to modulate the frequency and intensity of infections, whereas genetic control of Plasmodium vivax infections appeared to confer absolute susceptibility or refractoriness but not intensity of disease. Overall, the data show consistent, repeatable differences among hosts in their susceptibility to clinical disease, about half of which are attributable to host genes.\n      </p>", "The presence of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells makes the mouse a powerful model organism for reverse genetics, gene function study through mutagenesis of specific genes. In contrast, forward genetics, identification of mutated genes responsible for specific phenotypes, has an advantage to uncover novel pathways and unknown genes because no a priori assumptions are made about the mutated genes. However, it has been hampered in mice because of the lack of a system in which a large-scale mutagenesis and subsequent isolation of mutated genes can be performed efficiently. Here, we demonstrate the efficient chromosomal transposition of a Tc1/mariner-like transposon, Sleeping Beauty, in mice. This system allows germ-line mutagenesis in vivo and will facilitate certain aspects of phenotype-driven genetic screening in mice.\n      </p>", "The genetic markers of human immunoglobulins have significantly contributed to the understanding of the molecular biology of antibody synthesis. Like the Gm markers of IgG, the first genetic marker of serum IgA, a major immunoglubulin of exocrine secretions, has now been defined and termed Am(1). It is inherited as a Mendelian dominant trait and is independent of the Gm and Inv allotypes. Am(1) is localized in the \u03b1 -chains of the \u03b3 A2 subclass and is independent of the serum \u03b3 A2 levels. Its polymorphism makes it suitable for studies in population genetics and the molecular biology of IgA globulin.\n      </p>", "Human brain oscillations represent important features of information processing and are highly heritable. A common feature of beta oscillations (13-28 Hz) is the critical involvement of networks of inhibitory interneurons as pacemakers, gated by \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) action. Advances in molecular and statistical genetics permit examination of quantitative traits such as the beta frequency of the human electroencephalogram in conjunction with DNA markers. We report a significant linkage and linkage disequilibrium between beta frequency and a set of GABAA receptor genes. Uncovering the genes influencing brain oscillations provides a better understanding of the neural function involved in information processing.\n      </p>", "The attitudes of Australian practitioners working in clinical genetics and obstetrical ultrasound were surveyed on whether termination of pregnancy (TOP) should be available for conditions ranging from mild to severe fetal abnormality and for non-medical reasons. These were compared for terminations at 13 weeks and 24 weeks. It was found that some practitioners would not facilitate TOP at 24 weeks even for lethal or major abnormalities, fewer practitioners support TOP at 24 weeks compared with 13 weeks for any condition, and the difference in attitudes to TOP between 13 weeks and 24 weeks is most marked for pregnancies which are normal or involve a mild disorder. It is argued that a fetal abnormality criterion for late TOP is inconsistently applied, discriminatory and eugenic. Four possible moral justifications for current practice are examined, each of which would require significant changes to current practice. I argue in favour of a maternal interests criterion for any TOP.\n      </p>", "With the advancement of genetic information and technologies, there is an increasing need for a genetically literate public. This study looks critically at student learning and at the current instruction of genetics in introductory non\u2013science major biology and genetics courses at the undergraduate level. A new diagnostic tool, the Genetic Literacy Assessment Instrument, was administered pre- and postcourse to more than 300 students in six introductory nonmajor courses that emphasize genetics to varying degrees. Current data from students in these courses show a precourse average score of 43 percent correct zn the inventory. Postcourse scores increased only modestly, to an average of 49 percent. In this article, we discuss the impact of teaching methods and course content on scores, as well as student learning in the different content areas of genetics. The results suggest that further studies in genetics education are needed to better understand the effect of teaching methods on achieving genetic literacy.\n      </p>", "This article describes an extended collaboration between a development team and an evaluation team working with GenScope, an open-ended exploratory software tool. In some respects, this was a routine evaluation, documenting substantial gains (of roughly 1 SD) in genetics reasoning ability in all but 1 of 17 classes, despite challenges presented by school computer-lab settings. Relative to matched comparison classes, larger gains were found in technical biology and general science courses but not in college prep or honors biology courses. In other respects, our effort illustrates the value of new views of assessment, technology, and research. The alignment of a sophisticated research assessment and simple classroom assessments shed light on initial failures, spurring revision. By refining the GenScope activities and extending the classroom assessments, we supported worthwhile whole-class discourse around the shared understanding of the software. A follow-up study in a laptop-equipped classroom yielded the absolute and relative gains (3.1 SD and 1.6 SD) that proponents of such innovations have long promised. In retrospect, the strengths and weakness of the study illustrate the value of newer \"design-based\" approaches to educational research.\n      </p>", "We explore the distinctive characteristics of Mexico's society, politics and history that impacted the establishment of genetics in Mexico, as a new disciplinary field that began in the early 20th century and was consolidated and institutionalized in the second half. We identify about three stages in the institutionalization of genetics in Mexico. The first stage can be characterized by Edmundo Taboada, who was the leader of a research program initiated during the C\u00e1rdenas government (1934-1940), which was primarily directed towards improving the condition of small Mexican farmers. Taboada is the first Mexican post-graduate investigator in phytotechnology and phytopathology, trained at Cornell University and the University of Minnesota, in 1932 and 1933, respectively. He was the first investigator to teach plant genetics at the National School of Agriculture and wrote the first textbook of general genetics, Genetics Notes, in 1938. Taboada's most important single genetics contribution was the production of \"stabilized\" corn varieties. The extensive exile of Spanish intellectuals to Mexico, after the end of Spain's Civil War (1936-1939), had a major influence in Mexican science and characterizes the second stage. The three main personalities contributing to Mexican genetics are Federico Bonet de Marco and Bibiano Fern\u00e1ndez Osorio Tafall, at the National School of Biological Sciences, and Jos\u00e9 Luis de la Loma y Oteyza, at the Chapingo Agriculture School. The main contribution of the Spanish exiles to the introduction of genetics in Mexico concerned teaching. They introduced in several universities genetics as a distinctive discipline within the biology curriculum and wrote genetics text books and manuals. The third stage is identified with Alfonso Le\u00f3n de Garay, who founded the Genetics and Radiobiology Program in 1960 within the National Commission of Nuclear Energy, which had been founded in 1956. The Genetics and Radiobiology Program rapidly became a disciplinary program, for it embraced research, teaching, and training of academics and technicians. The Mexican Genetics Society, created by de Garay in 1966, and the development of strains and cultures for genetics research were important activities. One of de Garay's key requirements was the compulsory training of the Program's scientists for at least one or two years in the best universities of the United States and Europe. De Garay's role in the development of Mexican genetics was fundamental. His broad vision encompassed the practice of genetics in all its manifestations.\n      </p>", "Immigration is an important force shaping the social structure, evolution, and genetics of populations. A statistical method is presented that uses multilocus genotypes to identify individuals who are immigrants, or have recent immigrant ancestry. The method is appropriate for use with allozymes, microsatellites, or restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) and assumes linkage equilibrium among loci. Potential applications include studies of dispersal among natural populations of animals and plants, human evolutionary studies, and typing zoo animals of unknown origin (for use in captive breeding programs). The method is illustrated by analyzing RFLP genotypes in samples of humans from Australian, Japanese, New Guinean, and Senegalese populations. The test has power to detect immigrant ancestors, for these data, up to two generations in the past even though the overall differentiation of allele frequencies among populations is low.\n      </p>", "Mariner-family transposable elements are active in a wide variety of organisms and are becoming increasingly important genetic tools in species lacking sophisticated genetics. The Himar1 element, isolated from the horn fly, Haematobia irritans, is active in Escherichia coli when expressed appropriately. We used this fact to devise a genetic screen for hyperactive mutants of Himar1 transposase that enhance overall transposition from \u2248 4- to 50-fold as measured in an E. coli assay. Purified mutant transposases retain their hyperactivity, although to a lesser degree, in an in vitro transposition assay. Mutants like those described herein should enable sophisticated analysis of the biochemistry of mariner transposition and should improve the use of these elements as genetic tools, both in vivo and in vitro.\n      </p>", "By means of low-stringency cross-species hybridization to Southern DNA blots, human c-jun sequences were used to identify a unique Drosophila melanogaster locus (Djun). The predicted DJun protein is highly homologous to members of the mammalian Jun family in both the DNA binding and leucine zipper regions. Djun was mapped by in situ hybridization to position 46E of the second chromosome. It encodes a 1.7-kilobase transcript constitutively expressed at all developmental stages. Functionally, Djun in cooperation with mouse c-fos can trans-activate activator protein 1 DNA binding site when introduced into mammalian cells. Taken together, these data suggest that Djun, much like its mammalian homolog, may activate transcription of genes involved in regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and development. Furthermore, the identification of Djun allows one to exploit the genetics of Drosophila to identify genes in signal transduction pathways involving Djun and thus c-jun.\n      </p>", "Response to the steroid hormone ecdysone in Drosophila is controlled by genetic regulatory hierarchies that include eight members of the nuclear receptor protein family. The DHR3 gene, located within the 46F early-late ecdysone-inducible chromosome puff, encodes an orphan nuclear receptor that recently has been shown to exert both positive and negative regulatory effects in the ecdysone-induced genetic hierarchies at metamorphosis. We used a reverse genetics approach to identify 11 DHR3 mutants from a pool of lethal mutations in the 46F region on the second chromosome. Two DHR3 mutations result in amino acid substitutions within the conserved DNA binding domain. Analysis of DHR3 mutants reveals that DHR3 function is required to complete embryogenesis. All DHR3 alleles examined result in nervous system defects in the embryo.\n      </p>", "Ordering clones from a genomic library into physical maps of whole chromosomes presents a central computational/statistical problem in genetics. Here we present a physical mapping algorithm for creating ordered genomic libraries or contig maps by using a random cost approach [Berg, A. (1993) Nature (London) 361, 708-710]. This random cost algorithm is 5-10 times faster than existing physical mapping algorithms and has optimization performance comparable to existing procedures. The speedup in the algorithm makes practical the widespread use of bootstrap resampling to assess the statistical reliability of links in the physical map as well as the use of more elaborate physical mapping criteria to improve map quality. The random cost algorithm is illustrated by its application in assembling a physical map of chromosome IV from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans.\n      </p>", "The apoprotein(a)[apo(a)] gene encodes a protein component of the circulating lipoprotein(a)[Lp(a)]. The apo(a) gene is highly homologous to the plasminogen gene. It encodes one of the most polymorphic human proteins, due to variability in the number of repetitions of structures called kringles. In addition, Lp(a) levels vary among individuals by more than two orders of magnitude, the high levels being highly correlated with predisposition to early atherosclerotic disease. To better understand the genetics and function of the apo(a) gene, we have cloned in yeast artificial chromosome vectors DNA fragments comprising the linked apo(a) and plasminogen genes and other members of the plasminogen family. By a combination of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and genome walking experiments, we have identified the 5' portion and flanking regions of the apo(a) gene.\n      </p>", "Phospholipid metabolism plays an important role in cellular regulation by generating second messengers for signal transduction. Many stimuli activate a phospholipase D, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine, producing phosphatidic acid and choline. Here we report that the yeast SP014 gene, which is essential for meiosis [Honigberg, S. M., Conicella, C. \\&amp; Esposito, R. E. (1992) Genetics 130, 703-716], encodes a phospholipase D. SPO14 RNA and protein activity are induced during late meiotic prophase, and the enzyme has properties similar to mammalian phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-regulated phospholipase D. Characterization of an unusual allele of SPO14 defines regions of the protein important for enzyme catalysis and regulation. These results implicate phospholipase D signaling in regulating cellular differentiation.\n      </p>", "The resurgence of malaria in recent decades has been accompanied by the worldwide spread of resistance to chloroquine, a drug once uncontested as the first-line antimalarial agent because of its efficacy and low toxicity. Chloroquine-resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum counter the drug by expelling it rapidly via an unknown mechanism. In the absence of explicit biochemical knowledge of this efflux mechanism, reverse genetics provides a powerful approach to the molecular basis of chloroquine resistance. Here we report genetic linkage analysis in which 85 restriction fragment length polymorphism markers were used to examine inheritance of the 14 P. falciparum chromosomes in a laboratory cross between a chloroquine-resistant and a chloroquine-sensitive parasite. Inheritance data from 16 independent recombinant progeny show that the rapid efflux, chloroquine-resistant phenotype is governed by a single locus within an \u2248400-kilobase region of chromosome 7. Identification and characterization of genes within this region should lead to an understanding of the chloroquine-resistance mechanism.\n      </p>", "Progressive rod-cone degeneration (prcd) is the most widespread hereditary retinal disease leading to blindness in dogs and phenotypically is the canine counterpart of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) in humans. In previous efforts to identify the genetic locus for prcd, the canine homologs for many of the genes causally associated with RP in humans, such as RHO, PDE6B, and RDS/peripherin, have been excluded. In parallel with a recent undertaking to establish a framework map of the canine genome, multiple prcd-informative pedigrees have been typed with a panel of more than 100 anchor loci and microsatellite-based markers. Identification of a linkage group flanking prcd ([TK1, GALK1, prcd]-[MYL4, C09.173, C09.2263]-RARA-C09.250-C09.474-NF1) localizes prcd close to the centromeric end of canine chromosome 9 (CFA9), and excludes RARA as a candidate gene. The conserved synteny of this region of CFA9 and distal human chromosome 17q establishes the potential locus homology of prcd in the dog with RP17, a human retinitis pigmentosa locus for which no gene has yet been identified. Assignment of the prcd disease locus to an identified canine autosome represents a powerful application of the developing canine linkage map in medical genetics. The usefulness of this approach is further demonstrated by identification of the correspondence of the prcd interval to homologous human and mouse chromosomal regions. The rapid progress that is now occurring in the field of canine genetics will expedite the identification of the genes underlying many of the inherited traits and diseases that make the dog a unique asset for the study of mammalian traits.\n      </p>", "Sexual reproduction allows deleterious transposable elements to proliferate in populations, whereas the loss of sex, by preventing their spread, has been predicted eventually to result in a population free of such elements [Hickey, D. A. (1982) Genetics 101, 519-531]. We tested this expectation by screening representatives of a majority of animal phyla for LINE-like and gypsy-like reverse transcriptases and mariner/Tc1-like transposases. All species tested positive for reverse transcriptases except rotifers of the class Bdelloidea, the largest eukaryotic taxon in which males, hermaphrodites, and meiosis are unknown and for which ancient asexuality is supported by molecular genetic evidence. Mariner-like transposases are distributed sporadically among species and are present in bdelloid rotifers. The remarkable lack of LINE-like and gypsy-like retrotransposons in bdelloids and their ubiquitous presence in other taxa support the view that eukaryotic retrotransposons are sexually transmitted nuclear parasites and that bdelloid rotifers evolved asexually.\n      </p>", "Molecular data are becoming easier to collect and can help us address many important questions in invasion biology. However, for most organisms, the connection between molecular loci and phenotypic traits is not direct. Here, I review some fundamentals of population and ecological genetics and point out limitations of molecular data, particularly when the data are from loci without a known connection to the phenotype. I then discuss the ways that molecular data may facilitate management of invasive weeds, despite the limitations. Key uses of molecular data in invasive weed management include identifying species, determining their origins, and understanding mechanisms and rates of spread.\n      </p>", "P element insertion is essentially random at the scale of the genome. However, P elements containing regulatory sequences from Drosophila engrailed and polyhomeotic genes and from the Bithorax and Antennapedia complexes show some insertional specificity by frequently inserting near the parent gene (homing) and/or near genes containing Polycomb group response elements (preferential insertion). This phenomenon is thought to be mediated by Polycomb group proteins. In this report, we describe a case of homing of P elements containing regulatory sequences of the linotte gene. This homing occurs with high frequency (up to 20% of the lines) and high precision (inserted into a region of &lt;1 kilobase). We present evidence showing that it is not mediated by Polycomb group proteins but by a new, as yet unknown, mechanism. We also suggest that P element homing could be a more frequent phenomenon than generally assumed and that it could become a powerful tool of Drosophila reverse genetics, for which there is no other described gene targeting technique.\n      </p>", "Between 1946 and 1960, a new phenomenon emerged in the field of bacteriology. \"Bacterial sex,\" as it was called, revolutionized the study of genetics, largely by making available a whole new class of cheap, fast-growing, and easily manipulated organisms. But what was \"bacterial sex?\" How could single-celled organisms have \"sex\" or even be sexually differentiated? The technical language used in the scientific press -- the public and inalienable face of 20th century science -- to describe this apparently neuter organism was explicit: the cells \"copulated,\" had \"intimate contract,\" \"conjugal unions,\" and engaged in \"m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois\" relationships. And yet, to describe bacteria as sexually reproducing organisms, the definition of sex itself had to change. Despite manifold contradictions and the availability of alternative language, the notion of sexually active (even promiscuous) single-celled organisms has persisted, even into contemporary textbooks on cell biology and genetics. In this paper I examine the ways in which bacteria were brought into the genetic fold, sexualized, and given gender; I also consider the issues underlying the durability of \"bacterial sex.\"\n      </p>", "DNA polymerase \u03b2 (pol \u03b2 ) is a 39-kDa protein that functions in DNA repair processes in mammalian cells. As a first step toward understanding mechanisms of polymerase fidelity, we developed a genetic method to identify mammalian pol \u03b2 mutator mutants. This screen takes advantage of a microbial genetics assay and the ability of rat pol \u03b2 to substitute for Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I in DNA replication in vivo. Using this screen, we identified 13 candidate pol \u03b2 mutator mutants. Three of the candidate mutator mutants were further characterized in vivo and shown to confer an increased spontaneous mutation frequency over that of wild-type pol \u03b2 to our bacterial strain. Purification and subsequent analysis of one of our putative mutator proteins, the pol \u03b2 -14 protein, showed that it possesses intrinsic mutator activity in four different assays that measure the fidelity of DNA synthesis. Therefore, residue 265, which is altered in pol \u03b2 -14 and another of our mutant proteins, pol \u03b2 -166, is probably critical for accurate DNA synthesis by pol \u03b2 . Thus, our genetic method of screening for pol \u03b2 mutator mutants is useful in identifying active mammalian DNA polymerase mutants that encode enzymes that catalyze DNA synthesis with altered fidelity compared with the wild-type pol \u03b2 enzyme.\n      </p>", "The SSN3 and SSN8 genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were identified by mutations that suppress a defect in SNF1, a protein kinase required for release from glucose repression. Mutations in SSN3 and SSN8 also act synergistically with a mutation of the MIG1 repressor protein to relieve glucose repression. We have cloned the SSN3 and SSN8 genes. SSN3 encodes a cyclin-dependent protein kinase (cdk) homolog and is identical to UME5. SSN8 encodes a cyclin homolog 35% identical to human cyclin C. SSN3 and SSN8 fusion proteins interact in the two-hybrid system and coimmunoprecipitate from yeast cell extracts. Using an immune complex assay, we detected protein kinase activity that depends on both SSN3 and SSN8. Thus, the two SSN proteins are likely to function as a cdk-cyclin pair. Genetic analysis indicates that the SSN3-SSN8 complex contributes to transcriptional repression of diversely regulated genes and also affects induction of the GAL1 promoter.\n      </p>", "Muriel Wheldale, a distinguished graduate of Newnham College, Cambridge, was a member of William Bateson's school of genetics at Cambridge University from 1903. Her investigation of flower color inheritance in snapdragons (Antirrhinum), a topic of particular interest to botanists, contributed to establishing Mendelism as a powerful new tool in studying heredity. Her understanding of the genetics of pigment formation led her to do cutting-edge work in biochemistry, culminating in the publication of her landmark work, The Anthocyanin Pigments of Plants (1916). In 1915, she joined Frederick Gowland Hopkin's Department of Biochemistry as assistant and in 1926 became one of the first women to be appointed university lecturer. In 1919 she married the biochemist Huia Onslow, with whom she collaborated until his death in 1922. This paper examines Wheldale's work in genetics and especially focuses on the early linkage of Mendelian methdology with new techniques in biochemistry that eventually led to the founding of biochemical genetics. It highlights significant issues in the early history of women in genetics, including the critical role of mentors, funding opportunities, and career strategies.\n      </p>", "Genetic screens in Drosophila have lead to the discovery of many genes important for patterning and signal transduction in diverse organisms. Traditionally, the phenotypic effects of loss-of-function mutations are analyzed. As an alternative way to link genes and function, I have developed a versatile misexpression screen in Drosophila, the first such screen in higher eukaryotes. The screen identifies genes that, when over- or misexpressed in a pattern of interest, give a specific phenotype or modulate an existing mutant phenotype. It is based on Gal4 transactivation of a mobile enhancer and promoter that ``targets'' random endogenous genes for expression. The modular design of the screen allows directed expression in any temporal or spatial pattern. When activated in the developing eye, 4% of target inserts gave dominant phenotypes. One insertion was in the gene encoding Ras GTPase-activating protein; its overexpression phenotype was strongly enhanced by a mutation in Ras1. Thus, biologically relevant phenotypes and genetic interactions are identified using this method. The screen is a powerful new tool for developmental genetics; similar approaches can also be developed for other organisms.\n      </p>", "In females, most genes on the X chromosome are generally assumed to be transcriptionally silenced on the inactive X as a result of X inactivation. However, particularly in humans, an increasing number of genes are known to \"escape\" X inactivation and are expressed from both the active (Xa) and inactive (Xi) X chromosomes; such genes reflect different molecular and epigenetic responses to X inactivation and are candidates for phenotypes associated with X aneuploidy. To identify genes that escape X inactivation and to generate a first-generation X-inactivation profile of the X, we have evaluated the expression of 224 X-linked genes and expressed sequence tags by reverse-transcription-PCR analysis of a panel of multiple independent mouse/human somatic cell hybrids containing a normal human Xi but no Xa. The resulting survey yields an initial X-inactivation profile that is estimated to represent \u2248 10% of all X-linked transcripts. Of the 224 transcripts tested here, 34 (three of which are pseudoautosomal) were expressed in as many as nine Xi hybrids and thus appear to escape inactivation. The genes that escape inactivation are distributed nonrandomly along the X; 31 of 34 such transcripts map to Xp, implying that the two arms of the X are epigenetically and/or evolutionarily distinct and suggesting that genetic imbalance of Xp may be more severe clinically than imbalance of Xq. A complete X-inactivation profile will provide information relevant to clinical genetics and genetic counseling and should yield insight into the genomic and epigenetic organization of the X chromosome.\n      </p>", "Myosin heavy chains (MyHCs) are highly conserved ubiquitous actin-based motor proteins that drive a wide range of motile processes in eukaryotic cells. MyHC isoforms expressed in skeletal muscles are encoded by a multigene family that is clustered on syntenic regions of human and mouse chromosomes 17 and 11, respectively. In an effort to gain a better understanding of the genomic organization of the skeletal MyHC genes and its effects on the regulation, function, and molecular genetics of this multigene family, we have constructed high-resolution physical maps of both human and mouse loci using PCR-based marker content mapping of P1-artificial chromosome clones. Genes encoding six MyHC isoforms have been mapped with respect to their linear order and transcriptional orientations within a 350-kb region in both human and mouse. These maps reveal that the order, transcriptional orientation, and relative intergenic distances of these genes are remarkably conserved between these species. Unlike many clustered gene families, this order does not reflect the known temporal expression patterns of these genes. However, the conservation of gene organization since the estimated divergence of these species (\u2248 75-10 million years ago) suggests that the physical organization of these genes may be significant for their regulation and function.\n      </p>", "The molecular identity and function of the Drosophila melanogaster Y-linked fertility factors have long eluded researchers. Although the D. melanogaster genome sequence was recently completed, the fertility factors still were not identified, in part because of low cloning efficiency of heterochromatic Y sequences. Here we report a method for iterative BLAST searching to assemble heterochromatic genes from shotgun assemblies, and we successfully identify kl-2 and kl-3 as 1\u03b2 - and \u03b3 -dynein heavy chains, respectively. Our conclusions are supported by formal genetics with X-Y translocation lines. Reverse transcription-PCR was successful in linking together unmapped sequence fragments from the whole-genome shotgun assembly, although some sequences were missing altogether from the shotgun effort and had to be generated de novo. We also found a previously undescribed Y gene, polycystine-related (PRY). The closest paralogs of kl-2, kl-3, and PRY (and also of kl-5) are autosomal and not X-linked, suggesting that the evolution of the Drosophila Y chromosome has been driven by an accumulation of male-related genes arising de novo from the autosomes.\n      </p>", "Canine hereditary multifocal renal cystadenocarcinoma and nodular dermatofibrosis (RCND) is a rare, naturally occurring inherited cancer syndrome observed in dogs. Genetic linkage analysis of an RCND-informative pedigree has identified a linkage group flanking RCND (CHP14-C05.377-C05.414-FH2383-C05.771-[RCND-CPH18]-C02608-GLUT4-T P53-ZuBeCa6-AHT141-FH2140-FH2594) thus localizing the disease to a small region of canine chromosome 5. The closest marker, C02608, is linked to RCND with a recombination fraction (\u03b8) of 0.016, supported by a logarithm of odds score of 16.7. C02608 and the adjacent linked markers map to a region of the canine genome corresponding to portions of human chromosomes 1p and 17p. A combination of linkage analysis and direct sequencing eliminate several likely candidate genes, including tuberous sclerosis 1 and 2 genes (TSC1 and TSC2) and the tumor suppressor gene TP53. These data suggest that RCND may be caused by a previously unidentified tumor suppressor gene and highlight the potential for canine genetics in the study of human disease predisposition.\n      </p>", "The isolation of chemically induced mutations in forward genetic screens is one of the hallmarks of Drosophila genetics. However, mapping the corresponding loci and identifying the molecular lesions associated with these mutations are often difficult and labor-intensive. Two mapping methods are most often used in flies: meiotic recombination mapping with marked chromosomes and deficiency mapping. The availability of the fly genome sequence allows the establishment and usage of molecular markers. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms have therefore recently been used to map several genes. Here we show that thousands of molecularly mapped P element insertions in fly strains that are publicly available provide a powerful alternative method to single-nucleotide polymorphism mapping. We present a strategy that allows mapping of lethal mutations, as well as viable mutations with visible phenotypes, with minimal resources. The most important unknown in using recombination rates to map at high resolution is how accurately recombination data correlate with molecular maps in small intervals. We therefore surveyed distortions of recombination rates in intervals &lt;500 kb. We document the extent of distortions between the recombination and molecular maps and describe the required steps to map with an accuracy of &lt;50 kb. Finally, we describe a recently developed method to determine molecular lesions in 50-kb intervals by using a heteroduplex DNA mutation detection system. Our data show that this mapping approach is inexpensive, efficient, and precise, and that it significantly broadens the application of P elements in Drosophila.\n      </p>", "The nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse is a widely used model for genetic studies of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus due to the similarities between the murine and human diseases. To aid in the localization and identification of diabetes-related susceptibility genes, we have constructed an interspecific backcross between NOD and Mus spretus (SEG/Pas) mice. Although no diabetic animals were observed in the first backcross generation of (SEG/Pas x NOD) x NOD (BC1), the incidence of insulitis (lymphocyte infiltration of the islets of Langerhans) exceeded 20% after injections of cyclo-phosphamide, a treatment that provokes an acute form of diabetes in NOD mice. Insulitis, a prediabetic condition, is a useful phenotype in studies of diabetes susceptibility. In the second backcross (BC2) generation, 8% of the animals became diabetic and 76% were found to have insulitis. Genetic mapping studies in the BC2 families confirmed the importance of the major histocompatibility complex region on the severity of insulitis and suggested that additional susceptibility loci were linked to markers on mouse chromosomes 3, 6, and 15. Mus spretus crosses have been an important tool in recent advances in murine genetics, and our results extend their usefulness to the study of a multifactorial disease.\n      </p>", "The production of subtle or conditional mutations in mice through the combined use of site-specific and homologous recombination has become an increasingly widespread experimental paradigm in mammalian genetics. Embryonic stem cells containing recombinase transgenes that were expressed in the male germ line, but not in other tissues or in the embryonic stem cells themselves, would substantially simplify the production of such alleles. Here we show that transgenes comprised of the mouse protamine 1 promoter and the Cre recombinase coding sequence mediate the efficient recombination of a Cre target transgene in the male germ line, but not in other tissues. Embryonic stem cell lines generated from one of these transgenic strains were transfected with targeting vectors that included loxP-flanked selectable markers, and homologously recombined alleles containing the marker and functional loxP sites were isolated. These results establish the potential of the system for substantially reducing the time, effort, and resources required to produce homologously recombined alleles in mice that have been secondarily rearranged by a site-specific recombinase.\n      </p>", "The identification of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) in 1989 represents a landmark accomplishment in human genetics. Since that time, there have been numerous advances in elucidating the function of the encoded protein and the physiological basis of cystic fibrosis. However, numerous areas of cystic fibrosis biology require additional investigation, some of which would be facilitated by information about the long-range sequence context of the CFTR gene. For example, the latter might provide clues about the sequence elements responsible for the temporal and spatial regulation of CFTR expression. We thus sought to establish the sequence of the chromosomal segments encompassing the human CFTR and mouse Cftr genes, with the hope of identifying conserved regions of biologic interest by sequence comparison. Bacterial clone-based physical maps of the relevant human and mouse genomic regions were constructed, and minimally overlapping sets of clones were selected and sequenced, eventually yielding \u2248 1.6 Mb and \u2248 358 kb of contiguous human and mouse sequence, respectively. These efforts have produced the complete sequence of the \u2248 189-kb and \u2248 152-kb segments containing the human CFTR and mouse Cftr genes, respectively, as well as significant amounts of flanking DNA. Analyses of the resulting data provide insights about the organization of the CFTR/Cftr genes and potential sequence elements regulating their expression. Furthermore, the generated sequence reveals the precise architecture of genes residing near CFTR/Cftr, including one known gene (WNT2/Wnt2) and two previously unknown genes that immediately flank CFTR/Cftr.\n      </p>", "Nematode parasites show a characteristic aggregated distribution among hosts. This observation has important implications for pathogenesis, immunology, and control of these infections, but the relative roles of environment and genetics in determining these patterns have remained uncertain. This paper presents the results of the first genome scan for susceptibility to infection with roundworm (Ascaris lumbricoides). Data on 375 genetic markers were generated for each of 444 members of a genetically isolated Nepalese population, the Jirels. Ascaris worm burden as assessed by egg counts was measured in these same individuals by using the Kato Katz thick smear method. The extensive genealogical data available for the population allowed assignment of all 444 individuals to a single pedigree that contained 6,209 pairs of relatives that were informative for genetic analysis. A variance components linkage analysis resulted in the unequivocal localization of two genes (one on chromosome 1 and another on chromosome 13) with clear, significant effects on susceptibility to Ascaris infection. This is the first evidence that individual quantitative trait loci influence variation in Ascaris burden in humans.\n      </p>", "Progress in molecular genetics makes possible the development of alternative disease control strategies that target the competence of mosquitoes to transmit pathogens. We tested the regulatory region of the vitellogenin (Vg) gene of Aedes aegypti for its ability to express potential antipathogen factors in transgenic mosquitoes. Hermes-mediated transformation was used to integrate a 2.1-kb Vg-promoter fragment driving the expression of the Defensin A (DefA) coding region, one of the major insect immune factors. PCR amplification of genomic DNA and Southern blot analyses, carried out through the ninth generation, showed that the Vg-DefA transgene insertion was stable. The Vg-DefA transgene was strongly activated in the fat body by a blood meal. The mRNA levels reached a maximum at 24-h postblood meal, corresponding to the peak expression time of the endogenous Vg gene. High levels of transgenic defensin were accumulated in the hemolymph of bloodfed female mosquitoes, persisting for 20-22 days after a single blood feeding. Purified transgenic defensin showed antibacterial activity comparable to that of defensin isolated from bacterially challenged control mosquitoes. Thus, we have been able to engineer the genetically stable transgenic mosquito with an element of systemic immunity, which is activated through the blood meal-triggered cascade rather than by infection. This work represents a significant step toward the development of molecular genetic approaches to the control of vector competence in pathogen transmission.\n      </p>", "The conidiation rhythm in the fungus Neurospora crassa is a model system for investigating the genetics of circadian clocks. Null mutants at the frq (frequency) locus (frq9 and frq10) make no functional frq gene products and are arrhythmic under standard conditions. The white-collar strains (wc-1 and wc-2) are insensitive to most effects of light, and are also arrhythmic. All three genes are proposed to be central components of the circadian oscillator. We have been investigating two mutants, cel (chain-elongation) and chol-1 (choline-requirer), which are defective in lipid synthesis and affect the period and temperature compensation of the rhythm. We have constructed the double mutant strains chol-1 frq9, chol-1 frq10, chol-1 wc-1, chol-1 wc-2, cel frq9, cel frq10, and cel wc-2. We find that these double mutant strains are robustly rhythmic when assayed under lipid-deficient conditions, indicating that free-running rhythmicity does not require the frq, wc-1, or wc-2 gene products. The rhythms in the double mutant strains are similar to the cel and chol-1 parents, except that they are less sensitive to light. This suggests that the frq, wc-1, and wc-2 gene products may be components of a pathway that normally supplies input to a core oscillator to transduce light signals and sustain rhythmicity. This pathway can be bypassed when lipid metabolism is altered.\n      </p>", "A simple sensory assessment of apples provides an enjoyable and stimulating introduction to topics in genetics and the related areas of agriculture, selective breeding, and plant science.\n      </p>", "Quantitative genetics is at or is fast approaching its centennial. In this perspective I consider five current issues pertinent to the application of quantitative genetics to evolutionary theory. First, I discuss the utility of a quantitative genetic perspective in describing genetic variation at two very different levels of resolution, (1) in natural, free-ranging populations and (2) to describe variation at the level of DNA transcription. Whereas quantitative genetics can serve as a very useful descriptor of genetic variation, its greater usefulness is in predicting evolutionary change, particularly when used in the first instance (wild populations). Second, I review the contributions of Quantitative trait loci (QLT) analysis in determining the number of loci and distribution of their genetic effects, the possible importance of identifying specific genes, and the ability of the multivariate breeder's equation to predict the results of bivariate selection experiments. QLT analyses appear to indicate that genetic effects are skewed, that at least 20 loci are generally involved, with an unknown number of alleles, and that a few loci have major effects. However, epistatic effects are common, which means that such loci might not have population-wide major effects: this question waits upon (QTL) analyses conducted on more than a few inbred lines. Third, I examine the importance of research into the action of specific genes on traits. Although great progress has been made in identifying specific genes contributing to trait variation, the high level of gene interactions underlying quantitative traits makes it unlikely that in the near future we will have mechanistic models for such traits, or that these would have greater predictive power than quantitative genetic models. In the fourth section I present evidence that the results of bivariate selection experiments when selection is antagonistic to the genetic covariance are frequently not well predicted by the multivariate breeder's equation. Bivariate experiments that combine both selection and functional analyses are urgently needed. Finally, I discuss the importance of gaining more insight, both theoretical and empirical, on the evolution of the G and P matrices.\n      </p>", "Community genetics synthesizes community ecology and population genetics and yields fresh insights into the interplay between evolutionary and ecological processes. A community genetics framework proves especially valuable when strong selection on traits results from or impinges on interspecific interactions, an increasingly common phenomenon as more communities are subject to direct management or anthropogenic disturbances. We draw illustrations of this perspective from our ongoing studies of three representative communities, two managed and one natural, that have recently undergone large perturbations. The studied communities are: (1) insect pests of crop plants genetically engineered to produce insecticidal toxins; (2) insect-pollinated plants in habitats severely fragmented by agriculture and urbanization; and (3) a pathogen and its crop host now grown extensively outside their native ranges. We demonstrate the value of integrating genetic and ecological processes to gain a full understanding of community dynamics, particularly in nonequilibrium systems that are subject to strong selection.\n      </p>", "Among the three Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA repair epistasis groups, the RAD6 group is the most complicated and least characterized, primarily because it consists of two separate repair pathways: an error-free postreplication repair pathway, and a mutagenesis pathway. The rad6 and rad18 mutants are defective in both pathways, and the rev3 mutant affects only the mutagenesis pathway, but a yeast gene that is involved only in error-free postreplication repair has not been reported. We cloned the MMS2 gene from a yeast genomic library by functional complementation of the mms2-1 mutant [Prakash, L. &amp; Prakash, S. (1977) Genetics 86, 33-55]. MMS2 encodes a 137-amino acid, 15.2-kDa protein with significant sequence homology to a conserved family of ubiquitin-conjugating (Ubc) proteins. However, Mms2 does not appear to possess Ubc activity. Genetic analyses indicate that the mms2 mutation is hypostatic to rad6 and rad18 but is synergistic with the rev3 mutation, and the mms2 mutant is proficient in UV-induced mutagenesis. These phenotypes are reminiscent of a pol30-46 mutant known to be impaired in postreplication repair. The mms2 mutant also displayed a REV3-dependent mutator phenotype, strongly suggesting that the MMS2 gene functions in the error-free postreplication repair pathway, parallel to the REV3 mutagenesis pathway. Furthermore, with respect to UV sensitivity, mms2 was found to be hypostatic to the rad6\u0394 1-9 mutation, which results in the absence of the first nine amino acids of Rad6. On the basis of these collective results, we propose that the mms2 null mutation and two other allele-specific mutations, rad6\u0394 1-9 and pol30-46, define the error-free mode of DNA postreplication repair, and that these mutations may enhance both spontaneous and DNA damage-induced mutagenesis.\n      </p>", "Positive-strand RNA viruses are the largest virus class and include many pathogens such as hepatitis C virus and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS). Brome mosaic virus (BMV) is a representative positive-strand RNA virus whose RNA replication, gene expression, and encapsidation have been reproduced in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By using traditional yeast genetics, host genes have been identified that function in controlling BMV translation, selecting BMV RNAs as replication templates, activating the replication complex, maintaining a lipid composition required for membrane-associated RNA replication, and other steps. To more globally and systematically identify such host factors, we used engineered BMV derivatives to assay viral RNA replication in each strain of an ordered, genome-wide set of yeast single-gene deletion mutants. Each deletion strain was transformed to express BMV replicase proteins and a BMV RNA replication template with the capsid gene replaced by a luciferase reporter. Luciferase expression, which is dependent on viral RNA replication and RNA-dependent mRNA synthesis, was measured in intact yeast cells. Approximately 4,500 yeast deletion strains (\u224880% of yeast genes) were screened in duplicate and selected strains analyzed further. This functional genomics approach revealed nearly 100 genes whose absence inhibited or stimulated BMV RNA replication and/or gene expression by 3- to &gt;25-fold. Several of these genes were shown previously to function in BMV replication, validating the approach. Newly identified genes include some in RNA, protein, or membrane modification pathways and genes of unknown function. The results further illuminate virus and cell pathways. Further refinement of virus screening likely will reveal contributions from additional host genes.\n      </p>", "The evolution of multigene families whose members are dispersed into two or more nonhomologous chromosomes is studied from the standpoint of population genetics. By using a simple model of gene conversion, equilibrium and transient properties of the probability of identity of genes belonging to the family are investigated. Also, the time until fixation of a mutant belonging to a subdivided multigene family is studied by an approximation method. It is shown that dispersion of the family into two or more chromosomes has a relatively minor effect on the extent of identity between genes, unless the conversion rate between genes on nonhomologous chromosomes is extremely low, or unless the number of nonhomologous chromosomes on which gene members are dispersed in large.\n      </p>", "Genomic sequencing is no longer a novelty, but gene function annotation remains a key challenge in modern biology. A variety of functional genomics experimental techniques are available, from classic methods such as affinity precipitation to advanced high-throughput techniques such as gene expression microarrays. In the future, more disparate methods will be developed, further increasing the need for integrated computational analysis of data generated by these studies. We address this problem with Magic (Multisource Association of Genes by Integration of Clusters), a general framework that uses formal Bayesian reasoning to integrate heterogeneous types of high-throughput biological data (such as large-scale two-hybrid screens and multiple microarray analyses) for accurate gene function prediction. The system formally incorporates expert knowledge about relative accuracies of data sources to combine them within a normative framework. Magic provides a belief level with its output that allows the user to vary the stringency of predictions. We applied Magic to Saccharomyces cerevisiae genetic and physical interactions, microarray, and transcription factor binding sites data and assessed the biological relevance of gene groupings using Gene Ontology annotations produced by the Saccaromyces Genome Database. We found that by creating functional groupings based on heterogeneous data types, Magic improved accuracy of the groupings compared with microarray analysis alone. We describe several of the biological gene groupings identified.\n      </p>", "Full likelihood-based inference for modern population genetics data presents methodological and computational challenges. The problem is of considerable practical importance and has attracted recent attention, with the development of algorithms based on importance sampling (IS) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. Here we introduce a new IS algorithm. The optimal proposal distribution for these problems can be characterized, and we exploit a detailed analysis of genealogical processes to develop a practicable approximation to it. We compare the new method with existing algorithms on a variety of genetic examples. Our approach substantially outperforms existing IS algorithms, with efficiency typically improved by several orders of magnitude. The new method also compares favourably with existing MCMC methods in some problems, and less favourably in others, suggesting that both IS and MCMC methods have a continuing role to play in this area. We offer insights into the relative advantages of each approach, and we discuss diagnostics in the IS framework.\n      </p>", "In 1990, Palese and colleagues established a method (reverse genetics) that allowed one to generate influenza virus containing a gene segment derived from cloned cDNA. Although this method contributed tremendously to our understanding of influenza pathogenesis, the requirement of helper viruses limited its use in many experimental settings. Recently, we and others established systems for the generation of influenza viruses entirely from cloned cDNAs. These systems require only DNA cloning and transfection techniques, and can therefore be easily implemented by laboratories working in the fields of molecular biology and virology. Thus, for the first time, a system is now available that allows highly efficient generation of influenza virus without technical limitations. Using this technology, we generated the same strain of H5N1 influenza viruses that caused an outbreak in Hong Kong in 1997, killing six people.\n      </p>", "Recent progresses in the pathogenesis of sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) and genetics of familial PD are reviewed. There are common molecular events between sporadic and familial PD, particularly between sporadic PD and PARK1-linked PD due to \u03b1-synuclein (SNCA) mutations. In sporadic form, interaction of genetic predisposition and environmental factors is probably a primary event inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage resulting in oligomer and aggregate formations of \u03b1-synuclein. In PARK1-linked PD, mutant \u03b1-synuclein proteins initiate the disease process as they have increased tendency for self-aggregation. As highly phosphorylated aggregated proteins are deposited in nigral neurons in PD, dysfunctions of proteolytic systems, i.e. the ubiquitin--proteasome system and autophagy-lysosomal pathway, seem to be contributing to the final neurodegenerative process. Studies on the molecular mechanisms of nigral neuronal death in familial forms of PD will contribute further on the understanding of the pathogenesis of sporadic PD.\n      </p>", "Senescence is the decline in survival and reproduction as an organism ages and is known to occur in collared flycatchers Ficedula albicollis. We consider annual fitness (the estimated genetic contribution that an individual makes to next year\u2019s gene pool) as a measure of age\u2010specific fitness. We apply a restricted maximum likelihood linear mixed\u2010model approach on 25 years of data on 3,844 male and 4,992 female collared flycatchers. Annual fitness had a significant additive genetic component (h2 of about 4%). Annual fitness declined at later ages in both sexes. Using a random regression animal model, we show that the observed age\u2010related phenotypic changes in annual fitness were not present on the additive genetic level, contrary to predictions of genetic hypotheses of senescence. Our study suggests that patterns of aging in the wild need to be interpreted with caution in terms of underlying genetics because they may be largely determined by environmental processes.\n      </p>", "Because areas suitable for growth and reproduction are often ephemeral, a primary selective force in the evolution of migratory behavior in insects is the need to colonize new habitats. However, both migration itself and flight capability reduce present reproductive success. Thus the long-term fitness benefit of migration, the colonization of new habitats, is balanced by a short-term reduction in fitness, the result being that variation for migratory ability is preserved in a population. Migration is but one component of a wide suite of functionally connected traits that together form a migratory syndrome. Genetic variation is found in all components of the migratory syndrome, and selection for migration results in a change in the frequency of expression of these components, which can be analyzed and predicted using the mathematics of quantitative genetics. We illustrate this evolutionary interplay with the example of the evolution of wing dimorphism in the sand cricket.\n      </p>", "In translational bypassing, a peptidyl-tRNA::ribosome complex skips over a number of nucleotides in a messenger sequence and resumes protein chain elongation after a \"landing site\" downstream of the bypassed region. The present experiments demonstrate that the complex \"scans\" processively through the bypassed region. This conclusion rests on three observations. (i) When two potential \"landing sites\" are present, the protein sequence of the product shows that virtually all ribosomes land at the first and virtually none at the second. (ii) In such a sequence with two landing sites, the presence of a terminator triplet in phase in the coding region immediately after the first landing site drastically reduces the efficiency of bypassing. (iii) Internally complementary sequences that can form a stable stem/loop in the bypassed region significantly reduce the efficiency of bypassing. We analyze bypassing from a given \"takeoff\" site to \"landing sites\" at different distances downstream so as to derive estimates of the frequency of ribosome takeoff and of the stability of the bypassing complex.\n      </p>"], "words": {"represent": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "all": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "influenza": {"number": 1, "prob":
