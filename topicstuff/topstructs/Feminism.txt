{"total_words": 1133, "documents": ["Based on data from a national survey and personal interviews with more than 300 religiously committed Protestants, this analysis assesses the range and location of attitudes toward feminism among conservative Protestants. Findings suggest that evangelicals are not uniformly antifeminist. Rather, the majority are both supportive and appreciative of the gains of liberal feminism as well as concerned that feminism has gotten off track by promoting an excessive individualism that undermines stable, meaningful, and caring relationships. For most evangelicals, feminism is neither a significant subcultural religious boundary nor a focus of political mobilization or action. Political conservatism, embeddedness in conservative local religious subcultures, belief in husbands' headship and authority, and affiliation with particular subgroups and denominations help to locate and specify the sources that create, reinforce, and sustain more negative attitudes toward feminism within this diverse religious subculture.\n      </p>", "In contrast to popular presumptions and prior research on women of the \"postfeminist\" generation, this study found an appreciation for recent historical changes in women's opportunities, and an awareness of persisting inequalities and discrimination. The findings reveal support for feminist goals, coupled with ambiguity about the concept of feminism. Although some of the women could be categorized along a continuum of feminist identification, half were \"fence-sitters\" or were unable to articulate a position. There were variations in perspectives among those with different life experiences, as well as by racial and class background.\n      </p>", "In this critical personal narrative Harris explores some of the gaps between conceptions of feminist thought and feminist practice. Harris focuses on an analysis of race, class, and desire divisions within feminist sexual politics. She suggests a queer black feminist theory and practice that calls into question naturalized identities and communities, and therefore what feminism and feminist practices might entail.\n      </p>", "This article focuses on the often-lamented distinction between Women's Studies as an academic entity and feminism as a social movement. Whereas many feminist scholars urge us to return to social movement to counter the forces of institutionalization, I question the assumption that the political future of Women's Studies as a field can be guaranteed by repairing the distinction between academic institutionalization and feminism as a world changing social force. Indeed, I worry more about the implications for Women's Studies of refusing altogether the distinction between the academy and activism than about the difficulty of repairing the distinction between them.\n      </p>", "We address the question: What is the place of feminism in family studies? We focus on family studies scholarship published between 1984 and 1993 in three journals, Journal of Marriage and the Family, Family Relations, and Journal of Family Issues. We characterize feminist scholarship with five themes: (a) social construction of gender as a central concept, (b) commitment to gender equality and social change, (c) feminist practice, (d) centrality of women's lives and experiences, and (e) questioning \"the family.\" In analyzing the place of feminism in family studies, we focus on challenges, contradictions, tensions, and themes. Within each of the themes, we highlight a strong core of feminist scholarship and suggest directions for future work. We conclude that the discipline has created a legitimate place for feminism, but this place often is at the margins of family scholarship rather than the center. It is only in the domain of housework that feminism has moved to the center. In most domains, authors consider gender to be irrelevant to their understanding of family life.\n      </p>", "Today many feminists believe we are in a third wave of feminism, one that challenges the idea of dualism itself while recognizing diversity, particularity, and embodiment. By theorizing from the notion of embodiment, recent iterations of feminism are beginning to reweave the specific duality between culture and nature, an especially important endeavor in these environmentally disturbing times. These feminisms, rather than working from established and usually abstract foundational theories, begin from the situated perspectives of different(ing) women. Beyond this general congruence, however, there are several different foci in the feminisms seen as third wave today. In this work, I address the uneven movement from second-wave to third-wave feminism. I discuss three feminisms: youth feminism, postcolonial feminism, and ecofeminism, and the importance of each, in their current expression, to the present form of third-wave feminism. I suggest that while all these feminisms begin to reweave the nature/culture duality by theorizing from the notion of embodiment, ecofeminism is able to make a significant additional contribution in this regard. Besides reclaiming the female body, ecofeminism specifically includes nonhuman nature in its theorizing, an inclusion that enables it to engage in a more thoroughgoing analysis of the nature/culture dualism than other feminisms.\n      </p>", "Value change and the feminist movement represent two major shifts in mass political orientations and behavior in the late twentieth century. Yet we know little about how these two fundamental changes relate to one another. This article addresses this question by analyzing the relationship between postmaterialist values and feminism among 13 advanced industrial democracies, using the 1990-91 World Values Survey. The results suggest that both gender and postmaterialist values are associated with feminism: women and those who adopt a postmaterialist stance are notably more likely to endorse feminist beliefs compared to men or materialists. Religion also plays a major role, both in terms of individual religious self-identity, and in terms of the religious culture of the country in question. The relations among gender, postmaterialism, and feminism are complex and deserve more careful analysis. /// En cette fin de si\u00e8cle, deux forces majeures sont venues transformer les opinions et les comportements de l'\u00e9lectorat, soit l'av\u00e8nement de nouveaux courants d'id\u00e9es et le mouvement f\u00e9ministe.

However, these reforms by the \"feminist\" state did not evolve as a result of demands originating within society, but were imposed from above. The state's ideal of the modern Republican woman left out the majority of women beyond a small urbanized elite. Furthermore, state feminism did not concern itself with what happened behind closed doors, but focused on expanding women's public roles. Nevertheless, these dramatic reforms have expanded the realm of possibilities for Turkish women of all classes and allowed development of a more individualist feminism. The debates continue, but Turkey is one of the most important success stories of women's empowerment in the early twentieth century.\n      </p>", "This article explores the relationship between feminism and postmodernism in anthropology through a reading of the Derek Freeman / Margaret Mead controversy. It argues that the tensions between feminism and \"experimental\" ethnography can be captured by attending to writing practices in book reviews of Freeman's refutation of Mead. It compares reviews by George Marcus, Bonnie Nardi, and Albert Wendt, a Samoan writer. What follows is a discussion of feminist ethnography as an emergent response to the masculine bias of experimentalism. Lila Abu-Lughod's \"Can There be a Feminist Ethnography?\" redraws lines between feminist anthropology, experimental ethnography, and \"halfie\" or bicultural identity.\n      </p>", "This paper interrogates Caribbean feminist theory and activism in relation to the Euro-American experience and to challenges emerging from the Third World discourse. The author argues from the standpoint position that second wave Caribbean feminism has been largely Afro-centric and simultaneously interlocked with processes of independence and national identity struggles. She suggests that there is a need for the movement to reflect the experiences of women of other ethnic groups in the region. In this regard, in Trinidad and Tobago the Indo-Caribbean voice has been emerging and broadening the feminist base. In more recent years also the divisions between feminist and non-feminist groups are subsiding, strengthening the ultimate capacity of this movement for change in the region.\n      </p>", "This paper locates the work and critical reception of the experimental poet Lyn Hejinian within the emerging debates of 'third-wave' feminist critique. It centrally argues that Hejinian's writing at once illuminates and undermines the apparent tensions between a feminist and an anti-foundationalist critical position. It specifically focuses on Hejinian's use of autobiography, as at once gesturing to the limitations of the theoretically naive self-knowing subject, steeped in the discredited assumptions of modernity, and the continuing cultural validity of and desire for narrative, identification, self-expression and referentiality. The paper argues that Hejinian's writing makes sense of this equivocation, not through its use of feminized tropes assumed to subvert the linear assumptions of the genre and render the reader 'active', but through an attention to the ironical complexities of her own cultural positioning. Hejinian's writing demonstrates how the representation of the postmodern feminist subject involves an attention to authoriality, to the possibilities of textual experimentation and to the cultural sites that legitimize the production of meaning for these things. Hejinian demonstrates not simply that feminism can reconcile a need for agency with a critique of agency, and that such an act needs to consider its collective implications, but that these kinds of claims actually require an engagement with the varied contexts that continue to make feminist's attention to literature meaningful.\n      </p>", "This article examines developments in 'Islamic feminism', and offers a critique of feminist theories, which construct it as an authentic and indigenous emancipatory alternative to secular feminisms. Focusing on Iranian theocracy, I argue that the Islamization of gender relations has created an oppressive patriarchy that cannot be replaced through legal reforms. While many women in Iran resist this religious and patriarchal regime, and an increasing number of Iranian intellectuals and activists, including Islamists, call for the separation of state and religion, feminists of a cultural relativist and postmodernist persuasion do not acknowledge the failure of the Islamic project. I argue that western feminist theory, in spite of its advances, is in a state of crisis since (a) it is challenged by the continuation of patriarchal domination in the West in the wake of legal equality between genders, (b) suspicious of the universality of patriarchy, it overlooks oppressive gender relations in non-western societies and (c) rejecting Eurocentrism and racism, it endorses the fragmentation of women of the world into religious, national, ethnic, racial and cultural entities with particularist agendas.\n      </p>", "Geography and feminism are two powerful intellectual forces at large today. Are they forces that can communicate effectively with each other to build a richer understanding of life on earth or are they two alien worlds in collision? I explore three core analytic traditions that I see as common to geography and feminism: finding significance in everyday life, appreciating the importance of context, and thinking about difference. With examples from local labor market studies, I then illustrate how the collision between geography and feminism has not ignited a destructive explosion but instead has illuminated how we think about gender, how we think about place, and how we think about work. I argue that because geography and feminism share certain intellectual traditions, the two areas of inquiry should, once they begin to open up to and learn from each other, not only transform each other but also contribute powerful new insights about the world.\n      </p>", "This essay asks: If current third-wave controversy continues to reify oppositions between the second and third waves of feminism, largely based on caricatures, or \"straw feminisms,\" how can the grrrls and women who occupy the space of a \"third-wave political moment,\" or a \"third-wave feminist consciousness,\" accomplish the formidable tasks of feminisms? By addressing the primacy and pitfalls of dominant generational rhetoric and applying an alternative Kristevan framework, this piece examines the potentiality entailed in such a moment and challenges the limits of existing debates. Both the concepts of \"generation\" and \"wave\" reinscribe heteronormative principles in their assertion of both hegemonic familial structures and a heterosexist narrative of reproduction. Further, the unidirectional, linear (masculinist) logic of cause-effect narratives creates a sense of perpetual debt to the past. The dangers surrounding the use of a generational model of feminist intellectual exchange may suggest that it is reasonable, or even necessary, to cast aside such paradigmatic attachments. However, this essay suggests that by replacing the prevailing tripartite model with the schematic of feminist struggle outlined by Julia Kristeva in her classic essay, \"Women's Time,\" we can avoid some of the pitfalls of generational thinking and transform unproductive anxieties and closed debates into careful, open, and productive intergenerational dialogue.\n      </p>", "This paper presents an assessment of the impacts which feminism has had on sexual science. The assessment is based on an analysis of the degree to which feminist perspectives and scholarship have been integrated into: a) human sexuality curriculum materials, and b) articles published from 1980-1986 in a leading sexual science journal. Feminist impacts on curriculum materials are evaluated by reviewing several recent analyses and critiques of them. Data from an exploratory study of feminist content, gender and disciplinary affiliation of authors, and gender of editors in a sexual science journal and of disciplinary backgrounds and gender of the membership in the professional organization which publishes the journal, is then presented. The data, which show the differential distribution of journal authors and organization members by various disciplinary affiliations and by gender within those disciplines, are discussed in the context of recent explanations of factors, especially epistemological traditions, which affect the receptivity of various disciplines to feminist scholarship. Strategies for increasing the interaction between feminist scholars of sexuality and sexual science are discussed.\n      </p>", "This study explored the relationship among undergraduates' right-wing authoritarianism (as measured by the RWA scale), attitudes toward feminism, party identification, gender, and attitudes about the Clinton-Lewinsky relationship. Factor analysis yielded three subscales, reflecting participants' evaluations of Clinton's morality, the affair, and Kenneth Starr (the independent counsel). Republican identification was related to each subscale and also mediated the relationship between RWA and two subscales, which illustrates how party identification channels the expression of personality variables in partisan contexts. In addition, RWA-especially those items tapping aggression-was directly related to negative evaluations of Clinton, which suggests a punitiveness going beyond the mere channeling of opinions by party identification. Attitudes toward feminism were unrelated to the subscales, possibly because feminism supporters viewed Clinton's policies positively but his behavior negatively. However, females did give significantly lower evaluations of Clinton and the affair.\n      </p>", "The paper deals with the several aspects of the history of Feminism in the Ottoman Empire. It elucidates the early stages of the formation of the Feministic ideas and tendencies in the Turkish society at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. Particular attention is paid to the social-political activities and the role of the Turkish women writers Halide Edib, Arife Han\u0131m, and others. The author discusses inter alia the impact of the Armenian intellectual milieu and, especially, that of the Turkish Armenian women's literature on the inception and development of the Feministic literature in Turkey.\n      </p>", "Basing our analysis on survey data collected from college women aged 18 to 22 years, we assess their psychological orientations toward the feminist movement generally as well as the specific influences of negative experiences and labels used for the movement upon those orientations. Our findings show that negative experiences (e.g., sexual harassment and gendered violence) positively affect respondent support for feminism. Substituting the label \"feminist\" for the label \"women's movement\" results in more negative evaluations. We conclude that the typical dichotomies of feminist/antifeminist and feminist/postfeminist mask the complexity of young women's attitudes toward the women's movement.\n      </p>", "Many years after the Velvet Revolution, feminism remains close to a dirty word in the Czech Republic, even among women who share the views of \"Western feminists.\" Surprisingly, this may in part hark back to the negative views of \"bourgeois feminism\" propounded by the Communists. Equally surprising is the very high proportion of women who are employed, almost all of them full-time, although they continue to do the lion's share of homemaking. This strategy enables Czech women to have a high sense of personal efficacy and independence. This paper emphasizes the historical roots of women's position in Czech society, and the importance of the cultural and social context for the emergence of what we term \"Feminism, Czech Style.\"\n      </p>", "This essay examines the challenge confronting young feminists of finding their place and creating their space in the political landscape. It argues that the conceptual leverage of a \"third wave\" helps young women articulate a feminism that responds to the political, economic, technological, and cultural circumstances that are unique to the current era. Rather than take the position that the existence or authenticity of third-wave feminism ought be argued, the author asks the more important questions of what are the unique contributions that third-wave rhetoric can make? What is it about the political climate that has given rise to third wave that enables these feminists to make different contributions than second-wave feminists might make? Continuing to articulate feminism as a force to be reckoned with has become increasingly complex in our pluralistic world. It is further complicated by a now sophisticated and prolific postfeminist ideology that has co-opted and depoliticized the central tenets of feminism. The only thing postfeminism has to do with authentic feminism, however, is to contradict it at every turn while disguising this agenda, to perpetuate the falsehood that the need for feminist change is outdated. The author also discusses the rhetorical challenges facing third-wave feminists. She argues that their virtues of pluralism and contradiction could become their vices if they retreat from making arguments about what constitutes feminism, and that third-wave contributions can be made more profound if they refuse to see second wave monolithically. Finally, the author argues that third-wave feminists must meet these rhetorical challenges if they are to avoid the dangerous possibilities of false feminism: personal journey and resistance that are devoid of politics, and weak feminism: working for only as much social change as a patriarchal social order can outrun.\n      </p>", "Most general accounts of America in the 1970s view the decade as one of political apathy and narcissism. On the contrary, the 1970s saw Americans embrace a wide range of political causes. In the absence of strong national leadership, ordinary people engaged in politics at the grassroots level. An example of this vibrant political culture was the rise of second-wave feminism, which saw millions of ordinary women mobilize around a host of issues including credit and wage equity, reproductive rights, egalitarian marriage, and educational funding.\n      </p>", "This article argues that the 'Third Way', as the ideological rationale for the New Labour Government in the UK, attempts to resolve the tensions around women and social policy confronted by the present Government. The Third Way addresses 'women' without 'feminism', in particular those floating women voters for whom feminism holds little attraction. But affluent, middle England, corporate women, though central to the popular imagination of the \"Daily Mail\", and thus to Tony Blair, are in practice a tiny minority. New Labour in office thus finds itself committed to reconciling the irreconcilable. It wants to see women as a social group move more fully into employment, and on this many feminists would agree. At the same time it wants to see through further transformations of the welfare state, along the lines set in motion by Mrs Thatcher. Inevitably this involves further cuts in spending and privatization of social insurance. The former principle is made more difficult by the latter policy.

The author offers the term liberal bargain, paraphrasing Deniz Kandiyoti's \"patriarchal bargain\" and Cynthia Cockburn's \"ethnic bargain,\" and dwells on the interconnections between the three. The liberal bargain indicates the particular consciousness and symbolic whitening that \"colorized\" (i.e., excluded/oppressed) people tend to adopt when they attempt to cash in on the liberal promise. Within the discourse of postcolonial feminism, the concept is intended to promote the discussion of power differentials among women, through refining the analytically dissatisfactory color metaphors habitually used to address issues of hegemony and ethnocentrism.\n      </p>", "A series of significant internal changes transformed the British Labour Party in the years following 1983. This article is among the first to probe the women and politics dimension of these reforms, focusing on three main questions: first, what benefits accrued to Labour and organized feminism as a result of changes introduced after 1983? Second, what costs were incurred by both sides due to party reform, and how might these disadvantages affect their longer-term relationship? And third, how were initial New Labour government decisions viewed by women's group activists? The article concludes that although the 1997 elections did not produce a policy nirvana for British feminism, their initial effects augured reasonably well for movement interests. /// Depuis 1983, plusieurs changements internes sont venus transformer le Parti travailliste britannique.

It argues that the organization and practices of the refuge, including those which were specifically 'feminist' and those purporting to be anti-racist, reproduced a pattern of institutional racism which privileged and naturalized 'whiteness', white feminism and white women, and perpetuated the racial disadvantage of Aboriginal women, including continuing accountability to white colonizing women, loss of employment and economic security and contingent rather than guaranteed access to appropriate domestic violence crisis services. The article focuses on three interrelated concepts which were fundamental to the white women's construction and legitimation of their positions in the events: 'sisterhood', 'multiculturalism' and 'the good feminist worker'.\n      </p>", "Gertrudis G\u00f3mez de Avellaneda's novel \"Sab\" (1841) has been subject to many interpretations. Early criticism considered it as little more than a sentimental and shocking romantic story: the impossibly unconventional love of a black slave for a white woman. Later critics have sought to establish \"Sab\" as a pioneering anti-slavery novel. This article will attempt to demonstrate that Avellaneda's main purpose was not to narrate a doomed love, nor to present a denunciation of slavery, but to express her feminist ideology, establishing the parallelism between the situation of black slaves and the oppression of white women in the bourgeois society of her time. However, we cannot say that Avellaneda created a symbiosis between slavery and feminism; the theme of slavery is only a metaphor, doubly shocking because it exposes her own emancipating ideas in an oppressive society that did not forgive those voices which dared to transgress its norms.\n      </p>", "A small body of mentoring literature exists, but how mentoring relates to feminist supervision of graduate students has not been explicitly addressed. Because mentoring typically socializes individuals into a preexisting structure that feminist scholars may be challenging, critiquing, and attempting to change, important considerations arise for feminist mentoring.

Commonalities and concerns are identified, and implications for graduate pedagogy are presented.\n      </p>", "In this article, the author presents some of the counterpoints between historical developments and feminist studies in Puerto Rico since the 1970s, elaborating on the most recurrent topics. She includes a brief historical overview of Puerto Rico and the trends in women's status, feminism, and feminist studies in the Island. Next, she provides a brief summary of general theoretical and methodological issues. Then she discusses research on specific topics, including the intersections of gender, nation, race, class, and sexuality; women's employment and poverty; family structures and relations; sexual and reproductive rights; and current issues such as the relationship between feminism and the state and the context of globalization.\n      </p>", "This paper aims to evaluate the challenges posed to traditional ethical theory by the ethics of feminism, multiculturalism, and environmentalism. I argue that James Sterba, in his Three Challenges to Ethics, provides a distorted assessment by trying to assimilate feminism, multiculturalism, and environmentalism into traditional utilitarian, virtue, and Kantian/Rawlsian ethics - which he thus seeks to rescue from their alleged \"biases.\" In the cases of feminism and multiculturalism, I provide an alternative account on which these new critical discourses challenge the whole paradigm or conception of ethical inquiry embodied in the tradition. They embrace different questions, goals, tools of analysis, and wider audiences, typically ignored or marginalized by traditional ethicists. I illustrate my argument through brief interpretations of writers such as Susan Okin, Catharine Mackinnon, Sandra Bartky, John Stoltenberg, Richard Wasserstrom, Anthony Appiah, Charles Mills, Will Kymlicka, Charles Taylor, and Martha Nussbaum. In many of these cases, I suggest that they provide us with new ways of being ethicists. In the case of environmentalism, I defend a more conservative and negative assessment. Sterba embraces authors such as Peter Singer, Tom Regan, and Paul Taylor in order to advance an environmentalist ethic of \"species equality/impartiality\" and \"biocentric pluralism.\" Here I argue that the traditional Kantian/Rawlsian ethics - which Sterba hopes to accommodate - actually provides compelling moral reasons for rejecting his principles of \"species impartiality\" and biocentric pluralism. Moreover, Rawlsian ethics can provide a more coherent, consistent, and plausible account of environmental issues than Sterba's brand of environmental ethics. I argue that in practice, his ethics concedes what it denies in theory - namely, the special value which inheres in human beings. As such, environmental ethics, unlike feminism and multiculturalism, poses very little in the way of a credible challenge or alternative to traditional ethics.\n      </p>", "Traditionally, motherhood has not often been encouraged as a resource for Christian spirituality, nor has spirituality provided resources for mothers. This situation was reinforced by feminism's concern to free women from confinement to biologically-determined and domestic roles. Within feminism itself, there has been a shift from this position, precipitated by various factors. First, ecofeminism and its imagery is closely linked with 'feminine' values and especially with maternity. Second, motherhood is slowly being acknowledged as integral to the identity of women who are mothers, particularly since for the majority of the world's women, motherhood will always be a central element of lived experience. From a personal perspective, I have found my own motherhood to be a rich spiritual resource, discovering support for it in some surprising places in Christian tradition. This briefing attempts to situate motherhood in relation to spirituality in its historical context and to explore ways of bringing the two together.\n      </p>", "While \"The Second Sex\" is usually taken as Simone de Beauvoir's major theoretical contribution to feminism, in the 1960s and 1970s it was very often through her autobiographies - especially \"Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter\", \"The Prime of Life\", and \"Force of Circumstance\", along with novels such as \"She Came to Stay\" and \"The Mandarins\" - that her feminist ideas were most thoroughly absorbed. The autobiographies became nothing less than a guide for the fashioning of a new kind of feminine self. Where \"The Second Sex\" had intimated that a significant aspect of human liberation lay in women not losing their identity or their sense of self in those of men, it was the autobiographies which suggested and demonstrated in great detail how this might be done. In them, the rejection of conventional marriage and children was no mere slogan, but the foundation of what seemed to young female readers to be a fascinating and challenging life. In this paper, I reflect on de Beauvoir and her historical and contemporary relevance: first through reminiscence and re-reading of the autobiographies themselves; then with an historical examination of how they were read, taking Sydney, Australia, as my example; and finally by offering some reflections on subsequent feminist critique.\n      </p>", "According to the mass media, a postfeminist era emerged in the 1990s. The first objective is to develop a definition of the postfeminist perspective. Based on an informal content analysis of popular articles, the authors identify four postfeminist claims: (1) overall support for the women's movement has dramatically eroded because some women (2) are increasingly antifeminist, (3) believe the movement is irrelevant, and (4) have adopted a \"no, but...\" version of feminism. The second objective is to determine the extent of empirical support for these claims. Using existing public opinion data, the authors find little support for the four postfeminist claims. Implications of the unsubstantiated post-feminist argument are discussed.\n      </p>", "This essay consists of fragments, questions, and reflections which introduce this collection of essays on feminism and postmodernism in anthropology and which explore the problematic conjunctions and disjunctions of these \"isms\" in the academy in general.\n      </p>", "This article examines the limitations of the sociological research on feminist identities and ideologies that ignores the intersection of race and gender. Drawing from multiracial feminist theorizing, the author asks, Is self-identification as feminist a biased indicator of the salience of feminism in African American women's lives? Do women's racial statuses mediate the relationship between particular life events and experiences and the extent to which they embrace feminism? and To what extent are racial differences important when considering what women understand feminism to be? To answer these questions, the author conducted multiple group analyses of structural equation models to analyze data from the 1996 General Social Survey. Her findings are consistent with multiracial feminist theories and suggest a need to rethink traditional approaches to feminist research so that women's differences are no longer marginalized.\n      </p>", "This paper considers Olive Banks' work on charting the history and development of British feminism, and particularly her use of collective biography as a research and analytic tool. It is argued that while this has been seen as the least 'fashionable' aspect of her work, it took forward C. Wright Mills' contention for one definition of sociology as the interaction between biography and history, and predated by a decade or so similar work on prosopography by Bourdieu from the 1990s onwards. More recently other sociologists and educationists have taken up this methodological approach, including Jane Martin and Bronwyn Davies and Susanne Gannon.\n      </p>", "The understanding of feminist pasts has been largely ignored in the history of education. This paper suggests that the historical sociology of Olive Banks provides fresh starting points for future research exploring the relationship between the history of social and political movements and a reassessment of contemporary and historical forms of 'radical education'. The article proceeds to use group biography to explore a municipal socialism that has been over-ridden in historical memory by the classic political histories that take the view from Westminster and Whitehall. In so doing it seeks to show the contribution of six educator activists who were participants in the making of a metropolitan political elite emerging from the association between feminism, socialism and the labour and trade union movement.\n      </p>", "A critical look at two books, Coming to Power - Writings and Graphics on Lesbian S/M, published in 1981, and its 'long awaited sequel', The Second Coming - A Leatherdyke Reader, published in 1996, yields many differences and similarities. Both books have been judged negatively or positively on the basis of their sadomasochistic content and in line with knee-jerk positions around the lesbian 'sex wars' of the 1980s. The feminist politics represented in each book and the connections to more general lesbian feminist concerns and developments of either the late 1970s (Coming to Power) or the late 1980s and early 1990s (The Second Coming) are often overlooked or dismissed. Comparing the kind of sex acts and personas fetishized in each book as well as the claims made for lesbian sm by its adherents often reveals more than the writers may have intended. A more nuanced reading of both books also reveals connections between lesbian feminism, particularly lesbian radical feminism and the sm dykes. Rather than being the 'illegitimate children' of lesbian feminism, as Coming to Power maintained in 1981, it is clear now that sm dykes and lesbian feminists are strange sisters who needed each other to define their particular politicized identities.\n      </p>", "In 1888 the Canadian writer Sara Jeanette Duncan travelled around the world with only another single woman as a companion: an extremely unconventional proceeding. Her fictionalized account of her travels, \"A Social Departure: How Orthodocia and I Went Round the World by Ourselves\" (1890) is comic but also deliberately provocative. The book does not fit neatly into any of the available categories for discussion of \"fin de si\u00e8cle\" texts, but can be usefully analysed in relation to two literary contexts: first, New Woman fiction and nineteenth century 'feminism'; and second, the literature of aestheticism and decadence.\n      </p>", "During the scientific revolution reductionism and mechanism were introduced together. These concepts remained intertwined through much of the ensuing history of philosophy and science, resulting in the privileging of approaches to research that focus on the smallest bits of nature. This combination of concepts has been the object of intense feminist criticism, as it encourages biological determinism, narrows researchers' choices of problems and methods, and allows researchers to ignore the contextual features of the phenomena they investigate. I argue that the historical link between mechanism and reductionism is not a necessary one, that this link should be severed, and in many cases has already been severed. Separating reductionism from mechanism allows us to hold onto the mechanistic view that science should explain how things work, without mandating methods and approaches that reduce the objects of scientific investigation to their smallest parts. Mechanism without reductionism decenters reductive methods, and so creates intellectual space for a plurality of methods that may engage the world at a variety of levels of organization. This ensuing pluralism opens the door for a wide variety of approaches to research, including feminist and gender-sensitive science.\n      </p>", "Felipe Trigo stands out among the turn-of-the-century Spanish writers of erotic novels as the only one who concentrated on women's political and erotic emancipation. For the theory expressed in his doctrinal books and the sensuality of his novels, he acquired early on a reputation as an advocate of women's right. In fact, the utopic system described in his books of theory severely constricts the same emancipatory movement it claims to undertake, and his novels rely on traditional images such as the virgin/whore, the woman-monster, and the woman-corpse to reinforce existing patriarchal social and literary structures. In view of the recent \"recuperaci\u00f3n\" of Trigo's writing, it becomes important to do away with the commonplaces about it that are still being repeated, and which obstruct a true reevaluation of his place in Spanish letters. His reputation as a feminist is one such commonplace.\n      </p>", "Inter-war Australia saw the emergence of a feminist campaign for indigenous rights. Led by women activists who were members of various key Australian women's organizations affiliated with the British Commonwealth League, this campaign proposed a revitalized White Australia as a progressive force towards improving 'world' race relations. Drawing upon League of Nations conventions and the increasing role for the Dominions within the British Commonwealth, these women claimed to speak on behalf of Australian Aborigines in asserting their right to reparation as a usurped people and the need to overhaul government policy. Opposing inter-war policies of biological assimilation, they argued for a humane national Aboriginal policy including citizenship and rights in the person. Where white men had failed in their duty towards indigenous peoples, world women might bring about a new era of civilized relations between the races.\n      </p>", "Obstacles to organizing peace can sometimes emerge because women have suffered previous sexual violence. Consequently, the frame through which they react to contemporary political situations, including peace demonstrations organized by transnational feminists, might at the core have an internal structure derived from previous violation that women then project to identify, modify, and contain controversy in external events. Therefore, closely examining the border between private and public spheres in women's lives might not always lead to progressive politics for women as a group, as some might hope. Rather, some women might attempt to recover from specifically sexual violence in previous wars, seizing upon discourse bound of national security. They may attempt to regain internal strength by fortifying gender identity that has been thrown into crisis, using nationalistic contours to reaffirm their sense of self. This might lead them to actively protest other women working for peace. Since trauma survivors exhibit modes of recounting life histories that vividly dramatize past events in order to draw attention to private pain in public, the force of such narrators who speak in the streets can upstage peaceworkers' events.\n      </p>", "In Pakistan, as in many other societies, politico-religious movements or so-called Islamist fundamentalist movements are becoming an important site for women's activism as well as the harnessing of such activism to promote agendas that seem to undermine women's autonomy. This has become a concern for a growing feminist literature which from a variety of political and theoretical positions seeks to understand and explain the subject-position of Muslim women as politico-religious activists. This paper attempts a deconstructive reading of texts by leading Pakistani feminist scholars as they attempt the difficult process of steering between fundamentalism and Orientalism in their accounts of 'fundamentalist' women in the political ideological space of Pakistan.\n      </p>", "This article provides a critical analysis of the evolution and impact of hospital-sponsored women's health centers. Using original data gathered from interviews, participant observation, and content analysis of documents and brochures, the authors describe the development of four models of hospital-sponsored women's health centers and illustrate three specific mechanisms of the co-optation process. They show how many elements of feminist health care were used for the purpose of marketing and revenue production rather than for empowering women and transforming the delivery of care. Following Stratigaki's notion of negative countereffect, the authors show how the key feminist concepts of women-centered care and empowerment ended up contradicting their original meaning and purpose. Rather than being the subject of care, women became the object of treatment and revenue production.\n      </p>", "Reviewing \"The Ethics of Gender, Feminism and Christian Ethics,\" and \"The Cambridge Companion to Feminist Theology,\" the author suggests that Susan Parsons responds to questions postmodernism has posed to both feminism and Christian ethics by using insights gained from various accounts of the moral subject found in feminist philosophy, ethics, and theology. Hesitant to embrace postmodernism's critique of the possibility of ethics, Parsons redefines ethics by establishing a moral point of view within discursive communities. Yet in her brief treatment of Emmanuel Levinas, Parsons does not explore the postmodern option he offers feminists: an understanding of moral responsibility that can be critical of ethics. Parsons also ignores some feminist perspectives in the physical and natural sciences, thereby missing valuable insights of feminists who insist upon the materiality of the body.\n      </p>", "The 'hard man' has been an archetypical construction of masculinity in industrial Glasgow. However, the rise of second-wave feminism, the demographic revolution in the nature of the family, and the rise of the 'new man' have done much to erode the presence of and sympathy for the hard man of British urban folklore. Based on five interviews with men and women, this article examines the construction and 'composure' of masculine narratives in oral history interviews in relation to a young female interviewer. It brings to light how husbands and wives construct different narratives about the past; the relationship between the rise of feminist thought and the traditional 'hard man' image and how differently the various respondents read the discourses the interviewer 'brought' to the interview.\n      </p>", "This paper examines the development of feminism in Spain within the context of political transformations. It focuses on one particular strand of feminist thinking: 'equality feminism'. The paper traces the evolution of equality feminism and its institutionalization, supported by the production and dissemination of a feminist history of the Franquista dictatorship (1936-1939). Yet, under scrutiny such narratives maintain a silence on the social, political and geographical diversity of women's experiences prior to, during and beyond the Franquista dictatorship. Drawing on women's oral testimonies (recorded in the city of M\u00e1laga, Andaluc\u00eda) the paper animates the silences of this feminist history in Spain and the limits of state feminist ideology.\n      </p>", "This is an account of an interview with one of Britain's foremost literary theorists, Professor Catherine Belsey. The interview was conducted in Ghent, Belgium in 1997. The discussion spans all of Belsey's works, from the earliest, Critical Practice (1980), to her latest publication, Shakespeare and the Loss of Eden (1999). In this piece, Belsey openly and unpretentiously discusses her feminist commitment, her sometimes controversial critical positions, some of the influences on her careers and the importance to her of her teaching.\n      </p>", "A number of familial background variables were examined in relation to women's adherence to feminist ideology and commitment to a self-perception as a \"feminist\": religiosity, birth order, presence of a working mother, perception of mother's ideology, mother's education, and parents' occupational and educational differentials. Subjects were 400 unmarried, undergraduate women attending 27 social science classes during the spring of 1979. While birth order, mother's education, and parents' educational differential appeared unrelated to either ideology or self-perception, the presence of a working mother tended to influence women's perceptions of themselves as feminists. These same women tended to have mothers whose occupations were equal to or higher in status than their father's occupations and tend to perceive their mother's ideology as supportive of feminist tenets. The only factors differentiating women who uphold feminist ideology from those that do not is perception of mother's ideology and a nonreligious background. There also appears to be an inconsistency between women's attitudes and self-perceptions. A number of possible explanations and the theoretical possibility of an intergenerational feminism are presented.\n      </p>", "Using novelistic vignettes, this article calls for the reader's imaginative engagement in a highly-charged situation involving accusations of sexual harassment on our campus. This event made visible not only the contradictions between the traditional humanism grounding higher education and postmodern and feminist challenges to it, but also the dangers of feminist collaboration in liberal humanist projects. We invite readers to reflect on their own allegiances to the various and competing discourses that help structure the academy today as we expose our own shifting subject positions and investments. We aim to call into question the possibility of knowing the \"truth\" of this event, even as we self-consciously construct a reading of it in order to displace the \"official\" humanistic interpretation given to this situation by the college's president, in favor of one that applies postmodern and feminist insights about discourse, subjectivity, and the power/knowledge nexus to an \"ethnography\" of the academy.\n      </p>", "This paper contributes to ongoing discussions on feminism and the analysis of discourse. In particular, I examine Celia Kitzinger's [(2000), Doing feminist conversation analysis. \"Feminism and Psychology,\" 10, 163\u2014193 and (2002) Doing feminist conversation analysis. In P. McIlvenny (Ed.), \"Talking gender and sexuality.\" Amsterdam: John Benjamins Publishing Company.] claims to be engaged in \"feminist conversation analysis.\" This paper identifies susceptibilities in her arguments at both the theoretical level and the level of data analysis. My argument is that Kitzinger fails to appreciate the fact that her enterprise is basically a formal analytic one and that as such it is both radically different from, and incommensurate with, ethnomethodology (EM) and conversation analysis (CA). Indeed her attempts to supplement feminism with EM/CA are unnecessary and counterproductive from an EM/CA position insofar as they crucially undermine its integrity.\n      </p>", "Images of women, work, and family on television have changed enormously since the heyday of the network era. Early television confined women to the home and family setting. The increase in working women in the 1960s and 1970s was reflected in television s images of women working and living nontraditional family lives. These images gave way, in the postnetwork era, to a form of postfeminist television in the 1990s when television undercut the ideals of liberal feminism with a series of ambiguous images challenging its gains. Women's roles in the workplace, increasingly shown, were undercut by a sense of nostalgic yearning for the love and family life that they were seen to have displaced. Current television presents a third-wave-influenced feminism that picks up where postfeminism left off, introducing important representations more varied in race, sexuality, and the choices women are seen to make between work and family.\n      </p>", "This article reassesses the shift from lesbian-feminism to queer in light of the expressivist turn in feminist thought. The article follows Charles Taylor's theory of expressivism as a modernist, Romantic paradigm of identity and practice. Expressivism defines the self and freedom as a process of self-creation, apoeisis. An expressivist paradigm underlies aspects of contemporary feminist praxis, redefining politics as practices of transforming the subject, self, and/or language. I argue that this paradigm of praxis ultimately works to depoliticize feminism. I criticize two forms of expressivism, namely, lesbian-feminist normative expressivism (based on ethical ideals of liberation) and queer performative expressivism (based on aesthetic ideals of subversion, i.e., \"arts of the self\"). I argue that feminism needs to break out of the expressivist paradigm and to reconceptualize a praxis that interrelates practices of self-transformation with concrete, political practices aimed at transforming the social order.\n      </p>", "In this article I attempt to conceptualize my existential and institutional experience as the director of the Kharkov Center for Gender Studies acquired in the course of introducing gender studies into the system of post-Soviet higher education. The main subject of the article concerns the logical ground of gender discourse and the complicated relations between the notions of 'gender studies', 'women's studies', and, within the latter, 'feminism' in the former USSR, all in the framework of concepts from Western feminists theory.\n      </p>", "To sensitize practitioners to the application of feminism to family programs, three feminist assumptions are identified: Women are oppressed, the personal is political, and feminists have double consciousness. From these assumptions, principles of feminist practice are derived and the ways in which these principles are operationalized in programs published in Family Relations are identified. We discuss what it means to be a feminist practitioner, the difficulty of translating feminist vision into practice, and the need for a practical literature on feminist family programming. Finally, we encourage family practitioners to reflect on the assumptions underlying their practice.\n      </p>", "Using an analysis of child care books and parenting Web sites, this article asks if second-wave feminism 's vision of gender-neutral child rearing has been incorporated into contemporary advice on child rearing. The data suggest that while feminist understandings of gender have made significant inroads into popular advice, especially with regard to the social construction of gender, something akin to \"a stalled revolution \" has taken place. Children's gender nonconformity is still viewed as problematic because it is linked implicitly and explicitly to homosexuality.\n      </p>", "Understanding how the idea of culture is mobilized in discursive contests is crucial for both theorizing and building multicultural democracies. To investigate this, I analyze a debate over whether we should relieve the \u201ccultural need\u201d for infibulation among immigrants by offering a \u201cnick\u201d in U.S. hospitals. Using interviews, newspaper coverage, and primary documents, I show that physicians and opponents of the procedure with contrasting models of culture disagreed on whether it represented cultural change. Opponents argued that the \u201cnick\u201d was fairly described as \u201cfemale genital mutilation\u201d and symbolically identical to more extensive cutting. Using a reified model, they imagined Somalis to be \u201cculture-bound\u201d; the adoption of a \u201cnick\u201d was simply a move from one genital cutting procedure to another. Unable to envision meaningful cultural adaptation, and presupposing the incompatibility of multiculturalism and feminism, they supported forced assimilation. Physicians, drawing on a dynamic model of culture, believed that adoption of the \u201cnick\u201d was meaningful cultural change, but overly idealized their ability to protect Somali girls from both Somali and U.S. patriarchy. Unduly confident, they failed to take oppression seriously, dismissing relevant constituencies and their concerns.\n         Both models, then, influenced the outcome of this cultural conflict by shaping the perceptions of cultural change in problematic ways. Given the high-profile nature of \u201cculture\u201d in contemporary politics, these findings may very well extend to other issues that crystallize the supposed incommensurability of feminism and multiculturalism, as well as the wider debates about how societies can be both diverse and socially just.\n      </p>", "Research indicates that most people espouse feminist ideologies, yet very few self-identify as feminists. This article examines the discrepancy between agreement with feminist principles and lack of identification with feminism by analyzing 270 female and male college students' definitions of feminists. We explored similarities and differences in definitions provided by self-identified feminists and nonfeminists. The results indicate that feminists and nonfeminists are equally likely to define a feminist as one who actively promotes gender equality in society and, less commonly, rejects traditional gender roles and burns bras. Feminists were more likely to define a feminist as one who supports gender equality, is female, and has positive personal characteristics. Nonfeminists were more likely to define a feminist as one who supports female superiority, dislikes men, discriminates based on gender, has negative personal characteristics, and is lesbian or butch. These results are discussed in the broader contexts of feminist identity and movement mobilization.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

It argues that the complex story of Women's Studies has been marked by both ambiguity and uncertainty as well as sustained political commitment in the face of both institutional opposition and feminist ambivalence about Women's Studies as a field of scholarship. The development of Women's Studies occurs through crucial shifts in the theoretical paradigms of feminism and the political preoccupations of the women's movement. These shifts have both deconstructed the founding premises of feminist theory and generated a greater depth to feminist thinking and research. These challenges to Women's Studies have paralleled a different set of problems arising from the increasingly market-oriented direction pursued throughout the tertiary education sector. In spite of these difficulties Women's Studies continues to survive and constitutes an important and contested site of contemporary feminist thought.\n      </p>", "To date very little scholarship has focused on the experiences of women who fought or collaborated with Nicaragua's counter-revolutionary forces (known as the Contra) in the 1980s. Based on qualitative research conducted in Waslala, this paper examines the circumstances which led a group of women to become positioned as Contra supporters. It then explores how these women constructed their gender identities in the light of their collaboration with the Contra. It argues that despite their participation in a right-wing political organisation and despite their tendency to draw upon understandings of themselves as mothers, widows and victims of war, these women should not be seen as inherently conservative and reactionary, given that they have also been inspired by forms of political organisation that are indicative of an emergent feminist identity.\n      </p>", "The second wave of U. S. feminism and the reconstitution of the United States as a country of immigration gained momentum in the 1970s. Recent manifestations of both feminism and immigration have left indelible changes on the social landscape, yet immigration and feminism are rarely coupled in popular discussion, social movements, or academic research. This article explores the articulations and disarticulations between immigration and feminism; it focuses particularly on the intersections of migration studies and feminist studies.\n      </p>", "The following paper analyzes changes in Soviet gender politics of the 1920s and 1930s. It starts with a general discussion of the relationship between Marxism and feminism, emphasizing issues especially relevant in the Soviet context. The second focus of the article is Fedor Gladkov's \"Cement\", a novel originally written between 1922 and 1924 but reworked several times during the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, as the official policy on women was changing. By sketching out the differences between the first and later version of \"Cement\", the author shows how Stalinism emerged also as a response to the 1920s inability to deal with undermined traditional gender relations (and not just as a result of Stalin's consolidation of power). Consequently, it seems, all projects that aim to construct a \"better society\" must start with an analysis of sexual difference and desire.\n      </p>", "Employing content analysis of 44 songs taken from the Billboard charts between 1992 and 2000, the authors find that all female rap artists in the sample included the cornerstones of rap in their songs: braggadocio, consumption of alcohol and drugs, and \"dissin\" of female and male rap competitors. More important, the majority of the artists had themes of female agency and empowerment present in their music. However, the artists also had songs that were antithetical to Patricia Hill Collins' Black feminism. Indeed, a majority of the songs examined had women who self-objectified, self-exploited, and used derogatory lyrics when referring to other women. The author finds that these contradictory messages, sometimes by the same artists, nullify the empowering messages that are conveyed and only reproduce and uphold male hegemonic notions of femininity.\n      </p>", "This article describes the meaning of incest in contemporary popular culture. The author explores how feminism and changes in systems of kinship and sexuality have affected present-day discourse on incest, comparing the significance of blood relations and notions of abuse in constructing incest. The author analyzes media commentaries on two contemporary incestuous events that generated publicity: Kathryn Harrison's memoir of a sexual affair with her biological father and Woody Allen's relationship with Soon-Yi Previn. The author explores how commentators framed incest as morally objectionable in reaction to these two cases. She argues that blood ties are prevalent, but are becoming less relevant to discussions of incest in popular culture, and that feminist constructions of incest as an exploitation of power relations have been powerful enough for individuals to apply this framework even when adults (rather than children) are involved.\n      </p>", "This paper examined the hypothesis that women who took part in student movements of the 1960s would be distinguishable from their contemporaries in terms of political ideology, political behavior, and feminism in middle age. Women who had been identified as student activists in public records during the late 1960s and early 1970s were compared to a sample of nonactivist peers. Although the two groups scored similarly on variables related to work and family arrangements, former activists scored higher on measures of leftist political orientation and political efficacy, reported greater political salience and collectivism, and reported greater current political participation. Although both groups reported high levels of feminist consciousness and identity, activists scored significantly higher. The difficulty of politically mobilizing women to combat gender discrimination is discussed in light of the discrepancy between consciousness and activism in the comparison group.\n      </p>", "We present findings on women's political perspectives, participation, and activism derived from a survey of women in Montgomery County, Ohio, undertaken by the Women's Research Network formed at Wright State University, which we argue have both local and national implications for feminist organizing. We connect this work and these findings to the history of feminism in Dayton as well as to other status-of-women studies at national, state, and local levels. Our analysis shows that there has been a substantive decline in feminist activism and radicalism in Dayton, Ohio, the \"heartland of America,\" in the face of continued race and class divisions among women, the rise of the New Right, and an aging population. Given increasing barriers to the renewal of feminist activism in the heartland, local research on women such as this can provide one avenue for the reanimation of feminist civil society by identifying not only what divides women but also what issues can connect them. Such data offer the raw materials for future feminist activists and such research projects constitute one form of renewed feminist activism.\n      </p>", "This study compares the date-initiation and date expense-sharing behavior of feminists and nonfeminists. It is hypothesized that feminists engage in these nontraditional behaviors more than nonfeminists in order to equalize the bargaining element in dating relations. Subjects are 258 unmarried, undergraduate women attending classes at a large, Southeastern university during the spring of 1979. Feminists and nonfeminists are grouped according to summated scale scores on the FEM Scale. The results show that feminists tend to share dating expenses with male partners more than nonfeminists. They are also more likely to initiate dates and to share the financial obligations of woman-initiated dates than are more traditional women. The implications of these findings for family researchers and practitioners are discussed.\n      </p>", "In recent histories of U.S. feminism, collaborations between lesbians and heterosexuals are overshadowed by the infamous \"gay /straight split\" of the early 1970s. In lesbian history, seventies androgyny is often characterized as a lesbian-feminist indictment of butch-femme lesbians' gender, which obscures androgyny's polyvalence. Oral history and a locally published journal illustrate how feminists in a Baltimore neighborhood shared politics and an idealized \"socialist gender\" in the 1970s. The article reveals that women \"dressed down\" in ways that de-emphasized their femininity and emphasized their critique of consumer capitalism. It argues that the continuing historical construction of the split between feminist lesbians and their heterosexual counterparts limits both the history of women's liberation and of sexuality.\n      </p>", "The \"cultural turn\" in feminism has isolateci issues of gender and sexuality from their material conditions.

While \"post\" th\u00e9ories h\u00e2ve treated th\u00e8se and related practices as \"cultural\" effects and regarded them as (semi-) autonomous acts of r\u00e9sistance, culture is never isolated from its material base and cultural r\u00e9sistance, in and of itself, is not capable of transforming social totality. The most effective way to undertake such a transformation is by class struggle, which brings about \"root\" changes through reorganizing the relations of labor and capitai and puts an end to social class.

Both approaches deal with culture but the modes of analysis differ significantly. The article argues that Western feminism and Gender Studies as its academic output challenged the methods and paradigm of cultural analysis in post-Soviet academia which was and still is implicitly based on Marxist-Leninist premises of social research. The article then goes on to analyse why Gender Studies as well as Feminism are often perceived as 'imported products' for which reason their reception in post-Soviet humanities is rather problematic. Briefly speaking, the intellectual potential and methodological grounds of Gender Studies remain questionable for scholars in post-Soviet universities.\n      </p>", "From its inception, the archaeology of gender was entwined with feminism. Engagement has engendered reconstructions of complex, diverse peoples and practices that are more equitable, relevant, and sound. Yet, for many archaeologists, the connection with feminist perspectives has frayed in recent years. Their studies of gender articulate dated ideas about women and epistemological frames that highlight duality and universality. Examinations of labor divisions typify shortcomings. To advance gender's study and archaeology, practitioners need to consider several concerns about identity and difference emerging from thirdwave feminism. Gender is envisioned as intersection. Bioarchaeology, especially, will benefit from feminist approaches that reflect critically and regard gender in nonnormative and multiscalar terms. To this end, resistance to feminism must fade. Opposition stems from its imagined relationship with postmodernism, but conflation misconstrues feminism's sociopolitical commitment to emancipatory change. For their part, archaeologists can utilize feminist perspectives to diversify the field, explore difference, and tackle archaeological issues with sociopolitical resonance.\n      </p>", "Is history a category of reason, or is reason a category of history? These opposing questions have divided the structuralist from the materialist-but neither question is wrong. Analysis of the logic of oppositions challenges feminism, in particular, to find a logic-and a poetics-in which to render its values without historical or theoretical naivet\u00e9. I explore the question of the timing of feminism through Julia Kristeva and Luce Irigaray.\n      </p>", "In 'The Woman Poet: Her Dilemma' (1986-7), the Irish poet Eavan Boland argued that women poets were obstructed on the one hand by traditional ideas of femininity and poetry, and on the other by the demands of separatist feminism. In 'Dilemmas and Developments: Eavan Boland Re-examined' Sarah Maguire argues that in recent years women poets have clearly achieved greater confidence as a result of changes in their audience. However, the underlying dilemma facing a woman poet - that of the tension between the demands of femininity and the role expected of a post-Romantic lyric poet - continues to remain unresolved.\n      </p>", "The issue of a generational exchange in Italian feminism has been crucial over the last decade. Current struggles over precariousness have revived issues previously raised by feminists of the 1970s, recalling how old forms of instability and precarious employment are still present in Italy. This essay starts from the assumption that precariousness is a constitutive aspect of many young Italian women's lives. Young Italian feminist scholars have been discussing the effects of such precarity on their generation. This article analyses the literature produced by political groups of young scholars interested in gender and feminism connected to debates on labour and power in contemporary Italy. One of the most successful strategies that younger feminists have used to gain visibility has involved entering current debates on precariousness, thus forcing a connection with the larger Italian labour movement. In doing so, this new wave of feminism has destabilized the universalism assumed by the 1970s generation. By pointing to a necessary generational change, younger feminists have been able to mark their own specificity and point to exploitative power dynamics within feminist groups, as well as in the family and in the workplace without being dismissed. In such a layered context, many young feminists argue that precariousness is a life condition, not just the effect of job market flexibility and not solely negative. The literature produced by young feminists addresses the current strategies engineered to make 'their' precarious life more sustainable. This essay analyses such strategies in the light of contemporary Italian politics. The main conclusion is that younger Italian women's experience requires new strategies and tools for struggle, considering that the visibility of women as political subjects is still quite minimal. Female precariousness can be seen as a fruitful starting point for a dialogue across differences, addressing gender and reproduction, immigration, work and social welfare at the same time.\n      </p>", "This paper demonstrates that advancing our understanding of international political economy (IPE) entails posing the question of otherness and difference as an object of theoretical and historical inquiry. It suggests that the discourses of postmodernism, feminism, and postcolonial criticism directly contribute to IPE by locating the problematic of identity/difference at the center of the dialectic of social change. By pinpointing the strength and the problematic nature of each of these discourses, it argues that the reconstruction of IPE based on the recognition of difference requires 'an empathetic cooperation' among these discourses as a precondition for the creation of a dialogical interaction between theoretical discourse and subject-positions to whom it is addressed.\n      </p>", "Ecological feminism is a feminism which attempts to unite the demands of the women's movement with those of the ecological movement. Ecofeminists often appeal to \"ecology\" in support of their claims, particularly claims about the importance of feminism to environmentalism. What is missing from the literature is any sustained attempt to show respects in which ecological feminism and the science of ecology are engaged in complementary, mutually supportive projects. In this paper we attempt to do that by showing ten important similarities which establish the need for and benefits of on-going dialogue between ecofeminists and ecosystem ecologists.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "This attempt to develop an indigenous reading of feminism as both activism and discourse in the Caribbean is informed by my own preoccupation with the limits of contemporary postmodern feminist theorizing in terms of its accessibility, as well as application to understanding the specificity of a region. I, for instance, cannot speak for or in the manner of a white middle-class academic in Britain, or a black North American feminist, as much as we share similarities which go beyond the society, and which are fuelled by our commitment to gender equality. At the same time, our conversations are intersecting as a greater clarity of thought emerges in relation and perhaps in reaction to the other. Ideas of difference and the epistemological standpoint of 'Third World' women have been dealt with admirably by many feminist writers such as Chandra Mohanty, Avtah Brah and Uma Narayan. In this article I draw on the ideas emerging in contemporary western feminist debates pertaining to sexual difference and equality and continue my search for a Caribbean feminist voice which defines feminism and feminist theory in the region, not as a linear narrative but one which has continually intersected with the politics of identity in the region.\n      </p>", "To posit feminism and multiculturalism as oppositional is to assume that minority women are victims of their cultures. This assumption, as Professor Volpp illustrates in this Essay, is achieved by a discursive strategy that constructs gender subordination as integral only to certain cultures. She traces the origins of the ubiquitous claim that minority and Third World cultures are more subordinating than culture in the West to the history of colonialism, the origins of liberalism, depictions of the feminist subject, and the use of binary logic. Pitting feminism against multiculturalism has certain consequences: It obscures the influences that in fact shape cultural practices, hides the forces besides culture that affect women's lives, elides the way women exercise agency within patriarchy, and masks the level of violence within the United States. Professor Volpp concludes by suggesting a basis for a constructive dialogue beyond the discourse of feminism versus multiculturalism.\n      </p>", "This article is a review of the rise and development of women's studies and the sociology of women/gender, two interrelated academic fields in China. Informed by the sociology of knowledge, the authors analyze how historical and sociopolitical factors such as the legacy of Marxism, state/party control, economic reform, political upheavals, local conditions, and global influences have greatly shaped what and how women's and gender issues are studied and the resultant characteristics and knowledge production of the two fields in China. Specifically, the authors examine the dynamic process of knowledge development in sociology of women/gender in terms of its academic positioning, standpoint, content, research methodology, curriculum transformation, and teaching in China. Finally, the authors demonstrate how the characteristics and issues shared by the two fields have evolved in a dynamic interplay between Chinese Marxism and feminism.\n      </p>", "The literature on marital equality documents the incongruency between the ideology and practice of marital equality. Twenty married female and male feminists were interviewed and asked to describe the influence of feminism on their marriages. This study confirms a distinction between the ideology and practice of equality within heterosexual marriage. However, it also reveals the possibility of upgrading marriage for women and the establishment of marital equality. Couples reported the practice of vigilance, defined as an attending to and a monitoring of equality, within and outside of their relationship. This vigilance of equality appeared as five processes: (a) critique of gender injustices, (b) public acts of equality, (c) support of wives' activities, (d) reflective assessment, and (e) emotional involvement.\n      </p>", "Lesbian feminist communities present dilemmas for feminists who are involved in these communities yet do not define themselves as lesbians. In this exploratory study of nine non-lesbian feminists who were involved with a lesbian feminist community in the mid-1980s, important questions emerge about how to define oneself sexually and how to negotiate sexual identity. The politics of sexual identity is a core issue for these women, as lesbianism and feminism are entwined in a rhetoric which privileges lesbianism. On the other hand, the heterosexual world competes for their attention and offers a much less threatening lifestyle and political position. For the most part, these women resist defining themselves solely on the basis of sexual behavior and negotiate their identity depending on the audience or community. Sexual identity for these women is closely tied to overall self-concept and to the politics of lesbian feminist communities in the mid-1980s.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Premised on the popular view of woman's nature as virtuous, responsible, and nurturant, this art nonetheless challenged traditional practices and demanded political change. Interrelationships between feminism, art, and the historical context are explored in this analysis of women's imagery.\n      </p>", "In the light of postmodern debates in anthropology, ethnography offers anthropologists new ways of representing their objects of study. The politics involved in the production and consumption by feminist scholars and activists of women's representations in the Arab world, and Egypt specifically, provides the starting point of this article. Using an ethnographic text examining manifestations of 'Islamic Feminism' in Egypt, I explore problems in addressing the subject of veiling - a continuous favourite among researchers. Grappling with stereotypes, assumptions and pre-interpretations based on what we read before going to the field and the questions we formulate in our minds, I look towards strategies of engagement with research subjects where anthropologists can express their commitments to them. Research ethics and reflexivity offer no formulaic guarantees of better representations, but pave the way towards understanding one's motivations and urges ethnographers to examine the impact of their work, both on the immediate community, and with regard to larger power politics. Given the fluid nature of identities and the relative fixedness of representations, solutions do not appear in abundance. Working outside of unnecessary dichotomies and searching for incongruities presents interesting possibilities for future ethnographic research.\n      </p>", "This article draws on feminism and post-structuralism to theorize a narrative framework for developing and critiquing therapeutic practices with women who have experienced child sexual abuse. I argue that both objectivism and relativism provide poor guides for conducting therapy and that it is only through situating our knowledges precisely that more liberatory therapy practices may be developed. This approach, termed 'visible therapy', is used to directly and explicitly challenge normative constructions of women, child sexual abuse and therapy. I argue that it is necessary to explicate the embedded assumptions produced through practices of abuse, and which serve to construct children's experiences of that abuse, in order to ward against their reproduction within therapy relationships. I demonstrate that it is through situating and explicating the operations of power that the authenticity of experience and identity may be questioned and women's ongoing positioning as guilty victims may be challenged. Thus, I am concerned not with who women 'really are' but with how they come to know and be known through practices of both abuse and therapy. This, then, is about making the tactics of abuse and therapy visible. Problems are not located within individuals, but rather within the narratives which situate both past and current relationships but which, through reiteration, obscure their own social production. I conclude that it is only when categorical identity is no longer assumed that progressive therapy practices with women who have been sexually abused can be developed and maintained.\n      </p>", "Many Englishwomen explored the mountainous regions of the American West in the 1870s, 1880s, and 1890s, hiking and taking excursions into popular tourist destinations such as the Rocky Mountains and Yosemite Valley. This paper examines the writings of seven women who toured these regions and published accounts of their journeys. These elite international travelers produced a complex array of gendered subjectivities in their writings. They represented themselves as actively \"conquering\" mountain peaks as well as passively waiting for the men to do it, as fearing danger and fatigue but also ridiculing the incompetency of local male guides, and as \"resisting\" adventure, yet expressing female empowerment and abandonment in it. The paper problematizes \"feminine\" codes of behavior, first-wave feminism, and convergence of these within nineteenth-century British imperialism and narratives of adventure, to show how conventional as well as more transgressive discourses of Victorian womanhood worked with imperialist, nationalist, and class discourses. I examine what the women wrote about both the indoor spaces of mountainous landscapes and their outdoor mountaineering adventures. In many ways, the women reinscribed themselves as feminine domestic subjects in wilderness environments, yet they also explored and contested the powerful inscriptions of conventional Victorian womanhood.\n      </p>", "'Gender', understood as the social construction of sex, is a key concept for feminists working at the interface of theory and policy. This article examines challenges to the concept which emerged from different groups at the UN Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, September 1995, an important arena for struggles over feminist public policies. The first half of the article explores contradictory uses of the concept in the field of gender and development. Viewpoints from some southern activist women at the NGO Forum of the Beijing Conference are presented. Some of them argued that the way 'gender' has been deployed in development institutions has led to a depoliticization of the term, where feminist policy ambitions are sacrificed to the imperative of ease of institutionalization. 'Gender' becomes a synonym for 'women', rather than a form of shorthand for gender difference and conflict and the project of transformation in gender relations. 'Gender sensitivity' can be interpreted by non-feminists as encouragement to use gender-disaggregated statistics for development planning, but without consideration of relational aspects of gender, of power and ideology, and of how patterns of subordination are reproduced. A completely different attack on 'gender' came from right-wing groups and was battled out over the text of the Platform for Action agreed at the official conference. Six months prior to the conference, conservative groups had tried to bracket for possible removal the term 'gender' in this document, out of opposition to the notion of socially constructed, and hence mutable, gender identity. Conservative views on gender as the 'deconstruction of woman' are discussed here. The article points out certain contradictions and inconsistencies in feminist thinking on gender which are raised by the conservative backlash attack on feminism and the term 'gender'.\n      </p>"],
