In the K/BxN mouse model of inflammatory arthritis, T cells initiate disease by providing help to B cells to produce arthritogenic autoantibodies. Here, we have characterized an additional, nonhumoral role for T cells in promoting autoantibody-induced arthritis. Autoreactive KRN T cells introduced either by direct transfer or bone marrow transplantation into B-cell-deficient hosts enhanced K/BxN serum-transferred arthritis, an effect that was dependent on expression of the cognate MHC-molecule/peptide complex. The T cell influence was dependent on interleukin (IL)-17; in contrast, standard serum-transferred arthritis, unenhanced by the addition of T cells, was unaffected by IL-17 neutralization. An IL-17-producing population of transferred KRN T cells was identified and found to be supported by the cotransfer of arthritogenic autoantibodies. IL-17-producing KRN T cells were enriched in inflamed joints of K/BxN mice, suggesting either selective recruitment or preferential differentiation. These results demonstrate the potential for autoreactive T cells to play two roles in the development of arthritis, both driving the production of pathogenic autoantibodies and bolstering the subsequent inflammatory cascade dependent on the innate immune system.\n      </p>", "Background: Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) can influence the immune system, possibly increasing the risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In addition, as metabolic change due to obesity has been proposed as one mechanism of osteoarthritis (OA), POPs stored in adipose tissue may be also associated with OA. Objective: Our goal in this study was to examine associations of background exposure to POPs with arthritis among the general population. Design: We investigated cross-sectional associations of serum POPs concentrations with the prevalence of self-reported arthritis in 1,721 adults \u2265 20 years of age in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002. Results: Among several POPs, dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) or nondioxin-like PCBs were positively associated with arthritis in women. After adjusting for possible confounders, odds ratios (ORs) were 1.0, 2.1, 3.5, and 2.9 across quartiles of dioxin-like PCBs (p for trend =0.02). Corresponding figures for nondioxin-like PCBs were 1.0, 1.6, 2.6, and 2.5 (p for trend =0.02). Organochlorine (OC) pesticides were also weakly associated with arthritis in women. For subtypes of arthritis, respectively, RA was more strongly associated with PCBs than was OA. The adjusted ORs for RA were 1.0, 7.6, 6.1, and 8.5 for dioxin-like PCBs (p for trend = 0.05), 1.0, 2.2, 4.4, and 5.4 for nondioxin-like PCBs (p for trend &lt; 0.01), and 1.0, 2.8, 2.7, and 3.5 for OC pesticides (p for trend = 0.15). POPs in men did not show any clear relation with arthritis. Conclusions: The possibility that background exposure to PCBs may be involved in pathogenesis of arthritis, especially RA, in women should be investigated in prospective studies.\n      </p>", "Objective: Biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are efficacious for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, measurements of relative effectiveness, including treatment adherence and persistence, are lacking. We evaluated adherence and persistence during new episodes of use of traditional and biologic DMARDs. Methods: Using Tennessee Medicaid databases (1995-2004), we assembled a retrospective cohort of patients diagnosed with RA, and identified new episodes of use for 12 DMARD regimens. We evaluated persistence through survival analyses, and adherence within episodes through the medication possession ratio. A risk score was included in the analyses to account for measured confounders. Results: We identified 14,932 patients with RA; 6018 patients had 10,547 episodes of new use of DMARDs. Considering methotrexate as the reference and after adjustment for measured confounders, episodes of new use of sulfasalazine [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.59; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.47-1.72] and infliximab alone (aHR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.09-1.73) were more likely to be discontinued; and new episodes of etanercept (aHR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.73-0.92) and methotrexate + adalimumab (aHR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.48-0.84) were less likely to be discontinued. Compared with methotrexate, adherence was higher for leflunomide, infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab and lower for sulfasalazine and all combined therapies. Conclusions: We developed an approach to assess persistence on and adherence to the most common DMARD therapies. In this large cohort, persistence and adherence to leflunomide and most biologic DMARD therapies were at least comparable to methotrexate. Adherence was lower for sulfasalazine and all combined therapies.\n      </p>", "p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) regulates cytokines in arthritis and is, in turn, regulated by MAPK kinase (MKK) 3 and MKK6. To modulate p38 function but potentially minimize toxicity, we evaluated the utility of targeting MKK3 by using $MKK3^{-/-}$ mice. These studies showed that TNF-\u03b1 increased phosphorylation of p38 in WT cultured synoviocytes but that p38 activation, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 expression were markedly lower in $MKK3^{-/-}$ synoviocytes. In contrast, IL-1\u03b2 or LPS-stimulated p38 phosphorylation and IL-6 production by $MKK3^{-/-}$ synoviocytes were normal. Detailed signaling studies showed that NF-KB also contributes to IL-6 production and that TNF-\u03b1-induced NF-\u03baB activation is MKK3-dependent. In contrast, LPS-mediated activation of NF-\u03baB does not require MKK3. To determine whether this dichotomy occurs in vivo, two inflammation models were studied. In K/BxN passive arthritis, the severity of arthritis was dramatically lower in $MKK3^{-/-}$ mice. Phospho-p38, phospho-MAPK activator protein kinase 2, IL-1\u03b2, CXC ligand 1, IL-6, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 3 levels in the joints of $MKK3^{-/-}$ mice were significantly lower than in controls. Exogenous IL-1\u03b2 administered during the first 4 days of the passive model restored arthritis to the same severity as in WT mice. In the second model, IL-6 production after systemic LPS administration was similar in WT and $MKK3^{-/-}$ mice. Therefore, selective MKK3 deficiency can suppress inflammatory arthritis and cytokine production while Toll-like receptor 4-mediated host defense remains intact.\n      </p>", "Objective: We sought to examine differences in valuation of health by individuals from different ethnic backgrounds and between patients and community members. Research Design: We surveyed 193 community members identified by random-digit dialing (ie, 64 white, 65 black, and 64 Hispanic) and 198 patients with osteoarthritis (OA), 66 per ethnic group, drawn sequentially from clinic lists of an outpatient institution. Measures: Participants were interviewed and asked to rate 2 scenarios describing arthritis (mild and severe) using visual analog scale (VAS), standard gamble (SG), and time trade-off (TTO). Differences were adjusted for cohort, age, gender, and education. Results: Members of the public had higher preference scores for the 2 health states than patients (SG severe state: 0.77 public, 0.66 patients; SG mild state: 0.90 public, 0.84 patients). The difference score between the mild and severe states was smaller for black than white subjects (P &lt; 0.001) by SG and TTO. Scores for Hispanics and whites did not differ. Preference scores increased with age (SG, TTO). Conclusions: Significant differences were observed in the valuation of health between members of the public and patients, among ethnic groups, and in relation to educational status and age, with the difference between utilities of health states being a more efficient measure of preference than the utility of a single state. Utilities elicited through valuation of hypothetical health scenarios are dependent on sociodemographic traits, experience of disease, and method used. These findings suggest that utilities cannot be used interchangeably across populations, with implications for economic analyses.\n      </p>", "A juvenile western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) experienced recurrent fever, lethargy, diarrhea, and/or arthritis starting at age 6 mo. During an episode at age 15 mo, Shigella sp. was isolated from diarrheic feces. At age 41 mo, reactive arthritis was diagnosed. In addition, the gorilla's growth was retarded. All arthritic attacks were managed symptomatically prior to age 4 yr, at which time a severe episode precipitated the implementation of therapy with sulfasalazine, an arthritis suppressive medication. Examination 27 mo later revealed cessation of progressive joint pathology although the animal exhibited decreased range of motion in most joints. The gorilla has been on sulfasalazine therapy for 4 yr without lameness. Growth has resumed, and there has been no radiographic evidence of progressive joint degeneration. Immunogenetic analysis of whole blood obtained at age 68 mo identified the gorilla major histo-compatibility class I allele, $\\text{Gogo-B}^{\\ast }0101$ , which has limited nucleotide sequence similarity to HLA-B27, an allele associated with postinfection reactive arthritis in humans. Sulfasalazine therapy effectively managed reactive arthritis in this gorilla and should be considered for similarly frequently affected animals. Juvenile gorillas, in populations with a history of clinical shigellosis and/or postdiarrhea arthritis, may benefit from prophylactic sulfasalazine therapy after episodes of bacterial enterocolitis. Sulfasalazine therapy should be considered in all gorillas, juvenile and adult, experiencing confirmed Shigella sp.--associated enterocolitis.\n      </p>", "The pathogenesis of chronic joint inflammation remains unclear, although the involvement of pathogen recognition receptors has been suggested recently. In the present article, we describe the role of two members of the NACHT-LRR (NLR) family, Nod1 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain) and Nod2 in a model of acute joint inflammation induced by intraarticular injection of Streptococcus pyogenes cell wall fragments. Here, we show that Nod2 deficiency resulted in reduced joint inflammation and protection against early cartilage damage. In contrast, Nod1 gene-deficient mice developed enhanced joint inflammation with concomitant elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and cartilage damage, consistent with a model in which Nod1 controls the inflammatory reaction. To explore whether the different function of Nod1 and Nod2 occurs also in humans, we exposed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) carrying either Nod1ins/del or Nod2fs mutation with SCW fragments in vitro. Production of both TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 was clearly impaired in PBMCs carrying the Nod2fs compared with PBMCs isolated from healthy controls. In line with results in Nod1 gene-deficient mice, PBMCs from individuals bearing a newly described Nod1 mutation produced enhanced levels of proinflammatory cytokines after 24-h stimulation with SCW fragments. These data indicate that the NLR family members Nod1 and Nod2 have different functions in controlling inflammation, and that intracellular Nod1-Nod2 interactions may determine the severity of arthritis in this experimental model. Whether a distorted balance between the function of Nod1 and/or Nod2 is involved in the pathogenesis of human autoinflammatory or autoimmune disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis, remains to be elucidated.\n      </p>", "Abnormal T cell immune responses induce aberrant expression of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, leading to osteoclast-mediated bone erosion and osteoporosis in autoimmune arthritis. However, the mechanism underlying enhanced osteoclastogenesis in arthritis is not completely understood. Here we show that TNF-\u03b1 contributes to inflammatory bone loss by enhancing the osteoclastogenic potential of osteoclast precursor cells through inducing paired Ig-like receptor-A (PIR-A), a costimulatory receptor for receptor activator of NF-\u03baB (RANK). In fact, bone erosion and osteoporosis, but not inflammation, caused by aberrant TNF-\u03b1 expression were ameliorated in mice deficient in Fc receptor common \u03b3 subunit or \u03b2\u2082-microglobulin, in which the expression of PIR-As and PIR-A ligands is impaired, respectively. These results establish the pathological role of costimulatory receptors for RANK in bone loss in arthritis and may provide a molecular basis for the future therapy of inflammatory diseases.\n      </p>", "IL-33, a cytokine of the IL-1 family, is closely associated with type II T cell responses. Here, we report an unexpected proinflammatory role of IL-33 in inflammatory arthritis. IL-33 was expressed in synovial fibroblasts from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Expression was markedly elevated in vitro by inflammatory cytokines. Mice lacking ST2, the IL-33 receptor \u03b1-chain, developed attenuated collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and reduced ex vivo collagen-specific induction of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-17, TNF\u03b1, and IFN\u03b3), and antibody production. Conversely, treatment of wild-type (WT) but not &lt;tex-math&gt;${\\rm ST}2^{-/-}$&lt;/tex-math&gt; mice with IL-33 exacerbated CIA and elevated production of both proinflammatory cytokines and anti-collagen antibodies. Mast cells expressed high levels of ST2 and responded directly to IL-33 to produce a spectrum of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in vitro. In vivo, IL-33 treatment exacerbated CIA in &lt;tex-math&gt;${\\rm ST}2^{-/-}$&lt;/tex-math&gt; mice engrafted with mast cells from WT but not from &lt;tex-math&gt;${\\rm ST}2^{-/-}$&lt;/tex-math&gt; mice. Disease exacerbation was accompanied by elevated expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Our results demonstrate that IL-33 is a critical proinflammatory cytokine for inflammatory joint disease that integrates fibroblast activation with downstream immune activation mainly via an IL-33-driven, mast-cell-dependent pathway. Thus, this IL-1 superfamily member represents a therapeutic target for RA.\n      </p>", "Purpose To investigate whether people with long term conditions, whatever their specific nature, need to be assessed and treated for the full range of mental, physical and social problems. Main question investigated: that rheumatoid arthritis and schizophrenia will be associated with significantly greater impairment across the subscores of the SF36 scale than in reference general population samples. Specific hypothesis tested: while rheumatoid arthritis and schizophrenia will impair both physical and mental functioning, when comparing the two groups there will be a greater difference between the physical component scores than there will be between the mental/emotional component scores of the short form health survey (SF-36). Methods Cross sectional comparison of SF-36 subscore profiles of cohorts of: (1) people with rheumatoid arthritis attending specialist Rheumatology outpatient clinics in five London hospitals (n = 446), and (2) people with schizophrenia treated by community psychiatric teams in four sites in Europe (n = 409). Results Both groups had greater impairments across the whole spectrum of mental and physical problems assessed by the SF-36 than age specific normative data for the general population. The results also support our hypothesis that, comparing the people with rheumatoid arthritis and schizophrenia, we did find that there is a greater discrepancy between the physical scales than there is between the mental/emotional scales of the SF-36. Conclusions These findings show that whether the primary long-term condition is presenting as physical or as mental disorder, the practitioner should ensure that the full range of physical, mental and social problems is assessed and treated.\n      </p>", "Objective. To describe the impact of arthritis and other rheumatic conditions on hospitals by describing the magnitude and characteristics of these hospitalizations. Methods. Data from the 1997 National Hospital Discharge Survey were used to examine this impact. Arthritis was defined using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification, codes specified by the National Arthritis Data Workgroup. Arthritis-related hospitalizations were analyzed by principal diagnosis of arthritis and by any-listed arthritis diagnosis. Results. In 1997, there were an estimated 744,000 hospitalizations with a principal arthritis diagnosis (3% of hospitalizations). Compared with nonarthritis hospitalizations, persons hospitalized with a principal arthritis diagnosis were older, had fewer comorbidities, had shorter hospital stays, were more likely to undergo a procedure, and were more likely to be discharged to short- and long-term care facilities. The most common diagnoses and procedures related to osteoarthritis. This profile was consistent with a healthier-than-average hospital population electively admitted for specific procedures and subsequent rehabilitation. There were an estimated 2.5 million hospitalizations with an any-listed arthritis diagnosis (&gt;9% of hospitalizations). Persons hospitalized with an any-listed arthritis diagnosis were older, had more comorbidities, and had longer hospital stays than those with principal arthritis or nonarthritis hospitalizations. This profile was consistent with a sicker-than-average hospital population nonelectively admitted for reasons other than their arthritis, especially cardiovascular disease. Conclusion. Arthritis has a sizable impact on the hospital care system. As our population ages, this impact, in both human and economic terms, is likely to increase.\n      </p>", "Objective\u2014To investigate the relation between rheumatoid arthritis and occupational exposure to silica in pottery and related industries. Methods\u2014Medical records of 8325 men and women born 1916\u201345 and employed in pottery, refractory material (aluminosilicate or silica), and sandstone industries were examined to identify cases of rheumatoid arthritis. Medical and employment histories were extracted for cases and matched referents. Indices of duration, cumulative exposure, and mean silica concentration were compiled. Conditional logistic regression was used to investigate the relation between rheumatoid arthritis and indices of exposure, having allowed for potential confounders of smoking, employment in the coal mining industry, and number of pregnancies. Results\u201458 Cases of rheumatoid arthritis (43 men, 15 women) were identified. Cases had significantly shorter duration of exposure than referents. There was no significant difference between cases and referents in mean silica concentration. Men who had worked in the coal mining industry were particularly at risk (odds ratio 5.36, 95% confidence interval 1.92 to 15.03). Conclusion\u2014There was no evidence of increased risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis after occupational exposure to silica at mean exposures within the current United Kingdom exposure limits.\n      </p>", "The distribution of arthritis and osteomyelitis (OM) was studied in turkeys with green liver (GL) discoloration collected in a processing plant; the turkeys originated from seven commercial farms. Overall occurrence of GL, arthritis, and OM in the 25,320 inspected toms was 264 (1.04%), 123 (0.49%), and 107 (0.42%), respectively, and in the 16,690 inspected hens was 24 (0.14%), 0%, and 13 (0.08%), respectively. Prevalence of GL, OM, and arthritis varied among the studied farms. Arthritis and/or OM were detected in 168 (58.3%) of 288 turkeys with green discolored livers. Of the 168 turkeys with OM and/or arthritis, 48 (28.6%) had only arthritis, 45 (26.8%) had OM only, and 75 (44.6%) had both lesions. Arthritis and OM were detected in single and multiple sites and were unilateral and bilateral. Distribution of OM in the 120 OM-positive turkeys with and without arthritis was 77 (64.2%) in proximal tibia, 29 (24.2%) in proximal humerus, 28 (23.3%) in proximal femur, 13 (10.8%) in rib cage, and 4 (3.3%) in distal femur. Distribution of arthritis in the 123 arthritis-positive turkeys with and without OM was 77 (62.6%) in shoulder, 45 (36.6%) in stifle, and 25 (20.3%) in hip joints. Findings in this study suggest that arthritis and osteomyelitis are two distinct lesions and that they may develop independently in the same bird. /// Se estudi\u00f3 la distribuci\u00f3n de la artritis y osteomielitis en pavos con h\u00edgados verdes tomados en un matadero.

Twenty-three percent of cases and 13% of controls were current users of oral contraceptives at the index date (relative risk estimate = 2.0, 95% CI = 0.97-4.21). We conclude that current oral contraceptive use was not protective against the development of rheumatoid arthritis in this population.\n      </p>", "Spondyloarthropathy was documented for the first time in 14 (3.7%) of 386 large cats, affecting eight species belonging to three genera. The limited distribution of joint erosions, associated with spine and sacroiliac joint pathology, was indistinguishable from that occurring in humans with spondyloarthropathy of the reactive type. This form of inflammatory arthritis is almost twice as common as osteoarthritis (for fields as a whole), and animal wellbeing may be enhanced by its recognition and by initiation of specific treatment.\n      </p>", "Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the cost attributable to lost productivity from arthritis and the association between the degree of loss and demographic, disease-related, occupational, and psychosocial variables for people. Methods: In a prospective study, 383 employed individuals with arthritis were recruited from southwestern Ontario, Canada. Respondents completed structured questionnaires assessing demographic, disease-related, workplace, and psychosocial variables as well as employment-related transitions at 2 time points 18 months apart. Indirect costs resulting from arthritis-related absences, reduced performance, decreased work hours, job change, and work disability were estimated. A proportional odds model was used to assess the impact of the various variables on lost productivity. Results: The average cost attributable to arthritis was CAN $11,553 ($CAN = 0.75 $US) per person per year. The largest component of the loss was the result of reduced performance at work, which accounted for 41% ($4724) of the total loss. This was followed by wage loss resulting from stopping working or changing jobs, which comprised 37% ($4309) of the total. Another 12% ($1398) and 10% ($1121) of the loss were the result of the decrease in hours of work and absenteeism, respectively. Four variables were associated with the productivity loss: greater symptom severity (odds ratio [OR] = 1.11), low or medium control over the work schedule (OR = 0.55 and 0.60, respectively), greater workspace limitation (OR = 1.10), and higher depression (OR = 1.04). Conclusions: Indirect arthritis-related costs are substantial. Our results show that not only the disease itself, but also psychosocial and work-related factors affect the magnitude of the costs.\n      </p>", "To investigate the direct role of interleukin (IL) 6 in the development of rheumatoid arthritis, IL-6-deficient (IL-6 -/-) mice were backcrossed for eight generations into C57BL/6 mice, a strain of mice with a genetic background of susceptibility for antigen-induced arthritis (AIA). Both histological and immunological comparisons were made between IL-6-deficient (IL-6 -/-) mice and wild-type (IL-6 +/+) littermates after the induction of AIA. Although all IL-6 +/+ mice developed severe arthritis, only mild arthritis was observed in IL-6 -/- mice. Safranin O staining demonstrated that articular cartilage was well preserved in IL-6 -/- mice, whereas it was destroyed completely in IL-6 +/+ mice. In addition, comparable mRNA expression for both IL-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 , but not for IL-6, was detected in the inflamed joints of IL-6 -/- mice, suggesting that IL-6 may play a more crucial role in cartilage destruction than either IL-1\u03b2 or tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 . In immunological comparisons, both antigen-specific in vitro proliferative response in lymph node cells and in vivo antibody production were elicited in IL-6 -/- mice, but they were reduced to less than half of that found in IL-6 +/+ mice. Lymph node cells of IL-6 -/- mice produced many more Th2 cytokines than did IL-6 +/+ mice with either antigen-specific or nonspecific stimulation in in vitro culture. Taken together, these results indicate that IL-6 may play a key role in the development of AIA at the inductive as well as the effector phase, and the blockade of IL-6 is possibly beneficial in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.\n      </p>", "There is some evidence that sex hormones may influence the incidence of rheumatoid arthritis. Obesity has been found to increase endogenous estrogens, particularly among postmenopausal women. Although the association of endogenous hormones with smoking and alcohol use is less clear, we examined the relation of these three factors with rheumatoid arthritis in women. We conducted a population-based case-control study of rheumatoid arthritis in King County, WA, and Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound. We compared 349 incident cases of rheumatoid arthritis with 1,457 controls selected by random digit dialing or by random selection from the enrollment files of Group Health Cooperative. We conducted personal interviews to collect data on weight, smoking, alcohol history, reproductive variables, and other demographic variables. Women with 20 or more packyears of smoking had a relative risk of 1.5 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.0-2.0] compared with never-smokers. Postmenopausal women who averaged more than 14 alcoholic drinks per week had a reduced risk of rheumatoid arthritis (relative risk = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.2-1.7). Women in the highest quartile of body mass index had a risk of 1.4 (95% CI = 1.0-2.0) relative to women with lowest body mass index.\n      </p>", "Two juvenile lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) experienced polyarthropathies subsequent to Shigella flexneri enteritis. The clinical sign of lameness and soft tissue swelling resolved with anti-inflammatory and antibiotic therapy. One of the animals had a major histocompatibility class I allele with some sequence similarity to HLA-B27. This allele is associated with postinfection reactive arthritis in humans.\n      </p>", "Antioxidant micronutrients have been hypothesized to provide protection against rheumatoid arthritis. We investigated serum selenium and serum alpha-tocopherol for their prediction of subsequent development of rheumatoid arthritis in a case-control study nested within a Finnish cohort of 18,709 adult men and women who had neither arthritis nor a history of it at the baseline examination in 1973-1978; by late 1989, 122 had developed rheumatoid arthritis. Of the incident cases, 34 were rheumatoid factor-negative. Three controls per each incident case were individually matched for sex, age, and municipality. Serum selenium and alpha-tocopherol concentrations were measured from stored serum samples collected at baseline. Serum selenium was inversely related to subsequent occurrence of rheumatoid factor-negative but not rheumatoid factor-positive rheumatoid arthritis. The relative risks, adjusted for smoking and serum total cholesterol, for the highest relative to the lowest tertile of serum selenium, were 0.16 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.04-0.69] for rheumatoid factor-negative and 0.96 (CI = 0.49-1.90) for rheumatoid factor-positive rheumatoid arthritis. During the first 10 years of follow-up, the relative risk for rheumatoid arthritis for the highest compared with the lowest tertile of serum alpha-tocopherol was 0.44 (CI = 0.19-0.99). No association was found for longer follow-up periods. Low selenium status may be a risk factor for rheumatoid factor-negative rheumatoid arthritis, and low alpha-tocopherol status may be a risk factor for rheumatoid arthritis independently of rheumatoid factor status.\n      </p>", "Unossified horn or pilose antler cut from deer, which belong to the Cervidae generally is termed Nokyong. Nokyong is one of the most famous Korean traditional medicines and has been considered to possess sexual-reinforcing and antiaging actions. In this study, water extract of deer antler extract (DAA) prepared from the growing antler of Cervus korean TEMMINCK var. mantchuricus Swinhoe was used to investigate the efficacy of the DAA on the development of type II collagen (CII)-induced arthritis (CIA) in rats. Male rats were immunized with an emulsion of 200 \u00b5g of CII and complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). The rats then were administered by injection a suspension of DAA or phosphate-buffered saline. The effect of DAA on cellular responses to CII was examined. The injection of DAA suppressed the CII-specific secretion of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 from splenocytes ex vivo. The influence of DAA also was evaluated on the incidence and development of arthritis in rat CIA. Rats were immunized twice at a 3-wk interval with bovine CII, with DAA being given by injection once a d for 14 d with four different regimens. A 14-d course of DAA treatment at a daily dose of 100 \u00b5g/kg, which began on the d of the first CII immunization, suppressed the development of arthritis, as well as antibody formation and delayed-type hypersensitivity to CII. Treatment with DAA resulted in inhibition of development of arthritis and immune responses to CII.\n      </p>", "Objective: The objective of this study was to test the effectiveness of a mail-delivered, tailored self-management intervention (SMART) and to compare it with the classic Arthritis Self-Management Program (ASMP). Methods: We performed 2 randomized controlled trials: 1) a study of 1090 participants randomized to SMART or USUAL CARE, and 2) a study of 341 participants randomized to SMART or ASMP. Dependent variables included disability, pain, depression, role function, global severity, doctor visits, and self-efficacy. SMART interventions were provided in months 0-18 and not reinforced. Results were assessed at 1, 2, and 3 years using analyses of covariance (ANCOVA). Results: Compared with USUAL CARE, SMART participants at 1 year had decreased disability, improved role function, and increased self-efficacy (all P &lt;0.01). At 2 years, decreases in global severity, doctor visits, and increases in self-efficacy (all P &lt;0.01) were noted. At 3 years without reinforcement, no statistically significant effects remained. Compared with ASMP, SMART at 1 year had greater decreases in disability (P = 0.02) and increases in self-efficacy (P = 0.01). There were no differences at 2 years. At 3 years, role function (P = 0.04) and doctor visit (P = 0.03) were improved in ASMP as compared with SMART. Improvements from baseline were seen for nearly all variables in both groups. Conclusions: A mail-delivered arthritis self-management program, SMART, was similarly effective to the classic ASMP, with slightly better results in the first year and a slightly more rapid attenuation over the next 2 years. Results suggest that both programs are effective, and that the addition of a mail-delivered program could improve accessibility to arthritis self-management treatment.\n      </p>", "Objective. To evaluate the validity of SF-36 Health Survey (SF-36) scale scores and summary measure scores to describe the health burden of arthritis and to be responsive to clinical indicators of arthritis severity used in four clinical trials. Methods. Adults participating in four double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trials of therapy for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis were administered the SF-36 concurrent with clinical measures of disease severity (n = 1,016). Data were collected before treatment and 2 weeks after treatment. Mean SF-36 scores for all patients with arthritis at baseline were compared to a sociodemographically equivalent national norm to test the ability of the SF-36 to describe the burden of arthritis. To test the responsiveness of SF-36 scores to clinical measures of arthritis severity, mean SF-36 scale scores were compared across patients differing in arthritis severity before treatment. Two-week mean SF-36 change scores were compared across patients who improved in arthritis severity (responders) versus patients who did not improve (nonresponders). F-statistics and relative validity co-efficients were computed to determine how well each SF-36 scale and summary measure discriminated among arthritis severity levels and distinguished treatment responders from nonresponders, relative to the best scale. Results. Large and statistically significant differences in mean SF-36 scale scores and summary measures were found such that trial participants scored in worse health than a sociodemographically equivalent US general population norm. In addition, the largest SF-36 scale scores were found to significantly differ across clinically defined levels of arthritis severity. Finally, it was found that the SF-36 scales that best discriminate among arthritis severity groups cross-sectionally were also best at discriminating treatment responders from nonresponders. Conclusion. Results of this study support the validity of the SF-36 to document the health burden of arthritis and as a measure of generic health outcome for clinical trials of alternative treatments for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients.\n      </p>", "As shown here, general health measures cover much of the content included in arthritis-specific measures, but, are they equally sensitive to changes in disease condition? We reviewed the literature on the most widely used general health measure, the SF-36 Health Survey, to see if the empirical evidence supported its validity for use in arthritis patients. As of this writing, there was no documentation of the sensitivity of the SF-36 to short-term changes in arthritic condition over the course of clinical trials and few studies that compared the sensitivity of the SF-36 to arthritis-specific measures. The empirical research reported in this special supplement contributes to the literature on the use of the SF-36 in arthritis patients and demonstrates methods of studying the validity of general health measures to monitor change in specific conditions.\n      </p>", "Background: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) provide an important opportunity for understanding care of patients with a serious chronic condition. Objectives: We sought to characterize the complexity of care for patients with RA, including metrics describing the patient, the disease, and use of the health care system across time and place. Methods: We undertook a prospective cohort study of 568 community-dwelling patients with RA by using observational data from clinically detailed telephone interviews at baseline and 2 years later in addition to medical record abstraction. Health status, comorbidity, use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, visits, providers, provider types, encounter settings, and the discontinuity between patients and providers were studied. Results: Within a 12-month window, 568 patients had 8686 outpatient encounters with the health care system with a mean of 3.41 unique providers per patient associated with a mean of 5 primary care and 6 rheumatologist visits. Half did not see a primary care physician, and 20% did not see a rheumatologist during 6-month periods despite their use of potentially toxic drugs, a mean of 4 comorbidities and progressive RA. Over the course of 24 months, 29% of patients changed their primary care provider, and 15% changed their rheumatologist. Patients were moderately impaired with mean SF-12 physical component score 37 (SD, 9). Conclusion: Patients with RA have frequent encounters with multiple providers and also frequent discontinuity of care. Recognizing the complexity of the care of patients with a chronic disease across multiple dimensions provides an opportunity to better understand challenges and opportunities in delivering high quality care.\n      </p>", "Background: Antagonism between Th1 and Th2 lymphocyte mediated responses has been proposed to explain the observed 20th Century population increase in Th2 mediated allergic disease and reciprocal decrease in infectious disease, which stimulates a Th1 mediated response. Objective: To determine if Th1/Th2 antagonism would be consistent with associations between non-infectious diseases, we tested the hypothesis that the population prevalence of Th2 mediated allergies is inversely related to the prevalence of Th1 mediated rheumatoid arthritis. Methods: The analysis was based on data from the Canadian Community Health Survey conducted by Statistics Canada in 2000-2001 of those at least 12 years of age from 125,129 households. Each subject was asked if he or she had certain chronic health conditions that had been diagnosed by a health professional. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between rheumatoid arthritis and allergies with consideration of other important variables. Results: Allergy history was positively related to the prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis both in women (adjusted odds ratio (OR): 1.57, 95% CI: 1.43, 1.73) and in men (adjusted OR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.36, 1.77). Conclusions: The reported population prevalences of allergies and rheumatoid arthritis were positively associated and not explained by Th1/Th2 anatagonism suggesting that this mechanism may only be applicable to the association between an infectious and an immunologic disease. Mechanisms accounting for positive associations between immunologic diseases deserve further study.\n      </p>", "Background: Cost-effectiveness evaluation for health care programs often involves the use of quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) estimates to measure morbidity losses from health conditions. Current techniques for measuring morbidity losses are often subjective, inflexible, impractical, and subject to bias. Objective: We sought to examine the impact of population heterogeneity on QALY values for arthritis sufferers by estimating an alternative health-adjusted life-year (HALY) measure based on self-assessed health status. Research Design: We present a feasible approach for the assessment of improved QALY estimates for chronic conditions affecting heterogeneous populations. An ordered probit model, using data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), is used to calculate expected HALY losses from arthritis for distinct population subgroups. These measures are used to scale existing QALY measures that have been calculated for distinct homogeneous populations. Results: We find that QALY losses from chronic arthritis vary by age, time since onset, and type of arthritis. When we apply these results to prevention programs aimed at reducing the incidence of Salmonella enteritidis infections (and the resulting reactive arthritis sequelae), we find that age-invariant QALYs underestimate the true discounted lifetime QALY losses from arthritis by 15%. Conclusions: Our results indicate that a failure to account for population heterogeneity can lead to biased health loss estimates. The modified HALY measure presented here can be used to help inform policymakers faced with heterogeneous populations.\n      </p>", "Objective The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to evaluate cancer risk among rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients in California. Methods The study cohort derived from statewide patient discharge records was followed via linkage with cancer registry data over the period 1991\u2013 2002. Age and sex adjusted standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to compare observed to expected numbers of cancers based on age, race, and sex specific incidence rates in the California population. Results Among the 84,475 RA patients, who were observed for 405,540 person-years, 5,533 incident cancers were diagnosed during the observation interval. The risk of developing lymphohematopoietic cancer was significantly higher in the cohort for both sexes. Males had significantly higher risks of lung, liver, and esophageal cancer, but a lower risk of prostate cancer. Females were at significantly decreased risk for several cancers including breast, ovary, uterus, cervix, and melanoma, with the risk reduction ranging from 15 to 57% lower than the general population. Hispanics had increased risks of leukemia, vagina/vulva, lung, and liver cancers. Conclusion Studies investigating the mechanisms that underlie the reported associations between RA and specific cancer types are needed.\n      </p>", "The risk of hematologic malignancies was studied in Finnish patients with rheumatoid arthritis or Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, and the difference in the risk between those diseases was evaluated. The study cohorts comprised 676 patients with primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, 709 with secondary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, and 9,469 with rheumatoid arthritis identified from the Finnish hospitals' national discharge register. The follow-up times were 5,336, 4,254 and 65,391 person-years, respectively. Data on the incidence of malignancies were collected from the files of the Finnish Cancer Registry. The incidence of hematologic malignancies was elevated in the study cohorts. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was: 2.2 (95 percent confidence interval [CI] 1.5-3.1) for rheumatoid arthritis; 4.5 (CI = 1.5-11) for secondary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome; and 8.7 (CI = 4.3-16) for primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. The ratio of the SIR of primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndroma cf rheumatoid arthritis alone was 3.9 (CI = 1.8-8.0) in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 3.4 (CI = 1.2-8.1) in other hematologic cancers. The incidence of hematologic malignancies, especially that of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, is elevated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. It is higher in patients with secondary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome and highest in patients with primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. Differences in the immunologic aberration influence oncogenesis.\n      </p>", "Adjuvant arthritis characterized by chronic inflammation of the joints of rats is induced by immunization to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. To learn how autoimmune arthritis may be caused by a microbial antigen, we isolated a T-lymphocyte clone specific for M. tuberculosis antigens that was strongly arthritogenic. We now report that the clone recognized, in addition to M. tuberculosis antigens, antigens present in human synovial fluid, medium of chondrocyte cultures, and proteoglycans purified from cartilage. These observations indicate that the target antigen for the arthritogenic clone resides in the proteoglycan component of cartilage. As this arthritogenic clone shows specificity for both a M. tuberculosis antigen and a cartilage constituent we conclude that disease is probably caused by antigenic cross-reactivity. Thus, an autoimmune disease may be triggered by structural mimicry between antigens in the environment and self-antigens in the individual.\n      </p>", "Many different agents, including mineral oil and silicone, have the capacity to act as immunological adjuvants, i.e., they can contribute to the activation of the immune system. Some adjuvants, including mineral oil, are known to induce arthritis in certain strains of rats after intradermal injection or percutaneous application. The aim of this study was to determine if common commercial cosmetic products containing mineral oil could induce arthritis in the highly susceptible DA (Dark Agouti) rat. Intradermal injection of five out of eight assayed cosmetic products without further additives resulted in arthritis with synovitis. One of the products induced a very aggressive arthritis, which had declined after 5-9 weeks. When this product was also assayed for arthritogenicity upon percutaneous administration, it induced a mild and transient arthritis in 5 out of 10 DA rats, whereas control animals showed no clinical signs of joint involvement. No arthritic reaction was seen in rats after peroral feeding with the most arthritogenic product or by intravaginal application of Freund's adjuvants. Silicone gel implants in DA rats did not cause arthritis. We conclude that mineral oils included in common commercially available products retain their adjuvant properties and are arthritogenic in the presently investigated arthritis-prone rat strain. There is yet no evidence that mineral oils present in cosmetics may contribute to arthritis in humans, but we suggest that this question should be subject to further investigation.\n      </p>", "Objectives. To determine 4-month and 1-year health-related outcomes of a 6-week, lay-led, and community-based arthritis self-management program for Spanish-speaking participants and to determine the role of self-efficacy in predicting health status for this population. Methods. Three hundred and thirty one subjects were randomized to the program or to a 4-month wait list control group. One hundred ninety eight subjects continued in a 1-year longitudinal study. Data were collected via mailed questionnaires with telephone follow up. Results. At 4 months, treatment subjects, compared with controls, demonstrated positive changes in exercise, disability, pain, and self-efficacy (P &lt; 0.05). At 1 year, compared with baseline, treatment subjects demonstrated improvements in exercise, general health, disability, pain, self-efficacy, and depression (P &lt; 0.05). Baseline and 4-month changes in self-efficacy predicted health status at 1 year. Conclusions. Spanish-speaking participants of an arthritis self-management program demonstrate short- and long-term benefits (improved health behaviors, health status, and self-efficacy).\n      </p>", "The third and fourth phalanges of the third digit (main toe) of the left foot in an ostrich (Struthio camelus) were amputated because of severe osteomyelitis and septic arthritis of the distal interphalangeal joint. Healing occurred without any complications and no locomotive problems were reported by the owner 6 months after surgery. We conclude that amputation of a portion of the main digit is a feasible method of treating irreparable orthopedic digit disorders in ostriches, and does not create ambulatory problems for the bird.\n      </p>", "Background. The role of race/ethnicity in the receipt of arthritis-specific health care has not been well defined. Objective. To examine the association of race/ethnicity with the utilization of arthritis health care among community-dwelling older adults. Research Design. We used a computer-assisted telephone interview. Subjects. A population-based random sample was drawn from 6 preselected Alabama counties. Eligible respondents had self-reported arthritis and were over 50 years of age; 1424 people responded to the survey. Measures. Logistic regression was used to examine the association of race/ethnicity with the use of conventional (including use of a rheumatologist, primary care physician, and prescription arthritis medicines) and complementary and alternative medicines (CAM), including the use of chiropractic care, glucosamine and/or chondroitin, and herbals. Results. Reflecting stratified sampling, respondents were white (n = 852, 60%) or black (n = 528, 37%), female (72%), and had a mean age of 65 years. After multivariable adjustment, race/ethnicity was not a significant determinant of receiving rheumatology care or prescription arthritis medicines. However, whites were more likely than blacks to have seen a primary care physician for arthritis care (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-1.98) or to have used CAM (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.13-1.91) and twice as likely to have used glucosamine and/or chondroitin (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.30-3.05). Conclusion. In this population of community-dwelling older adults, white race was significantly associated with CAM use and visits to primary care physicians for arthritis care. In contrast, the use of specialists and prescription arthritis medications was better explained by factors other than race/ethnicity, which included female gender, urban residence, higher educational level, and other arthritis-specific variables.\n      </p>", "The etiology of arthritis in Hyaenidae has been a subject of conjecture. While osteoarthritis has been considered, the observation of an erosive arthritis prompted a systematic survey of museum specimens to define its nature and frequency. Spondyloarthropathy was a common erosive arthritis present in all species of Hyaenidae. Present at twice the frequency of osteoarthritis, it is a significant health consideration.\n      </p>", "This article examines practice variation among rheumatologists in their use of time and procedures in follow-up outpatient encounters with rheumatoid arthritis patients. It focuses on differences across individual physicians rather than differences in populations of patients. In addition, the total variance is divided into parts due to patient characteristics, the providers' economic and other incentives to do procedures or reduce contact time, individual practice styles, and the random sampling of encounters. Data are taken from a stratified random sampling of U.S. rheumatologists. Analyses are based on 1,154 outpatient follow-up encounters with rheumatoid arthritis patients provided by 66 physicians, each of whom reported at least ten such encounters. There are large differences among the physicians in visit length, number of monitoring procedures used per encounter, and whether the encounter included measurements of complete blood count/urinalysis or erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Individual practice style differences are far more important causes of the variation that was observed among providers than are patient differences or practice incentive differences. It was determined that 5-40% of the cost of specific management activities could be saved by reducing the highest use.\n      </p>", "An arthritis-specific health index (ASHI) for the SF-36 Health Survey was developed by studying its responsiveness to changes in clinical indicators of arthritis severity. Longitudinal data from 1,076 patients participating in four placebo-controlled trials were analyzed. All had at least a 6-month history of moderate to severe osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis of the knee or hip. All had undergone a washout period of 3 to 14 days before baseline assessment to bring about a flare state in osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis symptoms. Their average age was 60 years and 72% were female. Change scores for the eight-scale SF-36 health profile (acute version) and five arthritis-specific measures of disease severity (knee pain on weight bearing, time to walk 50 feet, physician global evaluation of symptom severity and impact, patient global evaluation of symptom severity and impact, and pain intensity visual analogue scale) were computed by subtracting scores before treatment from scores at two-week follow-up. Canonical correlation methods were used to derive weights for changes in SF-36 scales to score a single index (ASHI) that maximized its correlation with changes in the set of five clinical measures of arthritis severity. The weights used to score the ASHI were cross-validated in a 25% holdout group (N = 144) from the first two osteoarthritis trials and in two additional osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis trials (N = 530). Only one SF-36 canonical variate (ASHI) correlated significantly (F = 4.69, P &lt; 0.0001) with the clinical canonical variate that served as the \"criterion\" measure of change in the severity of arthritis. Changes in the ASHI and clinical canonical variate were substantially correlated in the developmental sample (r = 0.628, P &lt; 0.0001) and on cross-validation (r = 0.629, P &lt; 0.0001). The clinical canonical variate correlated highly (r = 0.75-0.88) with changes in all but one of the five clinical measures (50-foot walk; r = 0.41). The pattern of correlations between changes in SF-36 scales and the ASHI indicated that ASHI is primarily a measure of bodily pain (r = 0.92) and other aspects of physical and role functioning and well-being (r = 0.69 for Role-Physical, r = 0.68 for Physical Functioning, r = 0.52 for Social Functioning, and r = 0.51 Vitality). The patterns of correlations between SF-36 scales and the ASHI were very similar across developmental and cross-validation samples. This research demonstrates the feasibility and generalizability of a single ASHI scored from changes in responses to the SF-36 Health Survey. The generic SF-36 health profile, which has already been shown to be useful in comparing arthritis with other diseases and treatments, can also be scored specifically to make it more useful in studies of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.\n      </p>", "Objectives: Utility scores can be assessed indirectly using preference-based instruments and used as weightings for quality-adjusted life years in economic analyses. It is not clear whether available instruments yield similar results or what domains of health are contributing to the overall score in a sample of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Subjects: Our study included 313 individuals with rheumatologist-confirmed RA. Measures: A self-completed survey that permitted scoring of 4 indirect utility instruments (the Health Utilities Index Mark 2 and 3 (HUI-2 and HUI-3), the EuroQoL (EQ-5D), and the Short Form 6D (SF-6D) was the basis of our study. Results: Mean (standard deviation) global utility scores were 0.63 (0.24) for the SF-6D, 0.66 (0.13) for the EQ-5D, 0.71 (0.19) for the HUI-2, and 0.53 (0.29) for the HUI-3 (P = 0.02 by repeatedmeasures analysis of variance). The intraclass correlation across all the indices was 0.67 (95% confidence interval 0.62-0.71). BlandAltman plots revealed that agreement among instruments was poor at lower utility values. In this elderly RA sample, all of the global utilities mostly measured functional ability and pain. Conclusions: There are significant differences in utilities obtained from different indirect methods. Agreement among the instruments was moderate but poorer at lower utilities. It is unlikely that these utility values, if used as the weightings for quality-adjusted life years, would result in comparable estimates.\n      </p>", "Objective. To evaluate the psychometric assumptions underlying the construction and scoring of SF-36 scales and summary measures among clinical trial participants with arthritis. Methods. Cross-sectional SF-36 data from the baseline assessment of adult patients (n = 1,016) participating in four placebo-controlled clinical trials of treatment for arthritis were analyzed with blinding as to treatment. Tests of the completeness of data, scaling assumptions, internal-consistency reliability, and factor structure of SF-36 scales were performed for the combined sample. Eligible participants had at least a 6-month history of moderate to severe osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis of the knee or hip. Participants meeting inclusion criteria had undergone a washout period of 3-14 days before baseline assessment to bring about a flare state in osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis symptoms. Baseline sample sizes for the three osteoarthritis trials were n = 121, n = 341, and n = 187. The baseline sample size for the rheumatoid arthritis trial was n = 367. The average age of participants was 60 years, and the majority were females (72%). Measured were functional health and well-being scales and physical and mental health summary measures from the SF-36 Health Survey acute form. Results. Missing responses ranged from 0.0% to 1.5% across SF-36 items, and scale scores could be computed for 96.8% to 100% of participants across trials. In all four trials, item internal consistency tests were passed (91.4%-97.1%) and item discriminant validity tests were passed (96.9%-100.0%). Across the four trials, internal-consistency reliability coefficients ranged from a low of 0.75 to a high of 0.91 for the eight scales (median = 0.84), exceeding the minimum standards for group comparisons. Ceiling effects were minimal for most scales, and floor effects were noteworthy for the role physical and role emotional scales. Physical and mental health factors identified in previous studies were replicated. Conclusion. The SF-36 Health Survey proved to be a psychometrically sound tool for the assessment of the health status of adult participants in clinical trials of arthritis.\n      </p>", "Activation of Toll-like receptors (TLR) contributes to the initiation and maintenance of chronic inflammation in autoimmune diseases, yet repeated exposure to a TLR agonist can induce hyporespon-siveness to subsequent TLR stimulation. Here, we used a synthetic TLR7 agonist, 9-benzyl-8-hydroxy-2-(2-methoxyethoxy) adenine (SM360320, 1V136) to study TLR7 induced attenuation of inflammatory responses and its application to autoimmune diseases. Repeated low dose administration of this TLR7 agonist induced hyporesponsiveness or tolerance to TLR2, -7, and -9 activators and limited the course of neural inflammation in an experimental allergic encephalomyelitis model. The hyporesponsiveness did not depend on T or B lymphocytes, but did require bone marrow derived cells. In addition, TLR7 tolerance reduced inflammation in a passive antibody mediated arthritis model. TLR7 tolerance did not cause global immunosuppression, because susceptibility to Listeria monocytogenes infection was not altered. The mechanism of TLR7 tolerance involved the up-regulation of 2 inhibitors of TLR signaling: Interleukin 1 Receptor Associated Kinase (IRAK) M, and Src homology 2 domain-containing inositol polyphosphate phos-phatase (SHIP)-1. These findings suggest that induction of TLR7 tolerance might be a new therapeutic approach to subdue inflammation in autoimmune diseases.\n      </p>", "Using the 1994\u201395 National Health Interview Supplement Disability Supplement, the authors study levels of disabilities and accommodations among US adults with arthritis disability, compared to people with disability due to other conditions. Arthritis-disabled people are defined in two ways. One definition covers a broad range of arthritis and rheumatic conditions, and the other concentrates solely on arthritis. The authors find that arthritis-disabled people have more total disabilities than other-disabled people. However, their disabilities are less severe, have shorter durations, and accumulate more gradually over time. Despite more disabilities, people with arthritis disability use fewer assistive and service accommodations than other-disabled people. They do use more mobility aids. Because arthritis is the leading chronic condition for middle-aged and older adults, this profile of extensive but mild-to-moderate disability is experienced by many millions of adults. Accommodations for arthritis may also be extensive but aimed more toward self-care than toward assistive and medical services.\n      </p>", "Background: Major depression in later life is highest among people with chronic illness. Identifying amenable factors that mediate the relationship between known risk factors such as arthritis and heart disease with major depression is important to the design of clinical and public health strategies to reduce depression and its consequences. Objective: This study investigates factors amenable to clinical and public health intervention that could mediate the relationship between chronic illness and major depression. Design: Population-based national sample. Setting: United States preretirement age (54-65) adults. Participants: A total of 7825 participants from the 1996 Health and Retirement Survey. Measurement: The outcome is major depression based on standardized assessment. Independent variables include sociodemographics chronic illness profile, functional limitation, health and medical access. Results: A substantial burden of major depression is related to chronic illness, particularly arthritis (attributable risk [AR], 18.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.9-25.6) and heart disease (AR, 17.6%; 95% CI, 13.4-21.7). Functional limitation is the strongest investigated factor associated with depression (AR, 34.4%; 95% CI, 24.8-42.7) and attenuates the associations of arthritis and heart disease with depression. Conclusion: Functional limitation mediates the association of arthritis and heart disease with major depression. This relationship offers potential clinical and public health strategies to reduce major depression in older adults through intervention and management of functional limitation. Alternatively, it might be possible to reduce functional loss through screening for depression, particularly among people with functional limitation, and effective mental health treatment. The importance for clinical management of depression, comorbidity, and functional limitation spectrum supports the value of systems-based medicine.\n      </p>", "Accurate estimation of medical care costs raises a host of challenging issues. We examined whether pure administrative claims data without clinical validation of diagnosis allow reasonable estimation of disease-related costs in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Three patient groups were examined: patients with clinically confirmed RA (group A, n=338), patients with likely RA (administrative claims data reported the diagnosis of RA and patients were treated with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs, DMARDs; group B, n=303), and patients with possible RA (same as group B but patients had no DMARD treatment; group C, n=685). The payer's perspective was taken for this analysis. Only direct costs were included in the analysis. Cost data and data for several covariates were obtained from a major German statutory health insurance plan, the AOK Niedersachsen. A patient-per-patient microcosting approach was performed. A repeated measures, fixed effects model was applied to examine differences between the three study groups. Mean\u00b1SEM annual RA-related direct costs were \u20ac 2,017\u00b1183 per patient-year in group A, \u20ac 1763\u00b1192 in group B, and \u20ac 805\u00b158 in group C. Outpatient (inpatient) costs were \u20ac 1636 (328) in group A, \u20ac 1344 (340) in group B, and \u20ac 546 (136) in group C. DMARD costs were by far the single most important cost driver in groups A and B. The difference in total RA-related direct cost between groups A and B was not significant whereas the differences between groups A and C (group B and C respectively), were significant. Pure administrative claims data allowed for an accurate estimate of disease-related costs in RA patients that received DMARD therapy. However, the high number of patients for whom administrative claims data listed the diagnosis RA, but no DMARD treatment was given poses a challenge for further research.\n      </p>", "Objective: First, to investigate the patterns of functional ability, depressive feelings, and social support in early stage rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Second, to demonstrate the stress buffering effect of social support. Social support is thought to reduce the impact of chronic stress on psychological well-being; for patients without social support the impact of functional ability on depressive feelings will be stronger. Methods: In 4 waves with an intervening period of 1 year, longitudinal data was collected of 264 Dutch RA patients, of which 65% was female. At T1, the mean age of these patients was 53 years, while their mean disease duration was 22 months. In an interview at the patients' homes, data was collected on functional ability, social support en psychological well-being. The buffering effect of social support was examined by testing the significance of the (computed) stressor by social support interaction term in a regression analysis on depressive feelings. Results: Although large differences between subjects existed, the mean scores on functional ability, social support, and depressive feelings barely changed from year to year. Patients who deteriorated in functional ability during one year had the best chances to improve next year, and visa versa. Furthermore, the stress by support interaction terms had no significant effect on depressive feelings in a regression analysis. Conclusions: This study demonstrated clearly the fluctuating pattern of RA in the first years after onset. The patients' level of depressive feelings was linearly related to the level of functional ability. Like many other studies, also this study could not provide evidence for the stress buffering effect of social support.\n      </p>", "Silica exposure has been associated with kidney disease and rheumatoid arthritis; an autoimmune mechanism has been proposed. Approximately 2 million people are occupationally exposed to silica in the United States, 100,000 at more than twice the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommended exposure limit of 0.05 mg/ m3. We examined renal disease morbidity and mortality, as well as arthritis mortality, in a cohort of 4,626 silica-exposed workers in the industrial sand industry (an industry previously unstudied). We compared the cohort with the U.S. population and also conducted internal exposure-response analyses using a job-exposure matrix based on more than 4,000 industrial hygiene samples. We found excess mortality from acute renal disease [standardized mortality ratio (SMR) = 2.61, 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) = 1.49-4.24; 16 deaths], chronic renal disease (SMR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.13-2.22; 36 deaths), and arthritis (SMR = 4.36, 95% CI = 2.76-6.54; 23 deaths) on the basis of multiple-cause mortality data, which considered any mention of disease on a death certificate. Linking the cohort with the U.S. registry of end-stage renal disease for the years 1977-1996, we found an excess of end-stage renal disease incidence (standardized incidence ratio = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.25-2.96; 23 cases), which was highest for glomerulonephritis (standardized incidence ratio = 3.85, 95% CI = 1.55-7.93; 7 cases). We found increasing end-stage renal disease incidence with increasing cumulative exposure; standardized rate ratios by quartile of cumulative exposure were 1.00, 3.09, 5.22, and 7.79. A positive exposure-response trend was also observed for rheumatoid arthritis on the basis of death certificate data. These data represent the largest number of kidney disease cases analyzed to date in a cohort with well-defined silica exposure and suggest a causal link between silica and kidney disease. Excess risk of end-stage renal disease due to a lifetime of occupational exposure at currently recommended limits is estimated to be 14%, above a background end-stage renal disease risk of 2%.\n      </p>", "Spondyloarthropathy was observed in 25 (2.8%) of 895 preserved canid museum specimens and was catalogued by species. The associated skeletal alterations in canids are indistinguishable grossly and physiologically from those in humans with spondyloarthropathy of the reactive type. Rate of affliction was independent of captive or wild-caught status or gender. In canids, spondyloarthropathy was much more common than osteoarthritis (0.3%), which predominantly is limited to captive animals. Animal well-being may be enhanced by recognition of the condition and initiation of specific treatment.\n      </p>", "Background. The Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) is a comprehensive, compact health status classification and health state preference system. The HUI3 system has been included in 4 Canadian population health surveys and numerous clinical trials. Objectives. To evaluate the construct validity of the HUI3 for the measurement of health-related quality of life (HRQL) and attribute-specific morbidity in respondents to the 1990 Ontario Health Survey reported to have arthritis or stroke. The authors assessed (1) whether those with stroke, arthritis, and both conditions had lower HRQL scores than those with neither condition and (2) whether HUI3 detects morbidity in specific health attributes affected by arthritis and stroke. Stroke (but not arthritis) were expected to affect speech and cognition; arthritis (but not stroke) to affect pain; both to affect mobility, dexterity, and emotion; and neither to affect vision and hearing. Research Design. Linear regression models of HRQL and attribute-specific utilities were estimated as a function of 3 indicator variables of health problem (stroke only, arthritis only, both) and variables included to reduce confounding. Results. Subjects with stroke, arthritis, and both conditions had substantially lower HRQL than those with neither condition. Stroke subjects had greater morbidity in speech and cognition than arthritis subjects; somewhat surprisingly, pain morbidity was only slightly higher among arthritis subjects; neither condition affected vision or hearing. These associations were robust to various model specifications. Conclusions. The HUI3 system appears valid for measuring health status and HRQL for stroke and arthritis in the context of a noninstitutionalized population health survey.\n      </p>", "Immunization of mice with rat type II collagen (CII), a cartilage-specific protein, leads to development of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a model for rheumatoid arthritis. To define the interaction between the immune system and cartilage, we produced two sets of transgenic mice. In the first we point mutated the mouse CII gene to express an earlier defined T-cell epitope, CII-(256-270), present in rat CII. In the second we mutated the mouse type I collagen gene to express the same T-cell epitope. The mice with mutated type I collagen showed no T-cell reactivity to rat CII and were resistant to CIA. Thus, the CII-(256-270) epitope is immunodominant and critical for development of CIA. In contrast, the mice with mutated CII had an intact B-cell response and had T cells which could produce \u03b3 interferon, but not proliferate, in response to CII. They developed CIA, albeit with a reduced incidence. Thus, we conclude that T cells recognize CII derived from endogenous cartilage and are partially tolerized but may still be capable of mediating CIA.\n      </p>", "IL-23/IL-17-induced neutrophil recruitment plays a pivotal role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the mechanism of the neutrophil recruitment is obscure. Here we report that prostaglandin enhances the IL-23/IL-17-induced neutrophil migration in a murine model of RA by inhibiting IL-12 and IFN \u03b3 production. Methylated BSA (mBSA) and IL-23-induced neutrophil migration was inhibited by anti-IL-23 and anti-IL-17 antibodies, COX inhibitors, IL-12, or IFN\u03b3 but was enhanced by prostaglandin E\u2082 (PGE 2 ). IL-23-induced IL-17 production was increased by PGE\u2082 and suppressed by COXinhibition or IL-12. Furthermore, COX inhibition failed to reduce IL-23-induced neutrophil migration in IL-12-or IFN\u03b3 deficient mice. IL-17-induced neutrophil migration was not affected by COX inhibitors, IL-12, or IFNy but was inhibited by MK886 (a leukotriene synthesis inhibitor), anti-TNF\u03b1, anti-CXCL1, and anti-CXCL5 antibodies and by repertaxin (a CXCR1/2 antagonist). These treatments all inhibited mBSA-or IL-23-induced neutrophil migration. IL-17 induced neutrophil chemotaxis through a CXC chemokines-dependent pathway. Our results suggest that prostaglandin plays an important role in IL-23-induced neutrophil migration in arthritis by enhancing IL-17 synthesis and by inhibiting IL-12 and IFN\u03b3 production. We thus provide a mechanism for the pathogenic role of the IL-23/IL-17 axis in RA and also suggest an additional mechanism of action for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\n      </p>", "Objectives: Alternative definitions of arthritis in community surveys provide very different estimates of arthritis prevalence among older Americans. This telephone interview study examines prevalence estimates based on the current Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) arthritis case definition. Methods: Interviews were conducted with 851 Chicago residents age 45 and older. Logistic regression was used to compare the age and sex controlled prevalence of poor health, restricted activity, and arthritis risk factors among those with a previous arthritis diagnosis from a health professional, those with undiagnosed chronic joint symptoms, and those who were joint symptom free and without a previous arthritis diagnosis. Results: BRFSS-defined arthritis prevalence was 47% of older residents, including 33% reporting a previous arthritis diagnosis and 14% chronic undiagnosed joint symptoms. Only 25% of these respondents reported current arthritis treatment by a doctor. After controlling for age and sex, respondents with a previous arthritis diagnosis and those with undiagnosed chronic symptoms had significantly worse health and functioning, and more prevalent arthritis risk factors, than respondents without joint symptoms. Conclusions: BRFSS-defined arthritis included almost half the area population over age 45. Both diagnosed and undiagnosed chronic joint symptoms are associated with major functional limitations and arthritis risk after controlling for age and sex. The inclusion of previously undiagnosed chronic joint symptoms in the BRFSS arthritis definition is appropriate and indicates that previous arthritis prevalence estimates may be too low.\n      </p>", "Current status in quality of life and deterioration retrospectively attributed to the disease by patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were examined. The study group included 169 female and 53 male patients with probable (n = 70), definite (n = 127) and classical RA (n = 25). In a cross-sectional postal survey the participants self-rated their quality of life according to a generic self-assessment package tailored in part for this study. Shortened parallel ratings by significant others were also performed. The impact of RA on quality of life was pervasive. Heaviest intrusion emerged within the physical life sphere and the behavioural and activity domain, followed by the impact on global life satisfaction and habits. Material, psychological and social life domains were less disrupted. In spite of the pervasive discomfort attributed to the illness, quality of life status was mostly rated as being 'rather good' to 'good'. There was a consistent pattern: the better off currently, the less disturbance from the disease perceived. Higher age and longer duration of RA were significantly correlated to a lower status. In addition, individuals still working rated a higher quality of life and less intrusion of the disease. Self-ratings were corroborated by ratings of significant others. While there was an agreement on the level of the negative impact of the disease, the patients rated their current situation more positively than did significant others. The dual assessment of quality of life status and change appears reasonable and informative as regards rheumatoid arthritis.\n      </p>", "Navajo people frequently attribute occurrences of arthritis and rheumatism to inappropriate contact with menstruating women or menstrual blood. During ethnographic interviews about rules governing contact with various types of blood, Navajo consultants often explained these norms with allusions to key portions of the Navajo oral histories. The connections made by Navajo consultants in these contexts suggest that, like many other diseases, afflictions such as arthritis and rheumatism are metaphorically linked to ancestral impropriety or immorality. That is, particular actions on the part of ancestors of the Nihook\u00e1\u00e1 Dine'\u00e9 (Earth Surface People) are referenced as the precedent for considering certain types of menstrual and game animal blood dangerous to the health and well-being of contemporary Navajo people. In exploring the means by which these types of blood have come to carry such significance in the Navajo world, I contribute to disciplinary concerns about more effective ways to study so-called menstrual taboos and demonstrate how language, bodily substances, bodily ills, human agency, and ancestral actions intertwine.\n      </p>", "Objective: We evaluated differences in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for African Americans and Caucasians with self-reported arthritis residing in rural and urban areas of a southern state. Methods: 1,191 individuales completed a telephone survey, which included the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12). Participants were stratified into groups: African American/rural, Caucasian/rural, African American/urban, and Caucasian/urban. We evaluated differences and associations in HRQoL for the four groups. Results: Multivariable linear regression models revealed that being an African American rural resident was associated with worse self-reported mental health on the SF-12 even after adjusting for multiple confounding variables. In contrast, multivariable linear regression models revealed that being a Caucasian rural resident was associated with worse physical health SF-12 scores. Conclusions: The study revealed differences in HRQoL on the mental and physical health functioning scales of the SF-12 for African American rural and Caucasian rural residents. Researchers assessing HRQoL in arthritis patients should consider using a race/residence product term in their analyses.\n      </p>", "Objectives. Many reports indicate that patients with combined chronic illness and depressive symptomatology have more disability than those with illness alone, which may influence physician visits. Studies suggest that these combined conditions are unevenly accommodated by the delivery system and nonpsychiatric physicians often fail to recognize or treat these symptoms. To address this need, this study aimed to provide further information on combined conditions and report on relations found among arthritis disease symptoms, depression, and disability. Methods. The data was derived from a series of statewide surveys assessing the influence of psychosocial factors on disease course and treatment in a community sample of 277 patients under the care of a rheumatologist. A multivariate model was developed to assess these interrelationships, using measures of symptom severity, depression (CESD), disability (activities of daily living, days of restrictive activities, days in bed), service utilizations, and a few personal and health variables. Results. Even after removing somatic items from the CESD to reduce the risk of inflation due to physical disease, evidence was found for additive impact of depression on one measure of disability, days of restrictive activities. Patients with comorbid conditions also were a high-service utilization group. Very few patients reported receiving help in dealing with emotional problems, suggesting presence of substantial unmet need. Conclusions. Nonpsychiatric physicians need to be aware of the mental health status of chronically ill patients. Although the association between medication use and depression suggests some awareness of the need to treat depression, especially in physically compromised patients, there may be some need to dispense psychological and psychosocial support to those in need.\n      </p>", "Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease that affects approximately 1% of the adult population, and to date, genetic factors explain &lt; 50% of the risk. Particulate air pollution, especially of traffic origin, has been linked to systemic inflammation in many studies. Objectives: We examined the association of distance to road, a marker of traffic pollution exposure, and incidence of RA in a prospective cohort study. Methods: We studied 90,297 U.S. women in the Nurses' Health Study. We used a geographic information system to determine distance to road at the residence in 2000 as a measure of traffic exposure. Using Cox proportional hazard models, we examined the association of distance to road and incident RA (1976-2004) with adjustment for a large number of potential confounders. Results: In models adjusted for age, calendar year, race, cigarette smoking, parity, lactation, menopausal status and hormone use, oral contraceptive use, body mass index, physical activity, and census-tract-level median income and house value, we observed an elevated risk of RA [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.31; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.98-1.74] in women living within 50 m of a road, compared with those women living 200 m or farther away. We also observed this association in analyses among nonsmokers (HR = 1.62; 95% CI, 1.04-2.52), nonsmokers with rheumatoid factor (RF)-negative RA (HR = 1.77; 95% CI, 0.93-3.38), and nonsmokers with RF-positive RA (HR = 1.51; 95% CI, 0.82-2.77). We saw no elevations in risk in women living 50-200 m from the road. Conclusions: The observed association between exposure to traffic pollution and RA suggests that pollution from traffic in adulthood may be a newly identified environmental risk factor for RA.\n      </p>", "Objective. The authors compared outcomes among persons with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with a rheumatologist versus a non-rheumatologist as the main physician for this condition. Methods. A cohort of 1,025 persons with rheumatoid arthritis were followed for as long as 11 years. The principal measures were obtained from an annual structured telephone interview conducted by a trained survey worker. All persons with rheumatoid arthritis originally were selected from a random sample of community rheumatologists, but some subsequently had migrated to the practices of non-rheumatologists. The main outcome measures included the number of painful and swollen joints, extent of morning stiffness, a global pain rating, functional status, and a measure of global improvement. Results. The persons with rheumatoid arthritis treated by rheumatologists reported significantly better functional status, fewer painful joints, and a lower overall pain rating, although the magnitude of these differences was small. A significantly greater proportion of the persons with rheumatoid arthritis treated by rheumatologists also reported improvement in a global measure of rheumatoid arthritis outcome and simultaneous improvement in all outcome measures. On all other outcome measures, the point estimate favored those with a rheumatologist as the main rheumatoid arthritis physician, although the differences did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions. The evidence suggests an advantage for persons with a rheumatologist as the main rheumatoid arthritis physician, but on several of the measures of outcome, the magnitude of the advantage was small. Because the present study was an observational design, the possibility that the advantage among persons with a rheumatologist as the main rheumatoid arthritis physician is an artifact of selection bias cannot be ruled out.\n      </p>", "Discharge diagnoses following hospital admissions in Denmark are recorded in the Danish National Patient Registry (NPR). Such routine hospitalization records may serve as useful research tools in epidemiological studies. The aim of the study was to provide measures of the validity and completeness of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diagnoses recorded in the NPR. We identified medical records for 217 patients recorded as having RA in the NPR between 1977 and 2001. Using two definitions of RA (clinically confirmed RA and fulfilment of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1987 diagnostic criteria for RA), a rheumatologist assessed the proportion of RA diagnoses recorded in the NPR that could be confirmed by scrutiny of the original medical records. The completeness of RA diagnoses in the NPR was estimated by a two-sample capture-recapture method. Overall, 59% of the 217 RA diagnoses in the NPR were confirmed by information in the medical records. However, major differences were seen according to characteristics of the underlying hospital registrations. Generally, RA diagnoses were most often confirmed for patients registered as inpatients and for patients with more than one hospital registration with RA. Specifically, only 42% of patients with one RA registration from a rheumatology department were confirmed as having RA. In contrast, 91% of patients treated at a rheumatology department and having three or more hospital registrations with RA were confirmed as having RA. The completeness of the NPR with respect to RA satisfying the ACR 1987 classification criteria was estimated to 26%. Our conclusion is that with careful attention to the limitations in the data, discharge diagnoses for patients with records of RA in the Danish NPR can be used for epidemiological research purposes; however, our findings prompt general carefulness when using non-audited registries for research in RA.\n      </p>", "The sternoclavicular joint can be involved in ankylosing spondylitis as well as in rheumatoid and degenerative arthritis. Septic arthritis of this joint is infrequently seen, and the diagnosis of this infection can be missed until it presents with a complication. We describe a patient with bacteremia whose presentation of bilateral sternoclavicular joint septic arthritis was multiple cutaneous abscesses on her chest wall.\n      </p>", "Prostaglandin (PG)E2 is a potent mediator of pain and inflammation, and high levels of this lipid mediator are observed in numerous disease states. The inhibition of PGE2 production to control pain and to treat diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis to date has depended on nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents such as aspirin. However, these agents inhibit the synthesis of all prostanoids. To produce biologically active PGE2, PGE synthases catalyze the isomerization of PGH2 into PGE2. Recently, several PGE synthases have been identified and cloned, but their role in inflammation is not clear. To study the physiological role of the individual PGE synthases, we have generated by targeted homologous recombination a mouse line deficient in microsomal PGE synthase 1 (mPGES1) on the inbred DBA/1lacJ background. mPGES1-deficient (mPGES1-/-) mice are viable and fertile and develop normally compared with wild-type controls. However, mPGES1-/- mice displayed a marked reduction in inflammatory responses compared with mPGES1+/+ mice in multiple assays. Here, we identify mPGES1 as the PGE synthase that contributes to the pathogenesis of collagen-induced arthritis, a disease model of human rheumatoid arthritis. We also show that mPGES1 is responsible for the production of PGE2 that mediates acute pain during an inflammatory response. These findings suggest that mPGES1 provides a target for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and pain associated with inflammatory states.\n      </p>", "Some researchers have hypothesized that omega-3 fatty acids, found primarily in fish oils, may protect against the development of rheumatoid arthritis. We conducted a population-based case-control study in women, comparing 324 incident rheumatoid arthritis cases with 1,245 controls. We used a food frequency questionnaire to ascertain diet during a 1-year period 5 years before a reference date (first physician visit for joint symptoms). Consumption of broiled or baked fish, but not of other types of fish, was associated with a decreased risk of rheumatoid arthritis. The adjusted odds ratios (OR) for 1-&lt;2 servings and \u22652 servings of broiled or baked fish per week, compared with &lt;1 serving, were 0.78 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.53-1.14] and 0.57 (95% CI = 0.35-0.93). Other analyses showed associations with protein as a percentage of calories (adjusted OR for the top quartile as compared with the bottom quartile = 0.65; 95% CI = 0.46-0.94) and total calories (adjusted OR for the top quartile = 1.62; 95% CI = 1.15-2.28). The associations with broiled or baked fish, protein, and calories became stronger when we restricted our analysis to cases positive for rheumatoid factor. These results support the hypothesis that omega-3 fatty acids may help prevent rheumatoid arthritis.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis were examined in a cohort of 121,700 female nurses aged 30\u201355, followed in the Nurses' Health Study. Baseline information on reproductive variables, cigarette smoking, obesity, and other variables was obtained in 1976 and updated every 2 years. Cases of rheumatoid arthritis were defined by standardized questionnaire and review of medical records. During 883,187 person-years of follow-up, 217 new cases of rheumatoid arthritis were identified (115 had definite rheumatoid arthritis and 102 had \"undifferentiated polyarthritis\"). When compared with women who experienced menarche at age 13 years, the age-adjusted relative risk of rheumatoid arthritis among women with early menarche was 1.9 (95% confidence interval, 0.9\u20132.4). There were, however, no significant associations between parity, age at birth of the first child, menopause, or obesity and the incidence of rheumatoid arthritis. Cigarette smokers had a slight apparent increase in the risk of rheumatoid arthritis. Among current smokers, the age-adjusted relative risk for RA rheumatoid arthritis was 1.3 (0.9\u20132.1); among former smokers, the relative risk was 1.5 (0.9\u20132.3).\n      </p>", "Objective: To estimate the impact of arthritis using a general health index and National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data. Methods: Morbidity data came from NHIS Public Use data, from the years 1986-1988 and 1994. The data are 423 400 cases, representing 975 421 153 person-years. Quality of Well-being Scale (QWB) morbidity scores were imputed from NHIS questions about health conditions and limitations in functioning. Both the QWB and multiple linear regression were used to estimate the effects of arthritis with and without adjustments for co-morbidity. Mortality data for NHIS-sampled adults were drawn from the National Death Index by staff of the National Center for Health Statistics. Results: The mean QWB for those with self-reported arthritis was 0.608 on a scale ranging from 0.0 (for death) to 1.0 (for fully functional without symptoms or problems). This observed mean for arthritis is 39.2% below the 1.000 comparison standard. QWB morbidity scores for self-reported arthritis appear (0.701 - 0.608=) 9.3% more severe than mean effects of all other health conditions. Mortality adds an average 13.8% to the morbidity burden. Persons with arthritis constitute 4.7% of the population, but account for 9.6% of Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) lost to morbidity. Conclusions: Self-reported arthritis is associated with very significant losses in Quality-Adjusted Life in the US population.\n      </p>", "Objective. The SF-36 Arthritis-Specific Health Index (ASHI) was constructed to improve the responsiveness of the SF-36 Health Survey to changes in the severity of arthritis through the use of arthritis-specific scoring algorithms. This study compared the responsiveness of the ASHI and other generic scales and summary measures scored from the SF-36 in clinical trials of health outcomes for patients with arthritis. Methods. Longitudinal data for patients (n = 835) participating in four placebo-controlled trials were analyzed. Study participants had at least a 6-month history of moderate to severe osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis of the knee or hip. All had undergone a washout period of 3 to 14 days before baseline assessment to bring about a flare state in osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis symptoms. Their average age was 60 years, and 72% were female. Responders and nonresponders were classified on the basis of physician assessments of changes in arthritis severity, with blinding as to treatment group; treated and untreated (placebo) groups were also compared. For the SF-36 ASHI, generic physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) component summary measures and each of eight subscales scored from the SF-36 (acute version) change scores were computed by subtracting scores before treatment from scores at 2-week follow-up. To evaluate empirical validity, analyses of variance were performed. For each measure, an F-ratio was computed for the comparison between clinically defined groups of responders and nonresponders and between groups of patients assigned to placebo versus drug therapy. Relative validity (RV) coefficients were computed for the ASHI in comparison with PCS, MCS, and the best SF-36 scale to determine which was more responsive. Results. In analyses of each of the four trials and all trials combined, RV coefficients for the ASHI were higher than those for both of the generic SF-36 summary measures and for the most valid SF-36 scale (Bodily Pain), with only one exception. Across 40 tests of validity in distinguishing treated from untreated patients, the ASHI was 5% to 19% more valid than the best SF-36 scale (RV = 1.05-1.19; RV = 1.10 in all trials combined). The generic summary measures (PCS and MCS) were much less valid in these tests (RV = 0.67 and 0.27, respectively). In analyses of responders and nonresponders, RV coefficients for the ASHI ranged from 0.70 to 1.22 (RV = 1.04 in all trials combined), in comparison with the best SF-36 subscale, which was always Bodily Pain. RV coefficients were lower for PCS (RV = 0.75) and much lower than the MCS (RV = 0.18) in comparisons of treatment outcomes based on all trials combined. Conclusion. The ASHI appears to be more valid than the eight SF-36 scales and PCS and MCS summary measures for purposes of distinguishing between treated and untreated patients and between clinical responders and nonresponders. This study demonstrates the feasibility of improving the validity of the SF-36 through the use of arthritis-specific scoring while retaining the option of generic scoring, which makes it possible to also compare results across diseases and treatments.\n      </p>", "Noting the common occurrence of arthritis in contemporary elephants, a skeletal study was undertaken to assess the frequency and nature of the affliction. Spondyloarthropathy was unequivocally diagnosed in mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius) and contemporary elephants on the basis of fusion of vertebral bodies with marginal syndesmophytes, zygoapophyseal joint fusion, and peripheral erosive arthritis and fusion and was easily distinguished from infectious spondylitis and diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis. Vertebral involvement was limited in distribution, in a pattern characteristic of human psoriatic arthritis and Reiter's syndrome, also referred to as reactive arthritis. Infectious diarrhea or sexually transmitted reactive arthritis are the most likely candidates for this phenomenon, as recognized in elephants and mammoths, which affords a unique opportunity for therapeutic intervention.\n      </p>", "The Quality of Well-being (QWB) Scale combines preference-weighted measures of symptoms and functioning to provide a numerical point in-time expression of well-being that ranges from zero (0) for death to 1.0 for asymptomatic optimum functioning. The QWB includes three scales of function: mobility, physical activity, and social activity. Each step of these scales is associated with preference weights. Preference adjustments for symptoms are also included. This paper describes how this general system was used to evaluate outcomes in three different clinical conditions: acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), cystic fibrosis, and arthritis. In one study, the QWB was administered to 31 patients participating in evaluation of azidothymidine (AZT) treatment for AIDS. The QWB system demonstrated substantial benefits of AZT treatment in comparison to placebo. In a second study, the QWB and a series of pulmonary function measures were administered to 44 patients with cystic fibrosis. The QWB was demonstrated to be significantly correlated with measures of pulmonary function, including FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and maximal midexpiratory flow rate (MMEFR). In addition, there were significant associations between the QWB and measures of exercise tolerance. In the third study, the QWB and an arthritis-specific measure were administered to 83 arthritis patients before and after their treatment. The QWB was at least as capable of detecting clinical change in this population as was the disease-specific measure. For all three conditions, the QWB considered side effects and benefits of treatment in a common unit. Clinical trial data are cited to suggest that the QWB is a valuable outcome measure in arthritis treatment evaluation. We conclude that the QWB has substantial validity as a general health outcome measure and that the system can be used with different populations.\n      </p>", "The relationships between two personality characteristics (neuroticism, extraversion), three types of supportive transactions (emotional support, social companionship, instrumental support) and satisfaction with these transactions, and two aspects of mental health (feelings of anxiety and depressive mood) were studied among 280 patients with early rheumatoid arthritis. Structural equation modeling of the relevant variables showed that people with a more neurotic personality profile showed more anxiety and depressed feelings. Extraversion had no direct effect on depression or anxiety. Companionship, both transactions and satisfaction, had an independent positive effect on depression but not on anxiety. The effect of emotional support ran via social companionship: more emotional support (both transactions and satisfaction) was expressed in companionship leading to a less depressed mood. Finally, more depressed people received more instrumental supportive transactions while more satisfaction with this type of supportive transactions was related to less anxiety. Apart from the disturbing effect of a neurotic personality profile on mental health, the results once more underscore the importance of social companionship as a multifunctional activity for people's mental health. Maintaining this type of relationships despite a disabling condition gives people the opportunity to derive rewards that otherwise could not or only with more difficulty be achieved.\n      </p>", "Fifteen newborn Saanen goats were orally infected with a biologically cloned isolate of caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV-63). At 33.5 months after infection, 8 of 12 seropositive goats had CAEV-63-specific neutralizing antibody. Five neutralization-positive goats developed clinically apparent arthritis of carpal joints, three of which had periarticular swelling indicating severe synovitis. Arthritis was not evident in age-matched controls or infected goats without neutralizing antibody. Multiple viral isolates were obtained from synovial fluid or synovial fluid cells of arthritic joints between 36.4 and 44.9 months after infection, and successive isolates from individual joints were defined as antigenic variants expressing type-specific neutralization epitopes. Thus, the evolution of neutralizing antibody does not arrest viral replication or development of progressive inflammatory lesions. Rather, some antigenic variants produced in the presence of neutralizing antibody are clonally expanded within carpal joints, and severe joint inflammation is specifically associated with these variants.\n      </p>", "Borrelia burgdorferi-induced disease susceptibility was explored in disease-resistant C57/BL6 (B6) and -susceptible C3H7He (C3H) mice with and without the beige (bg) mutation, which is associated with granulocyte and NK cell dysfunction. Both B6 and C3H mice had more prevalent and severe arthritis than their congenic partners, and B6-bg mice developed arthritis equal in severity to that in C3H mice. Spirochetes were visualized in joint tissue of B6-bg mice but not B6 mice. No differences in spirochete isolation from tissues or immunoglobulin titers to B. burgdorferi were noted between groups. Depletion of granulocytes with cyclophosphamide and macrophages with silica in B6 and C3H mice modified arthritis susceptibility, but depletion of NK cells by serotherapy in B6 mice had no effect on disease. This study demonstrates that innate genetic resistance to Lyme arthritis in mice can be overcome by a single gene mutation, which is probably mediated through granulocyte function.\n      </p>", "Eighty blood cultures were made from twenty patients with chronic infectious arthritis. Three different methods of cultivation were used; one of them was that published by Cecil, Nicholls and Stainsby. Streptococci were not found in any culture. Thus we have been unable to confirm the results of these authors. A survey of previous studies has been made (table 1). Some reports are not included in the table, as the diagnoses of septic arthritis, acute rheumatism and acute polyarthritis with endocarditis seemed to indicate the presence of rheumatic fever or of other forms of arthritis that could not be classified as chronic or acute nonspecific infectious arthritis. Figures sufficiently exact for a brief statistical analysis are given in 780 cases, including the present series. Blood cultures were sterile in 578 cases (74 per cent). Various organisms were isolated in 202 cases (26 per cent). Streptococci of various types were isolated in 144 cases (18 per cent). Organisms other than streptococci were found in the remaining 58 cases (8 per cent). The percentage of positive cultures obtained by different workers varies tremendously. Blood cultures made by some investigators were uniformly negative, whereas others found a high percentage of cultures positive. We will not review the contentions regarding the significance of such differences. Some view the positive data with great suspicion and consider not only the staphylococci and diphtheroid organisms obtained as contaminations, but also the streptococci. Others, for example, Kracke and Teasley, have expressed the belief that failure to obtain positive cultures is due to a failure to destroy the bactericidal action of the complement in the patient's blood. The investigators named have just reported \"most striking results in chronic infectious arthritis\"; the details were unpublished at the time this paper was written. We do not consider the results in our series or in the cases covered by our survey as conclusive arguments for or against the theory that the type of chronic arthritis studied is infectious in origin. Although we are inclined to accept the theory that infection is of significance, it is apparent that, with present cultural methods, it is extremely difficult to isolate organisms from the blood of patients suffering from the condition studied, with any uniformity or with any great frequency.\n      </p>", "A conditionally Markov multiplicative intensity model is described for the analysis of clustered progressive multistate processes under intermittent observation. The model is motivated by a long-term prospective study of patients with psoriatic arthritis with the aim of characterizing progression of joint damage via an irreversible four-state model. The model accommodates heterogeneity in transition rates between different individuals and correlation in transition rates within patients. To do this we introduce subject-specific multivariate random effects in which each component acts multiplicatively on a specific transition intensity. Through the association between the components of the random effect, correlations in transition intensities are accommodated. A Monte Carlo EM algorithm is developed for estimation, which features closed form expressions for estimators at each M-step.\n      </p>", "We have disabled TNF receptor (TNFR) function by inducing allosteric modulation of tryptophan-107 (W107) in the receptor. The allosteric effect operates by means of an allosteric cavity found a short distance from a previously identified loop involved in ligand binding. Occupying this cavity by small molecules leads to perturbation of distal W107 and disables functions of the TNFR, a molecule not known to undergo conformational change upon binding TNF-\u03b1. TNF-\u03b1-induced NF-\u03baB and p38 kinase activities and clinical symptoms of collagen-induced arthritis in mice were all diminished. Thus, disabling receptor function by induced conformational changes of active binding surfaces represents an innovative paradigm in structure-based drug design.\n      </p>", "The development and persistence of Salmonella-specific serum antibodies of different immunoglobulin classes and subclasses were compared between those who developed reactive arthritis (n = 39) and those who did not (n = 58) after Salmonella infection. Antibodies against lipopolysaccharide and SDS-extract antigen were measured by ELISA. A significant difference was seen between the two patient groups after 4-14 months of follow-up; those with reactive arthritis had higher levels of Salmonella-specific IgM, IgG, and IgA class antibodies than those without arthritis. In the increased antibody response, secretory IgA, IgA1, and IgG2 classes were especially well represented. The persisting antibody response is a common feature in reactive arthritis and supports persistence of the pathogen or its components in the host. The differences observed in antibody profiles between Salmonellaand Fm/w'a-triggered reactive arthritides suggest certain dissimilarities (e.g., in the location of persisting microbes) in the arthritogenic process due to these two microbes.\n      </p>", "Study objective: To assess the association between physical activity and health related quality of life (HRQOL) among persons with arthritis or chronic joint symptoms (CJS). Design: Cross sectional survey investigating the relation between physical activity level and HRQOL. HRQOL was estimated using the number of physically or mentally unhealthy days during the past 30 days. Physical activity was categorised as recommended, insufficient, or inactive according to federal activity recommendations. Persons with arthritis were defined as those with either self reported CJS or doctor diagnosed arthritis. Setting: Community dwelling, US adults residing in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Participants: Respondents (n = 212 000) in the 2001 behavioral risk factor surveillance system (BRFSS), an annual population based, telephone survey. Main results: The 33% of BRFSS respondents with arthritis had a mean of 6.7 physically and 4.9 mentally unhealthy days during the past 30 days, compared with 1.8 and 2.7 among those without arthritis. Inactive men and women were 1.2-2.4 times more likely to report impaired HRQOL compared with those who met physical activity recommendations. Men and women who engage in insufficient physical activity also report variably reduced HRQOL. Conclusions: Among people with arthritis, recommended levels of physical activity were associated with fewer mean physically and mentally unhealthy days and a decreased probability of having severely impaired physical or mental HRQOL.\n      </p>", "Since 1963, evidence has accumulated that suggests boron is a safe and effective treatment for some forms of arthritis. The initial evidence was that boron supplementation alleviated arthritic pain and discomfort of the author. This was followed by findings from numerous other observations epidemiologic and controlled animal and human experiments. These findings included a) analytical evidence of lower boron concentrations in femur heads, bones, and synovial fluid from people with arthritis than from those without this disorder; b) observation evidence that bones of patients using boron supplements are much harder to cut than those of patients not using supplements; c) epidemiologic evidence that in areas of the world where boron intakes usually are 1.0 mg or less/day the estimated incidence of arthritis ranges from 20 to 70%, whereas in areas of the world where boron intakes are usually 3 to 10 mg, the estimated incidence of arthritis ranges from 0 to 10%; d) experimental evidence that rats with induced arthritis benefit from orally or intraperitoneally administered boron; e) experimental evidence from a double-blind placebo-boron supplementation trial with 20 subjects with osteoarthritis. A significant favorable response to a 6 mg boron/day supplement was obtained; 50% of subjects receiving the supplement improved compared to only 10% receiving the placebo. The preceding data indicate that boron is an essential nutrient for healthy bones and joints, and that further research into the use of boron for the treatment or prevention of arthritis is warranted.\n      </p>", "Objective To evaluate clinical effectiveness of a self management programme for arthritis in patients in primary care with osteoarthritis. Design Randomised controlled trial. Setting 74 general practices in the United Kingdom. Participants 812 patients aged 50 and over with osteoarthritis of hips or knees (or both) and pain or disability (or both). Intervention Participants were randomised to six sessions of self management of arthritis and an education booklet (intervention group) or the education booklet alone (control group). Main outcome measures Primary outcome was quality of life, as assessed by the short form health survey (SF-36). Several other physical and psychosocial secondary outcomes were assessed. Data were collected at baseline, four months, and 12 months. Results Response rates were 80% and 76% at four and 12 months. The two groups showed significant differences at 12 months on the anxiety subscore of the hospital anxiety and depression scale (mean difference -0.62, 95% confidence interval -1.08 to -0.16), arthritis self efficacy scale for pain (0.98, 0.07 to 1.89), and self efficacy for other aspects of management (1.58, 0.25 to 2.90). Results were similar for intention to treat and per protocol analyses. No significant difference was seen in number of visits to the general practitioner at 12 months. Conclusions The self management of arthritis programme reduced anxiety and improved participants' perceived self efficacy to manage symptoms, but it had no significant effect on pain, physical functioning, or contact with primary care. Trial registration Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN79115352.\n      </p>", "Background: Data suggest that differences in patient preferences may account for racial disparities in the use of medical interventions. Racial disparities have also been noted in outcomes and the delivery of healthcare services in chronic disease. Whether treatment preferences in chronic disease differ by race is not known. Methods: We elicited treatment preferences for aggressive therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who identified themselves as being black or white. Results: One hundred fifty consecutive eligible patients were invited to participate. Of these, 136 subjects completed the interview. In unadjusted analysis, 51% of white participants preferred aggressive therapy compared with 16% of blacks (P &lt; 0.0001). Subjects who were married and reported having at least some college education had stronger preferences for aggressive therapy compared with their respective counterparts. After adjusting for covariates, race remained the strongest predictor of aggressive therapy examined in this study [adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 11.2(1.9-64.9)]. Conclusions: In this study, fewer black patients preferred aggressive treatment compared with white patients with similar disease severity. These results have important clinical implications because use of aggressive treatment improves both short- and long-term outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis. Efforts to improve patient education and physician communication should be made to ensure that all patients have an accurate understanding of the benefits, as well as risks, associated with the best available treatment options.\n      </p>", "Objectives The aim of the present study was to evaluate possible occupational determinants for rheumatoid arthritis according to lifetime occupational history. Methods The cases were identified retrospectively from 1980 to 1995 at the University Hospital in Link\u00f6ping, Sweden. The study comprised 422 cases and 859 randomly selected referents. Exposure data were collected through a postal questionnaire. Results For men, occupations with increased, although nonsignificant, odds ratios (OR) were farmers or farm workers [OR 1.8, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.0\u20143.5], textile workers (OR 2.0, 95% CI 0.3\u201416.2), asphalters (OR 14.0, 95% CI 1.2\u2014799.0 without latency requirement), and employees at service stations (OR 2.2, 95% CI 0.5\u20149.5). Among the women, hairdressers and beauticians (OR 2.7,95% CI 0.8\u20148.6) had an increased risk for rheumatoid arthritis, as well as those exposed to hairdressing chemicals (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.0\u20149.4) and meat products (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.0\u20144.0). Conclusions Several of the findings in this study are in accordance with those of previous studies. The increased risks of rheumatoid arthritis for asphalters and employees at service stations are however new associations previously not described in the literature.\n      </p>", "Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by destruction of cartilage and bone that is mediated by synovial fibroblasts. To determine the mechanisms by which these cells are activated to produce matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), the effects of microparticles were investigated. Microparticles are small membrane-bound vesicles whose release from immune cells is increased during activation and apoptosis. Because microparticles occur abundantly in the synovial fluid in rheumatoid arthritis, they could represent novel stimulatory agents. Microparticles derived from T cells and monocytes strongly induced the synthesis of MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-13 in fibroblasts. The induction was time-dependent, with effects primarily observed after 36 h; under these conditions, MMP-2, MMP-14, and tissue inhibitor of MMP-1 (TIMP-1), TIMP-2, and TIMP-3 were not induced. Microparticles also increased the synthesis of inflammatory mediators including IL-6, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), and MCP-2. In I\u03ba-B-transfected synovial fibroblasts, MMPs were less inducible by microparticles compared with wild-type fibroblasts. Blocking of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 with antibodies against TNF\u03b1 and with IL-1 receptor antagonist did not abrogate stimulation by microparticles. These data provide evidence for a novel mechanism by which vesicles derived from activated or apoptotic immune cells can promote the destructive activity of synovial fibroblasts in rheumatoid arthritis.\n      </p>", "This study investigated the cost-effectiveness of leflunomide (LEF) compared to methotrexate (MTX) and sulfasalazine (SSZ) in the United Kingdom. A Markov model was constructed using health states defined by Health Assessment Questionnaire score. The model is based on a cohort of patients with recently diagnosed definite RA who were followed for up to 15 years at nine rheumatology clinics in the UK. The treatment effect was calculated based on clinical trials comparing LEF to MTX (one international and one United States trial) and to SSZ (one international trial). Transitions between health states for the first 2 years of treatment were calculated from the clinical trials, while the extrapolation beyond the trial was based on the Early Rheumatoid Arthritis Study cohort, using an ordered probit model. This makes it possible to predict transitions for patients with similar characteristics (age, time since disease onset) as in the trials. Separate analyses were performed for each trial, and all analyses covered a 10-year timeframe. Using the US trial, LEF had slightly lower costs and better effects (\u00a344,017 and 4.307 QALYs, compared to \u00a344,988 and 4.158 QALYs for MTX), while for the international trial this was reversed (\u00a334,070 and 4.487 QALYs for MTX compared to \u00a336,351 and 4.372 QALYs for LEF). Compared to SSZ, the cost of using LEF was slightly lower, with an increase in QALYs (\u00a335,855 and 3.896 QALYs compared to \u00a336,731 and 3.721 QALYs for SSZ). The two trials comparing LEF to MTX gave differing results. One possible reason for this is that MTX patients in the US trial were given folic acid, whereas in the international trial folate supplementation was not mandated. This may have reduced the effectiveness of MTX. In the UK it is standard practice to use folic acid with MTX, and therefore the results from the US trial may be more relevant for the UK. Compared to SSZ, the use of LEF appears to be cost-effective in the UK.\n      </p>", "Objectives: To determine how health related quality of life (HRQL) is perceived by patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and chronic low back pain (CLBP) using a textual analysis approach. Patients: Two-hundred and forty-eight outpatients (85% female), mean age 58 \u00b1 13 years (40% RA and 60% CLBP). Methods: Observational descriptive study. Sociodemographic and clinical variables were determined. A questionnaire was designed which included an open question \"What does health related quality of life mean to you.\" which patients answered in writing. Textual data analysis was performed using a previous described method based on multivariate descriptive statistical methods. Results: The two groups were homogenous with respect to gender, educational level, disease duration, comorbid conditions and global functional status. Patients with RA and CLBP used clearly differentiated terms to describe HRQL (RA: to be able (capable), house; CLBP: life, health, quality). RA patients were specific and primarily concerned with functional status and CLBP patients with health and life. The most characteristic phrase used by RA patients was: \"to be able to do housework\" and for CLBP: \"health is the most important thing for quality of life.\" In the factorial representation, the two pathologies were markedly separated. Conclusions: A series of characteristic answers on HRQL may be identified in patients with RA and CLBP, showing that they have different perceptions about what HRQL is according to their pathology. The use of open questions in a group of homogenous patients with specific pathologies could result in more disease-specific responses. Textual statistical analysis of open questions may provide more information than standard methods, and may be considered as valid for the analysis of subjective issues such as quality of life.\n      </p>", "The aim of this study was to increase understanding of the domains of life that are important to Swedish women with chronic rheumatic disease and to describe their dissatisfaction with these domains. Fifty women with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and 50 with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) were interviewed by telephone regarding their quality of life using five open-ended questions. Content analysis of their responses revealed nine categories: Health/wellness, Family/friends, Work, House/home/living environment, Social support/functional services, Hobbies/cultural activities, Sufficient income, Independence, Integrity/identity. Areas of importance correspond closely to those areas with which they were most dissatisfied. Although the domains identified in both groups were the same, SLE patients expressed more dissatisfaction with their perceived control over their bodies and understanding about their condition on the part of physicians and people in general. RA patients were more dissatisfied with areas of their lives that threatened their independence. Health care providers should be aware of these areas of dissatisfaction so that they can plan strategies to maximize patient quality of life.\n      </p>", "Purpose Comparative evidence regarding the responsiveness of the EQ-5D and SF-6D in arthritis patients is conflicting and insufficient across the range of disease severity. We examined the comparative responsiveness of the EQ-5D and SF-6D in cohorts of patients with early inflammatory disease through to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods Responsiveness was tested using the effect size (ES) and standardised response mean (SRM). Correlation of change in EQ-5D and SF-6D with disease specific measures was tested using Pearson correlations and the Steiger's Z test. Treatment response and self-reported change were used as anchors of important change.Results The EQ-5D was more responsive to deterioration (ES ratio (EQ-5D/SF-6D): 1.6-3.0) and the SF-6D more responsive to improvement (ES ratio (SF-6D/EQ-5D): 1.1-1.8) in health. The SF-6D did not respond well to deterioration in patients with established severe RA (ES and SRM 0.08). The EQ-5D provided larger absolute mean change estimates but with greater variance compared to the SF-6D. Conclusions The comparative responsiveness of the EQ-5D and SF-6D differs according to the direction of change. The level of mean change of the EQ-5D relative to the SF-6D has implications for cost-effectiveness analysis. Use of the SF-6D in patients with severe progressive disease may be inappropriate.\n      </p>", "Rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis are often difficult to differentiate, though it is important to do so as the natural history and treatment of the two conditions differ. Nine patients have recently been seen, each of whom fulfilled the criteria for both rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. In eight of the nine patients the histocompatibility antigen HLA-27 was present. A possible explanation of these cases is that one of the diseases occurred by chance in patients already suffering from the other, but this is extremely unlikely. If a chance association is not the correct explanation the basic concepts defining rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis must be reconsidered.\n      </p>", "The aim of this 12-month prospective study was to compare reports describing the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of children with Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) obtained from parents and children, to investigate the extent to which the children's HRQL changed over a 12-month period, and to describe the relationship between children's HRQL, and their experience of pain and use of pain coping strategies. Fifty-four children aged 8-18 years with JIA and their parents completed standard questionnaires assessing children's HRQL, pain intensity, and pain coping strategies at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. In general, children reported that their HRQL was better than was reported by parents. Both informants described children's HRQL as being very stable over the 12 months of the study. Consistent with the Biobehavioural Model of Pain, there was a significant negative relationship between children's HRQL and their experience of pain. However, there was little evidence that pain coping strategies mediated the relationship between children's experience of pain and their HRQL.\n      </p>", "A major immunoregulatory mechanism in inflammatory infections and allergic diseases is the control of the balance of cytokines secreted by Th1/Th2 subsets of T helper (Th) cells. This might also be true in autoimmune diseases; a Th2 pattern that prevents an effective immune response in infections with intracellular bacteria may favor immunosuppression in autoimmune diseases. The pattern of cytokine expression was compared in the synovial tissue from patients with a typical autoimmune disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and with a disorder with similar synovial pathology but driven by persisting exogenous antigen, reactive arthritis. We screened 12 rheumatoid and 9 reactive arthritis synovial tissues by PCR and in situ hybridization for their expression of T-cell cytokines. The cytokine pattern differs significantly between the two diseases; rheumatoid arthritis samples express a Th1-like pattern whereas in reactive arthritis interferon \u03b3 expression is accompanied by that of interleukin 4. Studying the expression of cytokines by in situ hybridization confirmed the results found by PCR; they also show an extremely low frequency of cytokine-transcribing cells. In a double-staining experiment, it was demonstrated that interleukin 4 is made by CD4 cells. These experiments favor the possibility of therapeutic intervention in inflammatory rheumatic diseases by means of inhibitory cytokines.\n      </p>", "Examination of 400 Saxon, Romano-British, and mediaeval skeletons from seven archaeological excavations in the west of England showed an unexpectedly high incidence of osteoarthritis and osteophytosis. Three skeletons had evidence of an erosive peripheral arthritis\u2014one with probable gout, one probable psoriatic arthropathy, and one with possible rheumatoid arthritis. The pattern and types of rheumatic disease, and the resultant disability, were apparently different. An exuberant form of large joint osteoarthritis was common and rheumatoid arthritis and similar diseases rare.\n      </p>", "Background: Nearly 18 million Americans experience limitations due to their arthritis. Documented disparities according to racial/ethnic groups in the use of surgical interventions such as knee and hip arthroplasty are largely based on data from Medicare beneficiaries age 65 or older. Whether there are disparities among younger adults has not been previously addressed. Objective: This study assesses age-specific racial/ethnic differences in arthritis-related knee and hip surgeries. Design: Longitudinal (1998-2004) Health and Retirement Study. Setting: National probability sample of US community-dwelling adults. Sample: A total of 2262 black, 1292 Hispanic, and 13,159 white adults age 51 and older. Measurements: The outcome is self- reported 2-year use of arthritisrelated hip or knee surgery. Independent variables are demographic (race/ethnicity, age, gender), health needs (arthritis, chronic diseases, obesity, physical activity, and functional limitations), and medical access (income, wealth, education, and health insurance). Longitudinal data methods using discrete survival analysis are used to validly account for repeated (biennial) observations over time. Analyses use person- weights, stratum, and sampling error codes to provide valid inferences to the US population. Results: Black adults under the age of 65 years report similar age/ gender adjusted rates of hip/ knee arthritis surgeries [hazard ratio ( HR) = 1.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.87-2.38] whereas older blacks (age 65+) have significantly lower rates ( HR = 0.38, CI = 0.16- 0.55) compared with whites. These relationships hold controlling for health and economic differences. Both under age 65 years (HR = 0.64, CI = 0.12- 1.44) and older (age 65 +) Hispanic adults (HR = 0.60, CI = 0.32-1.10) report lower utilization rates, although not statistically different than whites. A large portion of the Hispanic disparity is explained by economic differences. Conclusions: These national data document lower rates of arthritisrelated hip/knee surgeries for older black versus white adults age 65 or above, consistent with other national studies. However, utilization rates for black versus white under age 65 do not differ. Lower utilization among Hispanics versus whites in both age groups is largely explained by medical access factors. National utilization patterns may vary by age and merit further investigation.\n      </p>", "The proinflammatory cytokine TNF\u03b1 is a potent mediator of septic shock and a therapeutic target for chronic inflammatory pathologies including rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. As an alternative to anti-human TNF\u03b1 (hTNF\u03b1) mAbs and other hTNF\u03b1 blocker approved drugs, we developed an active anti-hTNF\u03b1 immunotherapy, based on a vaccine comprised of a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-hTNF\u03b1 heterocomplex immunogen (hTNF\u03b1 kinoid) adjuvanted in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. In mice transgenic for hTNF\u03b1 (TTg mice), hTNF\u03b1 kinoid vaccination elicited high titers of Abs that neutralized hTNF\u03b1 bioactivities but did not result in a cellular response to hTNF\u03b1. The vaccine was safe and effective in two experimental models. Kinoid-immunized but not control TTg mice resisted hTNF\u03b1-driven shock in one model and were prevented from spontaneous arthritis, inflammatory synovitis, and articular destruction in a second model. These data demonstrate an anti-cytokine induction of autoimmune protection against both acute and chronic hTNF\u03b1 exposure. They show that active vaccination against a human cytokine can be achieved, and that the immune response can be effective and safe.\n      </p>", "Blocking TNF effectively inhibits inflammation and structural damage in human rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, so far it is unclear whether the effect of TNF is a direct one or indirect on up-regulation of other mediators. IL-1 may be one of these candidates because it has a central role in animal models of arthritis, and inhibition of IL-1 is used as a therapy of human RA. We removed the effects of IL-1 from a TNF-mediated inflammatory joint disease by crossing IL-1\u03b1 and \u03b2-deficient mice $({\\rm IL}\\text{-}1^{-/-})$ with arthritic human TNF-transgenic (hTNFtg) mice. Development of synovial inflammation was almost unaffected on IL-1 deficiency, but bone erosion and osteoclast formation were significantly reduced in ${\\rm IL}\\text{-}1^{-/-}{\\rm hTNFtg}$ mice, compared with hTNFtg mice based on an intrinsic differentiation defect of IL-1-deficient monocytes. Most dramatically, however, cartilage damage was absent in ${\\rm IL}\\text{-}1^{-/-}{\\rm hTNFtg}$ mice. Chimera studies revealed that protection of cartilage is based on the loss of IL-1 on hematopoietic, but not mesenchymal, cells, leading to decreased expression of ADAMTS-5 and MMP-3. These data show that TNF-mediated cartilage damage is completely and TNF-mediated bone damage is partially dependent on IL-1, suggesting that IL-1 is a crucial mediator for inflammatory cartilage and bone degradation.\n      </p>", "Objective: To examine the prospective dose\u2014response relationships between both leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) and walking with self-reported arthritis in older women. Design, setting and participants: Data came from women aged 73-78 years who completed mailed surveys in 1999, 2002 and 2005 for the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health. Women reported their weekly minutes of walking and moderate to vigorous physical activities. They also reported on whether they had been diagnosed with, or treated for, arthritis since the previous survey. General estimating equation analyses were performed to examine the longitudinal relationship between LTPA and arthritis and, for women who reported walking as their only physical activity, the longitudinal relationship between walking and arthritis. Women who reported arthritis or a limited ability to walk in 1999 were excluded, resulting in data from 3613 women eligible for inclusion in these analyses. Main results: ORs for self-reported arthritis were lowest for women who reported \"moderate\" levels of LTPA (OR 0.78; 95% CI 0.67 to 0.92), equivalent to 75 to &lt;150 minutes of moderate-intensity LTPA per week. Slightly higher odds ratios were found for women who reported \"high\" (OR 0.81; 95% CI 0.69 to 0.95) or \"very high\" (OR 0.84; 95% CI 0.72 to 0.98) LTPA levels, indicating no further benefit from increased activity. For women whose only activity was walking, an inverse dose\u2014response relationship between walking and arthritis was seen. Conclusions: The results support an inverse association between both LTPA and walking with self-reported arthritis over 6 years in older women who are able to walk.\n      </p>", "Horse erythrocytes sensitized with antibodies produced in rabbits and guinea pigs generally failed to agglutinate in the presence of rheumatoid arthritis serum. The agglutination of sheep and beef cells by rabbit antihorse cell serum was not enhanced by most rheumatoid arthritis sera. The possibility that the antihorse cell agglutinins were composed entirely of macroglobulins was excluded by chromatographic separation of agglutinins on anion exchange cellulose. Heavily sensitized horse cells and horse cell stromata, however, absorbed rheumatoid factor. It is concluded that the failure to observe agglutination was due to the inability of the sensitized cells to aggregate rather than to the absence of a reaction between horse cell antibody globulin and rheumatoid factor.\n      </p>", "A hallmark of rheumatoid arthritis is the formation of an aggressive, tumor-like structure called pannus that erodes the joint. A major cellular component of the pannus is the fibroblast-like synoviocyte (FLS), whose morphology strikingly resembles that of a transformed cell, but underlying mechanisms of this \"transformation\" are not known. Here, using animal models of rheumatoid arthritis, we show that arthritic FLS contain a substantial (&gt;30%) fraction of bone marrow-derived precursors that can differentiate in vitro into various mesenchymal cell types, but inflammation prevents the multilineage differentiation. We show that the transcription factor NF-\u03baB plays the key role in the repression of osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of arthritic FLS. Furthermore, we show that specific activation of NF-KB profoundly enhances proliferation, motility, and matrix-degrading activity of FLS. We thus propose that arthritic FLS are mesenchymal stem cells whose differentiation is arrested at early stages of differentiation by activation of NF-\u03baB.\n      </p>", "Bone marrow stromal cells are essential for B-lymphocyte development. However, how stromal cells regulate B lymphopoiesis is not clear. In this paper, we report the molecular cloning of a stromal cell line-derived glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored molecule, BST-1, that facilitates pre-B-cell growth. The deduced amino acid sequence of BST-1 exhibited 33% identity with CD38. BST-1 was expressed in a wide range of tissues and in umbilical vein endothelial cells, whereas it was scarcely expressed in a variety of hematopoietic cell lines. The gene for BST-1 was assigned to chromosome 14q32.3, where immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes are clustered. BST-1 expression was enhanced in rheumatoid arthritis patient-derived bone marrow stromal cell lines that were previously shown to have an enhanced ability to support the growth of a pre-B-cell line as compared with stromal cell lines derived from healthy donors.\n      </p>", "Human macrophages produce in culture a factor termed mononuclear cell factor (MCF) that increases the production of collagenase and prostaglandins by isolated adherent rheumatoid synovial cells. A factor with similar biologic activity is also produced by the murine macrophage cell line P338D1. By using a sequential purification scheme involving ammonium sulfate fractionation; chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, Sephacryl S-200, and phenyl-Sepharose; and discontinuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the P338D1 cell-derived, synovial cell-stimulating factor was copurified with the lymphocyte-activating factor [LAF; interleukin 1 (IL 1)]. The specific activity of the partially purified LAF (IL 1) was approximately 15,000-fold higher than that of the LAF (IL 1) in the original P338D1 cell culture supernatant. On the basis of (i) the copurification of the P338D1 cell-derived LAF (IL 1) and synovial cell-stimulating factors; (ii) the similarity in cell of origin, molecular weight, and phenylglyoxal sensitivity of human MCF and murine LAF (IL 1); and (iii) the presence of LAF (IL 1) activity in preparations of partially purified human MCF, we have postulated that LAF (IL 1) may have effects on cell targets that are nonlymphoid in nature and also that human MCF may be similar to, or identical with human LAF (IL 1). The results of these studies have raised the possibility that LAF (IL 1) may play a role in macrophage-mediated activation of synovial cells and lymphocytes which are involved in the inflammatory responses associated with rheumatoid arthritis.\n      </p>", "Environmental factors are thought to play a major role in the development of rheumatoid arthritis. Because the use of ethanol is widespread, we assessed the role of ethanol intake on the propensity to develop chronic arthritis. Collagen type II-immunized mice were given water or water containing 10% (vol/vol) ethanol or its metabolite acetaldehyde. Their development of arthritis was assessed, as well as the impact of ethanol on leukocyte migration and activation of intracellular transcription factors. Mice exposed daily to this dose of ethanol did not display any liver toxicity, and the development of erosive arthritis was almost totally abrogated. In contrast, the antibody-mediated effector phase of collagen-induced arthritis was not influenced by ethanol exposure. Also, the major ethanol metabolite, acetaldehyde, prevented the development of arthritis. This antiinflammatory and antidestructive property of ethanol was mediated by (i) down-regulation of leukocyte migration and (ii) up-regulation of testosterone secretion, with the latter leading to decreased NF-\u03baB activation. We conclude that low but persistent ethanol consumption delays the onset and halts the progression of collagen-induced arthritis by interaction with innate immune responsiveness.\n      </p>", "Background. Mycobacterium xenopi is a nontuberculous mycobacterium responsible for opportunistic and nosocomial infections, chiefly of the lung; few cases of bone and joint infection have been reported. From July 1989 through May 1993, an outbreak of 58 cases of nosocomial discitis due to M. xenopi infection following percutaneous nucleotomy occurred in a French hospital. Peripheral M. xenopi arthritis seems exceedingly rare. We conducted a study to assess the epidemiological and clinical patterns of M. xenopi arthritis. Methods. We retrospectively reviewed cases of M. xenopi arthritis reported from May 1993 through October 2004. Results. We identified 7 cases, all of which occurred after invasive surgical procedures were performed on the affected joint, suggesting a nosocomial pattern of infection. Two patients may have been contaminated at the hospital where the M. xenopi discitis outbreak occurred. No source was identified in the other 5 patients. Despite the probable nosocomial nature of the infections, the diagnosis was delayed (mean time until diagnosis, 50 months). Repeated collection of deep tissue specimens for bacteriological analysis seemed crucial to the diagnosis. The treatment relied on combination antimicrobial therapy and surgery. Among 11 cases of M. xenopi osteoarticular infection reported in the literature from 1975 to 2005, (arthritis in 9 cases and osteitis in 2), none were nosocomial. Conclusion. A high index of suspicion should be maintained to ensure the diagnosis of M. xenopi arthritis before chronic monoarthritis and before the development of irreversible joint damage.\n      </p>"],
