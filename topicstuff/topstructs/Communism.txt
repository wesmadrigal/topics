{"total_words": 1133, "documents": ["Coinciding with the popularity of postmodern theory, the fall of communism appeared to offer further evidence of the exhaustion of modernity. Such analysis is grounded in a view that the Soviet system was the epitome of modernity. An alternative approach regards post-communism as opening new terrains of struggle for modernity. Thus Habermas and others suggest that post-communist societies are rejoining the trajectory of western modernity whose problems they now recapitulate. This alternative view implies that Soviet systems were something other than 'modern', although their nature is not always clearly defined. However, even if post-communist societies do encounter problems of modernity, they do so in new circumstances where modernist notions of social development have become problematic. This article argues that, contrary to those who regard modernization or postmodernization as irresistible trends, core post-communist societies are likely to develop along an alternative path to that of western modernity. This is tentatively described as 'neo-mercantilist'.\n      </p>", "It has long been assumed that inattention to matters of consumption contributed to the collapse of the centrally planned economies of the Soviet bloc. In Poland, the party-state followed a productivist model which occasionally paid lip-service to the consumer but which ultimately focused on the dictates of production. Yet, by 1981, there existed an organized consumer movement (Federacja Konsument\u00f3w) which emerged amidst the broader challenges to the state associated with Solidarity. In the transition to democracy, a form of consumer agency developed in Poland concerned less with the relative benefits of capitalism or communism in supplying consumer wants and desires, and more with a less overtly ideological notion of rights and protection promoted at the global level. This article demonstrates that Polish consumers and their expert representatives, both within and beyond the state, were capable of exercising an agency more complex than the negative one of frustration and recourse to alternative forms of provisioning usually associated with a command economy\n      </p>", "Commentators have either ignored American supporters of General Franco's Nationalists during the Spanish Civil War (1936\u201339) or dismissed them as cranks. In reality, the pro-Franco cause was both more widespread and more complex than prevailing historiography allows. Many Franco supporters were also anti-fascists and supporters in other respects of progressive causes. This article examines Ellery Sedgwick's support of Franco. Editor of the Atlantic Monthly, one of the leading journals of opinion at the time, Sedgwick was also representative of the American social \u00e9lite. The article argues that Sedgwick was not interested in Franco per se, but promoted his cause because he sought to demonstrate the danger that international communism posed to American national identity during a period of unprecedented insecurity. Caught in a unique historical moment, pro-Franco anti-communists of 1938 were patriots to themselves but un-American to the New Deal state.\n      </p>", "To what extent can the Catholic Church in Vietnam contribute to both social and political change? Traditionally, scholars have often focused on countries with large Catholic populations, such as Poland or the Philippines, to exemplify the Church's ability to promote political liberalization, while countries with smaller Catholic populations have been largely overlooked. By examining the confrontations and negotiations between the Catholic Church and the communist state in Vietnam, this article demonstrates that such an oversight precludes the recognition of key figures and initiatives that may bring about significant political change.\n      </p>", "The demise of Soviet communism invites a reappraisal of Socratic communism. Many readers believe that the institutions of Socrates' model city are antagonistic to genuine philosophy, that their formulation is intentionally ironic, and that their significance is accordingly limited to the contribution they make to the disenchantment of utopian thinking. I suggest, on the contrary, that the vital nerve of Socratic communism-\"all saying mine and not mine at the same time\"-supports an ethic of responsible detachment, which reorients one's approach to the whole of human affairs in a manner perfectly congenial to Socratic philosophy.\n      </p>", "This article contends that North Korean familism forms part of a broader trend toward family rule in post-socialist countries. Rather than being an outcast, North Korea has become the norm. The notion of \u201cRed Family\u201d as an ideal type is introduced by demonstrating that the selectorate of socialist societies is gradually transforming into a ruling caste. The adoption of the \u201cRed Family\u201d as a mode of governance profoundly impacts diplomacy, the legal system, the economy, technology, and culture.\n      </p>", "Karl Marx sought virtue through suffering. His need to seek it in some form of social rebellion was a product of his early life experiences. However, his reaction to his Jewish origin determined the direction of that rebellion: the field of economics. His first paper on the Jewish question described the Jew as a greedy manipulator of money. A few years later he was still attacking greedy manipulators of money, but his target had changed from the Jew to the capitalist. Marx never disavowed his early paper on the Jewish question, but he no longer used anti-Semitism as a basic element in his attack on the rich. In his final version of the materialist theory of history and the concept of capitalism, the Jew plays no part, nor does anti-Semitism. Marx's early work on the Jewish question has often been resurrected to try to prove just the opposite, namely that the communism of Marx is an anti-Semitic doctrine.\n      </p>", "This paper is an experiment in understanding the logic of communism from the perspective of political psychology. In Hungary, communism became a means for transforming the entire psychical make-up of a country in a moment of reduced intensity of consciousness, a transitory or liminal period, produced by the Second World War. In liminal conditions, unconscious impulses are set free that are channeled by the use of archetypical images. As an empirical case study, this paper discusses the speeches of the first post-war Hungarian Communist Party leader, M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi, delivered in the years immediately after the devastations of the war, in an effort to discern the techniques and mechanisms by which the Communist Party managed to capture the allegiance of a large segment of the population. The analysis of these speeches and their effects indicates that communism was not merely a consequence of Soviet occupation, and therefore the withdrawal of the troops did not eliminate the lasting, mostly hidden but still predominant, effects of communism on the countries that were in its grip.\n      </p>", "The Little Red Pioneers, the Chinese Communist Party's organization for children aged 7-12, seem anachronistic in China today. This article argues that the Pioneer organization, rather than being an outdated relic of the nation's Maoist past, provides insight into contemporary Chinese nationalism, particularly the theoretical question of how children are produced as national subjects. Based in Butler's concept of performativity this article argues that children's nationalism in China is performed through daily activities and practices structured by the Little Red Pioneers.\n      </p>", "Anti-radicalism in the United States has a long history. During World War I, it was transformed into anti-communism and became embedded in the political culture of the United States for the next seventy-plus years. There were many varieties of anti-communism, but it can be divided into two main categories: official or governmental, and unofficial or nongovernmental. This article traces the development of those varieties that most impacted the motion picture industry, led to the blacklisting of hundreds of employees, and cast a pall of censorship over moviemaking.\n      </p>", "In light of the fact\u2014despite a widespread impression to the contrary\u2014that the collapse of Communism in the fall of 1989 did not happen overnight, the paper explores the kind of gradual societal work that had led to the emergence of democratic polities in Central Europe but that had generally escaped the notice not only of policy makers and the leaders of the \"free world\" but also of theorists. The concept and practices of performative democracy as it manifested itself in the period of late Communism (1970s-1989), but also in South Africa at the dusk of apartheid, and the conditions for political performativity, as well as its main features, are then discussed.\n      </p>", "An analysis of the ancient tradition on Pythagorean communism shows that most of it depends on Timaeus, and that the material connected with his Fragment 77 can be rather fully reconstructed. Other sources provide some corroboration. According to this testimony, the communistic organization was confined to those in the upper levels of the society's hierarchy of grades. It seems to have been initiated by Pythagoras himself and may not have lasted much longer than his lifetime. The concept that \"the possessions of friends are common\" fits well with the philosophical ideals of the society, which emphasized harmony at all levels of existence, and also with its aristocratic political bias.\n      </p>", "Ronald Reagan's turn to the political right served certain social adjustment and ego defensive needs for him at a time when his personal and professional life had bottomed out. A movie career which had started out auspiciously never did take off, and a marriage portrayed as idyllic ended in divorce. Drawing upon psychological adaptations that had served him since boyhood - the energetic attack on obstacles in his path and the avoidance of emotional and intellectual ambiguities - he was able to find new routes to professional and personal success. His turn to anti-communism and more gradual embrace of a conservative political philosophy facilitated his rise to the presidency of the Screen Actors Guild and provided him with new opportunities for work and influence. The targeting of the communists and the federal government in Washington as the sources of all that had gone wrong in Hollywood provided him with safe outlets for the anger he felt as a result of his blocked career and an explanation of what had happened to him. The avoidance of ambiguity kept him from any troubling doubts about either the motives of some of the leaders of the anti-communist impulse or its effects on the careers of those who resisted it. An interactionist life-history model is used in the analysis and hypotheses suggested for further research. Individual shifts on the political spectrum, as this case history suggests, may not be accompanied by cognitive and psychological transformations. Threats to fundamental values may well intensify cognitive and emotional rigidities as a way of avoiding anxiety.\n      </p>", "A global economy powered by non-solar energy sources is limited by global warming, finite reserves and concomitant insults to the earth's biosphere, including our own species. Some of these impacts, such as loss of biodiversity, will be irreversible. Without constraints on the reproduction of capital, the global driver of the contemporary environmental crisis, these impacts will intensify. This is not a necessary outcome for an economy utilizing the high efficiency capture of solar energy, a conclusion informed by consideration of the heat budget of the earth's surface and the laws of thermodynamics. Such a solarbased economy managed by containment of the socially modified environment is a necessary condition for a global civilization realizing the Marxian concept of communism.\n      </p>", "The paper presents a framework for understanding the evolution of communism. We suggest that the politico-economic system of communist regimes may be usefully seen as an institutionally and ideologically constrained bargaining game. We distinguish three stages of the development of this \"game\"--pure communism, late communism, and constitutional communism. Pure communism is characterized by an aspiration to the total control over society, and a strong commitment to ideology. Constraints on bargaining weaken in late communism, resulting in a system with distinctive economic and political features, which we describe. Constitutional communism is an ideal type based on the current wave of reform, in which the power of communists is limited without being undermined. Its chief ingredients are the rule of law, separation of powers, communist corporatism, glasnost, and the market. /// L'utilisation d'un cadre d'analyse de type \"jeu de marchandage\" permet de mieux comprendre l'\u00e9volution du communisme en fonction de changements survenant dans les contraintes id\u00e9ologiques et institutionnelles qui p\u00e8sent sur le jeu.

Successful advice is unproblematic; more significant is assigning institutional blame in the aftermath of advice considered wrong or harmful, undercutting state security. How do experts, operating within epistemic communities, preserve their reputation in the face of charges of incompetence or malice? Attacks on experts and their sponsors can be an effective form of contentious politics, a wedge to denounce other institutional players. To examine the politics of expertise we analyze the debate in the early 1950s over \u201cWho Lost China?,\u201d the congressional attempt to assign responsibility for the fall of the Nationalist regime to the Communists. Using a \u201cstrong case,\u201d we examine political battles over the motives of Professor Owen Lattimore. For epistemic authority an expert must be defined as qualified (having appropriate credentials), influential (providing consequential information), and innocent (demonstrating epistemic neutrality). We focus on two forms of attack: smears (an oppositional presentation of a set of linked claims) and degradation ceremonies (the institutional awarding of stigma). We differentiate these by the critic's links to systems of power. Smears appear when reputational rivals lack power to make their claims stick, while degradation ceremonies operate through dominance within an institutional setting. Policy experts are awarded provisional credibility, but this access to an autonomous realm of knowledge can be countered by opponents with alternate sources of power. Ultimately expertise involves not only knowledge, but also the presentation of a validated self.\n      </p>", "In this two-part conversation between two former dissidents and key political thinkers of the 1970s-80s democratic opposition in the region, conducted nearly 20 years after the end of communism, Michnik prompts Havel to revisit the momentous events of the Prague Spring of 1968, the politics of the Kremlin vis-\u00e0-vis the region, and the emergence of the human-rights-based initiative known as Charter 77. The situation in Russia under Putin, and the surfacing of a cohesive new authoritarianism called by Michnik Putinism, are discussed, along with the challenges of a young democracy infected by cynicism, compliance, and an addiction to the narrative that emerges from the files produced by the secret police. The second part of the conversation centers around Havel's recent dramaturgical work that deals with questions of the loss of power and sudden political change.

Communism as a social and economic system is possible only in a Capitalist age. Due to the sharp contradiction between social function and the social substance of capital itself, social function and its institutional forms (state, relations of production, science, etc.) can exist autonomously from the substance of capital or even be used against it as the means of its negation. Communism is the result and the process of negation of capital as substance by means of capitalist functional forms (state, party). That is why historical Communism is and can be only Anticapitalism. The connection between Communism and Capitalism is not exhausted by this genetic feature. There are some others; for example, a functional one. Being a negation of Capitalism and another world-system, being substantially out of the Capitalist system, Communism is at the same time in it--functionally. During the \"short twentieth century\" (1917-91) it fulfilled for the Capitalist system some important functions, providing it with \"double mass.\" Capitalism could neither swallow and integrate into it a good portion of northern Eurasia, nor let it be unorganized. Communism came into being as a solution for this antinomy. The solution was negative, yet related to capitalism and was universalist in its form. Communism is the result and the process of the closest (in history) interaction between the Russian system and the Capitalist system and at the same time is a compromise between them. The end of Communism is the end of this compromise, which is partly shadowed by the fact that the Third Russian revolution of the XXth century (1991-93) was developing under capitalist (capital-substance) slogans. The end of Communism as a historical compromise between the Russian and the Capitalist systems is one of the signs of the systemic crisis of capitalism, the sign (or the sound) of Bells of History tolling both for Communism and Capitalism.\n      </p>", "Koreans have suffered a tragic fate under communism in the 20th century. After the Bolsheviks seized power, Korean farms in Russia's Far East were destroyed. Under Stalin, in 1937, all Koreans in the Far East were deported to Kazakhstan and Middle Asia as \"Chinese spies.\" Somehow, Koreans in the USSR have rebounded from these disasters and many have even become prosperous in spite of the Soviet system. After World War II, North Koreans sent workers to special work zones in the USSR under conditions of extreme hardship. Many of those who tried to escape were sentenced to death by North Korea.

This essay provides a theoretical appreciation of the values and principles that guided and undergirded the movement, which greatly contributed to the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe. This systematic overview of the ethic of the Solidarity movement fills a lacuna in the field of ethics because ethicists who are interested in the concept of solidarity have largely overlooked the Polish experience of the 1980s. This essay attempts to describe the key ingredients of the Polish ethic of solidarity by analyzing both Polish treatises on the subject and accounts of events on the ground. It elaborates conceptual categories and describes characteristic features of the movement in order to provide a phenomenological account of the nature of solidarity embodied in Poland during this era. These categories and characteristics include unity among differences, the foundation of hope at the movement's roots, self-sacrifice and heroism, promoting the equality and dignity of all, the centrality of participation, the affirmation of \"bread and freedom,\" an option for the poor, and the insistence on life in truth. Although this essay does not attempt to demonstrate the relevance of this \"thick\" ethic of solidarity to capitalist, democratic societies today, by way of conclusion it raises questions pertaining to the contemporary significance of the Polish ethic of solidarity.\n      </p>", "The influential dissident Vladimir Bukovskii played a formative role in the creation of the Soviet human rights movement and the exposure of the abuse of psychiatry in the USSR.

There is no scholarly work on Bukovskii, and this article seeks to fill this gap by offering an overview of Bukovskii's struggle with Soviet Communism, in particular by examining his moral and political ideas, and his anti-Communist activities.

In Western Europe, the extermination of the Jews during World War 2 represents the most abominable crime on the scale of 20th-century horrors, to such an extent that since the end of the 1970s Auschwitz has become a symbol of absolute evil. However, in the former Soviet countries, and especially those who are currently European Union candidate countries, the stress is put above all on the very painful memory of Soviet occupation. Eastern Europeans are critical of the weight given to the memory of the Shoah as they believe that Western Europeans minimize the crimes of communism in relation to the extermination of the Jews. In return, Western Europeans denounce Eastern European anti-Semitism. Under pressure from the European Union, many Eastern European countries have begun a phase of anamnesis. However, in spite of official policy, collective memory of the Shoah among civil society in these countries is still limited. Within the former communist bloc the former Soviet republics which remain close to Russia continue to celebrate the \"Great Patriotic War\" masking attempts to cultivate collective memory of the Shoah. This dialogue of the deaf between Western and Eastern Europe is a enduring reality. It is for this reason that intellectuals like Jorge Semprun are calling for the establishment of a mutual recognition of memories of both the Shoah and the Gulag throughout Europe which would serve as a basis for a future common European memory.\n      </p>", "This article examines the enunciation in March 1947 of the Truman Doctrine. The doctrine pledged the United States to \"assist free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.\" Although the statement was initially aimed at winning congressional support for U.S. aid to Greece and Turkey, where the administration feared Soviet penetration, it ultimately underpinned U.S. Cold War policy throughout Europe and around the world. Moreover, the doctrine addressed a broader cultural insecurity regarding modern life in a globalized world. The administration's concern over communism's domino effect, its media-sensitive presentation of the doctrine, and its mobilization of U.S. economic and military power to modernize unstable regions marked the advent of a modern U.S. foreign policy. In its maintenance of military preponderance, its nation-building activities, its organization of alliances, its advocacy of \"regime change,\" and its resort at times to limited war against armed insurgencies, the Truman Doctrine foreshadowed the contemporary Bush Doctrine against international terrorism.\n      </p>", "Foursov seems to imply that the creation of the Soviet system was almost a deliberate political creation of the capitalist system. This is unreal. Rather I believe that Russian Communism was not Communism but the an\u00fcsystemic reaction of a peasant nation, the attempt to catch up to the West by a backward great power. Capitalism was the real thing, but Communism was not. Today's capitalists are \"state capitalists\" because of the absence of a true middle class, unlike in Central Europe. Hence the state is here to stay.\n      </p>", "The theories of Communist voting among workers suggested by Lipset and Allardt assume that party choice among working-class Communists is in whole or in part nonrational. These theories are analyzed and compared with a voting model of the Downsian type, which assumes that voting is determined by rational choice on the bases of the relative utility to the worker of the policies that the parties stand for. A review of data pertaining to Lipset's hypothesis that authoritarianism is the variable underlying working class Communism fails to give support for this assumption. Some crucial correlations interpreted by Lipset as supporting his theory are probably spurious and caused by demographic factors. Data also fail to support Allardt's theory of anomie as the key variable behind \"emerging\" Communism. It seems possible to interpret available data on Communist sympathies among workers in Western Europe in terms of a simple model assuming rational, self-interested voters.\n      </p>", "The suggestion is made here that sociology is not \"value-free\" because this perspective cannot account for the way sociological works are actually generated. To illustrate this point, the author looks at the way communism has been treated in mainstream North American sociology. When one examines the various sociological works on communism one notices that the different scholars\u2014Selznick (1952), Bell (1952), Shils (1954a), Stouffer (1955), Howe and Coser (1957), Lipset (1960), and Glazer (1961)\u2014decided to pursue certain issues rather than others because of their initial opinions of communism. Since most of these studies are strongly anti-communistic a one-sided picture of communism has resulted.

In the former, the end of communism seems to suggest the reaffirmation of the nation's role as the dramatis personae of history.\u00b9 In the latter, the passing of modernity suggests the nation's decentering.\u00b2 But rather than see these apparently opposed accounts of the nation as antinomies, I would suggest that the conjuncture of post-communism and post-modernity sutures these accounts of the nation together in a spiral of cynical unity in which appeals to the truth of the nation and conflicts over its authenticity have different and more unstable meanings than such appeals and conflicts once did. At least I would like to suggest this as a guiding question for future research. In this paper, I make a case for why this is a potentially fruitful point of departure. But before I can talk about this conjuncture, I must pay homage to the famous essay on which this title plays, and consider some of the more recent literature upon which my argument rests.\n      </p>", "Assessment of the appeals of communism in Asia is handicapped by false conceptions and generalizations about the peoples of South and Southeast Asia. In Western writings and in the Western press, they are identified as \"Asians,\" although they do not accept this identification themselves. Communist appeals are directed at the ethnic-linguistic groups within each state. We have not analyzed the reasons why the peoples of the countries of southern Asia do not agree with us about the dangers of Communist expansion and world domination. We have not understood the bases for their attitudes which focus on different problems. Communist appeals are more carefully directed to meet the real concerns of the peoples of this area. We tend to view the problems of communism as a contest in which one side must be a winner, and we tend to be impatient with those who are not either for us or against the Communists. This is illustrated by the many references to the contest between India and China as one of democracy versus communism. The impression is left that people in other Asian countries are watching this contest closely. Nothing could be farther from the truth. If we are successfully to counter the appeals of communism in Asia, we must study and investigate the history, culture, political behavior, and norms of conduct of the peoples in each country, particularly during the colonial period. We must know why segments of the people in each country think as they do and act as they do. This requires concerted research with attempts to answer questions which are relevant to American policy formulation and action.\n      </p>", "What makes an individual become a communist, and what does communism make of the individual?

Analyses of the implications of adaptation to life circumstances under communist regimes lead to the hypotheses that East European samples are likely to attribute especially high importance to conservatism and hierarchy values and low importance to egalitarianism, intellectual and affective autonomy, and mastery values. The same hypotheses apply to differences between countries within Eastern Europe in which there was greater or lesser communist penetration. These hypotheses are largely supported with data both from samples of school teachers and of university students from nine Eastern European and 12 Western European countries. Various possible alternative explanations are discussed: national economic level, religion, earlier shared history, effects of totalitarianism, and distinctiveness of Western Europe.\n      </p>", "This paper provides a conceptual frame to comprehend the nature of social movements in East-Central Europe. I distinguish between the forces that brought down the Communist polity, which were peaceful indeed, and the forces that are nascent thereafter. I argue that the factors that had warranted the peaceful elimination of the communist super structure are not the ones which are responsible for the introduction of the economic and social mechanisms of the post-communism. The magnitude of social change from the socialism to post-communism experiments with market capitalism can only be compared with the major social revolutions and political breakdowns that convert one formation into another. Formational conversions are marked by rapid dislocation of major collective actors and usually by the decline in interventionist capacity. But such processes usually give rise to new and violent movements, and they also prompt the state to use violence against the populace.\n      </p>", "Studies of values around the world have revealed that a world at peace, social justice, and equality (universalism values) are ordinarily opposed motivationally to social order and national security (security values). We first establish that these sociopolitical values exhibit an unusual pattern of compatibility in East European samples from eight countries (N = 2770). This pattern suggests a shared meaning for the sociopolitical values similar to that of conformity values and opposed to that of self-direction values. We then hypothesize that this unusual meaning of sociopolitical values reflects the experience of living under East European communist regimes. Comparison of the value priorities of opponents and supporters of the communist regime in Poland supports this hypothesis. Implications for the nature and speed of value change are discussed.\n      </p>", "This article maps ways in which radical left-wing politics in 1930s and Second World War Sweden were conceived in medico-biological and eugenic terms that expressed strong dehumanizing sentiments. The article engages Agamben's and Foucault's thinking on 'biopolitics' and 'biopower', and extensively exemplifies dehumanizing discourse as deployed by leading Social Democratic politicians, leading figures of government within the police and military, as well as by editors of both right-wing and Social Democratic press. Ways in which individuals labelled 'Communists' were spatially managed in terms of extensive surveillance, registration, detainment planning and forms of incarceration are addressed. I further discuss state measures that may be seen as elements of a state of exception, some measures implemented against 'Communists', and others against individuals deemed to have undesirable characteristics seen to be hereditary. In employing Agamben's notion of 'inoperosity' in a discussion of a state paradigm of social productivity, eugenic measures in the building of the Swedish welfare state are then related to the dehumanizing framing of 'Communists'. In conclusion, conditions for regaining a place in the body politic are briefly addressed. The article's focus on ways in which the ethnic and racial same was dehumanized within a democracy on political grounds results from a conscious effort to complement studies of dehumanization as related to colonialism, dictatorial regimes as well as identity politics.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "The South African ecologist and political activist Edward Roux (1903-1966) used evolutionary biology to argue against racism. During the cold-war, he transformed his communist beliefs into advocacy for scientific rationalism, management, and protection of nature against advancing capitalism. These pleas for saving the environment served as a vehicle for questioning the more risky issue of evolution and racial order in society. The link between ecological and political order had long been an important theme among the country's ecologists and politicians alike. The statesman Jan Christian Smuts' holistic theory of evolution and racial order inspired the nation's ecologists to sanctify an ecologically informed racial policy. This idealist informed methodology stood in direct opposition to the materialist approach to ecology of Roux. These methodological debates reflected differing political support from within the Union Party and people on the radical left, respectively. Ecology was of concern to politicians because understandings of the order of nature had direct implications for the racial order of the South African society.\n      </p>", "Research has largely overlooked the reification of the intellectual (zhishifenzi) after the 1949 Communist revolution. Studying this major feature of Chinese socialism can illuminate the workings of the Chinese Communist Party, state-society relations, and the experience of so-called intellectuals. This article explores the social and ideological contexts that first nurtured the party's concept of intellectuals. It focuses on the debate about the intellectual class (zhishi jieji) in political and literary circles from the late 1910s to the mid-1920s. During the May Fourth era, socialists, anarchists, and other activists regarded the intellectual class as a distinct social category with internal cleavages based on age and political consciousness. Under the influence of the Comintern, the Chinese Communists recast the intellectual class as the primary ideological enemy. The debate about the intellectual class profoundly affected the party's understanding of the intellectual. The article concludes by suggesting new directions for research on the reification of the intellectual.\n      </p>", "Hirschman's (1970, 1993) theoretical constructs of Exit and Voice represent a useful way to think about citizenship. Exit refers to a desire to emigrate and can be construed as apolitical, private, and passive-a threat to citizenship-whereas Voice refers to political commitment and can be construed as ideal citizenship. A survey of 560 Bulgarian university students in 1998 explored their emphasis on Exit and Voice (as options for themselves in the future) and the association of each option with different economic, political, and psychological factors. One in four students wanted to emigrate, and half of them considered leaving the country for a period of time. Exit plans appeared mainly to be triggered by a wish to participate in the consumer culture, but were also associated with a critical view of the political system as well as a rejection of tradition in conjunction with a Western identity. Although most of the students shared vague or ideal Voice-related plans, few wanted to become actively involved in politics. An emphasis on Voice reflected not only a somewhat limited political engagement but also a more traditionalistic attitude associated with plans for a career and family. The findings indicate that a normative separation between Exit and Voice as theoretical concepts does not cover the complexities of the Bulgarian students' emigration and political involvement plans.\n      </p>", "After World War II, most Bulgarian Jews emigrated legally to Israel. Those who stayed had to take part in the building of socialism and integrate in a monolithic \"socialist nation.\" Thereby they had to \"forget\" their ethnic identity (\"aided\" by the state in various ways) and to become Homo politicus rather than Homo ethnicus. Since 1990, a revival of Jewish identity has begun in Bulgaria. Here I explore how the women of three generations from the same family reinvent their Jewish identity in their life stories. Drawing on this particular case, I suggest an approach to the question of the interplay of individual and collective memory. I focus on family and generation as different types of collectivities influencing individual memories and self-actualizations.\n      </p>", "This article traces the development of the FBI's investigation of Hollywood during World War II. Motivated by a fear of Communist propaganda, the FBI initiated this surveillance before the onset of the Cold War.

I contend that the dichotomous concept 'civil society versus the state', when used to explain the transition from communism, is applicable only in rare, extreme cases and misleading in most cases.

In most cases, institutional amphibiousness more adequately accounts for the dynamics of the erosion of communism than the concept of 'civil society versus the state'.\n      </p>", "The original analysis of the data collected for the Communism, Conformity, and Civil Liberties volume was based on a cross tabulation approach.

Mari\u00e1tegui had a heterodox attitude toward religion, as well as other subjects. Mari\u00e1tegui does not venture a new definition of religion. However, it can be inferred from his writings that his is an ethical-political and spiritual concept, one related to \"all the need of the infinite that exists in man\" (of which he wrote in 1925) and the quest for a heroic myth that could restore sense and enchantment to life. The word \"mystical,\" which appears very often in Mari\u00e1tegui's work, is evidently religious in origin but has a broader meaning: it refers to the spiritual and ethical dimension of socialism, as well as faith in the revolutionary struggle, absolute commitment to the emancipatory cause, and the heroic willingness to risk life itself.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

West Europe has two mass Communist parties, the semirevisionist Italians and the rigid French, and many other small, sectarian ones. The effect of the Sino-Soviet schism has been decisive only in Albania, which, out of fear of Yugoslavia, has deserted Moscow for Peking, and primary only in Yugoslavia, where it furthered but did not primarily cause the new Soviet-Yugoslav rapprochement. Elsewhere throughout Europe, Communist parties have remained pro-Soviet. Even so, by giving party leaderships more room for maneuver, the schism has significantly contributed to, although not primarily determined, the consolidation of Polish moderation, the extension of liberalization in Hungary, and ideological revisionism and reformism in Italian communism. In the long run, it seems likely to further still more increasing differentiation and moderation throughout European communism.\n      </p>", "In central Europe fertility fell during transition from centrally planned to market oriented economies. Families reevaluated fertility plans facing new wages, reduced child-care subsidies, and economic uncertainty. Using micro-data from 1984 and 1993 in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, this paper relates fertility changes following Communism to wages, prices and risks. Earnings have little impact on fertility timing during transition, though age, job uncertainty, and children conceived during Communism do. In the Czech Republic, changed fertility demand parameters account for much of the fall in fertility. In Slovakia a sizable proportion results from predictable responses to changed incentives.\n      </p>", "Perhaps no one in the United States is better qualified to write on the subject of Communism in China than Mr. Bryan. Born in Shanghai of American missionary parents, he has spent most of his life in the Far East. He was Municipal Advocate and Legal Adviser to the Shanghai Municipal Council from 1928 to the outbreak of World War II. Interned by the Japanese during the war, he returned in 1946 to the practice of law in Shanghai, only to be arrested and interned again by the Chinese Communists on a charge of being a spy, the Red's standard accusation against Americans in foreign countries behind the Iron Curtain. Mr. Bryan was released in 1952 and returned to his native country. A full account of his experiences in the hands of his Communist captors was published in the Saturday Evening Post in its issues of January 17, 24, 31 and February 7, 1953.\n      </p>", "Most studies of right-wing anti-Communism among students and others have assumed that phenomenon to be part of a general pattern of intolerance, based either upon certain psychological variables (e.g., the \"authoritarian personality\") or upon social background factors, such as class or status. This paper considers right-wing anti-Communism in an otherwise highly tolerant student population--i.e. apart from intolerance generally--and suggests that certain religious and secular value commitments are a principal source of militant anti-Communism among the otherwise tolerant. The study is largely a secondary analysis of data gathered during December, 1957, for the University of California Civil Liberties Study by Selvin and Hagstrom, supplemented by more recent survey data gathered by the author from two anti-Communist student organizations on the Berkeley campus.\n      </p>", "Communism is vulgar capitalism; that is, the communist command economy is based on mistaken notions of how capitalism grew by exploiting workers. Command economies not capitalism fulfil Marx's predictions, collapsing because they are unproductive and immoral, basing economic choices on corrupted personal relations. Without competition, decision in command economies are unproductive through negative selection, and immoral, being based on corrupt personal relations. Each and every Marxist and neo-Marxist prediction about capitalism, from commodity fetishism to the alienation of the citizen from the state, comes true under communism. The explanation is straightforward: Marxist assumptions about the state and the economy are far more true for communist than for capitalist countries.\n      </p>", "As was to be expected, one of the foremost matters of interest and concern to members of both the Assembly and House of Delegates in Seattle September 6-9 was that our Association should take a strong stand, and recommend measures protective of our country, as to the infiltrations and aggressions of Communism and Communists in our government and in the political and representative organizations of the United States, including our own Association. As to the latter, some difficulty was experienced in formulating and adopting an acceptable form and basis of recommended action, although no substantial disagreement in principle was manifest. A chief difficulty appeared to be that proposals emanated from several sources, without integration before submission, and the sessions of the Annual Meeting, interspersed with Seattle's unforgettable hospitality, did not give a ready opportunity for ironing out differences of opinion and arriving at a consensus. The task was nevertheless accomplished. The Assembly voted an emphatic stand against lawyers who \"publicly or secretly\" aid Communism, in which the House concurred. The House also gave strong indorsement to the Mundt-Nixon bill (H.R. 5852 in the 80th Congress) to define and curb Communist offenses against our form of government. The expulsion of proved members of the Communist Party from our Association was recommended. Refusal of a member of our Association, summoned before a constituted inquiry, to answer questions as to whether he is or is not a Communist, was declared to be \"compelling cause\" for his expulsion from our Association. The final actions taken appeared to be, in the aggregate, effectively declaratory of the attitude expressed in our August editorial: \"The Point Where Toleration Ends\" (page 696). The following report of the debates and votes is an interesting narrative of the deliberative processes by which decisions are arrived at and acceptable actions are formulated in the representative bicameral system which governs policy-making in our Association.\n      </p>", "There are different modes of looking back at the Central and Eastern European communist experience. One mode is to analyze it in terms of a project for modernization. To what extent real socialism succeeded to modernize the countries of this region? If it did not succeed, then where did it fail? This article attempts to answer these questions in the particular case of Romania. Within the frameworks of other contributions like those of Andorka (1993) or Sztompka (1993), the following pages deal with the Romania's hard and soft dimensions which underwent profound changes under communism. As in the cases of Hungary and Poland, in Romania too some of these changes also meant improvements and modernization. Yet many other changes, especially in the sphere of mentalities, can hardly be designated as the equivalents of Western modernization.\n      </p>", "This paper argues that insights from Tocqueville help us to understand post-communism. Tocqueville is initially helpful in helping us appreciate the extraordinary vacuum that has followed the fall of state socialism. Vacuums tend to be filled, however, and the first part of the paper accordingly concerns itself with nationalism. But not every country suffers from nationalism, and the second part of the paper argues - against currently dominant theory - that instant democratization is not likely to stymie economic reform. The third part of the paper notes that the absence of a civil society is, in the long run, much more of a problem than a solution: the chances of successfully consolidating democracy depend upon destroying venal and cumbersome states and in creating leaner and more efficient replacements. The conclusion notes that a variety of regimes is likely to characterize the region once the initial period of vacuum has come to an end.\n      </p>", "This paper seeks to explore social relations in north Malabar in the period between 1934 and 1948 and the attempts of Congress socialism and subsequently communism to resolve the problem of caste inequality in the region. The one theme unifying these endeavours was the aspiration towards creating a community of equals. It will be argued here that the idea of community represents an aspiration and not an achieved entity; communities are always in the process of formation without reaching realisation. There can only be conjunctural creations of community when a temporary balance is achieved between diverse individual initiatives. This paper looks at the creation of one such conjunctural community when the aims of communist political activity, the aspirations for land and equality among low caste agricultural labourers and the need for landowners to get cultivators for their lands in the context of food shortage following the second world war all came together.\n      </p>", "The encounter of the Mexican and Bolshevik Revolutions on Mexican soil took place when the Mexican Revolution was still considered a viable project, however unrealized. The Bolshevik emissaries to Mexico, who arrived in 1919 and again in 1921, misunderstood Mexico on two counts. They disregarded the prerevolutionary radicalism that had developed in the workplace under the influence of the Industrial Workers of the World, and they dismissed the revolution as simply bourgeois. Both misreadings led them into blind alleys. Attempting to radicalize an already radical movement, they antagonized the anarcho-syndicalists. At the same time, the fact that in Soviet Russia anarchists were victimized by the new regime diminished the stature of that country in Mexico and made the anarchists hostile to communism.\n      </p>", "The transition from a classless to a class society has been a major dilemma to Marxist economic historians. Using the Wolof social formation of West Africa as its historical example, this paper produces a class theoretic analysis of primitive communism. From this analysis, it is then able to show how such a transition could take place.\n      </p>", "Concepts of class struggle and social reproduction are used to explain the sudden collapse of Soviet Communism. I explore these ideas by means of the mathematical theory of dynamical systems. Theoretical focus is upon the power of social classes and how this power changes over time. The Soviet bureaucracy gradually divided into two classes, and the power relations between these ruling classes caused a drastic loss of power by both, which is why the Communist system collapsed. Four classes of Soviet society are considered: political class, administrative class, working class, and capitalist class. I examine the reproduction of class power in two-, three-, and four-class systems. Also analyzed are the effects of random perturbations and the particular impact of the August 1991 coup attempt. Wherever possible, graphs are used instead of equations to explain class dynamics. The results indicate that drastic power loss was not the only possible outcome of Soviet class dynamics, which may be why the collapse was so surprising. The class dynamics approach emphasizes multiple historical possibilities and cuts against any rigid class determinism.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Joseph baruch salsberg was one of Canada's best known and respected communists when he left the Labor-Progressive Party in 1957 after years of anguish over clear evidence of antisemitism in the Soviet Union.

It seeks to explain why the radicalism of the war years which had led them to reach their electoral peak by 1945-6 saw most of them utterly defeated by 1948 and unable to become significant forces in the political life of their respective countries. Their activism in the war years, superior to that of their socialist rivals, was due to their internal organisation, but this advantage could not be carried out easily in a framework of electoral politics. Cold war politics is seen as the decisive factor in the sudden and ultimate defeat of Western communism, but national aspects and the relative importance of the resistance to Nazism account for the markedly stronger post-war performance of the French, Finnish and Italian Communist parties. /// Cet article suit les vicissitudes des Partis Communistes de l'Europe Occidentale entre 1939 et 1948.

Rather than using metaphors such as alien invaders or giant insects (like so many films of that era), all three directly address Communism, using it as an important element in their plots.

This appears to be no less true of lawyers than of other citizens, although lawyers are being especially looked to for advice and leadership as to what should be done to resist and combat the spread of Communist doctrines in America. In particular, our lawyers have not gone extensively into available facts as to what Communists in action do to our profession, to Courts, to the administration of justice under law, albeit these Communist practices are of vital importance, not only to lawyers, but to the whole community whose rights, freedom and security require the existence of an independent profession and impartial, law-governed Courts. We are able to give here a detailed description of just what the ascendancy of Communists in a country means as to the lawyers who are permitted to live and remain such. The narration is not from any source that could be claimed to be hostile to Communism, independent of it, or purely objective. On the contrary, it is an official account of the \"Reform of Legal Profession\" in Bulgaria, published in Sofia but circulated somewhat in Communist propaganda in the United States. In other words, it is obviously what propagandists of the Cominform think will commend their cause to some Americans.

It conceptualizes symbolizations as contingent interpretive acts that capture people in extraordinary situations of dissolutions of political order.

In the second part, I elaborate on the creativity of political symbolism by understanding symbolizations as rites of passage, constructions of origins and ends, as well as reality-creating self-fulfilling prophecies.
