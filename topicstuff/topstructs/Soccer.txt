{"total_words": 856, "documents": ["In this paper a method is suggested for predicting the distribution of scores in international soccer matches, treating each team's goals scored as independent Poisson variables dependent on the Federation Intemationale de Football Association (FIFA) rating of each team, and the match venue. The results of a Poisson regression to estimate parameters for this model were used to simulate matches played during the 1998 World Cup tournament. For the model to be a more effective predictor, some manual adjustments must be made to the ratings data. The predictions of the model were placed on a web page to create interest in applications of mathematics, and proved popular with the general public.\n      </p>", "Soccer (football in the non-American terminology) is the most globalized sport. Free circulation of players has markedly increased during the last ten to fifteen years as limits on the number of foreign players in the European leagues have been lifted, and clubs have become more commercially minded. On the other hand, the rules governing national team competition have remained restrictive: players can play only for the country where they were born. We show that, in a model where there is free circulation of labour, increasing returns to scale, and endogeneity of skills, this produces on the one hand, higher overall quality of the game and increasing inequality of results among clubs, and on the other hand, lower inequality in the national teams' performances. The empirical examples from the history of the European Champions' League and the World Cup support the implications of the model. We argue in the conclusions, that soccer's global rules allow poor countries to capture some of their 'leg drain', that is the improved skills which their players have acquired playing for better foreign clubs. This provides an example as how forces of efficiency but also inequality unleashed by globalization can be harnessed by the existence of global institutions to help improve the outcome for the poor countries.\n      </p>", "Through an analysis of recent developments in Australian soccer, I extend Homi Bhabha's work on the nation as a problem of narration in two principal ways. I demonstrate that sport, like literature, is a fertile site for narrating the nation. I also illustrate the value of moving beyond the exclusive study of national narratives to the study of ethnic and transnational narratives as well in order to understand more fully the role of narrative in the construction of identities in an increasingly globalized world. Specifically, I argue that the ambivalence and the power of the nation as narrative is what enables people involved in Australian soccer to use different narratives of the Australian nation-narratives of ethnic nationalism, multiculturalism, and cultural hybridity-to serve their own political and economic interests.\n      </p>", "We estimate an ordered probit model for soccer results in the Netherlands. The result of a game is assumed to be determined by home ground advantage and differences in quality between the opposing teams. The parameters of the model are used to assess whether the balance in competition in Dutch professional soccer has changed over time. Contrary to popular belief, we find that the balance has not changed much since the mid-1970s.\n      </p>", "We investigate the effect of the expulsion of a player on the outcome of a soccer match by means of a probability model for the score. We propose estimators of the expulsion effect that are independent of the relative strength of the teams. We use the estimates to illustrate the expulsion effect on the outcome of a match.\n      </p>", "Using a notational system which records on-the-ball events taking place throughout a soccer match, the game can be broken down into a series of team possessions. To assess the effectiveness of a team possession, a quantitative variable is developed representing the probability of a goal being scored, minus the probability of one being conceded. This variable, called the yield, can be used to evaluate both the expected outcome of a team possession originating in a given situation, as well as the actual outcome of the possession. In this way, the effectiveness of different strategies occurring during the possession can be quantified and compared.\n      </p>", "We test whether attendances in team sports respond positively to the amount of uncertainty of the outcome between the competing teams in a match. Our results show that admissions at English soccer matches relate positively to the quality of teams involved and negatively to a measure of the relative win probabilities of the competing teams. The uncertainty measure is derived from a model of the betting market which corrects for specific biases tested for and identified in the odds in our data set. Although supporters appear to favour an uncertainty of outcome, a greater quality of strength across clubs may still yield a fall in aggregate attendance because of the extent to which home field advantage generates an uneven contest between similarly strong teams.\n      </p>", "Since 2005, Chile's professional soccer league has used a game-scheduling system that is based on an integer linear programming model. The Chilean league managers considered several operational, economic, and sporting criteria for the final tournaments' scheduling. Thus, they created a highly constrained problem that had been, in practice, unsolvable using their previous methodology. This led to the adoption of a model that used some techniques that were new in soccer-league sports scheduling. The schedules they generated provided the teams with benefits such as lower costs, higher incomes, and fairer seasons. In addition, the tournaments were more attractive to sports fans. The success of the new scheduling system has completely fulfilled the expectations of the Asociaci\u00f3n Nacional de F\u00fatbol Profesional (ANFP), the organization for Chilean professional soccer.\n      </p>", "The present study considers how the athletic performance of minority groups relates to national subjective well-being (SWB) and life expectancy. Based on the argument that sports represent a microcosm of society and the reliable finding that national inequality is associated with reduced SWB, we hypothesized that greater opportunities for typically disadvantaged groups within sports should be positively related to national indicators of well-being. Study 1 compared the relation of success in the Paralympics versus the Olympics to national subjective well-being and life expectancy. The results supported our hypothesis. In Study 2 we conceptually replicated these results using the standings of national men's and women's soccer teams. Overall, it appears that the opportunities to compete in sports that nations afford to members of disadvantaged groups reflect on the health and well-being of the entire society.\n      </p>", "Objectives: The objective of the study is to investigate the mortality experience of Italian soccer players and to discuss the findings in the light of possible long term effects of doping. Methods: Standardized proportionate mortality ratio (SPMR) and standardized proportionate cancer mortality ratio (SPCMR) were computed for 350 deceased subjects deriving from a list of about 24,000 active Italian soccer players from 1960 to 1996 in the three top leagues (A, B and C). Results: When considering SPMRs, there is a substantial adherence of observed to expected mortality, with the only exception of mortality for diseases of the nervous system (13 obs. vs. 6 exp.) mainly explained by an excess of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (8 obs. vs 0.69 exp.). As far as SPCMRs are concerned, some digestive cancers (namely: colon cancer, liver cancer and pancreas cancer) show a doubled risk. Conclusions: A high risk for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is observed among Italian soccer players. Epidemiological data on association between sport and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) are contrasting. On the basis of the overall available evidence we suggest a possible connection between dietary supplements or drugs used to enhance sporting performance and ALS pathogenesis. Further epidemiological studies are needed to confirm these specific mortality risks among soccer players.\n      </p>", "A common discussion subject for the male part of the population in particular is the prediction of the next week-end's soccer matches, especially for the local team. Knowledge of offensive and defensive skills is valuable in the decision process before making a bet at a book-maker. We take an applied statistician's approach to the problem, suggesting a Bayesian dynamic generalized linear model to estimate the time-dependent skills of all teams in a league, and to predict the next week-end's soccer matches. The problem is more intricate than it may appear at first glance, as we need to estimate the skills of all teams simultaneously as they are dependent. It is now possible to deal with such inference problems by using the Markov chain Monte Carlo iterative simulation technique. We show various applications of the proposed model based on the English Premier League and division 1 in 1997-1998: prediction with application to betting, retrospective analysis of the final ranking, the detection of surprising matches and how each team's properties vary during the season.\n      </p>", "This paper looks at how Nike's soccer ball suppliers (previous and current) in Sialkot (Pakistan) fare in relation to the company's code of ethics. While minimum required working conditions are implemented, the criteria for social and environmental compliance are not met with. The multinational's decision to withdraw orders from the previous supplier ostensibly due to allegations of child labour and unauthorised subcontracting hit large sections of the workforce, especially rural, low-skilled and female workers. Is it fair for multinationals to cut and run in such cases or should they find a solution to save thousands of livelihoods?\n      </p>", "This study examines the \"culture wars\" using the lens of attitudes toward soccer. Despite soccer's increasing popularity in the United States, anti-soccer rhetoric is fairly common. In his widely read book, How Soccer Explains the World (2004), Foer contends that the \"culture wars,\" including divisions over soccer, are better explained by reactions to globalization than social class or political ideology. Using data from a survey of Nebraskans, we find that attitudes about cultural globalization are the best predictor of soccer sentiment. Contrary to popular claims about the \"culture wars,\" most respondents were moderate in their attitudes toward both soccer and globalization.\n      </p>", "In this paper we estimate the best responses of soccer clubs to the choices of other clubs in Spanish and English leagues over the period 1994-2004. We find that choices are more closely approximated by win maximization than by profit maximization in both leagues. We examine club characteristics that might explain variations in choices between Spanish clubs.\n      </p>", "Least squares is used to fit a model to the individual match results in English football and to produce a home ground advantage effect for each team in addition to a team rating. We show that for a balanced competition this is equivalent to a simple calculator method using only data from the final ladder. The existence of a spurious home advantage is discussed. Home advantages for all teams in the English Football League from 1981-82 to 1990-91 are calculated, and some reasons for their differences investigated. A paired home advantage is defined and shown to be linearly related to the distance between club grounds.\n      </p>", "This article investigates how sports and popular music contributed to the formation of national consciousness during the immediate post-state-socialist period in Bulgaria. Throughout the difficult summers of 1994 and 1996, Bulgaria's success in international soccer championships briefly restored hope, confidence and national pride to many. Significantly, during the championships musicians produced new songs that celebrated the home team's victories in language and musical styles that referred overtly to the nation's shifting position vis \u00e0 vis the Balkans, the European Union and the western world.\n      </p>", "In this paper, we use operations research (OR) techniques to schedule the Second Division of the Chilean professional soccer league. The solution must satisfy a series of conditions requested by league officials. Because the teams generally travel long distances by bus, geographical restrictions are particularly important. We specify the scheduling problem and solve it using an integer linear programming (ILP) model that defines when and where each match is played, subject to constraints. For the most difficult instances, we formulate a second ILP model that generates home-away patterns and assigns them to the teams; we then run the model, which determines the match schedule. Chilean league officials have successfully used the models to schedule all five Second Division tournaments between 2007 and 2010, replacing the random scheduling methodology that they used previously. Since 2007, the two formulations have been adapted to various formats with which the Second Division has experimented; these include a quadruple round robin and a two-phase tournament with zonal and national phases. The application we present is one of a number of such projects that the authors and their colleagues developed over the past few years, and it represents an expansion of the use of OR techniques for managing tasks in Chilean soccer.\n      </p>", "What strategy should a football (soccer, in American parlance) club adopt when deciding whether to sack its manager? This paper introduces a simple model assuming that a club's objective is to maximize the number of league points that it scores per season. The club's strategy consists of three choices: the length of the honeymoon period during which it will not consider sacking a new manager, the level of the performance trapdoor below which the manager get the sack, and the weight that it will give to more recent games compared to earlier ones. Some data from the last six seasons of the English Premiership are used to calibrate the model. At this early stage of the research, the best strategy appears to have only a short honeymoon period of eight games (much less than the actual shortest period of 12 games), to set the trapdoor at 0.74 points per game, and to put 47% of the weight on the last five games. A club adopting this strategy would obtain on average 56.8 points per season, compared to a Premiership average of 51.8 points.\n      </p>", "Sports, with their massive investments in players and structures, have become a big business. Professional and amateur leagues face challenging problems, including logistics, revenue maximization, broadcast rights, fairness issues, game attractiveness, and security. The annual Brazilian soccer tournament is a compact, mirrored double round-robin tournament played by 20 teams in each of its two main divisions; it is possibly the world's most attractive soccer tournament because of the quality of the teams and players in the competition. With substantial revenue and community pride on the line, devising optimal schedules is crucial to players, teams, fans, sponsors, cities, and for security issues. Fair and balanced schedules for all teams are a major issue for ensuring attractiveness and confidence in the tournament outcome. The organizers seek schedules that satisfy a number of constraints. As often as possible, the most important games should be played in weekend rounds so that the open TV channels can broadcast many attractive games. We describe the integer programming formulation of the scheduling problem and the three-phase decomposition approach we proposed for solving it. We also report on the practical experience we observed after two years of running the system and the main results achieved during its successful history.\n      </p>", "We evaluated the occurrence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in 97 former soccer players who played in Recife, Brazil in the 1960s and 1970s, and analysed the risk factors for infection, such as history of transfusions, surgery, tattoos, piercings, and the use of illicit drugs or injectable vitamin complexes. Immunochromatographic testing was performed to detect anti-HCV antibodies. All former soccer players were men (mean age 59.2 years), of whom 62 (64%) and 35 (36%) were classified as amateurs and professionals, respectively. Seven (7.2%) tested positive for anti-HCV antibodies; three (4.8%) were amateurs, and four (11.4%) were professionals. In univariate analysis, transfusion, surgery, and use of injectable vitamin complexes were associated with HCV infection, while in multivariate analysis, only the use of injectable vitamin complexes was related (P=0.0005). We observed a high frequency of HCV infection in former soccer players, especially in professionals who used injectable vitamin complexes.\n      </p>", "The probability P(\u03bb,\u03bc) that a team with mean score \u03bb beats a team with mean score \u03bc, is calculated when the score of each team is Poisson distributed. It is found that \u2202 P(\u03bb, \u03bc)/\u2202\u03bb is equal to the probability of a tie. When this equality holds for any distribution of the score of the team with mean \u03bc, it is shown that the score of the team with mean \u03bb must be Poisson distributed. The Poisson distribution is shown to fit certain baseball data, and it is also applied to some soccer data.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Using a novel proxy for investors' expectations based on contracts traded on betting exchanges (prediction markets), we find that within our sample, investor sentiment is attributable, in part, to a systematic bias in investors' ex ante expectations. Investors are overly optimistic about their teams' prospects ex ante and, on average, end up disappointed ex post, leading to negative postgame abnormal returns.

Surprisingly, soccer clubs do not profit from the expected rents. The purpose of this study is to explain such contradictory evidence. Our model and empirical test, using data obtained from the Spanish professional soccer league for the season 2001/2002, suggests that monopsony rents that the clubs were to obtain from most of the soccer players would eventually revert to the superstars. The study also illustrates that the market value of players stems both from their sporting performance and their economic contribution.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

This loss effect is stronger in small stocks and in more important games, and is robust to methodological changes. We also document a loss effect after international cricket, rugby, and basketball games.\n      </p>", "An x-ray crystal structure that confirms the soccer ball-shaped carbon framework of C$_{60}$ (buckminsterfullerene) is reported.

The purpose of this form of analysis is to help model interactions in which the parties involved may have quite different perceptions of the \"game\" being played. Soccer hooliganism is considered in terms of an interaction between two main parties-the \"hooligan fans\" and the \"authorities\". Recent empirical studies are used to help build up representations of some possible \"games\" that may be seen by each side. From the resulting hypergames, predictions are derived as to the likely outcome under various circumstances. Also considered are possible effects of taking the interaction through several \"rounds\".

In this paper we explore the roots of these perceptions by examining the social history of these two clubs specifically, and the Ghanaian soccer league system in general, with an eye for the actors, practices and events that injected political airs into purportedly 'apolitical' athletic competitions. With this social history clearly defining the popularly perceived 'us' versus 'them' of the Hearts/Kotoko rivalry, we analyse on the basis of a modest survey some of the assumptions these widely held stereotypes rely upon. We find that ethnicity and location matter both in terms of predicting one's affinity for a given soccer club and partisan inclinations. These factors do not, however, completely dispel the relationship between sports and politics as spurious. Though not conclusive, there is enough evidence collected in the survey to suggest that one's preferred club, even when controlling for ethnicity and location, does have an effect on one's partisan leanings, or perhaps vice versa. This finding highlights the independent role that often-understudied cultural politics can play.\n      </p>", "Este artigo aborda os processos de identidade transnacional adaptativa relacionados com o soccer entre as comunidades imigrantes lus\u00f3fonas na Nova Inglaterra.

We develop a DP formulation to derive quantitatively the optimal substitution strategy of a team, in relation to the number required of each type of outfield player. We demonstrate how this approach may help to determine how many of each type of player should start a match and be substituted during a match. We also show how the expected league points would increase if the optimal strategy were followed.\n      </p>", "Models based on the bivariate Poisson distribution are used for modelling sports data. Independent Poisson distributions are usually adopted to model the number of goals of two competing teams. We replace the independence assumption by considering a bivariate Poisson model and its extensions. The models proposed allow for correlation between the two scores, which is a plausible assumption in sports with two opposing teams competing against each other. The effect of introducing even slight correlation is discussed. Using just a bivariate Poisson distribution can improve model fit and prediction of the number of draws in football games. The model is extended by considering an inflation factor for diagonal terms in the bivariate joint distribution. This inflation improves in precision the estimation of draws and, at the same time, allows for overdispersed, relative to the simple Poisson distribution, marginal distributions. The properties of the models proposed as well as interpretation and estimation procedures are provided.

Main outcome measures\u2014Acute sports injuries requiring medical treatment and reported to the insurance company on structured forms by the patients and their doctors. Results\u201454 186 sports injuries were recorded. Injury rates were low in athletes aged under 15, while 20-24 year olds had the highest rates. Differences in injury rates between the sports were minor in this adult age group. Overall injury rates were higher in sports entailing more frequent and powerful body contact. Each sport had a specific injury profile. Fractures and dental injuries were most common in ice hockey and karate and least frequent in volleyball. Knee injuries were the most common cause of permanent disability. Conclusions\u2014Based on the defined injury profiles in the different sports it is recommended that sports specific preventive measures should be employed to decrease the number of violent contacts between athletes, including improved game rules supported by careful refereeing.

The 'friendly' soccer game between the two national teams become a symbolic space, another occasion, for remembering the French-Algerian colonial past. Moreover, it represented an opportunity to reposition Algeria in the international (sporting) arena, and more importantly, to reassert social ties between Algerians, as part of the post-conflict process for national reconciliation.

The results also indicate that a win in a European Cup does not affect clubs' stock returns. However, a domestic win effect is significantly higher than the effect of a European Cup win. The price reaction of stocks also depends on the type of corporation that the clubs establish when they go public.\n      </p>", "This paper examines the relationship between financial inequality, competitive balance and attendance at English professional league soccer. It shows that while financial inequality among the clubs has increased, competitive balance has remained relatively stable and match attendance appears unrelated to competitive balance.

Because income inequality is primarily driven by inter- rather than intra-divisional inequality, the FA Cup has been a much more unbalanced competition than the divisional championships.

The World Cup illuminates the mentalit\u00e9 of late 1930s sportifs as well as that of the intellectuals and politicians who had come to take sport and culture physique seriously as a source of national salvation, and it demonstrates how attitudes toward sport and the male sporting body had become entwined with contemporary concerns about \"national decline.\" The tournament reminds us that the sports stadium functioned as a contested political space in interwar France, even if the World Cup ultimately shows the dominance of the allegedly politically neutral values of sportivit\u00e9 over those of engagement. /// L'\u00e9tude de la Coupe du Monde de football disput\u00e9e dans les stades fran\u00e7ais en juin 1938 permet de mieux comprendre les concepts de sport et de culture physique \u00e0 la fin des ann\u00e9es 1930, et combien le sport \u00e9tait devenu un produit int\u00e9gr\u00e9 dans la langue et l'\u00e9conomie du spectacle.

Previous studies of behaviour of soccer referees have not adequately incorporated within-game information. Descriptive statistics from our samples clearly show that home teams receive fewer yellow and red cards than away teams. These differences may be wrongly interpreted as evidence of bias where the modeller has failed to include withingame events such as goals scored and recent cards issued. What appears as referee favouritism may actually be excessive and illegal aggressive behaviour by players in teams that are behind in score. We deal with these issues by using a minute-by-minute bivariate probit analysis of yellow and red cards issued in games over six seasons in the two leagues. The significance of a variable to denote the difference in score at the time of sanction suggests that foul play that is induced by a losing position is an important influence on the award of yellow and red cards. Controlling for various pre-game and within-game variables, we find evidence that is indicative of home team favouritism induced by crowd pressure: in Germany home teams with running tracks in their stadia attract more yellow and red cards than teams playing in stadia with less distance between the crowd and the pitch. Separating the competing teams in matches by favourite and underdog status, as perceived by the betting market, yields further evidence, this time for both leagues, that the source of home teams receiving fewer cards is not just that they are disproportionately often the favoured team and disproportionately ahead in score. Thus there is evidence that is consistent with pure referee bias in relative treatments of home and away teams.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Will European football keep leagues open, or adopt the American system of closed leagues?

First, the contemporary scientific mode that most social sciences simply take for granted and assume, quite unthinkingly, to be universally applicable and valid in all circumstances. Second, because the discussion uses African materials and empirical examples drawn from the realm of football, the article also explores a mode of causation based on the active manipulation of supernatural forces that in much of Africa is usually called witchcraft or sorcery. The essay begins with a general examination of how these two modes of understanding causation play themselves out in African football with examples drawn largely from the 2002 World Cup. It then presents a more focused analysis of one match between the national sides of Uganda and Rwanda that occurred in 2003 to demonstrate the interplay of science and sorcery in a more'controlled' manner.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Illness was associated with touching a reusable grocery bag or consuming its packaged food contents (risk difference, 0.636; P&lt;.01). By polymerase chain reaction, GII norovirus was recovered from the bag, which had been stored in a bathroom used before the outbreak by a person with norovirus-like illness. Airborne contamination of fomites can lead to subsequent point-source outbreaks. When feasible, we recommend dedicated bathrooms for sick persons and informing cleaning staff (professional or otherwise) about the need for adequate environmental sanitation of surfaces and fomites to prevent spread.\n      </p>", "The minimax argument represents game theory in its most elegant form: simple but with stark predictions. Although some of these predictions have been met with reasonable success in the field, experimental data have generally not provided results close to the theoretical predictions. In a striking study, Palacios-Huerta and Volij (2008) presented evidence that potentially resolves this puzzle: both amateur and professional soccer players play nearly exact minimax strategies in laboratory experiments. In this paper, we establish important bounds on these results by examining the behavior of four distinct subject pools: college students, bridge professionals, world-class poker players, who have vast experience with high-stakes randomization in card games, and American professional soccer players. In contrast to Palacios-Huerta and Volij's results, we find little evidence that real-world experience transfers to the lab in these games\u2014 indeed, similar to previous experimental results, all four subject pools provide choices that are generally not close to minimax predictions. We use two additional pieces of evidence to explore why professionals do not perform well in the lab: (i) complementary experimental treatments that pit professionals against preprogrammed computers and (ii) post-experiment questionnaires. The most likely explanation is that these professionals are unable to transfer their skills at randomization from the familiar context of the field to the unfamiliar context of the lab.\n      </p>"],
