{"total_words": 491, "documents": ["Past research on the intergenerational transmission of parenting concentrates on the continuity of harsh or abusive parenting, for the most part relying on retrospective reports of early upbringing. This study investigates the intergenerational transmission of constructive parenting using a 3-wave longitudinal data set that has spanned 2 decades, obtaining the respondents' contemporaneous reports in early adolescence, early adulthood, and middle adulthood respectively (N = 2,338). The results support the hypotheses that interpersonal relations, social participation, and role-specific modeling explain the intergenerational continuity of constructive parenting.\n      </p>", "Positive parenting is hampered by social-contextual risks--lack of income, education, and support, as well as maternal mental illness--but current models do not examine the effect of each factor in concert with the others. Using structural equation modeling and a community sample (N = 202) of African American mothers diagnosed with depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia, we examined the direct and indirect effects of poverty, maternal education, social support, material and social stress, current mental health, and psychiatric history on positive parenting attitudes, involvement in children's education, and authoritative parenting style. The strongest predictors of parenting attitudes were stress and current mental health. Parenting attitudes were the strongest predictors of parent involvement and style but stress and current mental health were also predictive. Involvement was also predicted by maternal education and social support.\n      </p>", "This study focuses on strengths and challenges of poor rural African American parents. Ninety-two participants responded to semis-tructured interview questions about parenting, religiosity, and stress. Parents who are more religious reported using fewer coercive parenting strategies and experiencing fewer stressful life events. These findings are discussed in terms of practical implications for professionals who support rural African American families.\n      </p>", "Using data on 11,044 adolescents from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we examine the relationship between parenting practices and the composition of an adolescent's friendship network. In general, parent-child relationship quality, selecting a neighborhood because of its schools, and parents supervision are negatively associated with having a more delinquent friendship network but positively associated with having a more prosocial network. These results suggest that parents have the capacity to shape the characteristics of their child's friendship networks, even after taking into account the likelihood that adolescents have friends who are similar to themselves.\n      </p>", "An ecological model of human development was used to assess the interrelationship between psychological determinants of parenting, parental age, and parenting skill for a sample of 210 parents. Parents' race was found to be significantly related to attitudes toward childrearing, knowledge of child development, and perceived social support. Punitive attitudes toward childrearing and parental race were significant predictors of the quality of parenting with more punitive and younger parents having less supportive and less nurturant home environments.\n      </p>", "The purpose of this paper is to determine whether divorced parents exhibit a diminished capacity to parent in the period following divorce. Using 2 waves of data from a national survey of Canadian children, the current study prospectively follows 5,004 children living in 2-biological parent households at initial interview and compares changes in parenting practices between households that subsequently divorce and those that remain intact. Results show that divorce is unrelated to changes in parenting behavior, suggesting that there are more similarities than differences in parenting among recently divorced and continuously married parents.\n      </p>", "Data from the 1988 National Survey on Families and Households were analyzed to examine the associations among marital conflict, ineffective parenting, and children's and adolescents' maladjustment. Parents' use of harsh discipline and low parental involvement helped explain the connection between marital conflict and children's maladjustment in children aged 2 through 11. Parent-child conflict was measured only in families with a target teenager and also was a significant mediator. Although ineffective parenting explained part of the association between marital conflict and children's maladjustment, independent effects of marital conflict remained in families with target children aged 2 through 11 (but not for families with a teenager). With a few exceptions, this pattern of findings was consistent for mothers' and fathers' reports, for daughters and sons, for families with various ethnic backgrounds, and for families living in and out of poverty.\n      </p>", "A stress-buffering hypothesis for parenting was tested in a county-representative sample of 218 divorced fathers. Social support for parenting (emergency and nonemergency child care, practical support, financial support) was hypothesized to moderate effects of stress (role overload, coparental conflict, and daily hassles) on fathers' quality parenting. No custody fathers relied more on relatives compared with custodial fathers, who relied more on new partners for parenting support. No differences by custody status were found on levels of support or parenting over time. Parenting support buffered effects of change in role overload and coparenting conflict on coercive parenting and buffered effects of change in daily hassles on prosocial parenting. Buffer effects were more predictive over time. Implications for practice and preventive intervention strategies are discussed.\n      </p>", "Many former spouses have different and often conflicting perceptions of their postdivorce circumstances, particularly as they relate to parenting and custody. Using a symbolic interactionism framework, our study examined the relationship between these perceptual differences and coparental conflict (N = 112; representing 56 previously married couples). For both mothers and fathers, perceptual divergence regarding fathers' child-rearing skills and perceptual divergence regarding mothers' willingness to be accommodating emerged as predictors of conflict. An overestimation of custody satisfaction by the former spouse also was associated positively with conflict.\n      </p>", "This study explored the relationship between empathy and parenting strategy choices. Participants read one of four vignettes depicting either a male or female child with either a history of acting-out or good behavior. Participants rated the likelihood of choosing a number of parenting strategies. Results indicated that the good child received more reward and talking strategies, whereas the acting-out child received more negative and ignoring interventions. Empathy was negatively related to the use of negative and ignoring parenting strategies.\n      </p>", "Alcohol use increases throughout adolescence. Based on family socialization theory, it was hypothesized that family factors, particularly parental support and monitoring, would influence individual trajectories in the development of alcohol misuse. Six waves of data were analyzed, based on interviews with 506 adolescents in the general population of a northeastern metropolitan area. Using growth-curve longitudinal analysis, results show that parenting significantly predicts adolescents' initial drinking levels (intercepts) as well as their rates of increase in alcohol misuse (slope). This study provides evidence that effective parenting is an important factor in preventing alcohol misuse.\n      </p>", "This study examined predictors of intervention-induced resilience in children of divorce whose mothers participated in a preventive parenting program. Contextual, maternal, and child factors were examined as predictors of improved child adjustment using two strategies: (a) within-group analyses conducted with program participants and (b) between-group analyses, in which relations in the parenting intervention were compared with those in a control condition. Between-group analyses showed that children were less likely to maintain program gains in externalizing when maternal demoralization was high or when children's self-regulatory skills were low. Implications for program modification and methodology for studying predictors of program benefit are discussed.\n      </p>", "The current study utilized a social exchange perspective to examine relations among 74 adolescent mothers' perceptions of barriers to father engagement, parenting alliance strength, and nonresident fathers' engagement in caregiving and nurturing activities with their children. Even after accounting for mothers' perceptions of barrier strength, mothers who viewed the parenting alliance as strong also perceived fathers as more engaged in caregiving activities. A more complex pattern emerged for mothers' perceptions of father engagement in nurturing activities, such that relations between barrier strength and fathers' nurturing depended on the parents' relationship status and parenting alliance strength. Our findings suggest the importance of helping young parents strengthen their coparenting relationship in order to foster fathers' engagement with their children.\n      </p>", "Using data from the National Survey of Families and Households, this paper reports a study of cultural variations in parenting of mothers and fathers in two-parent families. Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, and Asian-American parents were assessed in terms of parenting attitudes, parenting behaviors, and parenting involvement. Multivariate analyses of covariance and analyses of covariance with socioeconomic status as the covariate indicated more similarities than differences between and among the four parenting groups. However, as a group, the ethnic parents indicated a greater general emphasis on their children exercising self-control and succeeding in school than did Caucasian parents.\n      </p>", "The effects of parental attitudes, practices, and television mediation on adolescent sexual behaviors were investigated in a study of adolescent sexuality and media (N = 887). Confirmatory factor analyses supported an eight-factor parenting model with television mediation factors as constructs distinct from general parenting practices. Logistic regressions indicated that adolescents reporting greater parental disapproval and limits on viewing at Wave 1 were less likely to initiate oral sex between Waves 1 and 2. Adolescents who reported more sexual communication with parents were more likely to initiate oral sex. Results for vaginal intercourse were similar to those for oral sex. Coviewing was a significant negative predictor of initiation of sexual behavior. Parental attitudes and television mediation can delay potentially risky adolescent sexual behaviors.\n      </p>", "This investigation tested whether parenting mediates longitudinal associations between marital conflict and children's adjustment. Data were drawn from a three-wave study of 283 families with children aged 8-16 years at Wave 1. Relations among marital conflict, parenting (behavioral control, psychological autonomy, and warmth), and children's adjustment (externalizing and internalizing) were examined. Structural equation models indicated multiple dimensions of parenting mediated relations between marital conflict and children's adjustment. When including controls for earlier adjustment, behavioral control continued to mediate relations between marital conflict and change in children's internalizing symptoms over time. These results advance parenting process models for relations between marital conflict and child adjustment and provide impetus for study of other pathways, including direct and child effects.\n      </p>", "Do adults' perceptions of their mothers' and fathers' parenting practices in childhood vary by their mothers' employment status? Among adults in the Survey of Midlife Development in United States who lived with 2 biological parents until the age of 16 years (N = 2,246), those who had employed mothers during most or all of their childhood reported less support and less discipline from both parents than those who had stay-at-home mothers. Sons but not daughters who had employed mothers reported more verbal or physical assaults by both parents than their counterparts who had homemaker mothers. Despite greater social acceptance of maternal employment among younger Americans, cohort differences were not evident. These findings underscore the significance of mothers' economic roles in influencing offspring's perceptions of family dynamics.\n      </p>", "This article defines and discusses the advantages of parenting coalitions when children have contact with both of their parents after divorce and remarriage. It outlines the developmental sequence leading to such coalitions and describes common obstacles encountered by the adults. The major focus is on therapeutic interventions which can help the adults form parenting coalitions, illustrated with case examples.\n      </p>", "We examined reported parenting and disciplinary practices in 114 working and middle class African American mothers of children aged 5-12 using the Parenting Dimensions Inventory (PDI; Power, 1991). Results indicated substantive variation among parents in their disciplinary strategies. Reasoning, which is characteristic of authoritative parenting, was the most frequently reported strategy. Factor analyses were conducted on mother's responses to PDI items, and sociodemographic and psychological variables were related to the identified factors. Maternal education, socioeconomic status, childrearing history, and maternal depression differentially predicted child-centered parenting, reasoning, and mothers' tendencies to let a situation go. The importance of extending theoretical and empirical models of parenting determinants to underrepresented segments of African American families is emphasized in order to gain a fuller understanding of the factors that contribute to diverse styles of parenting in such groups.\n      </p>", "One hundred twenty-eight inmates and 337 non-inmates completed parenting questionnaires that assessed retrospective perceptions of their fathers' and mothers' authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive parenting styles, as well as the stylistic dimensions found within the three styles. Inmates reported higher incidence than non-inmates of both authoritarian and permissive parenting styles and dimensions, and lower incidence of the authoritative parenting style and dimensions. Significant interactions between inmate status and parent gender and child gender were also found. Recommendations for family life educators in prison settings are outlined.\n      </p>", "Family stress theory can explain associations between contextual stressors and parenting. The theory, however, has not been tested among Mexican Americans or expanded to include cultural-contextual risks. This study examined associations between neighborhood, economic, and acculturative stressors and parenting behaviors in a sample of 570 two-parent Mexican American families. Results support the negative impact of economic stress on parenting through parental depressive symptoms. Neighborhood stress influenced fathers' depressive symptoms and parenting, but not mothers'. The effects of acculturative stress were inconsistent. Results suggest that contextual stressors common to Mexican American families impact\n      </p>", "In this study, 178 subjects responded to 6 vignettes which briefly described normal, egocentric and annoying behaviors of a preschool child, by selecting a preferred choice from among three responses that had been designed to match Baumrind's authoritative, permissive, or authoritarian parenting style categories. Parental responses appeared to vary with the child's behavior, as well as with the adult's sex, age, and experience in parenting.\n      </p>", "Chinese parenting has historically been seen as more \"authoritarian\" than mainstream American culture. Recent research suggests that authoritarian parenting may be a Western concept that does not accurately depict Chinese socialization. This exploratory study sought qualitative information on the parenting style of Chinese immigrants. Results revealed central themes of watchful and subtle influence to conform with parental expectations. These expectations arose from parents' desires for their children to succeed and be \"good people.\" Thus, aspects of Chinese parenting that have traditionally been ascribed to an \"authoritarian\" style may stem from an entirely different set of parenting attitudes and beliefs that are culturally-based.\n      </p>", "Conventional images of motherhood and fatherhood, social interactions, and gender-based job pressures push couples toward unequal parenting. Equally sharing parents resist those pressures, and construct equality through everyday negotiations and ongoing decisions about family and work. They do not believe that mothers are more responsible for children, or more suited to care for them, than fathers. They avoid gender-based decisions about jobs that reinforce a gender-based division of labor at home. Qualitative research is necessary to unravel the complex interactions between work and family arrangements, and to show how economic, social, and ideological factors constrain family arrangements, but are also transformed in their creation.\n      </p>", "Relationships among parenting self-efficacy, general self-efficacy, child and maternal characteristics, and parenting satisfaction in 145 mothers of school-aged children were examined. Higher parenting self-efficacy was observed in mothers of less emotional and more sociable children, and among mothers who were better educated, had higher family incomes, and reported more previous experience with children. Higher parenting self-efficacy and several mother and child variables predicted greater satisfaction with parenting. Influences of mothers' experience with children other than their own and maternal education on parenting satisfaction were mediated by parenting self-efficacy. Suggestions concerning the conceptualization and measurement of parenting self-efficacy are provided.\n      </p>", "Undergraduate women students were administered a questionnaire during the spring semesters of 1972 and 1979 and their attitudes toward parenting assessed. When compared to the 1972 sample, the 1979 sample desired fewer children, was more accepting of non-parenting decisions, expressed more uncertainty regarding desire for parenting as a factor in selection of a mate, and appeared less concerned about overpopulation. These findings are discussed in the context of changes in sex roles during the 1970's.\n      </p>", "This study used the content analysis research technique to identify parenting behaviors portrayed in family-oriented, prime-time television programs. The behaviors coded reflected performance of the parental role, child rearing patterns, and children's responses to those roles and patterns. Results indicated that relatively large numbers of parenting behaviors were being shown in the programs viewed. Television fathers were somewhat more active as parents than were mothers and both mothers and fathers were portrayed in traditional ways, even though many more nontraditional than traditional family structures were represented. Television children responded differently to performance of parental roles and to child rearing patterns according to sex of the television parent. Several recommendations were made for parent and family life education and further related research based on the findings.\n      </p>", "We explore dyadic parenting styles and their association with first-grade children's externalizing behavior Symptoms in a sample of 85 working-class, dual-earner families. Cluster analysis is used to create a typology of parenting types, reflecting the parental warmth, overreactivity, and laxness ofboth mothers and fathers in two-parent families. Three distinct groups emerged: Supportive Parents, Mixed-Support Parents, and Unsupportive Parents. Results indicate that dyadic parenting styles were related to teacher-reported externalizing Symptoms for boys but not for girls.\n      </p>", "Thirty-one married couples (62 subjects) participated in this study of the effect of parenting courses on family relationships. Sixteen subjects (8 couples) participated in parenting courses (either Parent Effectiveness Training, P. E. T., or Systematic Training for Effective Parenting, STEP) with their spouses, while for the other 23 couples only one member participated. The courses are generally seen as beneficial, and there are no differences in perceived effectiveness between P. E. T. and S. T. E. P. Couples where both members participated perceive the course as no more effective than do those where only one member participated, and low marital adjustment subjects rate their relationships as improved over the course.\n      </p>", "The purpose of this exploratory study was to examine the relationship between perceptions of the parenting alliance, marital quality, and the amount of involvement fathers have in raising their young children. Subjects were 89 predominately White, two-parent families with preschool aged children. Self-report and interview data were collected to measure each parent's participation in three categories of parental involvement (interaction, accessibility, and responsibility), as well as perceptions of the parenting alliance and marital quality. Multiple regression procedures suggested that fathers' perceptions of spouses' confidence in their own parenting, as well as mother's emotional appraisal of their partners' parenting and their shared parenting philosophy were significant predictors of father involvement in child rearing activities. Results are discussed in terms of future research on paternal involvement, as well as for the development of intervention programs designed to facilitate increased levels of father involvement in child rearing.\n      </p>", "This study draws data from the Family Life Project to examine parenting behaviors observed for 105 mothers and grandmothers raising an infant in rural low-income multigenerational households. Multilevel models are used to examine the relationships between maternal age and psychological distress and parenting of the infant by both generations. The findings indicate that young maternal age is a risk factor for less sensitive parenting in the presence of other risks, including psychological distress. Further, young maternal age is associated with negative parenting behaviors by grandmothers only. Grandmothers and mothers displayed similar levels of negative intrusive parenting, but different factors were linked to the observed parenting of each generation. These findings contribute to understanding the benefits and risks of three-generation households.\n      </p>", "Children's genotypes and their social relationships are correlated throughout their development. Heritable characteristics of children evoke strong and specific responses from their parents; frequently, these same heritable characteristics also influence the children's adjustment. Moreover, parental heritable traits that influence their parenting are also transmitted to children and influence their children's adjustment. Thus, genetically influenced evocative processes from children and parental-transmission mechanisms influence the covariances between measures of family relationships and child development. These findings suggest new targets for preventing adverse development: altering parental responses to heritable characteristics of children and influencing the genetically influenced ontogeny of parenting.\n      </p>", "The purpose of this study is to examine the association between interparental conflict and parenting using meta-analytic review techniques. One-hundred and thirty-eight effect sizes from 39 studies are analyzed. The overall average weighted effect size is -.62, indicating a moderate association and support for the spillover hypothesis. The parenting behaviors most impacted by interparental conflict are harsh discipline and parental acceptance. Several moderating effects for subject and method characteristics are significant.\n      </p>", "Three general areas of research and social concern pertaining to parenting are discussed within an international perspective focusing on recent social changes as well as on constructs of parenting. First, I critique ideological biases arising out of a particular Western definition of parenting\u2014in this case, mothering\u2014that affect research paradigms. This critique is then expanded by linking it to current international social changes in order to offer a glimpse into areas of parenting that could be addressed empirically. And, third, consideration of socioeconomic changes and upheavals leads to the suggestion that the experience of parenting may become more difficult in the near future in most countries of the world. This discussion is informed by a critical analysis based on perspectives that view childhood, and hence parenting, as social constructs evolving with sociohistorical changes.\n      </p>", "Guided by family stress theory, relations among neighborhood stress, maternal psychological functioning, and parenting were examined among 123 low-income, urban-dwelling, African American single mothers. Using a longitudinal design, structural equation modeling was employed to test the hypothesis that neighborhood stress results in poorer parenting over time through its detrimental effect on maternal psychological functioning. Social support from family and friends was examined as a potential moderator of the association between neighborhood stress and parenting behavior. Results indicated that higher levels of neighborhood stress were related to greater psychological distress among mothers, which in turn, was significantly related to less engagement in positive parenting practices approximately 15 months later. A moderating effect emerged for social support, however, such that the proposed model provided a better fit for mothers reporting low levels of perceived social support than for mothers reporting high levels. Implications of the findings for prevention and intervention are discussed.\n      </p>", "This study examined the relations among family income, social support, parental depression, and parenting among 290 predominantly rural families with children at risk for disruptive or socially withdrawn behaviors. Structural equation modeling and multiple regression were used, and the results showed that low family income was related to high levels of parental depression, which in turn were associated with disruptive parenting. The findings also showed that social support mediated the adverse relationship between low family income and parental depression. Social support was directly related to positive parenting and indirectly related to parent-child relational\n      </p>", "Data on 51 fathers and their preschool-aged children were collected for this study on the relations between fathers' job complexity, values of self-direction versus conformity, and perceptions of nurturant and restrictive parenting and children's depression and aggression. Bivariate correlations revealed that fathers' job complexity was related to values, and values were related to fathers' perceptions of parenting. Fathers' values of self-direction and perceptions of nurturant parenting predicted children's depression but not aggression. Implications for practitioners and family life educators are discussed.\n      </p>", "Using data from a nationally representative panel of parents interviewed in 1988 and 1992, we report a model of parenting satisfaction, with particular attention to marital happiness, family structure, and parents' gender. Cross-sectional analyses show that parenting satisfaction is significantly higher for married parents with high marital quality, for those who are parenting their own biological children, and for mothers. Panel analyses reveal that satisfaction with parenting is highly stable over this 4-year period but is positively related to increases in marital quality. Further consideration of this association using structural equation models indicates that reciprocal paths between marital happiness and parenting satisfaction are statistically significant and are of approximately equal strength and that these associations operate similarly for mothers and fathers. The results support the need for greater attention to parental satisfaction as a factor that can have independent effects on marital happiness and perhaps other dimensions of family life.\n      </p>", "Parenting self-efficacy is a crucial component of parenting competence. In this study, we examine differences in parenting self-efficacy and the relationship of social support to parenting self-efficacy for HIV-infected and uninfected mothers. We test competing hypotheses about how social support may relate to self-efficacy in the two groups of women. Participants were 205 African American mothers, one third of whom were infected with HIV. Results indicate that HIV-infected mothers reported lower levels of parenting self-efficacy than did mothers who were not infected. Furthermore, the relationship between social support and parenting self-efficacy differed according to HIV status.\n      </p>", "Mothers' perceptions of their competence in managing selected parenting tasks were examined for five stages of parenting (Infancy, Toddlerhood, Preschool, Schoolage, and Adolescence). Subjects were selected from a list of mothers who had scheduled appointments for their children at a private pediatric office. Overall, these mothers reported feeling highly competent in most areas of parenting; however, each stage presented unique challenges. Mothers of adolescents felt the least comfortable about their effectiveness in their parenting role. The findings are discussed with regard to their implications for parent education programs.\n      </p>", "The relationship between parents' knowledge about child development and their ability to design a quality home learning environment was examined. Two hundred and forty-three black and white mothers of infants were studied. Controlling for income and education, parents who knew more about critical environmental factors and infant normative development did score higher on the parenting skill measure.\n      </p>", "There exists a need for a comprehensive understanding of adolescent parenting, especially the analysis of cross-ethnic populations. To date, examinations have included primarily Euro-American, followed by African-American, and Hispanic-American populations (Wasserman, Rauh, Brunelli, Garcia-Castro, &amp; Necos, 1990). Despite high rates of teenage parenting on the Navajo Reservation, no investigations of this population exist. In this manuscript, two studies exploring adolescent parenting among Navajo adolescent women are described. The first investigation included Navajo adolescent mothers living in a rural, Navajo Reservation community. This investigation was based on the tenets of the Process Model of Parenting Competence (Belsky, Robins, &amp; Gamble, 1984), and employed quantitative techniques to explore factors posited as predicting parenting competence among adult and adolescent populations. Correlational analyses revealed associations in the expected directions suggesting the variables posited by the model are associated in the hypothesized ways for a young native group. A follow-up, qualitative investigation was conducted with a comparable sample of American Indian Navajo adolescent mothers. Interviews focused on factors posited by Belsky et al. (1984) for determining parenting behavior and revealed significant within group differences. Suggestions for future research are discussed.\n      </p>"], "words": {"particularly": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "chinese": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "among":
