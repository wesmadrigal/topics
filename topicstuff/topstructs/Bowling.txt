{"total_words": 343, "documents": ["Earlier analysis of basketball data debunked the common perception that players sometimes have \"hot hands.\" That analysis, however, did not control for several confounding influences. Our analysis of professional bowling indicates that, for many bowlers, the probability of rolling a strike is not independent of previous outcomes and the number of strikes rolled varies more across games than can be explained by chance alone. For example, most bowlers have a higher strike proportion after j consecutive strikes than after j consecutive nonstrikes, and this difference becomes more pronounced as j increas from 1 to 4.\n      </p>", "On the basis of an analysis of approximately 2,100 five-pin bowling scores, it is shown that the logarithms of bowling scores are approximately normally distributed. This distributional result is useful in calculating probabilistic quantities of interest.\n      </p>", "An examination of variation in Poa annua L. provided evidence for population differentiation between two bowling greens and their adjacent flower beds. The bowling green populations consisted almost entirely of prostrate individuals, whereas the flower bed populations were more heterogeneous, containing both erect and prostrate growth forms. Family trials indicated that vegetative and floral erectness, and time from sowing to anthesis were under genetic control. Erect families came into flower significantly quicker than prostrate families. Moreover, there were significant differences, both between and within families, for each of the two growth forms in mean number of days from sowing to anthesis. An investigation was conducted using gel electrophoretic techniques to examine the genetic structure of these populations of P. annua, and to estimate the amount of natural outcrossing. The esterase enzyme system was found to consist of multiple molecular forms. No apparent banding differences were found which distinguished erect and prostrate growth forms. Heterogeneity of banding patterns was discovered within both growth form groups, suggesting that each of the prostrate and erect growth forms consisted of more than one genotype. Evidence that the observed banding patterns were under genetic control was obtained from the examination of four families derived from selfed heterozygotes, which yielded segregating patterns within families. Both erect and prostrate growth forms, in the area under study, had the chromosome number 2n = 28.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Most prominent among these are generational replacement, the spread of television, rising geographic mobility, increasing time pressure, marital instability, and the decline of religious affiliations. In Bowling Alone, Robert Putnam (Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community, Simon and Schuster, New York, 2000) lends credibility to the claim that these factors are at least related to the decline of participation levels in the United States, and might even be regarded as an underlying cause. In this paper, the author assesses whether these variables also have a bearing on the participation level of the Belgian population. The analysis of a Belgian survey (N = 1341) shows that for most of the invoked causes, the relation is not significant, although the decline in religious affiliation does seem a likely candidate for further research. The paper closes with some suggestions for future research on civic engagement.

Parmi les plus importants citons le renouvellement des g\u00e9n\u00e9rations, la diffusion de la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision, une plus grande mobilit\u00e9 g\u00e9ographique, l'augmentation du stress, de l'instabilit\u00e9 maritale et le d\u00e9clin de l'engagement religieux. Dans Bowling Alone Robert Putman (2000) accr\u00e9dite l'hypoth\u00e8se selon laquelle ces facteurs seraient au moins li\u00e9s au d\u00e9clin du niveau de participation constat\u00e9 au Etats Unis, et pourraient m\u00eame \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme la cause sous-jacente.

In der Literatur zu einem m\u00f6glichen R\u00fcckgang des Partizipationsniveaus werden mehrere Faktoren als angebliche Ursachen dieses Trends angef\u00fchrt. Die herausragendsten unter diesen Faktoren sind der Generationenwandel, die Verbreitung des Fernsehens, zunehmende geographische Mobilit\u00e4t, zunehmender Zeitdruck, Instabilit\u00e4t der ehelichen Beziehungen und der R\u00fcckgang religi\u00f6ser Bindungen. In seinem Buch \u201eBowling Alone\u201d (2000) hat Robert Putnam dieser Behauptung insofern Glaubw\u00fcrdigkeit verliehen als dass er nachwies, dass diese Faktoren zumindest in Beziehung stehen zum R\u00fcckgang des Partizipationsniveaus in den Vereinigten Staaten und vielleicht sogar als dieser Entwicklung zugrunde liegende Ursachen betrachtet werden k\u00f6nnen. In dem vorliegenden Aufsatz \u00fcberpr\u00fcft der Autor, ob diese Variablen auch einen Einfluss haben auf das Partizipationsniveau der belgischen Bev\u00f6lkerung. Die Analyse der belgischen Untersuchung (N = 1341) zeigt, dass diese Beziehung f\u00fcr die meisten der angef\u00fchrten Ursachen nicht signifikant ist, obwohl der R\u00fcckgang der religi\u00f6sen Bindungen ein wahrscheinlicher Kandidat f\u00fcr zuk\u00fcnftige Forschung zu sein scheint. Der Aufsatz schlie\u03b2t mit einigen Vorschl\u00e4gen zur zuk\u00fcnftigen Erforschung zivilgesellschaftlichen Engagements. En la literatura sobre un posible declive de los niveles de participaci\u00f3n, algunos factores se invocan como causa posible para esta tendencia. Los mas prominente entre estos son reemplazo generacional, la difusi\u00f3n de la televisi\u00f3n, el aumento de la movilidad geogr\u00e1fica, el incremento de la presi\u00f3n del tiempo, la inestabilidad marital y el declive de las afiliaciones religiosas. En Bowling Along, Robert Putnam (2000) concede credibilidad al hecho de que estos factores estan al menos relacionados con el declive de los niveles de participaci\u00f3n en Estados Unidos, y puede incluso ser considerado como una causa fundamental. En este art\u00edculo, el autor valora si estas variables tambien tienen relaci\u00f3n con los niveles de participaci\u00f3n de la poblaci\u00f3n belga. El an\u00e1lisis de una encuesta belga (N = 1341) muestra que para la mayor\u00eda de las causas invocadas, la relaci\u00f3n no es significante, aunque el declive en la afiliaci\u00f3n religiosa parece un candidato probable para futuras investigaciones.

(1) Studies of samples of seedlings, raised from the seed present in soil and surface debris from the two bowling greens and one flower bed, established that in each site the seed population was more variable than the adult. This result is compatible with the notion of disruptive selection. (2) An experiment was set up to examine the response of the two growth forms to clipping and to estimate the effectiveness of clipping as a selective force in the bowling green environment. In the control (unclipped treatment), the erect and prostrate variants differed both in total production and in their relative energy allocation to both vegetative and floral reproduction. These differences have been discussed in relation to r and K selection strategies. Differential response to clipping was observed; the groups in descending order of relative fitness consisted of prostrate individuals from the two bowling green populations &gt; prostrate individuals from the flower bed populations &gt; erect individuals from flower bed populations. Clipping appears to have two effects on the erect forms resulting in: (1) a greater percentage decrease in total dry matter production in the erect compared with the prostrate forms, and (2) a greater percentage of the dry weight produced being removed by the cut in the erect forms compared with the prostrate forms. Coefficients of selection acting against erect plants under a regime of clipping ranged from 0.53 to 0.68. A selection coefficient of 0.77 was obtained for prostrate plants in the absence of clipping. In the light of the management of the lawns and flower beds, evidence for selection and gene flow is discussed.\n      </p>", "\t\t\t\t\t     \t\t For individual subscriptions, please contact the  <a href=\"http://www.ucpressjournals.com/journalBuy.asp?j=auk\">University of California Press</a>\n\t\t\t      \t    \t\t\t . \n\t\t           \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "\t\t\t\t\t     \t\t For individual subscriptions, please contact the  <a href=\"http://www.ucpressjournals.com/journalBuy.asp?j=auk\">University of California Press</a>\n\t\t\t      \t    \t\t\t . \n\t\t           \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "Despite elevating Alexis de Tocqueville to iconic status in our national debate on civic engagement, we have frequently neglected the range and depth of his associational thought.

It is recognized, within the game of cricket, that such measures have severe limitations in assessing the true performances and abilities of players. Whenever a player's performance statistics are quoted, there is nearly always some verbal qualification that is necessary in order to place the statistics into context. Such comments include the stage of an innings a player usually bats or bowls, as this significantly affects a player's opportunity for scoring runs or taking wickets. Further, traditional measures do not allow the comparison of the skills of batting and bowling as they are based on incompatible scales. This paper uses the well-established Duckworth/Lewis methodology to create alternative measures of player performance. These measures, it is argued, have the potential to reflect better the performances of players having regard for the stages of innings that runs are scored or conceded and wickets taken or lost. The proposed measures could impact in evaluating player performance for a particular match, a series of matches, or in the longer term over players' careers. Further, the methodology enables an objective measure to be created that compares and combines the performances of batsmen and bowlers and of a player's all-round ability.

Data sources: Using the Medline, Toxline, and Toxnet databases, the internet, and bibliographies of relevant articles, we identified studies that reported measurements of ambient nicotine concentrations in the 5 B's. Study selection: Studies were included if they reported a mean concentration of ambient nicotine measured in at least one of the 5 B's. Data extraction: We calculated a weighted average of nicotine concentrations in each of the 5 B's. We then estimated the working lifetime excess lung cancer mortality risk associated with this exposure, as well as with exposure at the upper and lower limits of the range of mean exposures reported in all of the studies in each establishment category. Data synthesis: Nicotine concentrations in the 5 B's were 2.4 to 18.5 times higher than in offices or residences, and 1.5 to 11.7 times higher than in restaurants. At these exposure levels, estimated working lifetime excess lung cancer mortality risk from secondhand smoke exposure for workers in the 5 B's is between 1.0-4.1/1000, which greatly exceeds the typical de manifestis risk level of 0.3/1000. Conclusions: Workers in the 5 B's have high levels of occupational exposure to secondhand smoke and must be included in workplace smoking regulations.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Although membership in voluntary associations has been presumed to be a central element in the building of social capital, micro-level knowledge about whether and how voluntary associations make their members more trusting and cooperative has been lacking. The link between trust and involvement in associations in Germany and Sweden was explored by means of a questionnaire concerning traits of individuals and of the associational groups to which they belong. The analysis of the resulting data set considered the extent to which various group characteristics (such as demographic diversity, in-group trust, and engagement level) are related to the generalized trust of the members. The results indicate that more diverse, more engaged voluntary associations, and those with weak ties, indeed accommodate more trusting people. In particular, time spent in groups with foreigners, or in groups with weaker ties, affects the generalized trust levels of the members.\n      </p>", "Eight years after the Lawrence Inquiry, the question of police powers to stop and search people in public places remains at the forefront of debate about police community relations. Police are empowered to stop and search citizens under a wide range of legislative acts and the power is employed daily across Britain.

We argue that the statistics show that the use of the powers against black people is disproportionate and that this is an indication of unlawful racial discrimination.

Design and setting - The vehicle for the study was the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys omnibus survey in Great Britain. The sampling frame was the British postcode address file of \"small users\", stratified by region and socioeconomic factors. This file includes all private household addresses. The postal sectors are selected with probability proportional to size. Within each sector 30 addresses are selected randomly with an target size of 2000 adults. Participants - The total number of adults interviewed was 2033 (one per sampled household), resulting in 2031 usable questionnaires, and representing a response rate of 77%. Main results - Of those who reported a longstanding illness, the most common, freely mentioned, first most important effects of the longstanding illness on their lives were (in order of frequency) ability to get out and about/stand/walk/go out shopping, being able to work/find a job, and effects on social life/leisure activities. Analysis of the areas of life affected by longstanding illness, showed considerable variation in relation to the condition. For example, respondents with mental health disorders (mainly depression) were most likely to report as the first most important effect the availability of work/ability to work, followed by social life/leisure activities; respondents with digestive and endocrine (for example, diabetes) disorders were most likely to report dietary restrictions; while respondents with cardiovascular disease, respiratory, and musculoskeletal disorders were most likely to report ability to get out and about/stand/walk/go out shopping.

Death should be a family affair but is increasingly hidden from public view. In contrast to those who die at home, most of those who die in hospital die alone with no relatives or friends with them. Husbands and wives are less likely to have the opportunity to say 'goodbye' to their dying spouses. As people become less familiar with death they may increasingly assume that the terminally ill are better cared for in hospital. However, this need not be the case. Most people want to die at home, most do not for social rather than medical reasons. It is not the illness itself which leads to hospital admission in many cases but its duration and nature \u2013 and the type of burden it places on relatives. Although home care should be encouraged where possible, no amount of exhortation to the family or to the dying person of the advantages of home care can disguise the fact that demand for domiciliary services is greater than is now being provided.

Political participation is typically characterized by inertia: reproduced within families, highly correlated with social class, and largely stable after the onset of adulthood. This research illustrates an element of political socialization that occurs just before the transition into full citizenship, that mimics adult civic life, and that can be available regardless of family advantage. The authors use two longitudinal national datasets to identify the kinds of voluntary associations that encourage members to be more politically active later in life. They find that general involvement in extracurricular activities is important, but that in particular, involvement in youth voluntary associations concerning community service, representation, speaking in public forums, and generating a communal identity most encourage future political participation. The authors find these effects net of self selection and causal factors traditionally characterized in political socialization research. The influence of youth voluntary associations on future political activity is nontrivial and has implications for both democratic education and election outcomes.\n      </p>", "Study objective-The aim was to examine the relationship between handedness and longevity. Design-This was an archival (retrospective) survey of a cohort of adult men who had played 'first-class cricket'. Setting-The United Kingdom Participants-The subjects consisted of all of the deceased players included in an encyclopaedia of 'first-class cricket' whose bowling hand had been recorded (n=3165). The study also considered a further 2314 players, born before 1951 but still alive at the time the book was published (1984). Measurements and main results-Using the bowling hand as an indicator of handedness it was possible to compare the lifespans of 2580 right handed men and 585 left handed men. The average life spans of the two groups differed by 25 months (right=65\u00b762, left- =63\u00b752), a highly significant difference (p=0\u00b7006). An examination of cause of death (where noted) strongly indicated that the left handed men were more likely to die prematurely in accidents or in warfare. As a consequence, when these unnatural deaths were removed from the sample the longevity difference between the right handers and left handers was considerably reduced. There was no evidence that these results related to any longitudinal change in the proportion of right handers to left handers across the time course of the sample. Conclusion-The study found clear evidence that left handedness was associated with a decrease in longevity among a cohort of adult, athletic men. A major factor responsible for this result seemed to be a differential likelihood of accidental death or death during warfare.\n      </p>", "Trends of female access to and presence in responsible governmental positions have gained substantial attention. The research reported here assesses and seeks convergence on several issues associated with gender representation. It extends the research by focusing on top executive posts in American state governments. In particular, the presence of women agency heads in all 50 states is examined from 1970 through 2000 using the lenses of passive representativeness and active representation. The authors find, first, that women face fewer blockages in securing top posts-the glass ceilings are cracking. Second, womens access to peak executive positions springs from more solid educational, career, and organizational foundations or \"floors. \" Third, lateral career movements are penetrating the \"walls\"surrounding traditionally male-dominated agency types. The essay concludes with a framework for understanding relationships involving passive representativeness, active representation, and representative results. That framework assists in shifting attention toward the consequences of both passive and active representation.\n      </p>", "Profiles of potassium activity and electrical potential in the vacuoles of cells across the intact root of Helianthus annuus have been measured. No gradient in either potassium activity or potential difference was detected from epidermis to pericycle. The trans-root electrical potential was found to be made up of two components, a large P.D. between the outside solution and the outer cells and a small P.D. at the pericycle-xylem interface. The results indicated that all the living cells of the root have the same capacity to actively accumulate potassium.\n      </p>", "The electrical potential difference across exuding roots of Helianthus annuus in two strengths of complete culture solution was measured. The determination of the concentration of the major nutrient ions in the outside solution and the xylem sap enabled the Nernst potential for each ion to be calculated. A comparison of the measured and calculated potentials indicated that the anions NO3, SO4, H2PO4 and HPO4 were actively transported into the sap against the electrochemical potential gradient. The cations Ca and Mg, on the other hand, appeared to move passively into the sap. The behaviour of potassium depended on its concentration in the medium. With a relatively low external concentration (0.75 mM) it appeared to be actively transported into the sap, whilst at higher outside concentrations (7.5 mM) it was apparently moving passively into the xylem down the electrochemical potential gradient. The possibility of potassium being pumped out of the sap with relatively high external concentrations is discussed.\n      </p>", "Oxygen partial pressures in the vacuolar sap of root cells have been measured using oxygen sensitive polarographic microelectrodes. A significant gradient in oxygen partial pressure was observed across intact sunflower roots growing in air saturated culture solution. The relevance of this finding to the mechanism of salt transfer across the root and in particular to the Crafts-Broyer theory is discussed.\n      </p>", "The effect of transpiration on the uptake of K, Ca, NO3 and SO4 from two strengths of culture solution by Helianthus plants was investigated. In the dilute solution transpiration had no effect on the uptake of all the ions studied. In the more concentrated solution the uptake of K, NO3 and SO4 were found to be sensitive to changes in water flux across the root. Calcium uptake was found to be completely independent of water uptake in all the experiments. The results are interpreted in the light of the results from an earlier study on excised Helianthus roots. It is suggested that transpiration only affects the nonmetabolic transport of the ions across the root.\n      </p>", "Left-handers occur at unexpectedly high frequencies at top levels of many interactive sports. This may occur either because left-handed contestants are innately superior or because they enjoy a negatively frequency-dependent strategic advantage when rare relative to right-handers. We analysed the batting records from the 2003 cricket World Cup and showed that left-handed batsmen were more successful than right-handers, and that the most successful teams had close to 50% left-handed batsmen. We demonstrate that this was because left-handed batsmen have a strategic advantage over bowlers, and that this advantage is greatest over bowlers that are unaccustomed to bowling to left-handers. This provides a clear mechanism for negative frequency-dependent success of left-handed batsmen. Our results may also support a historical role for negative frequency-dependent success in fights and other contests in the maintenance of left-handedness by natural selection.\n      </p>", "The electrical potential difference across the sieve plates in the primary phloem of Vitis vinifera was measured by inserting micro-electrodes into the sieve-tubes. The values obtained ranged from 4\u201448 mV. The potential across the transverse walls of the phloem fibres was also determined and found to range from 1\u201411 mV. These results are discussed in relation to the theory of translocation based on electro-osmosis put forward independently by Fensom and Spanner.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

This item may be sensitive to its position in questionnaires and to response-choice wording. The aims of this paper were to investigate the effects of question order and response choice on self-reported health status. Method: A secondary analysis of wave 1 of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). Participants were a nationally representative sample of people aged 50 years and over living at home. Over 11 000 respondents were interviewed face-to-face in their homes, and were randomly assigned to one of two versions of a self-rated health item. Results: The health status item asked after, rather than before, a module of health questions, resulted in more optimal health assessments, although the effect size was small. The version of the health status item with \"excellent\", rather than \"very good\" as the first response category resulted in more optimal health assessments, although it had a smaller ceiling effect. Conclusions: There was support for the insertion of the health status question at the beginning of health questionnaires, as it may be influenced by questions about health and disease if placed at the end, although the effect size was small. Evidence for the version of the item with \"excellent\", rather than \"very good\", as the first response choice was more mixed as, although optimism bias appeared higher, the ceiling effects were lower. The smaller ceiling effects for the \"excellent\" version has important implications for the ability to detect improvements in follow-up studies.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
