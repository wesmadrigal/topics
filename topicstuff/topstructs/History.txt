Given the enormous popularity of oral history on television in the past decade the use of video histories in museums - and elsewhere - has been surprising by its absence. It has been due to lack of money, expertise and a strong feeling amongst practitioners that video history was not the most natural medium for documenting life stories. New developments in video technology now allow much easier and cheaper use of this medium. The visual dimension of oral history adds emotional power to life story recordings and displays which can heighten their impact - and is well worth the extra effort. There is now a new mood in museums in which there is likely to be much greater use of video history in the near future.\n      </p>", "Both academic and public historians in the US have been seeking to reach mass audiences beyond their professional peers.

Both endeavours have encountered mounting criticism, particularly over the efforts of museums and historic sites to interpret the materials they display.

Methods Data from the Black Women's Health Study, a prospective cohort study of African American women, were used to assess breast cancer risk in relation to family history of cancer. Since 1995, participants have completed biennial postal questionnaires on health status, risk factors, and family history of cancer. Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to calculate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for family history of breast and other types of cancer. Results Among 57,364 participants who were cancer-free at baseline, 1,306 incident breast cancer cases occurred during 12 years of follow-up. The IRR for a first-degree family history of breast cancer relative to no family history was 1.78 (95% CI 1.55\u20142.06). IRRs varied by the age at diagnosis, from 1.60 (\u2265age 55) to 2.76 (&lt;age35). Results were consistent across subtypes of breast tumor defined by estrogen and progesterone receptor status. Breast cancer risk was also associated with family history of colon cancer (IRR 1.35, 95% CI 1.12\u20141.63) and possibly with family history of leukemia (IRR 1.42, 95% CI 0.82\u20142.46). Conclusions These findings indicate a strong familial relationship for breast cancer in African American women.

In the process of this overarching narrative he argues that oral history is particularly important for at least three reasons: it provides access to unique stories, although often with a deeper social significance; that it packs considerable emotional power; and finally, as people's history, oral history has been a major force for the democratisation of history on television.\n      </p>", "This article reviews the history of FDA regulation of DES during 1941-1981.\n      </p>", "The Radio Ballads, produced by Charles Parker, Ewan MacColl and Peggy Seeger in the late 1950s and early 1960s, were a new type of radio programme.

Metabolic rate constrains the scaling of production with body mass, so that larger organisms have lower rates of production on a mass-specific basis than smaller ones. Here, we explore the implications of this constraint for life-history evolution. We show that for a range of very simple life histories, Darwinian fitness is equal to birth rate minus death rate. So, natural selection maximizes birth and production rates and minimizes death rates. This implies that decreased body size will generally be favored because it increases production, so long as mortality is unaffected. Alternatively, increased body size will be favored only if it decreases mortality or enhances reproductive success sufficiently to override the preexisting production constraint. Adaptations that may favor evolution of larger size include niche shifts that decrease mortality by escaping predation or that increase fecundity by exploiting new abundant food sources. These principles can be generalized to better understand the intimate relationship between the genetic currency of evolution and the metabolic currency of ecology.\n      </p>", "This article describes OutHistory.org, the public Web site on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) history hosted by the Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies (CLAGS) at the City University of New York, Graduate Center.

Southern Cape populations had relatively low reproductive rates, but levels of energy storage and survival rates were high. The reverse applied to eastern Cape populations. The diets of the two populations differed, with a higher ratio of available production nutrients (NPK) to maintenance nutrients (C) in the eastern Cape. A life history model is developed which accommodates these regional differences by linking nutritional characteristics of the diet with metabolic turnover rates. According to this model, the rate of reproductive investment (number of viable young per unit of time) relative to somatic investment (energy storage, survival) is determined by the rate at which production nutrients (NPK) are procurable. For herbivorous animals this depends on the rate at which the nutrients are available to their food plants, which in turn is linked to soil fertility and thus to the geological parent material.\n      </p>", "Despite skepticism about the scholarly value of urban history encyclopedias, they represent a convergence of public, digital, and academic history.

In a long letter to Henry Oldenburg dated 13 June 1666 and in ancillary manuscript material, Boyle spells out the method or 'Designe' by which he believes experimental programs in natural philosophy should be written up. The 'Designe' is enormously important in giving a clear statement of the precise contours of Boyle's Baconian methodology and providing a key to understanding the rationale, composition and format for many of his published histories. Works such as \"New Experiments and Considerations Touching Cold,\" \"Memoirs for the Natural History of Human Blood\" and even his more speculative writings such as \"An Introduction to the History of Particular Qualities\" are best understood in terms of Boyle's overall method as articulated in his \"Designe about Natural History\".\n      </p>", "The evolution of reproductive isolation within Coreopsis is investigated by integrating phylogenetic data with estimates of pollen viability of plants from inter- and intraspecific crosses. Three different models that predict F1 fitness are compared. The first uses ITS pairwise distances, the second is based on phylogenetic branch lengths derived from DNA sequences, and the third elaborates on the second model by dividing branch length according to reconstructions of the evolution of life history. This is the first study to use phylogenetic branch-length estimates for predicting levels of reproductive isolation. Estimated branch lengths (model 2) predict hybrid fitness more accurately than simply genetic distance (model 1) but only very slightly. This is probably because the two variables are strongly correlated in Coreopsis. Prediction is substantially improved by allowing evolutionary rates to differ between annual and perennial branches (model 3). A bootstrapping procedure indicates that the life-history effect is statistically significant. The more rapid evolution of reproductive isolation within annual species of Coreopsis may be due to differing mechanisms of reproductive isolation, that is, chromosomal rearrangements rather than genetic incompatibilities.\n      </p>", "Background This study aims to investigate whether increased awareness of breast cancer, due to a positive family history (FH), reduces diagnostic, therapeutic, and survival differences between women of low versus high socio-economic status (SES). Methods All breast cancer patients registered between 1990 and 2005 at the population-based Geneva Cancer Registry were included. With multivariate logistic and Cox regression analysis, we estimated the impact of SES and FH on method of detection, treatment, and mortality from breast cancer. Results SES discrepancies in method of detection and suboptimal treatment, as seen among women without a FH, disappeared in the presence of a positive FH. SES differences in stage and survival remained regardless of the presence of a positive FH. Overall, positive FH was associated with better survival. This effect was the strongest in women of high SES (age-adjusted Hazard Ratio $[{\\rm HR}_{{\\rm ageadj}}]$ 0.54 [0.3-1.0]) but less pronounced in women of middle (0.77 [0.6-1.0]), and absent in women of low SES (0.80 [0.5-1.2]). Conclusion A positive FH of breast cancer may reduce SES differences in access to screening and optimal treatment. However, even with better access to early detection and optimal treatment, women of low SES have higher risks of death from their disease than those of high SES.\n      </p>", "This article compares and contrasts the approaches of the New Deal Federal Writers' Project and the Columbia Oral History Program in an effort to reconsider the paradoxical history of oral history research in the United States and its relationship to how many oral historians today look at their work and the history of their field. As it turns out, the theoretical and social concerns of the FWP projects are closer to current theoretical concerns of oral historians than the work Allan Nevins conducted in the early years of the Columbia project. The article also shows how awareness of the history of the intellectual and cultural currents that affect oral history projects in general, and the FWP's work in particular-interviews with former slaves, tenant farmers, industrial workers, and members of ethnic minorities-can help us analyze and use those materials. It argues that an awareness of continuity and discontinuity in the history of oral history makes it possible for today's oral historians to have a productive dialogue with their predecessors in the field.\n      </p>", "Over the past 15 years, phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs) have become standard in the study of life-history evolution. To date, most studies have focused on variation among species or higher taxonomic levels, generally revealing the presence of significant phylogenetic effects as well as residual variation potentially attributable to adaptive evolution. Recently, population-level phylogenetic hypotheses have become available for many species, making it possible to apply PCMs directly to the level at which experiments are typically used to test adaptive hypotheses. In this study, we present the results of PCMs applied to life-history variation among populations of the widespread and well-studied lizard Sceloporus undulatus. Using S. undulatus (which may represent four closely related species) as an example, we explore the benefits of using PCMs at the population level, as well as consider the importance of several thorny methodological problems including but not limited to nonindependence of populations, lack of sufficient variation in traits, and the typically small sample sizes dictated by the difficulty of collecting detailed demographic data. We show that phylogenetic effects on life-history variation among populations of S. undulatus appear to be unimportant, and that several classic trade-offs expected by theory and revealed by many interspecific comparisons are absent. Our results suggest that PCMs applied to variation in life-history traits below the species level may be of limited value, but more studies like ours are needed to draw a general conclusion. Finally, we discuss several outstanding problems that face studies seeking to apply PCMs below the species level.\n      </p>", "Dominance and epistatic effects are predicted to be larger in life-history than in morphological traits. We test these predictions using published results from line cross analyses. We find that dominance is found in more than 95% of traits, regardless of the type of trait, but that the magnitude of the effect in relation to the additive effect is much greater in life-history than in morphological traits. Epistatic effects were detected more often in life-history than in morphological traits (79% and 67%, respectively). We also test for a difference in the magnitude of the effects by comparing the ratio of the nonadditive components separately to the additive component. For both dominance and epistatic components, the ratio of the nonadditive component to additive effects in life-history traits is approximately twice as large as that for morphological traits.\n      </p>", "Public history in Britain is becoming one of the frameworks within which practitioners conceptualize concerns of, inter alia, cultural identity and heritage, resource management, institutional memory, history and policy, civic engagement, and entertainment.

We present a general autoregressive model of the timing of life-history events in relation to variation in global climate that, like autoregressive models of population dynamics, allows for a more mechanistic understanding of the roles of climate, resources and competition. We applied the model to data on 50 years of annual dates of first flowering by three species of plants in 26 populations covering 4\u00b0 of latitude in Norway. In agreement with earlier studies, plants in most populations and all three species bloomed earlier following warmer winters. Moreover, our model revealed that earlier blooming reflected increasing influences of resources and density-dependent population limitation under climatic warming. The insights available from the application of this model to phenological data in other taxa will contribute to our understanding of the roles of endogenous versus exogenous processes in the evolution of the timing of life-history events in a changing climate.\n      </p>", "We argue that the field of international business should evolve its rhetoric from the relatively uncontroversial idea that 'history matters' to exploring how it matters. We discuss four conceptual channels through which history matters, illustrating each with a major example. First, historical variation is at least a worthy complement to contemporary cross-sectional variation in illuminating conceptual issues. As an example, we show that conclusions reached by the literature on contemporary emerging market business groups are remarkably similar to independently reached conclusions about a very similar organizational form that was ubiquitous in the age of empire. Second, historical evidence avoids spurious labeling of some phenomena as 'new', and by so doing may challenge current explanations of their determinants. Whereas some firm types today were also present earlier, some types have disappeared, some have appeared, and some have disappeared and reappeared later. Third, history can allow us to move beyond the oft-recognized importance of issues of path dependence to explore the roots of Penrosian resources. We argue that the choices made by Jardine's and Swire's in Asia today, for example, are an outgrowth of strategic choices first in evidence more than a century ago. These would remain obscured absent an historical analysis. Fourth, there are certain issues that are unaddressable, except in the really long (that is, historical) run. Exploring the causal relationship (if any) between foreign direct investment, a staple of the international business literature, and long-run economic development provides one important example. Throughout, we advocate embracing rigorous methods for analyzing small-sample and qualitative data when conventional regression techniques do not apply. That is, we suggest that re-embracing history in the mainstream is not tantamount to sacrificing methodological rigor.\n      </p>", "The extinction of species results in a permanent loss of evolutionary history. Recent theoretical studies show that this loss may be proportionally much smaller than the loss of species, but under some conditions can exceed it. Such conditions occur when the phylogenetic tree that describes the evolutionary relationships among species is highly imbalanced due to differences between lineages in past speciation and/or extinction rates. I used the taxonomy by C. G. Sibley and B. L. Monroe Jr to estimate the global loss of bird evolutionary history from historical and predicted extinctions, and to quantify the ensuing changes in balance of the bird phylogenetic tree. In the global bird fauna, evolutionary history is being lost at a high rate, similar to the rate of species extinction. The bird phylogenetic tree is highly imbalanced, and the imbalance is increased significantly by anthropogenic extinction. Historically, the elevated loss of bird evolutionary history has been fuelled mostly by phylogenetic non-randomness in the extinction of species, but the direct effect of tree imbalance is substantial and could dominate in the future.\n      </p>", "The post-Civil War American natural history craze spawned a new institution -- the natural history dealer -- that has failed to receive the historical attention it deserves. The individuals who created these enterprises simultaneously helped to promote and hoped to profit from the burgeoning interest in both scientific and popular specimen collecting. At a time when other employment and educational prospects in natural history were severely limited, hundreds of dealers across the nation provided encouragement, specimens, publication outlets, training opportunities, and jobs for naturalists of all motivations and levels of expertise. This paper explores the crucial role that specimen dealers played in the larger natural history community. After briefly examining the development of local taxidermy shops in the mid-nineteenth century, it then traces the history of four large natural history dealerships established in the United States during the latter half of the century: Ward's Natural History Establishment, Frank Blake Webster's Naturalists' Supply Depot, Southwick &amp; Jencks' Natural History Store, and Frank H.

We studied life-history responses to time constraints manipulated by photoperiod and associated with hatching date in larvae of the damselfly Lestes viridis for two populations with a different hydroperiod. In a common garden experiment, early- and late-hatched larvae from both populations were reared at two photoperiods mimicking the start and the end of the egg-hatching season. In a reciprocal transplant experiment, early- and late-hatched larvae from both populations were reared in both ponds. In all these experiments, larvae were reared from egg hatching until adult emergence. Within both populations, larvae reared at the photoperiod indicating a late time point in the growing season, reduced development time to compensate for their perceived shorter development period. Growth rate, however, did not respond to photoperiod, resulting in a lower mass at emergence. As expected, both in the laboratory and in the field, larvae from eggs that hatched later in the season generally had a shorter development time and a faster growth rate, resulting in a higher mass at emergence compared to early-hatched larvae. This may explain the intriguing seasonal increase in mass at emergence in this species, and affect the predictions of optimality models. None of these life-history responses differed between the two populations, despite clear differences in time constraints linked to hydroperiod, suggesting the robustness of the observed patterns. Given the ubiquity of asynchronous hatching in nature, and the adaptive value of the observed differences between early- and late-hatched larvae, we expect the effects of hatching date on life-history plasticity to be widespread.\n      </p>", "In these days of supercomputer-based global climate models, large ecosystem experiments including Biosphere II, and aircraft-borne sensors of ozone holes it is often overlooked that many fundamental insights into ecological processes and major environmental issues come not through reductionist or high-tech studies of modern conditions but from thoughtful consideration of nature's history. In fact, it is foolhardy to make any ecological interpretation of modern landscapes or environments or to formulate policy in conservation or natural resource management without an historical context that extends back decades, at least, but preferably centuries or millennia. Oftentimes, the ecological and conservation communities, in their search for more detail on the present and simulation of the future, appear to have forgotten the value of a deep historical perspective in research and application.

Currently, it is difficult to predict the dynamics of AMF communities, mainly because little is known about AMF life-history strategies. This review provides a theoretical context for AMF community dynamics on a successional time scale, based on differences in AMF life-history strategies. While some studies have examined colonization and persistence behaviors among AMF, these traits have not been examined in the context of life-history strategies for AMF. We propose a model whereby differences in colonizing and persistence strategies among AMF are responsible for AMF succession over time. In our Driver/Passenger hypothesis, we describe two mechanisms for AMF and plant community changes over time. In the Driver hypothesis, interactions within AMF communities are responsible for changes in the plant community over time. In the Passenger hypothesis, AMF community dynamics are a by-product of changes within the plant community. To test these theories, it will be necessary to classify AMF in terms of life-history strategies. Once accomplished, this knowledge will allow landscape managers to have better predictive power when utilizing AMF for ecosystem management.\n      </p>", "In Boston, Massachusetts, civic leaders used the lessons of history to design policy initiatives to sustain Boston's culture of innovation.

This roundtable seeks to examine the influence of the new western history on the practice of public history, particularly as it is found in museums and historic sites.\n      </p>", "C. J. Temminck, director of the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie (now the National Museum of Natural History in Leiden) and a renowned ornithologist, gained his contemporary's respect thanks to the description of many new species and to his detailed monographs on birds. He also published a small number of works on biogeography describing the fauna of the Dutch colonies in South East Asia and Japan. These works are remarkable for two reasons. First, in them Temminck accurately described the species composition of poorly explored regions, like the Sunda Islands and Japan. Secondly, he formulated a new law on the geographical distribution of animals around the globe, based on the parallels he observed between the fauna from Europe, Asia and Japan. The underlying ideas that lead Temminck to this law were the typeconcept, which he understood as the ideal morphological plan behind animal form, the unchanging character of the species and a strong belief in nature's divine design. During the first half of the nineteenth century, the type-and the species-concept, the origin and fixity of the species and the meaning of variations aroused heated discussions. When put in the context of his time, Temminck emerges as a scientist whose work was driven by the dominating scientific philosophy of the time in which he lived, under the influence of late eighteenth century natural history and of French empiricists, in particular, the great zoologist and paleontologist Georges Cuvier. Temminck's detailed descriptions of the Dutch East Indian fauna helped the great naturalists after him to understand nature's patterns and to propose comprehensive theories that explain its diversity.\n      </p>", "The life history strategy of the dung beetle Kheper nigroaeneus was studied in Mkuzi Game Reserve, South Africa. K. nigroaeneus, a large ball-rolling dung beetle, brood-cares a single offspring per nesting occasion. Adults emerged from the ground following the first spring rain (\u2265 17 mm) in October or November, occasionally September, and trap catches were at a maximum 1-2 weeks later. Females outnumbered males by 3:1 at the time of maximum catches, but thereafter declined steadily, as the numbers of females involved in brood-care increased. Brood-care lasted 12 weeks, and parental females then (a) entered a second brood-care period, or (b) remained underground in diapause, or (c) emerged to feed. Reproductive activity stopped after February, ensuring that the entire population reached the adult stage by winter. Females active above ground after February, in reproductive diapause, had low fat levels and resorbed oocytes. Females buried underground, in reproductive diapause prior to and during winter, had high fat levels, resorbed oocytes, a reduced metabolic rate and empty guts. The Mkuzi habitat is predictable for K. nigroaeneus in spring, since only one good fall of rain is sufficient to drive population events for the next three months. In the latter half of the season the life history of K. nigroaeneus is more flexible, and hence less constrained by climate.\n      </p>", "The study of the historic past, through material evidence and texts, was an integral component of colonial practice in India, and remains a highly visible governmental and public focus in contemporary South Asia. In this paper, we present an historic overview of the development of knowledge and research on ancient India, beginning with the formation of the Asiatic Society in 1784 and proceeding to the creation of the Archaeological Survey of India in 1861, when history and archaeology were formally differentiated. We trace this development through the post-colonial period, examining how archaeology and ancient history are practiced and conceptualized today. We conclude with four case studies that explore the existing state of, and the potential for, productive partnerships between historians and archaeologists. /// L'\u00e9tude du pass\u00e9e historique, \u00e0 travers l'evidence material et documentaire, faisait partie int\u00e9grante du pratique colonial a l'Inde, et reste encore un foyer du gouvernement et de la publique de la sud-Asie contemporaine.

Cases were 843 women aged 54 or less (median age 43 years, range 21-54) with histologically confirmed uterine fibroids, whose clinical diagnosis dated back no more than 2 years. Indications for surgery were recurrent menorrhagia or ultrasound evidence of fibroids larger than 10 cm in diameter. Controls were 1557 women aged 54 years or less of comparable quinquennia of age (median age 43 years, range 21-54) who had not undergone hysterectomy and were admitted for acute, non-gynecologic, non-hormonal, non-neoplastic conditions to a network of hospitals with a similar catchment area. Clinical history of severe overweight was inversely associated with the risk of fibroids (multivariate odds ratio (OR), OR: 0.6, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.5-0.8). An increase in the frequency of fibroids was seen in women with a history of benign breast disease (OR: 1.2, 95% CI: 0.9-1.6) and particularly of breast biopsies (OR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.2-3.5). The results of this large dataset indicate that medical conditions known or likely to be related to female hormones are not important determinants of the risk of fibroids.\n      </p>", "Where did all those dead animals come from? What are they used for? These are questions that natural history museums must be prepared to answer. Specimen collections are a valuable research tool, but their utility remains a mystery to many. In this article, we introduce the Web exhibit \u201cDoing Natural History\u201d ( http://mvz.berkeley.edu/DoingNaturalHistory ) as an educational resource that draws connections between early twentieth-century evolutionary biology and innovative museum science today. As a companion to the Web exhibit, in this article, we show how natural history research changed during the twentieth century and argue that collections have provided the basis for innovation in natural history, integrative biology, and, more generally, in the life sciences. Drawing on examples from the University of California, Berkeley\u2019s, Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, we look at the practice of natural history to reveal the centrality of collections to both practice and theory in the life sciences.\n      </p>", "This paper explores the manner in which educational and political conservatives attempted to control the content and purposes of the history curriculum in English schools during the period 1987-1994. It focuses upon this particular coalition because, since the late 1970s, it has set the agenda for the debate and dominated the race to produce a history curriculum designed to help produce a particular kind of society. The paper argues that the New Right's claim to be engaging in an educational debate is spurious. Rather, its concern is primarily ideological and only educational in terms of its use of history education as a vehicle through which to disseminate a specific set of values and beliefs.\n      </p>", "A comparative ecological study of closely related invasive and non-invasive species, Senecio madagascariensis and S. lautus (Asteraceae), investigated what traits might confer invasive ability in very similar species. Life-history attributes of the weed S. madagascariensis were compared to five habitat-specific subspecies of S. lautus: S. l. alpinus, S. l. dissectifolius, S. l. lanceolatus and two forms of S. l. maritimus. Field populations of each taxon were monitored to compare their population ecology. Relative rates of phenological development were compared at a single location. Seed germination was studied in a laboratory experiment. Transplant experiments were conducted in a range of S. madagascariensis and S. lautus habitats to compare performance in different environments. In monitored field populations S. madagascariensis produced seedlings and reproductive cohorts more frequently, flowered for longer periods, produced more seeds and had fewer germinable achenes in the soil compared to S. lautus taxa. S. madagascariensis achenes had higher rates of germination than S. lautus in both light and dark conditions. S. madagascariensis was found to have higher rates of survival than S. lautus taxa in a range of habitats and to be faster to flower in both transplant and standard glasshouse environments. Overall S. madagascariensis performed better than S. lautus ecotypes in terms of seedling, growth and fecundity measurements and second best for achenes. Despite relatively good performance in terms of life-history traits there is no evidence that S. madagascariensis is invading S. lautus habitats. We speculate that physiological and morphological adaptations to specialised environments are a better explanation for success of Senecio taxa/ecotypes than generalised life-history trait performance. We suggest that invasiveness is essentially unpredictable, due to habitat/plant specific interactions between invader and area of introduction. In the absence of predictive theory, quarantine authorities should use a combination of methods to assess invasive potential including a database of known weeds, performance comparisons between congeneric natives and exotics in a range of habitats at proposed point of introduction and monitoring of introduced species to determine if they spread.\n      </p>", "The expression \"evidence-based medicine\" was probably coined at the McMaster University of Canada in the late 1980s and was largely supported by the science of statistics applied on medical research. The word \"statistics\" originated in eighteenth century Germany, its science, however, originated long before that. In this article we present some early clues of application of statistical principles on medicine from the Roman era, which, albeit rudimentary, contain many modern basic principles of statistics, like the concepts of sample size, mean, distribution of population, representativeness and randomization of the sample. Most clues come from Galen's writings and are probably cited for the first time with a statistical point of view. We also present one of the earlier randomized controlled trials of an antidote in history.\n      </p>", "Comparative data on emergence, adult activity, and larval development were used to interpret patterns of phenology, voltinism, and developmental synchrony in a 14-species assemblage of dragonflies (Odonata:Anisoptera). Interspecific differences in these characteristics provided an opportunity to interrelate life history, population size structure, and the potential for intra- and interspecific interactions. Larval populations of most species comprised an extraordinary size range of individuals at any one time. In many species, this intraspecific size variability was primarily due to developmental asynchrony within generations (e.g., Libellula lydia, Celithemis elisa, Perithemis tenera). Oviposition in these species occurred throughout most of the summer so that the timing of instar development varied considerably among broods. By fall, the largest larvae in these populations were 5 to 10 times the size of smaller conspecifics. In other asynchronous breeders, an even wider size range of co-occurring conspecifics resulted from overlap between generations. In Erythemis simplicicollis and Pachydiplax longipennis this generation overlap was due to the presence of mixed uni- and bivoltine cohorts, whereas in Tramea lacerata and Anax junius, it was due to phenologically separate but overlapping migratory and resident cohorts. In the semivoltine Epitheca princeps, size variability among conspecifics was due mainly to overlap between year classes. Most larvae were similar in size at the same point in time in those species that bred synchronously and were univoltine (Epitheca cynosura, Leucorrhinia intacta). Size ratios of the smallest to largest co-occurring conspecifics in these populations were frequently larger than those commonly thought to facilitate interspecific coexistence. Thus, intraspecific resource partitioning should play an important role in population regulation, as should cannibalism. This intraspecific size variability should also create the potential for mixed competition--predation interactions between the same species. A phenological tradeoff between competition and predation should minimize the efficacy of seaonal segregation as a mechanism for minimizing the intensity of interspecific interaction in this assemblage.\n      </p>", "This issue of in vitro plant is dedicated to various aspects of biofuel research and development. The editors have sought the experts in this field and solicited manuscripts for this special issue publication from various academic institutions, government (USDA, DOE), industry (Mendel, Alellyx, Canavilas, Syngenta, Monsanto), and various countries (USA, China, Brazil, India, and Australia). This has resulted in state-of-the-art articles describing ethanol and also biodiesel research. These publications highlight the status of biofuel research across the globe and also focus on private, public, and government interests. This is especially noteworthy in that President Barack Obama has stated that renewable energy is a pivotal aspect of his policy for the USA. The objective of this introduction is to provide the reader with the pertinent background information relative to the biofuel efforts within the private sector, academia, and government laboratories.

In a longitudinal multivariate model including parental diabetes observed in the offspring's childhood, BMI, MAP, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin, and glucose, adjusted for age, age\u00b2, race, sex, and race by sex interaction, parental diabetes and adverse changes in LDL cholesterol and glucose were independently associated with pre-diabetic status in adulthood (regression coefficient [\u03b2] = 0.74 (95% CI: 0.04-1.45), 0.44 (95% CI: 0.24-0.64), and 1.99 (95% CI: 1.73-2.25), respectively), while parental diabetes and adverse changes in BMI, HDL cholesterol, and glucose were associated with the diabetic status (\u03b2 = 1.14 (95% CI: 0.35-1.92), 0.08 (95% CI: 0.05-0.11), -0.51 (95% CI: -1.03 to - 0.003), and 1.79 (95% CI: 1.48-2.09), respectively).

Although comprehensive world histories continue to appear, design historians are only gradually confronting the question of how a world history of design might be written. A major problem is the limited definition of design that has, for many scholars, confined its study to industrialized regions of the world. We need to understand how different cultures have provided for their respective material needs, as well as how larger forces of politics and economics have shaped the conditions for material production in those cultures. Design is an integral component of modern production and a world history of design should argue for its vital role in economic development. Other issues include the rise of nationalism and the question of race. Looking at the history of design from a world perspective enables us to see that people of all ethnic backgrounds have been active designers within their own communities, even if they have largely worked outside the orbit of advanced industrialization. Writing a world history of design with an emphasis on how empires, nations, and other political entities have used it to advance their political and economic agendas links design to the larger problems of the world.\n      </p>", "Since its emergence in the mid-1980s, the \u201cnew western history\u201d has become a standard approach for interpreting the region's past and has influenced the practice of public history in important ways. This essay summarizes the concerns and assumptions of the new western historians and then assesses the impact of their scholarship on public history. Of particular concern is its effect on community museums in the West. Two case studies from museums in Colorado are presented. Finally, the author argues that the spirit of community engagement evinced by some of its leading practitioners has been an important, if less visible, impact of the new western history.\n      </p>", "Cassandra Pinnick and George Gale (Journal for General Phisophy of Science 31, 109-125) examined the post-Lakatos period of historical cum philosophical case studies and concluded that a new methodology is required.

Since Hempel's challenge to historians that they should adopt the covering law model of explanation, the methodological conflict has revolved around the respective roles of the general and the particular in each discipline. In recent years, the revival of narrativism in history, coupled with the trend in philosophy of science to rely upon case studies, joins the methodological conflict anew. So long as contemporary philosophy of science relies upon history's methodology to construct its case studies, it subjects itself to a paradoxical situation: the better the history, the worse the philosophy. An example of the methodological conflict is presented in the case of Antoine Lavoisier. This example also serves our ultimate conclusion, which is that distinctively philosophical methods of case-study design promise enhanced prescriptive powers for philosophy of science.\n      </p>", "Even as museums and sites struggle to attract audiences and bemoan the public's lack of interest in history, people working outside museums and universities, without professional training, and often without funding, are approaching history in ways that fire the enthusiasm of thousands. Unmoored by institutional expectations, they are what we might call \u201coutsider history-makers\u201d: genealogists, heritage tourism developers, and re-enactors, among others. They establish emotional connections to the past that operate on the level of instinct more than intellect. As public history professionalizes, the field seems increasingly at odds with this approach. The efforts of the outsiders, however, suggest new strategies for drawing passionate audiences to museums and point to new sets of skills that public history training programs should be teaching their students.\n      </p>", "The food web centering on Allium ursinum (Liliaceae) in a beech forest (Germany) is described, and temporal variation of active trophic links is related to species' life cycles. The most important insect herbivores are Cheilosia fasciata (a larval leaf miner) and Portevinia maculata (a larval bulb miner) (Diptera: Syrphidae). Energy, carbon and nitrogen flow in the food chain (Allium-Cheilosia-Phygadeuon ursini) are investigated and analysed with respect to differences in resource allocation by the leaf miner and its hymenoptereous parasitoid. In C. fasciata nitrogen is likely to be the limiting resource, while growth in Phygadeuon ursini appears energy-limited. Larval feeding habits of C. fasciata and Portevinia maculata determined the timing of the species' life cycles and, as a consequence, appeared to preclude the existence of a pupal parasitoid in Portevinia maculata. Further details of life history traits are demonstrated and discussed.\n      </p>", "Recent interest has focused on immune response in an evolutionary context, with particular attention to disease resistance as a life\u2010history trait, subject to trade\u2010offs against other traits such as reproductive effort. Immune defense has several characteristics that complicate this approach, however; for example, because of the risk of autoimmunity, optimal immune defense is not necessarily maximum immune defense. Two important types of cost associated with immunity in the context of life history are resource costs, those related to the allocation of essential but limited resources, such as energy or nutrients, and option costs, those paid not in the currency of resources but in functional or structural components of the organism. Resource and option costs are likely to apply to different aspects of resistance. Recent investigations into possible trade\u2010offs between reproductive effort, particularly sexual displays, and immunity have suggested interesting functional links between the two. Although all organisms balance the costs of immune defense against the requirements of reproduction, this balance works out differently for males than it does for females, creating sex differences in immune response that in turn are related to ecological factors such as the mating system. We conclude that immune response is indeed costly and that future work would do well to include invertebrates, which have sometimes been neglected in studies of the ecology of immune defense.\n      </p>", "This paper discusses some of the issues that consultants face when trying to publish products that they have produced as part of their business. It examines four main topics: the purpose behind the creation of the work product and its scope, the collaborative nature of public history writing, bureaucratic red-tape related to publishing, and the relative lack of emphasis on publishing in the consulting world. In addition, the paper discusses proper forums for the publication of public history.\n      </p>", "Ulam has defined a history-dependent random sequence by the recursion $X_{n+1}=X_{n}+X_{U(n)}$, where (U(n); n\u22651) is a sequence of independent random variables with U(n) uniformly distributed on {1,..., n} and X\u2081 = 1. We introduce a new class of continuous-time history-dependent random processes regulated by Poisson processes. The simplest of these, a univariate process regulated by a homogeneous Poisson process, replicates in continuous time the essential properties of Ulam's sequence, and greatly facilitates its analysis. We consider several generalizations and extensions of this, including bivariate and multivariate coupled history-dependent processes, and cases when the dependence on the past is not uniform. The analysis of the discrete-time formulations of these models would be at the very least an extremely formidable project, but we determine the asymptotic growth rates of their means and higher moments with relative ease.\n      </p>", "In this study we used 2 reciprocal transference experiments to estimate the mode and magnitude of selection on life history traits of the aphid Brevicoryne brassicae L. on 2 sympatric host plants, Brassica campestris L. and Brassica oleraceae L. In the first experiment, we recorded success in establishment, age at first reproduction, duration of reproduction, number of nymphs laid, reproductive rate, and rate of increase ($r_{{\\rm i}}$) on each host. In the second experiment, the offspring of females collected on Br. campestris or Br. oleraceae were reared on hosts through 3 generations. Age at first reproduction, duration of reproduction, fecundity, and rate of increase ($r_{{\\rm i}}$) were measured during the third generation in order to determine presence of maternal effects. Within each recipient host, we estimated selection gradients by performing a multiple linear regression of relative number of nymphs in relation to age at first reproduction and duration of reproduction. Results of the first experiment indicate that successful establishment was higher on the source host on which the mother was collected. A significant effect associated with the recipient host was detected for most life history traits. Positive directional selection on duration of reproduction was detected on both hosts whereas selection on the age at first reproduction was detected only in Br. oleraeae. In the second experiment we did not find evidence of maternal effects since the recipient host exerted a significant effect on fecundity. Again, the selection on duration of reproduction was detected on both hosts. Despite these results suggesting incipient ecological specialization in B. brassicae, we recognize factors that may prevent the evolution of host plant specialization. /// Usamos dos experimentos de transferencia rec\u00edproca para estimar el modo y magnitud de la selecci\u00f3n en caracteres de historia de vida de Brevicoryne brassicae L en dos especies hu\u00e9sped simp\u00e1tricas, Brassica campestris L. y Brassica oleraceae L.

We investigate the implications of size-selective mortality on life-history evolution by introducing and analysing a new and particularly flexible life-history model with the following key features: the lengths of growth and reproductive periods in successive reproductive cycles can vary evolutionarily, the model does not constrain evolution to patterns of either determinate or indeterminate growth, and lifetime number and sizes of broods are the outcomes of evolutionarily optimal life-history decisions. We find that small changes in environmental conditions can lead to abrupt transitions in optimal life histories when size-dependent mortality is sufficiently strong. Such discontinuous switching results from antagonistic selection pressures and occurs between strategies of early maturation with short reproductive periods and late maturation with long reproductive cycles. When mortality is size-selective and the size-independent component is not too high, selection favours prolonged juvenile growth, thereby allowing individuals to reach a mortality refuge at large body size before the onset of reproduction. When either component of mortality is then increased, the mortality refuge first becomes unattractive and eventually closes up altogether, resulting in short juvenile growth and frequent reproduction. Our results suggest a new mechanism for the evolution of life-history dimorphisms.\n      </p>", "Trees in cities display a varied pattern that is often moulded by a city's physical fabric and its evolution through time. The town plan expressed in spatial dimension as land use, and in temporal sense as development history, furnishes a framework to evaluate the intricate association between city and trees. Guangzhou city, the premier metropolis of south China, has been established for 2800 years, and has a long history of urban greening and heterogeneous land use. Five urban districts, which represent old, middle-aged and young stages of development and cover the bulk of the city's built-up zones, form the study area. Interpretation of aerial photographs is used as a basis to classify the urban forest into three types, and to design a sampling scheme for studying trees in urban parks, institutional grounds and roadsides. District history has bequeathed a plethora of configurations in terms of buildings, roads and land uses, accompanied by plantable spaces of dissimilar dimensions, geometry and quality. The districts display diverse tree attributes such as frequency, density and species diversity. Young districts, with lower density, more institutional uses and wider roads, present more opportunities for greening. Recent shifts in landscape fashion have introduced a significantly different treescape. A few exceptionally large parks and institutional sites play a pivotal role in the city's tree assets. Parks, roadsides and institutional forests have different tree-stocking rates and species assemblages. Implications for future planting and management of urban trees in different situations, and for the greening of other cities in China, and other developing countries, are explored.\n      </p>", "The general popularity of natural history in the eighteenth century is mirrored in the frequency and importance of the more than 4,500 articles on natural history in the \"Encyclop\u00e9die\". The main contributors to natural history were Daubenton, Diderot, Jaucourt and d'Holbach, but some of the key animating principles derive from Buffon, who wrote nothing specifically for the \"Encyclop\u00e9die\". Still, a number of articles reflect his thinking, especially his antipathy toward Linnaeus. There was in principle a natural tie between encyclopedism, with its emphasis on connected knowledge, and the task of natural historians who concentrated on the relationships among living forms. Both the encyclopedists and natural historians aimed at a sweeping overview of knowledge, and we see that Diderot's discussions of the encyclopedia were apparently informed by his reading of natural history. Most of the articles on natural history drew from traditional sources, but there are differences in emphasis and choice of subject, depending upon the author. Diderot's 300 contributions are often practical, interesting, and depend upon accounts from other parts of the world. Jaucourt, who wrote more articles on natural history than anyone else, followed in his footsteps. Daubenton's 900 articles reflected a more narrow, professional approach. His contributions concluded for the most part with Volume 8, and Jaucourt carried on almost single-handedly after that. While staking out traditional ground (description, taxonomy) and advancing newer theoretical views linked with Buffon, natural history in the \"Encyclop\u00e9die\" avoided almost completely the sentimentalism concerning nature that developed after Rousseau.\n      </p>", "This article describes the essentials of event history analysis, illustrated with data on marital stability from two waves of the National Survey of Families and Households. First, the advantages of event history analysis are described. Second, issues regarding data collection methods are briefly reviewed. The final three sections explain statistical procedures including survival tables, continuous time models, and discrete time models. Results indicate that individual assessments of marital stability at Wave 1, especially from wives, have a substantial influence on the likelihood of separation. Even after individual assessments are taken into account, however, demographic factors such as age at marriage, marital duration, prior experience in a disrupted marriage, and birth of a child continue to have a significant relationship with marital stability.\n      </p>", "The paper presents an analysis of the returns to a questionnaire survey on the state of department archives within UK departments of geography. The results of the survey are discussed in relation to recent work in geography which has examined the archive as a site for knowledge's making but seldom in its own terms as a resource for the history of geography, and studies within the archival sciences which have considered the archive as something more than a 'storehouse' for collective memory. The paper reveals that the archival record for the history of British geography is at best uneven, and in many departments non-existent, although information on departmental history is held, often as memory, by individual geographers. The paper considers the survey's implications for the future histories of British geography and addresses the nature of the UK geography department archive as resource and responsibility.\n      </p>", "Predator-mediated plasticity in the morphology, life history and behaviour of prey organisms has been widely reported in freshwater ecosystems. Although clearly adaptive, similar responses have only recently been reported for terrestrial organisms. This is surprising as aphids are polyphenic and develop very rapidly compared with their predators and often produce very large colonies, which are attractive to predators. Therefore, one might expect terrestrial organisms like aphids to show a facultative change in their development in response to the presence of predators and other results have confirmed this. The results presented below indicate that the pea aphid responded to the tracks left by ladybird larvae by producing a greater proportion of winged offspring, which avoid the impending increased risk of predation by dispersing. Associated with this was a short-term increase in activity and reduction in fecundity. The black bean and vetch aphids, which are afforded some protection from ladybirds because they are ant attended and/or unpalatable, did not respond in this way to the presence of ladybird larvae.\n      </p>", "This paper reviews critical developments in the international history of oral history and outlines four paradigmatic revolutions in theory and practice: the postwar renaissance of memory as a source for 'people's history'; the development, from the late 1970s, of 'post-positivist' approaches to memory and subjectivity; a transformation in perceptions about the role of the oral historian as interviewer and analyst from the late 1980s; and the digital revolution of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Threaded through discussion of these paradigm shifts are reflections upon four factors that have impacted oral history and, in turn, been significantly influenced by oral historians: the growing significance of political and legal practices in which personal testimony is a central resource; the increasing interdisciplinarity of approaches to interviewing and the interpretation of memory; the proliferation from the 1980s of studies concerned with the relationship between history and memory; and the evolving internationalism of oral history.\n      </p>", "Larvae of Hybosciara gigantea fed on leaf litter and formed compact masses of up to several hundred individuals. Sex ratios were often highly biased, and varied widely in different masses. Given the fact that in some sciarid species females are able to produce only a single sex of offspring, larvae in masses were probably often siblings; several other aspects of the flies's natural history were in accord with this hypothesis. Young adult females, but apparently not males, dispersed long distances. Males formed loose ephemeral swarms near vegetation where copulation occurred.\n      </p>", "This study establishes the phenology of the alternate life history phases of the green alga Acrosiphonia in British Columbia, Canada. Free-living, filamentous plants are seasonal, March-July, with peak percent cover (10%) in April. Plants are fertile immediately after establishment. The unicells, previously identified as Chlorochytrium inclusum and Codiolum petrocelidis, are the sporophyte phase of Acrosiphonia. 'Chlorochytrium,' spherical and 160-280 \u03bc m in diameter, colonizes the foliose red alga Mazzaella splendens 1 mo after filamentous Acrosiphonia plants appear. Maximum density (53 'Chlorochytrium' cells/cm2 of blade) was recorded in May. 'Codiolum,' on the other hand, is stalked (the vesicle measures 150 \u00d7 50 \u03bc m) and colonizes the red algal crust Petrocelis. Peak density (22400 'Codiolum' cells/cm2 of crust) was recorded 2 mo after 'Chlorochytrium' density peaked. The endophytes survive high summer temperatures, which correlate with death of the free-living plants, and overwinter in their hosts. Zoospore release in late winter corresponds to decreased host abundance, suggesting the endophytes have evolved a strategy whereby duration in the host is synchronized with host seasonality. A bet-hedging strategy is proposed for Acrosiphonia's life history: two morphologically different phases have adapted to a seasonally variable environment, with the sporophyte phase capable of colonizing two different hosts.\n      </p>", "In this article we give a survey of recent literature on the use and value of the history of geometry in mathematics education. It turns out that many authors have contributed to the debate why we should apply history. Their arguments can be divided into conceptual, (multi-) cultural and motivational ones. The number of authors who concentrated on the methodological question \"How could we introduce history into mathematics lessons?\" is considerably smaller. Those who want to make history an integral part of mathematics education have to bridge the gap between theoretical arguments and practical ideas, and, connected with this, between historians and teachers, and ultimately between mathematicians from the past and present day students. We divided the various surveyed publications, mainly journal articles, into categories according to a framework in order to clarify the discussion on the role of the history of geometry in education. Details about content and purpose of the articles are presented in two appendices, which make the articles more accessible both for further research and for practical teacher purposes.\n      </p>", "The mountainous region of northwest Greece has often been cited as a possible area for the existence of temperate tree taxa during the last glacial This series of papers examines the vegetational history and sedimentary history of two small basins in the Pindus mountain range of northwest Greece. The two basins are 18 km apart but at contrasting heights of 285 and 1800 m The present paper describes results from the lowland basin of Gramousti lake. Techniques of pollen analysis, plant macrofossil analysis, sediment chemistry, mineral magnetics and radiocarbon dating are employed to reconstruct both the vegetational and sedimentary history of the basin The sequence extends c 14 000 BP to c 1000 BP Palaeobotanical studies suggest that, during the lateglacial, vegetation in this lowland region was dominated by herbaceous taxa indicative of an open environment. Of the trees, only Quercus and Pinus were present, in low numbers. The lateglacial/postglacial transition was represented by an expansion of oak woodland and a reduction in steppe vegetation Quercus dominated woodland persisted throughout much of the postglacial and became more diverse at c 7500 BP with the arrival and expansion of Carpinus orientalis/Ostrya carpinifolia Anthropogenic intervention at c. 4500 BP was probably responsible for a reduction in the oak woodland and the formation of a vegetation type similar to present day which is dominated by herbaceous taxa and chew-resistant shrubs such as Quercus coccifera and Paliurus spina-christi\n      </p>", "Pollen analysis was carried out on sediment sequences from two small basins situated 6 km apart in the hills of west Mainland, Orkney. At both sites, vegetation development from the lateglacial until after the arrival of Neolithic people is recorded. An initial lateglacial heath, interrupted by a herbaceous phase indicating the Younger Dryas, was replaced by tallherb and grassland vegetation. The Saksunarvatn ash layer was recorded, coinciding with the arrival of Corylus avellana in the islands at around 92 ka BP. Extensive woodland developed at about 8000 yr BP, predominantly Betula-Corylus with Salix, Alnus glutinosa, Quercus and Pinus sylvestris occasionally present. The woodland was locally affected by Mesolithic human activity and finally lost at around 5 ka BP, partly as a consequence of Neolithic human activity. Mire development was actively proceeding in both basins after the woodland decline. The records illustrate the importance of human activity in the development of the treeless, varied landscape seen in Orkney today.\n      </p>", "By jointly considering patterns of genetic and life-history diversity in over 100 populations of Chinook salmon from California to British Columbia, we demonstrate the importance of two different mechanisms for life-history evolution. Mapping adult run timing (the life-history trait most commonly used to characterize salmon populations) onto a tree based on the genetic data shows that the same run-time phenotypes exist in many different genetic lineages. In a hierarchical gene diversity analysis, differences among major geographic and ecological provinces explained the majority (62%) of the overall GST, whereas run-time differences explained only 10%. Collectively, these results indicate that run-timing diversity has developed independently by a process of parallel evolution in many different coastal areas. However, genetic differences between coastal populations with different run timing from the same basin are very modest ($G_{ST} &lt; 0.02$), indicating that evolutionary divergence of this trait linked to reproductive isolation has not led to parallel speciation, probably because of ongoing gene flow. A strikingly different pattern is seen in the interior Columbia River Basin, where run timing and other correlated life-history traits map cleanly onto two divergent genetic lineages (GST \u223c 0.15), indicating that some patterns of life-history diversity have a much older origin. Indeed, genetic data indicate that in the interior Columbia Basin, the two divergent lineages behave essentially as separate biological species, showing little evidence of genetic contact in spite of the fact that they comigrate through large areas of the river and ocean and in some locations spawn in nearly adjacent areas.\n      </p>", "This study reports on the life-history traits of a stream population of the clam Musculium partumeium. The population displays two generations per year: a spring-born generation (SG) which reproduces twice (fall and following spring) and a fall-born generation (FG) which reproduces once in the spring. Traits for FG and SG generations are, respectively: maximum shell length, 5.1 and 6.1 mm; annual reproductive output (number of young born per average adult), 16 and 38; larval growth rate, 0.15 and 0.08 mm/wk; larval mortality, 67 and 48%; intrinsic rate of increase (r) 0.011 and 0.019/day. Compared with values for other populations of M. partumeium, our results were generally intermediate between those displayed by permanent pond populations (with 2 generations/year) and those of ephemeral pond populations (1 generation/year). This species appears to display a wide range of phenotypic plasticity in life-history traits.\n      </p>", "We conducted a mail survey of practicing pediatricians in Georgia to assess their knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding recording patients' environmental histories. Of 477 eligible pediatricians, 266 (55.8%) responded. Fewer than one in five reported having received training in environmental history-taking. Pediatricians reported that they strongly believe in the importance of environmental exposures in children's health, and 53.5% of respondents reported experience with a patient who was seriously affected by an environmental exposure. Pediatricians agreed moderately strongly that environmental history-taking is useful in identifying potentially hazardous exposures and in helping prevent these exposures. Respondents reported low self-efficacy regarding environmental history-taking, discussing environmental exposures with parents, and finding diagnosis and treatment resources related to environmental exposures. The probability of self-reported history-taking varied with the specific exposure, with environmental tobacco smoke and pets most frequently queried and asbestos, mercury, formaldehyde, and radon rarely queried. The pediatricians' preferred information resources include the American Academy of Pediatrics, newsletters, and patient education materials. Pediatricians are highly interested in pediatric environmental health but report low self-efficacy in taking and following up on environmental histories. There is considerable opportunity for training in environmental history-taking and for increasing the frequency with which such histories are taken.\n      </p>", "Plasmodium mexicanum, a malaria parasite of lizards, exhibits substantial variation among infections in the life-history traits which define its blood-dwelling stages. Such variation in life histories among infections is common in Plasmodium and may influence the ecology and evolution of the parasite's transmission success and virulence. Insight into these issues requires identification of independent traits (some traits may be bound by developmental trade-offs) and the importance of genetic versus host effects producing the variation. We studied 11 life-history traits in 120 induced infections of P. mexicanum in its natural lizard host (20 each from six donor infections). The traits varied among infections and fell into three clusters: rate/peak (rate of increase and peak parasitaemia of asexuals and gametocytes), time (duration of prepatent period and the infection's growth) and maturity (timing of first gametocytes). Thus, few life-history traits define an infection in the lizard's blood. Donor effects were significant for ten traits and two trait clusters (maturity was the exception) suggesting genetic differences among infections may influence the rate of increase and peak parasitacmia, but not the timing of the first production of gametocytes.\n      </p>", "A bioenergetics simulation model of the growth and life history of the aquatic predator Nephelopsis obscura Verrill was developed and validated using both experimentation and sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the model's internal feedbacks resulted in stability similar to homeostatic biological mechanisms. The experimental validation showed the model very accurately predicts growth at 10\u00b0 C and 15\u00b0 C but is slightly biased at 20\u00b0 C. Simulation output was also consistent with the observed data on Nephelopsis from the site from which the simulation input data were obtained and indicated that Nephelopsis growth is more sensitive to prey variation among years than to temperature variation. Although built using data from a population at one extreme of the spectrum observed in life history and growth, the model was able to emulate the growth of Nephelopsis throughout its range. Thus, the variability in size and life history observed in the field can be explained as the result of a plastic phenotype responding to different habitat conditions.\n      </p>", "This paper assesses the latitudinal extent of terrestrial breeding birds in Nicaragua. In particular, associations among latitudinal midpoint, body mass, and latitudinal extent are examined; significant differences between natural history characteristics (trophic guild, forest dependence, number of forest types) and latitudinal extent are identified; and a test is undertaken of Rapoport's rule for birds at the edge of their northern or southern range in Nicaragua. Birds in Nicaragua were classified into four categories based on latitudinal extent: birds generally restricted to Central America (20%); birds near the edge of their range within Nicaragua (34%); Neotropical birds (42%); and Pan-American birds (4%). Latitudinal midpoint had a significant negative correlation with latitudinal extent over different taxonomic scales. Natural history characteristics of trophic guild, forest dependence and number of forest types can account for significant differences in species latitudinal extent. Carnivores had greater latitudinal extents than most other trophic guilds, non-forest birds had greater latitudinal extents than birds that require patchy forest, and birds that occur in four or more forest types had greater latitudinal extents than birds restricted to one or two forest types. Contrary to Rapoport's rule, birds with a northern affinity or latitudinal midpoint north of Nicaragua had significantly smaller latitudinal extents than birds with a southern affinity or latitudinal midpoint south of Nicaragua. A comparison of natural history characteristics of birds with northern and southern affinities found no difference between trophic guild or forest dependence but a significant difference among the number of forest types used by forest birds. Birds with a southern affinity were restricted to fewer forest types than birds with a northern affinity.\n      </p>", "New York has a long tradition of attention to, caring for, and publishing local history. Approaches and intensity of interest have varied over the years, with strong local history publication in the late nineteenth century, an ebb in the early twentieth century but also a state requirement in 1919 for local governments to designate official historians, a sharp rise in the period of the bicentennial of the American Revolution, and, since that time, an increase in the publication of local history and other examples of progress such as the annual conference on New York State history. At the same time, though, there are substantial needs for better training, advocacy, and resources. New York's history programs are \u201clike a cluster of wind turbines,\u201d many exuding energy, others quiet and still.

We evaluated the association between family history of cancer and pediatric GCT in a Children's Oncology Group case\u2014control study that included 274 GCT cases (195 female and 79 male) diagnosed &lt;age 15 years and 418 controls frequency matched to cases on sex and age. Family history data were collected through telephone interviews with biological mothers and fathers and unconditional logistic regression was used to evaluate associations with GCT adjusting for potential confounders. A family history of cancer with onset &lt;age 40 years was associated with a reduced risk of GCT among female cases (Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.50, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.28\u20140.89) and an increased risk among male cases (OR = 2.56, 95% CI 1.02\u20146.44). Male cases were more likely to report family history of melanoma compared with male controls (OR = 4.65, 95% CI 1.40\u201415.4). There was an inverse association between family history of ovarian or uterine cancers and GCT in girls (OR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.22\u20140.96). These sex and cancer site specific associations should be confirmed in additional studies as they may provide clues to the etiology of pediatric GCT.\n      </p>", "Taking its departure from current debates over social capital, this article presents new textual findings in a backward-revealing conceptual history. In particular, it analyzes the texts and contexts of Lyda J. Hanifan who was rediscovered by Robert Putnam as having (allegedly first) used the term; it offers discoveries of earlier uses of the term and concept-most notably by John Dewey-thereby introducing critical pragmatism as another tradition of social capital; and it recovers features of the critique of political economy in the nineteenth century-from Bellamy to Marshall to Sidgwick to Marx-that assessed \"capital from the social point of view,\" especially cooperative associations. While it ends with Marx's use of \"social capital,\" Dewey is its central figure. The article concludes by returning to the present and offering work, sympathy, civic education, and a critical stance as emergent themes from this conceptual history that might enrich current debates.\n      </p>", "This article, based mainly on oral history research carried out in the 1990s, argues that the questions we ask of the past can yield ambiguous information which is difficult to interpret. Finding out that women of the house in 1920s-1960s Ireland worked hard, often controlled the money and made the decisions, tells us little about their every day lives. When women surrendered economic independence for marriage - as progressively fewer of them were inclined to do, from the mid-1940s - they often prioritized comfort over control, and found some kinds of spousal help and involvement better than others.\n      </p>", "In Drosophila melanogaster, exposure of females to low temperature and shortened photoperiod can induce the expression of reproductive quiescence or diapause. Diapause expression is highly variable within and among natural populations and has significant effects on life-history profiles, including patterns of longevity, fecundity, and stress resistance. We hypothesized that if diapause expression is associated with overwintering mechanisms and adaptation to temperate environments, the frequency of diapause incidence would exhibit a latitudinal cline among natural populations. Because stress resistance and reproductive traits are also clinal in this species, we also examined how patterns of fecundity and longevity varied with geography and how stress resistance and associated traits differed constitutively between diapause and nondiapause lines. Diapause incidence was shown to vary predictably with latitude, ranging from 35% to 90% among natural populations in the eastern United States Survivorship under starvation stress differed between diapause and nondiapause lines; diapause phenotypes were also distinct for total body triglyceride content and the developmental distribution of oocytes in the ovary following stress exposure. Patterns of longevity, fecundity, and ovariole number also varied with geography. The data suggest that, for North American populations, diapause expression is functionally associated with overwintering mechanisms and may be an integral life-history component in natural populations.\n      </p>", "Allometry for sexual size dimorphism (SSD) is common in animals, but how different evolutionary processes interact to determine allometry remains unclear. Among related species SSD (male : female) typically increases with average body size, resulting in slopes of less than 1 when female size is regressed on male size: an allometric relationship formalized as 'Rensch's rule'. Empirical studies show that taxa with male-biased SSD are more likely to satisfy Rensch's rule and that a taxon's mean SSD is negatively correlated with allometric slope, implicating sexual selection on male size as an important mechanism promoting allometry for SSD. I use body length (and life-history) data from 628 (259) populations of seven species of anadromous Pacific salmon and trout (Oncorhynchus spp.) to show that in this genus life-history variation appears to regulate patterns of allometry both within and between species. Although all seven species have intraspecific allometric slopes of less than 1, contrary to expectation slope is unrelated to species' mean SSD, but is instead negatively correlated with two life-history variables: the species' mean marine age and variation in marine age. Second, because differences in marine age among species render SSD and body size uncorrelated, the interspecific slope is isometric. Together, these results provide an example of how evolutionary divergence in life history among related species can affect patterns of allometry for SSD across taxonomic scales.\n      </p>", "People with familial history of disease often consult with genetic counselors about their chance of carrying mutations that increase disease risk. To aid them, genetic counselors use Mendelian models that predict whether the person carries deleterious mutations based on their reported family history. Such models rely on accurate reporting of each member's diagnosis and age of diagnosis, but this information may be inaccurate. Commonly encountered errors in family history can significantly distort predictions, and thus can alter the clinical management of people undergoing counseling, screening, or genetic testing. We derive general results about the distortion in the carrier probability estimate caused by misreported diagnoses in relatives. We show that the Bayes factor that channels all family history information has a convenient and intuitive interpretation. We focus on the ratio of the carrier odds given correct diagnosis versus given misreported diagnosis to measure the impact of errors. We derive the general form of this ratio and approximate it in realistic cases. Misreported age of diagnosis usually causes less distortion than misreported diagnosis. This is the first systematic quantitative assessment of the effect of misreported family history on mutation prediction. We apply the results to the BRCAPRO model, which predicts the risk of carrying a mutation in the breast and ovarian cancer genes BRCA1 and BRCA2.\n      </p>", "This article considers the work of a small group within the nursing profession in the period after the Second World War when they were responsible for running the UK's large institutions for people with learning disabilities.

The many herb and shrub species initially found in post-agricultural areas of this site declined or disappeared as the forest canopy closed. Tsuga canadensis ([L.] Carriere) increased in importance in the forest canopy until the introduction of the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae Annand). Shade-intolerant under-story species are now increasing in abundance as the death of large T. canadensis opens gaps in the canopy. Mantel path analysis, a multivariate technique that allows examination of indirect and direct relationships among variables, was used to quantify the complex network of relationships among environment, land use history and plant community composition. Overall environmental variability was uncorrelated with vegetation, except within the shrub stratum. Slope and drainage were the most important individual environmental factors measured. Land use history was strongly correlated with all four strata, and the strength of this relationship decreased over time. The composition of the tree seedling stratum was highly variable through time; other strata showed more self-similarity between sample dates. Land use history appears to impact the vegetation so strongly as to conceal any effects of environmental variation on this site.\n      </p>", "According to life-history theory, the development of immune function should be balanced through evolutionary optimization of the allocation of resources to reproduction and through mechanisms that promote survival. We investigated interspecific variability in cell-mediated immune response (CMI), as measured by the phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) assay, in relation to clutch size, longevity and other life-history traits in 50 species of birds. CMI exhibited significant repeatability within species, and PHA responses in chicks were consistently stronger than in adults. Univariate tests showed a variety of significant relationships between the CMI of both chicks and adults with respect to size, development period and lifespan, but not clutch size or prevalence of blood parasites in adults. Multivariate analyses confirmed these patterns but independent variables were too highly correlated to isolate unique influences on CMI. The positive relationship of chick CMI to nestling period is further complicated by a parallel relationship of chick CMI to the age at testing. However, multivariate analysis showed that chick CMI varies uniquely with length of the nestling period. Adult CMI was associated with a strong life-history axis of body size, development rate and longevity. Therefore, adult CMI may be associated with prevention and repair mechanisms related to long lifespan, but it also may be allometrically related to body size through other pathways. Neither chick CMI nor adult CMI was related to clutch size, contradicting previous results linking parasite-related mortality to CMI and the evolution of clutch size (reproductive investment) in birds.\n      </p>", "This article offers a re-interpretation of the geographical pivot of history by setting it in the context of the international relations and strategic debates of the early twentieth century, and by engaging with the historiography of British foreign policy during the Edwardian period. The overall argument is that the prospective effort of Mackinder does not appear as merely speculative but is in fact rather well grounded in the fundamentals of British foreign policy and more directly relevant than hitherto assumed. Identifying a trend towards a shift in the equilibrium between land power and sea power, Mackinder emphasized - and perhaps over-emphasized - a Russian threat to British interests but considered that Germany alone only posed a minor threat. Such analysis seems to be remarkably in tune with British geopolitical culture around 1904, and with the ideas of the British Prime Minister Arthur Balfour. The way in which Mackinder further stressed that a combination of the two main continental powers would represent a major peril for Britain has hitherto been treated rather dismissively. This article however shows how twice during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5 Wilhelm II attempted to bring such an alliance about. This article attempts to reassess the actual impact of the geographical pivot of history and more broadly of Mackinder's thought, usually considered minimal, on British foreign policy before 1914. Finally, a number of issues that seem to deserve further attention are suggested, in particular that of the influence exerted by Mackinder before 1914, and that of the genesis of Mackinder's conception of the 'pivot zone' or 'heartland'.\n      </p>", "The selective pressures involved in the evolution of semelparity and its associated life-history traits are largely unknown. We used species-level analyses, independent contrasts, and reconstruction of ancestral states to study the evolution of body length, fecundity, egg weight, gonadosomatic index, and parity (semelparity vs. degree of iteroparity) in females of 12 species of salmonid fishes. According to both species-level analysis and independent contrasts analysis, body length was positively correlated with fecundity, egg weight, and gonadosomatic index, and semelparous species exhibited a significantly steeper slope for the regression of egg weight on body length than did iteroparous species. Percent repeat breeding (degree of iteroparity) was negatively correlated with gonadosomatic index using independent contrasts analysis. Semelparous species had significantly larger eggs by species-level analysis, and the egg weight contrast for the branch on which semelparity was inferred to have originated was significantly larger than the other egg weight contrasts, corresponding to a remarkable increase in egg weight. Reconstruction of ancestral states showed that egg weight and body length apparently increased with the origin of semelparity, but fecundity and gonadosomatic index remained more or less constant or decreased. Thus, the strong evolutionary linkages between body size, fecundity, and gonadosomatic index were broken during the transition from iteroparity to semelparity. These findings suggest that long-distance migrations, which increase adult mortality between breeding episodes, may have been necessary for the origin of semelparity in Pacific salmon, but that increased egg weight, leading to increased juvenile survivorship, was crucial in driving the transition. Our analyses support the life-history hypotheses that a lower degree of repeat breeding is linked to higher reproductive investment per breeding episode, and that semelparity evolves under a combination of relatively high juvenile survivorship and relatively low adult survivorship.\n      </p>"], "words": {"essay": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "represent": {"number": 1,
