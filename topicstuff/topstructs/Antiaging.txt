Evidence suggests that the antiaging transmembrane protein Klotho (KL) is shed from the cell surface by proteolytic cleavage. In this study, we attempted to identify the enzymes responsible for the shedding of KL by treating KL-transfected COS-7 cells with a panel of proteinase inhibitors and measuring cleavage products by Western blot. We report that metalloproteinase inhibitors, including EDTA, EGTA, and TAPI-1, inhibit the shedding of KL, whereas insulin increases shedding. The effects of the inhibitors in KL-transfected COS-7 cells were repeated in studies on rat kidney slices ex vivo, which validates the use of COS-7 cells as our model system. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (Timp)-3 effectively inhibits KL cleavage, whereas Timp-1 and Timp-2 do not, a profile that indicates the involvement of members of the A Desintegrin and Metalloproteinase (ADAM) family. Cotransfection of KL with either ADAM10 or ADAM17 enhances KL cleavage, whereas cotransfection of KL with small interference RNAs specific to ADAM10 and ADAM17 inhibits KL secretion. These results indicate that KL shedding is mediated mainly by ADAM10 and ADAM17 in KL-transfected COS-7 cells. The effect of insulin is abolished when ADAM10 or ADAM17 are silenced. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the effect of insulin on KL shedding is inhibited by wortmannin, showing that insulin acts through a PI3K-dependent pathway. Insulin enhances KL shedding without increasing ADAM10 and ADAM17 mRNA and protein levels, suggesting that it acts by stimulating their proteolytic activities.\n      </p>", "Age-related accumulation of cellular damage and death has been linked to oxidative stress. Calorie restriction (CR) is the most robust, nongenetic intervention that increases lifespan and reduces the rate of aging in a variety of species. Mechanisms responsible for the antiaging effects of CR remain uncertain, but reduction of oxidative stress within mitochondria remains a major focus of research. CR is hypothesized to decrease mitochondrial electron flow and proton leaks to attenuate damage caused by reactive oxygen species. We have focused our research on a related, but different, antiaging mechanism of CR. Specifically, using both in vivo and in vitro analyses, we report that CR reduces oxidative stress at the same time that it stimulates the proliferation of mitochondria through a peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor coactivator l\u03b1 signaling pathway. Moreover, mitochondria under CR conditions show less oxygen consumption, reduce membrane potential, and generate less reactive oxygen species than controls, but remarkably they are able to maintain their critical ATP production. In effect, CR can induce a peroxisome proliferationactivated receptor coactivator 1\u03b1-dependent increase in mitochondria capable of efficient and balanced bioenergetics to reduce oxidative stress and attenuate age-dependent endogenous oxidative damage.\n      </p>", "Food restriction has long been known to prolong life in rodents, and recent studies have shown it to have antiaging effects in regard to a variety of physiologic and pathologic processes. It has been suggested that these actions of food restriction relate to the reduction of metabolic rate per unit of body mass brought about by this dietary regimen. Data are presented in this report showing that food restriction can have a marked life-prolonging action in rats without reducing caloric intake per gram of body weight. Moreover, the food-restricted rats consumed a greater number of calories per gram of body weight during their lifetimes than did the rats fed ad lib, yet they lived longer. Thus, the data in this report do not support the concept that food restriction slows the rate of aging by decreasing the metabolic rate.\n      </p>", "Reduction of core body temperature has been proposed to contribute to the increased life span and the antiaging effects conferred by calorie restriction (CR). Validation of this hypothesis has been difficult in homeotherms, primarily due to a lack of experimental models. We report that transgenic mice engineered to overexpress the uncoupling protein 2 in hypocretin neurons (Hcrt-UCP2) have elevated hypothalamic temperature. The effects of local temperature elevation on the central thermostat resulted in a 0.3\u00b0 to 0.5\u00b0C reduction of the core body temperature. Fed ad libitum, Hcrt-UCP2 transgenic mice had the same caloric intake as their wild-type littermates but had increased energy efficiency and a greater median life span (12% increase in males; 20% increase in females). Thus, modest, sustained reduction of core body temperature prolonged life span independent of altered diet or CR.\n      </p>", "Aging and cancer share a number of characteristics. This has led to the hypothesis that species' differences in longevity may be governed in part by the same mechanisms as those processes governing species' differences in their age-dependent probability of developing cancer. Much evidence has indicated that \u03b2 -carotene and retinol may be important natural anticarcinogens. Accordingly, they also may be important antiaging agents. This possibility has been tested by determining if a positive correlation exists between the concentration of carotenoids and retinol in serum and brain tissue with the maximal life-span potential of mammalian species. The results show a significant positive correlation for the carotenoids but not for retinol. These results suggest that the carotenoids may be biologically active as protective agents against cancer and as longevity determinants. Retinol appears to be less important in these functions.\n      </p>", "Caloric restriction (CR) is the most potent intervention known to both protect against carcinogenesis and extend lifespan in laboratory animals. A variety of anticarcinogens and CR mimetics induce and activate the NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. Nrf2, in turn, induces a number of antioxidative and carcinogen-detoxifying enzymes. Thus, Nrf2 offers a promising target for anticarcinogenesis and antiaging interventions. We used Nrf2-disrupted (KO) mice to examine its role on the biological effects of CR. Here, we show that Nrf2 is responsible for most of the anticarcinogenic effects of CR, but is dispensable for increased insulin sensitivity and lifespan extension. Nrf2-deficient mice developed tumors more readily in response to carcinogen exposure than did WT mice, and CR was ineffective in suppressing tumors in the KO mice. However, CR extended lifespan and increased insulin sensitivity similarly in KO and WT mice. These findings identify a molecular pathway that dissociates the prolongevity and anticarcinogenic effects of CR.\n      </p>", "Broad aspects of Caenorhabditis elegans life history, including larval developmental timing, arrest at the dauer diapause, and longevity, are regulated by the nuclear receptor DAF-12. Endogenous DAF-12 ligands are 3-keto bile acid-like steroids, called dafachronic acids, which rescue larval defects of hormone-deficient mutants, such as daf-9/cytochrome P450 and daf-36/Rieske oxygenase, and activate DAF-12. Here we examined the effect of dafachronic acid on pathways controlling lifespan. Dafachronic acid supplementation shortened the lifespan of long-lived daf-9 mutants and abolished their stress resistance, indicating that the ligand is \"proaging\" in response to signals from the dauer pathways. However, the ligand extended the lifespan of germ-line ablated daf-9 and daf-36 mutants, showing that it is \"antiaging\" in the germ-line longevity pathway. Thus, dafachronic acid regulates C. elegans lifespan according to signaling state. These studies provide key evidence that bile acid-like steroids modulate aging in animals.\n      </p>", "Klotho, an antiaging gene with restricted organ distribution, is mainly expressed in the kidney tubules; the mutant mice have shortened life span, arteriosclerosis, anemia, and osteoporesis, features common to patients with chronic renal failure. Conceivably, the reduction of the Klotho gene expression may contribute to the development of kidney failure; alternatively, its overexpression may lead to the amelioration of renal injury in an ICR-derived glomerulonephritis (ICGN) mouse model with subtle immune complex-mediated disease. To address this issue, four different strains of mice were generated by cross-breeding: ICGN mice without the Klotho transgene (ICGN), ICGN mice with the Klotho transgene (ICGN/klTG), wild-type mice with the Klotho transgene (klTG), and wild-type mice without the Klotho transgene (control). At 40 weeks old, the survival rate was \u224830% in ICGN mice, and \u224870% in the ICGN/klTG group. This improvement was associated with dramatic improvement in renal functions, morphological lesions, and cytochrome c oxidase activity but a reduction in \u03b2-galactosidase activity (a senescence-associated protein), mitochondrial DNA fragmentation, superoxide anion generation, lipid peroxidation, and Bax protein expression and apoptosis. Interestingly, improvement was seen in both the tubular and glomerular compartments of the kidney, although Klotho is exclusively confined to the tubules, suggesting that its gene product has a remarkable reno-protective effect by potentially serving as a circulating hormone while mitigating the mitochondrial oxidative stress.\n      </p>", "Unossified horn or pilose antler cut from deer, which belong to the Cervidae generally is termed Nokyong. Nokyong is one of the most famous Korean traditional medicines and has been considered to possess sexual-reinforcing and antiaging actions. In this study, water extract of deer antler extract (DAA) prepared from the growing antler of Cervus korean TEMMINCK var. mantchuricus Swinhoe was used to investigate the efficacy of the DAA on the development of type II collagen (CII)-induced arthritis (CIA) in rats. Male rats were immunized with an emulsion of 200 \u00b5g of CII and complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). The rats then were administered by injection a suspension of DAA or phosphate-buffered saline. The effect of DAA on cellular responses to CII was examined. The injection of DAA suppressed the CII-specific secretion of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 from splenocytes ex vivo. The influence of DAA also was evaluated on the incidence and development of arthritis in rat CIA. Rats were immunized twice at a 3-wk interval with bovine CII, with DAA being given by injection once a d for 14 d with four different regimens. A 14-d course of DAA treatment at a daily dose of 100 \u00b5g/kg, which began on the d of the first CII immunization, suppressed the development of arthritis, as well as antibody formation and delayed-type hypersensitivity to CII. Treatment with DAA resulted in inhibition of development of arthritis and immune responses to CII.\n      </p>", "When the food intake of organisms such as yeast and rodents is reduced (dietary restriction), they live longer than organisms fed a normal diet. A similar effect is seen when the activity of nutrientsensing pathways is reduced by mutations or chemical inhibitors. In rodents, both dietary restriction and decreased nutrient-sensing pathway activity can lower the incidence of age-related loss of function and disease, including tumors and neurodegeneration. Dietary restriction also increases life span and protects against diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease in rhesus monkeys, and in humans it causes changes that protect against these age-related pathologies. Tumors and diabetes are also uncommon in humans with mutations in the growth hormone receptor, and natural genetic variants in nutrient-sensing pathways are associated with increased human life span. Dietary restriction and reduced activity of nutrient-sensing pathways may thus slow aging by similar mechanisms, which have been conserved during evolution. We discuss these findings and their potential application to prevention of age-related disease and promotion of healthy aging in humans, and the challenge of possible negative side effects.\n      </p>", "This paper situates age discrimination within a broader system of age relations that intersects with other inequalities, and then uses that framework to analyze internet advertisements for the anti-aging industry. Such ads reinforce age and gender relations by positing old people as worthwhile only to the extent that they look and act like those who are middle aged or younger, by defining manhood and womanhood in opposition to each other, and by defining old age as an unhealthy loss of gender identity. These ads promote a reversion to middle age and white, middle-class, heterosexual norms of male performance and female beauty. The analysis demonstrates the utility of understanding age discrimination in terms of intersecting relations of inequality rather than learned attitudes alone.\n      </p>", "Aging can be slowed in laboratory rodents by low-calorie diets, and changes in single genes can extend mouse life span by 40 percent or more. Therefore, despite its surface complexity and effects on multiple cells and intercellular systems, aging in mammals might also be retarded by both genetic and nongenetic means. If human aging could be slowed pharmacologically to the extent now possible in rodents, the effect on healthy life expectancy would exceed that of abolishing cancer, cardiovascular disease, and adult-onset diabetes. Why, then, is research on the biological control of aging and longevity poorly funded and shunned by both most scientists and those setting national research priorities? Economic disincentives, disease-specific lobby groups, scientific careerism, and ineffective nostrums, together with gerontologiphobia, must be overcome before such research can improve public health.\n      </p>", "The emergence and proliferation of anti-aging medicine since the 1990s situates the process of aging-rather than \"age-associated\" disease-as a target for biomedical intervention. Bypassing the notion of disease entirely, anti-aging proponents argue that biological aging is the problem. The shift tendered by anti-aging proponents proceeds largely upon predictions for the future, A compelling prediction must have built into it a sense of feasibility and a sense of moral purpose. Feasibility is principally predicated upon a particular history and a map for the endeavors' imagined success. The notion that aging is painful and costly both for the individual and for society links with the powerful ethic of scientific progress to ground anti-aging predictions in the here and now of scientific funding, research and practice. lmagining this kind of future demands, in this sense, its pursuit. And its pursuit then refashions our relationship to our past by reifying the particular history in which it is embedded.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "The soluble crystallins in lenses from diet-restricted and control mice of diverse ages (2, 11, or 30 months) were studied by high-performance liquid chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate--polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Indian system of health care and longevity. It involves a holistic view of man, his health, and illness. Ayurvedic treatment of a disease consists of salubrious use of drugs, diets, and certain practices. Medicinal preparations are invariably complex mixtures, based mostly on plant products. Around 1,250 plants are currently used in various Ayurvedic preparations. Many Indian medicinal plants have come under scientific scrutiny since the middle of the nineteenth century, although in a sporadic fashion. The first significant contribution from Ayurvedic materia medica came with the isolation of the hypertensive alkaloid from the sarpagandha plant (Rauwolfia serpentina), valued in Ayurveda for the treatment of hypertension, insomnia, and insanity. This was the first important ancient-modern concordance in Ayurvedic plants. With the gradual coming of age of chemistry and biology, disciplines central to the study of biologic activities of natural products, many Ayurvedic plants have been reinvestigated. Our work on Commiphora wightti gum-resin, valued in Ayurveda for correcting lipid disorders, has been described in some detail; based on these investigations, a modern antihyperlipoproteinemic drug is on the market in India and some other countries. There has also been concordance for a few other Ayurvedic crude drugs such as Asparagus racemosus, Cedrus deodara, and Psoralea corylifolia.\n      </p>", "Biosphere 2 is a 3.15-acre space containing an ecosystem that is energetically open (sunlight, electric power, and heat) but materially closed, with air, water, and organic material being recycled. Since September 1991, eight subjects (four women and four men) have been sealed inside, living on food crops grown within. Their diet, low in calories (average, 1780 kcal/day; 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ), low in fat (10% of calories), and nutrient-dense, conforms to that which in numerous animal experiments has promoted health, retarded aging, and extended maximum life span. We report here medical data on the eight subjects, comparing preclosure data with data through 6 months of closure. Significant changes included: (i) weight, 74 to 62 kg (men) and 61 to 54 kg (women); (ii) mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure (eight subjects), 109/74 to 89/58 mmHg (1 mmHg = 133 Pa); (iii) total serum cholesterol, from 191 \u00b1 11 to 123 \u00b1 9 mg/dl (mean \u00b1 SD; 36% mean reduction), and high density lipoprotein, from 62 \u00b1 8 to 38 \u00b1 5 (risk ratio unchanged); (iv) triglyceride, 139 to 96 mg/dl (men) and 78 to 114 mg/dl (women); (v) fasting glucose, 92 to 74 mg/dl; (vi) leukocyte count, 6.7 to 4.7 x 109 cells per liter. We conclude that drastic reductions in cholesterol and blood pressure may be instituted in normal individuals in Western countries by application of a carefully chosen diet and that a low-calorie nutrient-dense regime shows physiologic features in humans similar to those in other animal species.\n      </p>", "Restriction of the number of calories consumed extends longevity in many organisms. In rodents, caloric restriction decreases the levels of plasma glucose and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1) and postpones or attenuates cancer, immunose-nescence, and inflammation without irreversible side effects. In organisms ranging from yeast to mice, mutations in glucose or IGF-I-like signaling pathways extend life-span but also cause glycogen or fat accumulation and dwarfism.

Because serum levels of active vitamin D are greatly increased upon genetic ablation of Fgf-23 or Klotho, we find that these molecules have a dual role in suppression of apoptotic actions of vitamin D through both negative regulation of 1\u03b1-hydroxylase expression and phosphoinositide-3 kinase-dependent inhibition of caspase activity. These data provide new insights into the physiological roles of FGF-23 and Klotho.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

As the authors concede, this juxtaposition appears at first to offend intuition: According to the DS theory, senescence is the result of a tight budget for caloric energy, such that repair and maintenance functions are shortchanged; yet, in CR experiments, it is found that longevity decreases smoothly as the total caloric budget is increased. In the Shanley-Kirkwood model, an optimized allocation of resources causes energy to be diverted away from somatic maintenance at a greater rate than caloric intake increases, with the net result that more total energy is associated with less energy available for maintenance. In the present critique, the limitations of this model are detailed and its special assumptions reviewed. While the CR experiments find comparable life extension for males and females, measured relative to nonbreeding controls, the Shanley-Kirkwood model draws its energy budget from data on breeding females. In addition, the success in reproducing the observed relationship between feeding and longevity depends crucially on a mathematical relationship between food availability and the probability of reproductive success which may be difficult to justify.\n      </p>", "More and more people are living past 110.

Because an age-related decline in proteasome activity is 1 of the reasons for the accumulation of abnormal proteins during aging, we have investigated the effects of RMHS on the 20S proteasome, which is the major proteolytic system involved in the removal of abnormal and oxidatively damaged proteins. Serially passaged human skin fibroblasts exposed to RMHS at 41\u00b0C for 60 minutes twice a week had increased 3 proteasomal activities by 40% to 95% in early- and midpassage cultures. RMHS-treated cells also contained a 2-fold higher amount of the proteasome activator 11S, and the extent of the bound activator was double in early- and midpassage cells only. Furthermore, there was no difference in the content of the 19S proteasome regulator in the stressed and the unstressed cells. Therefore, RMHS-induced proteasome stimulatin in early- and midpassage fibroblasts appears to be due to an induction and enhanced binding of 11S proteasome activators. In contrast to this, the proteasomal system in late-passage senescent cells appears to be less responsive to the stimulatory effects of mild heat shock.\n      </p>", "A cell's decision whether to undergo apoptosis (cell suicide) is examined here from an Adaptationist perspective, rather than a mechanistic one.

A system in which each cell takes primary responsibility for deciding its own fate has great adaptive value because it harnesses each cell's self-knowledge rather than waiting for external cues to be recognized by other cells. Cell self-destruction can be an important selective mechanism, potentially leading to better performance of tissues over time. However, reliance on cells to monitor themselves has a flaw, since cells may incur selfish mutations that impair their apoptotic responsibility. The tight control exerted over somatic cells serves to check selfish genes involved in neoplasia and viral infections. Germ cells appear to be similarly monitored, both by other germ cells and by supporting follicular or Sertoli cells, thus maintaining the advantages offered by an apoptotic system. The adaptationist approach views the limited replacement of neurons and cardiac myocytes as likely to have net survival value. The linkage of these cell into a network with their neighbors throughout a lifetime allows for a precisely functioning team of cells expected to compensate for gradual declines in individual cell functionality. Replacement of apoptotic cells with naive cells might decrease brain functionality and might risk upsetting the conduction of cardiac impulses. The evolutionary viewpoint lends itself to new hypotheses, but only the boldest speculator would have predicted a system in which cells are given primary responsibility for deciding whether to kill themselves when they deem it beneficial to the organism.\n      </p>", "Sestrin s are conserved proteins that accumulate in cells exposed to stress, potentiate adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and inhibit activation of target of rapamycin (TOR). We show that the abundance of Drosophila sestrin (dSesn) is increased upon chronic TOR activation through accumulation of reactive oxygen species that cause activation of c-Jun aminoterminal kinase and transcription factor Forkhead box O (FoxO). Loss of dSesn resulted in ageassociated pathologies including triglyc\u00e9ride accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, muscle degeneration, and cardiac malfunction, which were prevented by pharmacological activation of AMPK or inhibition of TOR. Hence, dSesn appears to be a negative feedback regulator of TOR that integrates metabolic and stress inputs and prevents pathologies caused by chronic TOR activation that may result from diminished autophagic clearance of damaged mitochondria, protein aggregates, or lipids.\n      </p>", "Mutations that increase the longevity of the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans could define genes involved in a process specific for aging. Alternatively, these mutations could reduce animal metabolic rate and increase longevity as a consequence. In ectotherms, longevity is often negatively correlated with metabolic rate. Consistent with these observations, environmental conditions that reduce the metabolic rate of C. elegans also extend longevity. We found that the metabolic rate of long-lived C. elegans mutants is reduced compared with that of wild-type worms and that a genetic suppressor that restored normal longevity to long-lived mutants restored normal metabolic rate. Thus, the increased longevity of some long-lived C. elegans mutants may be a consequence of a reduction in their metabolic rate, rather than an alteration of a genetic pathway that leads to enhanced longevity while maintaining normal physiology. The actual mechanism responsible for the inverse correlation between metabolic rate and longevity remains unknown.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "According to resource allocation theory, animals face a trade off between the allocation of resources into reproduction and into individual growth/maintenance. This trade off is reinforced when food conditions decline. It is well established in biological research that many animals increase their life span when food is in suboptimal supply for growth and/or reproduction. Such a situation of reduced food availability is called dietary restriction. An increase in life span under dietary restricted conditions is seen as a strategy to tolerate periods of food shortage so that the animals can start reproduction again when food is in greater supply. In this study, the effect of dietary restriction on life span and reproduction in two rotifer species, Cephalodella sp. and Elosa worallii, was investigated using life table experiments. The food concentration under dietary restricted conditions was below the threshold for population growth. It was (1) tested whether the rotifers start reproduction again after food replenishment, and (2) estimated whether the time scale of dietary restricted conditions is relevant for the persistence of a population in the field. Only E. worallii responded to dietary restriction with an increase in life span at the expense of reproduction. After replenishment of food, E. worallii started to reproduce again within 1 day. With an increase in the duration of dietary restricted conditions of up to 15 days, which is longer than the median life span of E. worallii under food saturation, the life span increased and the life time reproduction decreased. These results suggest that in a temporally (or spatially) variable environment, some rotifer populations can persist even during long periods of severe food deprivation.\n      </p>", "Senescence is the progressive deterioration of organismal function leading to accelerating rates of mortality. Cumulative extrinsic and intrinsic stresses are thought to contribute to senescence. Molecular chaperones, such as heat shock proteins, are hypothesized to modulate senescence through their ability to mitigate protein damage. Recent discoveries made with the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster lend strong support to this theory. Longevity extending mutants of the nematode also increase intrinsic and inducible thermotolerance, and they overexpress heat shock proteins upon thermal shock. Intriguingly, these genes regulate dauer (diapause) formation, and are associated with an insulin-like dependent signal transduction pathway. Direct evidence for a casual role of hsp70 in aging is provided by analysis of transgenic fruit flies. When hsp70 is induced by mild heat shock, flies that overexpress the protein have greatly reduced mortality rates during subsequent weeks of aging at normal temperatures. Current work with fruit flies focuses on the relationship between insulin-like receptors, ovarian diapause, heat shock and aging.\n      </p>", "Monotonicity properties of certain classes of point processes with respect to the Palm measure are exploited to derive upper and lower bounds on the total variation distance away from Poisson of these processes. The results obtained are applied to new better than used and new worse than used renewal processes and to a Cox process with rates given by a two state Markov chain.\n      </p>", "The age distributions of industrialized societies are rapidly changing, thereby altering the traditional relations between age groups. Some observers think ageism is increasing in the United States; others, that it is decreasing. In either case, stereotypes of old age are now changing with the rise of the young-old-that is, the age group 55 to 75, who constitute 15 percent of the population-who are relatively healthy, relatively affluent, relatively free from traditional responsibilities of work and family and who are increasingly well educated and politically active. This group will develop a variety of new needs with regard to meaningful use of time and for maximizing the opportunities for both self-enhancement and community participation. The young-old have enormous potential as agents of social change in creating an age-irrelevant society and in thus improving the relations between age groups.\n      </p>", "A putative metalloprotease was purifed from mycelium of Ganoderma lucidum. The enzyme was purified by anion exchange, chromatofocusing, and gel filtration chromatography. The Mr was determined to be 52 000 by SDS-PAGE and 100 000 by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-150 column, indicating that it is a dimer. The enzyme was inhibited by EDTA, 1,10-phenanthroline, and phosphoamidon. The presence of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; was detected by ICP mass spectral analysis as 1.1 mol of &lt;tex-math&gt;$\\text{Zn}^{2-}$&lt;/tex-math&gt; per mol of protease. This protease hydrolyzed A&lt;sub&gt;\u03b1&lt;/sub&gt; and B&lt;sub&gt;\u03b2&lt;/sub&gt; chains of human fibrinogen, but did not cleave thrombin, albumin, hemoglobin, and immunoglobulin under the same condition. It also showed an anticoagulant activity in human plasma. The enzyme delayed the activated partial thromboplastin time and thrombin time, but not the clotting induced by reptilase, indicating Ganoderma protease is specific to thrombin. Ganoderma protease behaved as a competitive inhibitor of thrombin-catalyzed fibrin formation, but no inhibition of thrombin was found with a small synthetic peptide. These observations indicate that Ganoderma protease could bind thrombin at an anion binding exosite distinct from the active site and cause the delay of clotting time induced by thrombin.\n      </p>", "The tumor suppressor p53 can trigger cell death independently of its transcriptional activity through subcellular translocation and activation of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members. The regulation of such activity of endogenous p53 in response to stress remains largely unknown. Here we show that nuclear, activated FOXO3a could impair p53 transcriptional activity. However, activation of FOXO3a either on serum starvation or by expressing a constitutively active form of FOXO3a could induce p53-dependent apoptosis, even in cells bearing a transcriptionally inactive form of p53. Furthermore, FOXO3a could promote p53 cytoplasmic accumulation by increasing its association with nuclear exporting machinery. Our data also suggest that PUMA and Bax are required for p53-dependent apoptosis in manner that is independent of p53 transcriptional activity.\n      </p>", "Identifying the molecular targets for the beneficial or detrimental effects of small-molecule drugs is an important and currently unmet challenge. We have developed a method, drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS), which takes advantage of a reduction in the protease susceptibility of the target protein upon drug binding. DARTS is universally applicable because it requires no modification of the drug and is independent of the mechanism of drug action. We demonstrate use of DARTS to identify known small-molecule-protein interactions and to reveal the eukaryotic translation initiation machinery as a molecular target for the longevity-enhancing plant natural product resveratrol. We envisage that DARTS will also be useful in global mapping of protein-metabolite interaction networks and in label-free screening of unlimited varieties of compounds for development as molecular imaging agents.\n      </p>", "FKHRL1 (FOXO3a) and p53 are two potent stress-response regulators. Here we show that these two transcription factors exhibit \"crosstalk\" in vivo. In response to DNA damage, p53 activation led to FKHRL1 phosphorylation and subcellular localization change, which resulted in inhibition of FKHRL1 transcription activity. AKT was dispensable for p53-dependent suppression of FKHRL1. By contrast, serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) was significantly induced in a p53-dependent manner after DNA damage, and this induction was through extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2-mediated posttranslational regulation. Furthermore, inhibition of SGK1 expression by a small interfering RNA knockdown experiment significantly decreased FKHRL1 phosphorylation in response to DNA damage. Taken together, our observations reveal previously unrecognized crosstalk between p53 and FKHRL1. Moreover, our findings suggest a new pathway for understanding aging and the age dependency of human diseases governed by these two transcription factors.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
