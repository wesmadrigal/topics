One downside of this is that firms can experience negative publicity and financial damage if their data are breached. This is particularly the case in the medical sector, where we find empirical evidence that increased digitization of patient data is associated with more data breaches. The encryption of customer data is often presented as a potential solution, because encryption acts as a disincentive for potential malicious hackers, and can minimize the risk of breached data being put to malicious use. However, encryption both requires careful data management policies to be successful and does not ward off the insider threat. Indeed, we find no empirical evidence of a decrease in publicized instances of data loss associated with the use of encryption. Instead, there are actually increases in the cases of publicized data loss due to internal fraud or loss of computer equipment.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "The advent of available, inexpensive powerful encryption software based on the virtually \"uncrackable\" RSA algorithms, coupled with the Clinton administration's response in the form of the Clipper Chip proposal, has produced a heated public debate which extends far beyond technical issues to the very core of the constitutional rights and freedoms of American citizens. The ability which this technology offers to private citizens (or to governments, businesses, and other institutions) of encrypting digitally communicated materials, with privacy protection unassailable by even the most sophisticated code-breaking supercomputers of the National Security Agency, presents both serious threats and challenging opportunities to archivists already struggling with the management of electronic records. Thus, it is necessary for archivists to become aware of the nature and development of this powerful form of encryption, the government's response through the Clipper Chip proposal, and the associated issues of individual privacy and public security. Moreover, archivists should consider how encryption might be employed to facilitate the archival management of electronic records.\n      </p>", "In Junger v. Daley, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that the usual First Amendment standards apply to export regulations requiring a license before distributing encryption source code. In Bernstein v. United States Department of Justice, a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reached the same conclusion and struck down the licensing system as an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech. The Ninth Circuit agreed to hear the matter en banc, however, and vacated the panel opinion. This Note argues that the opinions in Junger and Bernstein are correct, and it shows that although regulations promulgated after Bernstein are somewhat less restrictive, they too represent an unconstitutional prior restraint on the dissemination of encryption source code on the Internet.\n      </p>", "The growing expanse of e-commerce and the widespread availability of online databases raise many fears regarding loss of privacy and many statistical challenges. Even with encryption and other nominal forms of protection for individual databases, we still need to protect against the violation of privacy through linkages across multiple databases. These issues parallel those that have arisen and received some attention in the context of homeland security. Following the events of September 11, 2001, there has been heightened attention in the United States and elsewhere to the use of multiple government and private databases for the identification of possible perpetrators of future attacks, as well as an unprecedented expansion of federal government data mining activities, many involving databases containing personal information. We present an overview of some proposals that have surfaced for the search of multiple databases which supposedly do not compromise possible pledges of confidentiality to the individuals whose data are included. We also explore their link to the related literature on privacy-preserving data mining. In particular, we focus on the matching problem across databases and the concept of \"selective revelation\" and their confidentiality implications.\n      </p>", "Since the early 1990s, the United States has been formulating, executing, and imposing a form of \"electronic cultural policy.\" This phrase means two things: a state-generated set of policies to encourage or mandate design standards for electronic devices and dictate a particular set of cultural choices; and the cultural choices themselves, which have been embedded in the design and software of electronic goods. The goal of electronic cultural policy has been to encourage and enable \"remote control,\" shifting decisions over the use of content from the user to the vendor. The intended macro effects of such micro policies are antidemocratic. Their potential has created the possibility of a whole new set of forms of cultural domination by a handful of powerful global institutions. Yet so far, the actual consequences of these policies have been different from those intended, igniting activism and disobedience on a global scale.\n      </p>", "The notion of nonmalleable cryptography, an extension of semantically secure cryptography, is defined. Informally, in the context of encryption the additional requirement is that given the ciphertext it is impossible to generate a different ciphertext so that the respective plaintexts are related. The same concept makes sense in the contexts of string commitment and zero-knowledge proofs of possession of knowledge. Nonmalleable schemes for each of these three problems are presented. The schemes do not assume a trusted center; a user need not know anything about the number or identity of other system users. Our cryptosystem is the first proven to be secure against a strong type of chosen ciphertext attack proposed by Rackoff and Simon, in which the attacker knows the ciphertext she wishes to break and can query the decryption oracle on any ciphertext other than the target.\n      </p>", "In an undated letter, Peirce claims that he can make a machine that will automatically encrypt and decrypt messages, an astonishing claim considering the state of American science during his time. In two undated manuscripts, Peirce actually describes a cryptosystem, a system for encrypting and decrypting, suggesting the use of arithmetical transformations and binary notation. The relationship between the manuscripts and the letter are discussed in the paper. The paper also describes Peirce's cryptosystem, places it in its historical context and assesses its comparative value. The paper ends with speculations on whether Peirce could really have built the machine. Considering that he understood the relationship between electricity, binary arithmetic, and Boolean logic, and was familiar with the experiences on the logical machines of his time, the paper concludes that Peirce had all the knowledge necessary to build such a machine.\n      </p>", "We present the different methods that have been proposed in the literature for sending information by means of a chaotic signal.

This study assesses the evolutionary and ecological associations of such stomatal protection in a model system\u2014the diverse southern hemisphere family Proteaceae. Analyses were based on the morphology of over 1400 Australian, South African, New Caledonian, New Zealand, and South American species, anatomy of over 300 of these species, and bioclimatic data from all 1109 Australian species. Ancestral state reconstruction revealed that five or six evolutionary transitions explain over 98% of the dry climate species in the family, with a few other, minor invasions of dry climates. Deep encryption, i.e., stomata in deep pits, in grooves, enclosed by tightly revolute margins or strongly overarched by cuticle, evolved at least 11 times in very dry environments. Other forms of stomatal protection (sunken but not closely encrypted stomata, papillae, and layers of hairs covering the stomata) also evolved repeatedly, but had no systematic association with dry climates. These data are evidence for a strong distinction in function, with deep encryption being an adaptation to aridity, whereas broad pits and covered stomata have more complex relations to climate.\n      </p>", "Quantum cryptography is the result of a synthesis of ideas from fundamental quantum physics and classical encryption that may radically change the way in which the confidentiality of information and the integrity of communications networks are protected.

However, the barriers to literally integrating these data can be substantial, even insurmountable. In this article we show how tools from information technology-specifically, secure multiparty computation and networking-can be used to perform statistically valid analyses of distributed databases. The common characteristic of these methods is that the owners share sufficient statistics computed on the local databases in a way that protects each owner's data from the other owners. Our focus is on horizontally partitioned data, in which data records rather than attributes are spread among the databases. We present protocols for securely performing regression, maximum likelihood estimation, and Bayesian analysis, as well as secure construction of contingency tables.

The poet's most dangerous secret was sodomy, a capital crime, and the form of flash he had needed most was the coded language on which sodomites had to rely.

In this essay I propose a different model. Taking as my example the work of Emily Dickinson\u2014a poet whose descriptions of psychic distress, often presumed to be autobiographical, have no known basis in the historical record\u2014I argue that the limits of representation are best conceived as functions of the limits of intention. Further, because intention's failure\u2014whether conceived as an inability or as an unwillingness to form meaningful utterance\u2014is necessarily indistinguishable from the unintended or purely random utterance, I argue that representation's limits are met at precisely those moments when interpretation founders in doubt.\n      </p>", "Engineered two-phase microfluidic systems have recently shown promise for computation, encryption, and biological processing. For many of these systems, complex control of dispersed-phase frequency and switching is enabled by nonlinearities associated with interfacial stresses. Introducing nonlinearity associated with fluid inertia has recently been identified as an easy to implement strategy to control two-phase (solid-liquid) microscale flows. By taking advantage of inertial effects we demonstrate controllable self-assembling particle systems, uncover dynamics suggesting a unique mechanism of dynamic self-assembly, and establish a framework for engineering microfluidic structures with the possibility of spatial frequency filtering. Focusing on the dynamics of the particle\u2014particle interactions reveals a mechanism for the dynamic self-assembly process; inertial lift forces and a parabolic flow field act together to stabilize interparticle spacings that otherwise would diverge to infinity due to viscous disturbance flows. The interplay of the repulsive viscous interaction and inertial lift also allow us to design and implement microfluidic structures that irreversibly change interparticle spacing, similar to a low-pass filter. Although often not considered at the microscale, nonlinearity due to inertia can provide a platform for high-throughput passive control of particle positions in all directions, which will be useful for applications in flow cytometry, tissue engineering, and metamaterial synthesis.\n      </p>", "In densely populated urban areas WiFi routers form a tightly interconnected proximity network that can be exploited as a substrate for the spreading of malware able to launch massive fraudulent attacks. In this article, we consider several scenarios for the deployment of malware that spreads over the wireless channel of major urban areas in the US. We develop an epidemiological model that takes into consideration prevalent security flaws on these routers. The spread of such a contagion is simulated on real-world data for georeferenced wireless routers. We uncover a major weakness of WiFi networks in that most of the simulated scenarios show tens of thousands of routers infected in as little as 2 weeks, with the majority of the infections occurring in the first 24-48 h. We indicate possible containment and prevention measures and provide computational estimates for the rate of encrypted routers that would stop the spreading of the epidemics by placing the system below the percolation threshold.\n      </p>", "Introduction: During 2000 and 2001, Auckland Regional Public Health Service piloted a general-practitioner\u2014based syndromic surveillance system (GPSURV). Objectives: The pilot evaluated data capture, the method used to distinguish initial from follow-up visits, the definition of denominators, and the external validity of measured influenza-like illness trends. Methods: GPSURV monitored three acute infectious-disease syndromes: gastroenteritis, influenza-like illness, and skin and subcutaneous tissue infection. Standardized terms were used to describe the syndromes. Data were uploaded daily from clinics and transferred to a database via a secure network after one-way encryption of patient identifiers. Records were matched to allow the distinction of follow-ups from first visits, based on between-visit intervals of \u22648 weeks. Denominator populations were based on counts of unique patients treated at participating clinics during the previous 2 years. Record completion was examined by using before-and-after surveys of self-assessed standardized-term recording. Between-visit intervals were counted for matching records and alternative denominators were calculated on the basis of different observation periods. Weekly influenza-like illness rates were compared with rates generated by an alternative system. Results: Physicians' self-reported recording compliance was highest for skin and subcutaneous tissue infection (71%) and lowest for influenza-like illness (48%). Initial visits had 18%\u201319% greater compliance than follow-up visits. The number of physicians reporting increasing compliance during the pilot was greater than the number reporting decreases for all conditions. Comparison of data with an independent influenza-like illness surveillance system indicated a close agreement between the two data series. Conclusions: These results indicate that incidence of acute syndromes can be monitored, at least as successfully as a manual system, by using standardized clinical-term data from selected general-practice clinics. The provision of feedback reports appears to have a limited but positive effect on data quality.\n      </p>", "This paper arose from interest in assessing the quality of random number generators. The problem of testing randomness of a string of binary bits produced by such a generator gained importance with the wide use of public key cryptography and the need for secure encryption algorithms. All such algorithms are based on a generator of (pseudo) random numbers; the testing of such generators for randomness became crucial for the communications industry where digital signatures and key management are vital for information processing. The concept of approximate entropy has been introduced in a series of papers by S. Pincus and co-authors. The corresponding statistic is designed to measure the degree of randomness of observed sequences. It is based on incremental contrasts of empirical entropies based on the frequencies of different patterns in the sequence. Sequences with large approximate entropy must have substantial fluctuation or irregularity. Alternatively, small values of this characteristic imply strong regularity, or lack of randomness, in a sequence. Pincus and Kalman (1997) evaluated approximate entropies for binary and decimal expansions of e, $\\pi, \\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$ with the surprising conclusion that the expansion of $\\sqrt{3}$ demonstrated much less irregularity than that of \u03c0. Tractable small sample distributions are hardly available, and testing randomness is based, as a rule, on fairly long strings. Therefore, to have rigorous statistical tests of randomness based on this approximate entropy statistic, one needs the limiting distribution of this characteristic under the randomness assumption. Until now this distribution remained unknown and was thought to be difficult to obtain. To derive the limiting distribution of approximate entropy we modify its definition. It is shown that the approximate entropy as well as its modified version converges in distribution to a \u03c72-random variable. The P-values of approximate entropy test statistics for binary expansions of e, \u03c0 and $\\sqrt{3}$ are plotted. Although some of these values for $\\sqrt{3}$ digits are small, they do not provide enough statistical significance against the randomness hypothesis.\n      </p>", "This article explores how a minor medium such as comics\u2014specifically, Alberto Breccia's version of Edgar Allan Poe's \"William Wilson\"\u2014used its counter-censorial potential to activate memory in a context stifled by harsh repression. Through the development of several reading hypotheses, the author demonstrates how Breccia's drawings allow for a decoding that runs counter to the signification imposed by the Argentina junta of 1976\u201383. By recontextualizing the transfer to comics and by detaching the images from Poe's source text, the analysis diverges from traditional adaptation studies, which privilege words (the \"original\") over images (the adaptation itself). Instead, the analysis foregrounds the specificity of the Latin American cultural framework as one of camouflage, in which encryption and decoding are central and potentially empowering. This utopian thrust is located in the comic's appeal to memory, which runs directly counter to a censorial logic intent on erasing and forgetting.\n      </p>", "           ", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Although still nascent, the technology is wildly popular. Geography is a central consideration in the functioning of Wi-Fi technology. Yet, its influence is just beginning to be investigated. Examination of the space of Wi-Fi poses problems as wireless data traffic is invisible to the eye and its underlying apparatus is impromptu and veiled to traditional geographic inquiry. A scheme for detecting Wi-Fi infrastructure and transmissions and analyzing their geographic properties is introduced in this article. The application of the scheme to the study of Wi-Fi geography in Salt Lake City, Utah, is described. A dense network of impromptu Wi-Fi infrastructure is found to permeate the city's built environment and the urban area has been blanketed in a fog of Wi-Fi transmissions without any centralized organization. This Wi-Fi cloud is surprisingly resilient to network and physical problems, although the early signs of geographically systematic throughput difficulties are evident in parts of the urban area. Wi-Fi appears to offer a solution to last-mile problems in the city and bucks the trend for polarization of the population on either side of a digital divide, at least for those with access to Wi-Fi-enabled hardware. Wi-Fi was found to strengthen existing urban geography. Activity is most prominent in the city's traditional commercial core. However, Wi-Fi also reaches out to interstitial and peripheral parts of the city. Although commercial penetration of Wi-Fi misses the traditional tourist and retail areas of the city, public Wi-Fi is being used to encapsulate and reinforce civic space in the city. /// \u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u5e7f\u64ad\u548c\u4ee5\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u7f51\u7edc. \u867d\u7136\u8fd8\u5904\u4e8e\u840c\u82bd\u72b6\u6001, \u8fd9\u9879\u6280\u672f\u5df2\u7ecf\u975e\u5e38\u6d41\u884c. \u5730\u7406\u5b66\u662f\u8fd0\u4f5c\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u6280\u672f\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u8003\u8651\u73af\u8282. \u7136\u800c, \u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u624d\u521a\u521a\u5f00\u59cb\u88ab\u5b66\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u67e5. \u7814 \u7a76\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c06\u6784\u6210\u95ee\u9898, \u56e0\u4e3a\u65e0\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u91cf\u662f\u8089\u773c\u770b\u4e0d\u89c1\u7684, \u5176\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u5668\u5177\u662f\u5373\u5174\u7684, \u4e5f\u662f\u4f20 \u7edf\u7684\u5730\u7406\u8c03\u67e5\u6240\u4e0d\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u7684. \u8fd9\u7bc7\u6587\u7ae0\u5c06\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e00\u4e2a\u63a2\u6d4b\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u7cfb\u7edf, \u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5730\u7406 \u7279\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6848. \u8fd9\u9879\u65b9\u6848\u5f62\u5bb9\u4e86\u76d0\u6e56\u57ce, \u72b9\u4ed6\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u5730\u7406\u6027\u8d28. \u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6574\u4e2a\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u6e17\u900f\u7740\u4e00 \u7f51\u7a20\u5bc6\u5373\u5174\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd. \u57ce\u5e02\u5730\u533a\u88ab\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u5305\u88f9\u7740. \u867d\u7136\u5730\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u541e \u5410\u91cf\u7684\u56f0\u96be\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u5e02\u533a\u65e9\u5df2\u663e\u73b0, \u7136\u800c\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u7269\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u4ee4\u4eba\u60ca\u8bb6. \u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f3c\u4e4e\u662f \u6700\u540e\u4e00\u82f1\u91cc\u95f4\u9898\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u529e\u6cd5. \u6b64\u5916, \u81f3\u5c11\u5728\u90a3\u4e9b\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u5177\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u529f\u80fd\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u5730\u533a, \u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc \u4e5f\u52a0\u6df1\u4e86\u4eba\u53e3\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u9e3f\u6c9f\u4e24\u6781\u5316\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf. \u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u52a0\u5f3a\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u5730\u7406. \u6700\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u7684 \u6d3b\u52a8\u533a\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u5546\u4e1a\u6838\u5fc3. \u7136\u800c, \u65e0\u7ebf \u7f51\u7edc\u4e5f\u6e17\u5165\u5230\u4e86\u4ee5\u95f4\u8d28\u548c\u5468\u8fb9\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u5dff\u533a. \u867d\u7136\u5546\u4e1a\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u672a\u80fd\u6e17\u900f\u5230\u57ce\u5e02\u91cc\u4f20\u7edf\u65c5\u6e38\u548c\u96f6\u552e\u4e1a\u7b49\u9886\u57df, \u516c\u5171\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u5df2\u88ab\u7528\u6765\u6982\u62ec\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u91cc\u516c\u6c11\u7a7a \u95f4. /// Wi-Fi se une a las redes basadas en Internet y a la radiodifusi\u00f3n.

There is strong evidence to indicate that information encoded within these stimulus-induced Ca\u00b2\u207a oscillations can provide signalling specificity. Such Ca\u00b2\u207a signals, or 'Ca\u00b2\u207a signatures', are generated in the cytosol, and in noncytosolic locations including the nucleus and chloroplast, through the coordinated action of Ca\u00b2\u207a influx and efflux pathways. An increased understanding of the functions and regulation of these various Ca\u00b2\u207a transporters has improved our appreciation of the role these transporters play in specifically shaping the Ca\u00b2\u207a signatures. Here we review the evidence which indicates that Ca\u00b2\u207a channel, Ca\u00b2\u207a-ATPase and Ca\u00b2\u207a exchanger isoforms can indeed modulate specific Ca\u00b2\u207a signatures in response to an individual signal.\n      </p>", "           ", "           ", "           ", "           ", "           ", "           ", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
