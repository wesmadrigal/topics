This creativity inside a framework of seeming inflexibility is one of the things that helps evangelical Christianity localize while \"holding its shape,\" It also enables conversions to be grounded in idiosyncratic experience while enabling those conversions to present as orthodox. Employing interviews with ethnic Thai and Sino-Thai who have converted from Buddhism to Christianity, the article explores two mechanisms of hybridity that can be observed among Thai evangelicals, Hybridities of extension fit locally specific material into frames that are transcultura shared, while hybridities of transition exploit cognitive and terminological overlaps that facil-itate a person's movement across otherwise discrete religious boundaries. Together, these orthodox hybridities give evangelical Christianity a feel of the local while preserving converts' sense of being loyal to a transculturally shared set of teachings.\n      </p>", "Non-Western Christianity engages with capitalist development and ideas of modernization from multiple and competing perspectives. In this article, I argue that as researchers we can weave together disparate theoretical strands attempting to explain the appeal of Christianity--particularly its Pentecostal and charismatic forms--by examining indigenous notions of \"salvation\" that have often been overlooked in the literature. To illustrate, I examine millennial Christianity among the Ipili of Papua New Guinea, demonstrating how their understandings of \"heaven\" and their desire for the Second Coming articulate with a concern regarding how social relations are spatialized through engagement with capitalist mining development, evangelical Christianity, and traditional spirits responsible for maintaining the world's integrity.\n      </p>", "This essay examines Aboriginal people's expression of Christian ideologies, values, and behaviors in regard to personhood. Christian practice in Galiwin'ku is a repertoire of individualization that fosters self-reliance and self-actualization, which relate to employment benefits and positions of political authority. Christianity is an important and equivocal site for staging opposition between community residents and for the expression of indigenous political agency within and beyond the settlement. Examining how Christianity informs the production of identities sheds light on some of the ways in which Aboriginal people negotiate tensions arising from a market economy and an egalitarian ethos.\n      </p>", "This article considers the way Christianity has transformed notions of desire among the Urapmin of the West Sepik Province of Papua New Guinea. While Melanesian cargo cults have generally been understood as generated by a relatively comprehensible set of desires, Urapmin Christianity has focused not on realizing desires but rather on defining and controlling them. In its efforts to exercise such control, Christianity has come into conflict with traditional Urapmin social structure. The latter depended upon a dialectical relationship between willfulness and lawfulness that allowed them both to be valued and to set limits on one another. By demonizing all willfulness, Christianity has made sinners of those Urapmin who operate successfully within that social structure. After tracing the way Christianity has created this contradiction, this article concludes by examining new Christian rituals that have developed in order to allow people to resolve some of its effects on their lives.\n      </p>", "This article focuses on the Christian debate on polygyny from the perspective of mission theologians, missionaries, and women at the grassroots level in Cameroon. From the end of the last century onwards, Christian Churches condemned polygyny since it was thought to be incompatible with Christianity and to victimize women. To be \"true Christians\" and respectful spouses, Africans had to do away with polygyny and to marry monogamously. The article explains that women in Cameroon have been creating their own interpretations of Christianity in which polygyny appears as an aspect of \"true\" Christianity.\n      </p>", "Throughout August Wilson's plays, characters are struggling with and wrestling over their ideas of religion and God. Wilson sets up a dichotomy between the role of Christianity and the African traditional religion (ATR) in two of his plays. Acceptance of one religion resolves the conflict, and Wilson illustrates these two polarized religions by creating images that reflect the tenets of ATR and Christianity. \"Joe Turner's Come and Gone\" includes a story of a Shiny Man, rituals, ghosts, a juba, and a self-inflicted cutting, all of which relate to the tenets of ATR, whereas characters of the Shiny Man and Martha represent Christianity. In \"The Piano Lesson,\" the ghost of Sutter represents ATR, whereas Avery represents Christianity. In each of these plays, the characters are forced to choose between ATR and Christianity, and Wilson subtly guides his characters to choose ATR and overcome. Wilson's plays are a contemporary commentary on the role of religion in the lives of American Blacks.\n      </p>", "In one of the essays in his recent book on Christianity, La d\u00e9closion (2005), Nancy discusses the relationship between Judaism and Christianity. Nancy opens this discussion with a reference to Lyotard's book on this relationship: Un trait d' union (1993). Both Lyotard and Nancy examine a very early figure in the emergence of Christianity from Judaism\u2014whereas Lyotard focuses on the epistles of Paul, Nancy reads the epistle of James. Lyotard concludes that the hyphen in the expression 'Judeo-Christian' actually conceals 'the most impenetrable abyss within Western thought'. With this abyss, Lyotard refers to the point of departure of Judaism: the event in which a Voice has left behind letters, inaugurating an interminable work of interpretation. For Nancy, however, it is rather Christianity, and therefore, Western culture, which is deconstructive in nature. Its composition is co-original with a decomposition, and therefore, with an openness. In James, Nancy finds an emphasis on praxis, in such a way that existence is to be understood as transcendent within itself. With this reading of James, Nancy seems to deny that there is a fundamental difference between Judaism and Christianity. In order to clarify the differences between Lyotard and Nancy, it is shown that, in Lyotard's view, an unsublatable alterity comes with aisth\u00e8sis, whereas in Nancy's view, alterity comes with existence as such.\n      </p>", "The introduction of Christianity into sub-Saharan Africa has contributed to social change and the rise of nationalism. As a product of the missionary's work, particularly during the early decades of the twentieth century, Africans learned new norms and habits and were inducted into new roles. From these, recruitment into proto-nationalist churches, mass parties, and roles in the modern sector of society has occurred. Statistical evidence from ten countries shows positive relationships between the rise of Christianity and the growth of indicators of development such as education, wage labor, electrical consumption and urbanization. Conversely, negative relationships are found with communication variables. The overall effect of Christianity, however, has been positive.\n      </p>", "This response accepts Richard Steigmann-Gall's argument that nazism and Christianity were less sharply opposed than popular and much scholarly opinion have assumed. Personal ties, institutional links and ideological common ground connected nazism and Christianity, and many members of the nazi elite considered themselves to be devoted Christians. Steigmann-Gall makes a significant contribution by focusing on such 'Christian nazis', in contrast to the 'nazi Christians' that others have examined. But he could do more to clinch his case. By defining religion solely in terms of belief, he ignores important aspects of nazi-Christian co-existence: for example, the fact that Church membership remained extremely high in Germany throughout the nazi era. His assumption of an especially close nazi-Protestant nexus obscures the significant cooperation of the Catholic Church. Meanwhile, by denying the existence of tensions between nazism and Christianity, he fails to consider the defensive posture of Church leaders, a stance that motivated much of their eager accommodation of National Socialism.\n      </p>", "Christianity, as Richard Steigmann-Gall argues in his study on the Holy Reich, did not constitute a barrier to nazism. Quite the opposite, he says: for many of the leading nazis he explores in his book the battles waged against Germany's enemies constituted a war in the name of Christianity. He aims to prove this central thesis by text analysis of prominent nazi leaders as well as some selected fields of nazi action. However, his main line of argumentation is far from being persuasive. A strange obsession to depict National Socialism as emphatically as Christian as possible runs throughout the book. It seduces the author into a series of systematic blind spots about National Socialism as a whole. Time and again he tends to over-generalize his partial findings. He refuses to adopt important sources like the Goebbels diaries and relevant literature, especially if they provide evidence contrary to his central thesis. In the end, the whole of his line of reasoning goes awry. Although SteigmannGall provides an interesting, stimulating and provocative interpretation of religious dimensions of the Third Reich, it is necessary to remind the author of the essential fact that National Socialism, above all, waged a war in the name of the 'Aryan-Germanic race', and preached a new and predominantly non-Christian faith, but not Christianity, the 'old faith'.\n      </p>", "Much of the credit for the vitality of Christianity in southern Africa has gone to the African Initiated Churches that date their birth to earlier 'Ethiopian' and 'Zionist' movements. Yet far from being compromised, as they are often portrayed, those African Christians remaining in the mission churches often played a critical role in the naturalization of the faith. In the churches of the American Zulu Mission, the largest mission body in colonial Natal, one of the most important moments in this process occurred at the end of the nineteenth century when participants in a revival, led in part by a young Zulu Christian named Mbiya Kuzwayo, employed the theology of Holiness to dramatically alter the nature of their lived Christianity and bring about an internal revolution that gave them effective control of their churches.\n      </p>", "The concept of political religion as used in the study of National Socialism depends upon highly criticized expressive-symbolist theories of religion and an implied opposition to the religion of genuine Christianity. The idea of a counterfeit substitute for Christianity goes back to ancient Christian discourse about heresy. The article advocates rational-cognitivist approaches to religion and argues that these prove better for historical work on National Socialism, and that Steigmann-Gall's Holy Reich is compatible with this way of theorizing religion.\n      </p>", "This essay examines the role of vegetarianism during the formative period of the Unity School of Christianity (1895-1938). Unity, based in the Kansas City area, taught that vegetarianism was an integral component of regenerating the body. Scholars studying the New Thought movement have only recently begun to recognize the body's role in salvation in these religious movements. By examining the interaction between the practice of vegetarianism and Unity's belief that the body must be regenerated, I show both how vegetarianism was integral to defining and putting into practice Unity's religious beliefs and how it helped to develop religious identity by marking the behavioral boundaries of a Unity member.\n      </p>", "During the first half of the nineteenth century, European missionaries in southern Africa sought to establish their intellectual and moral authority over Africans and propagate the tenets of Christianity. Men like Jacob Dohne, Robert Moffat, John Colenso, Henry Callaway and others viewed a knowledge of African languages as key to disclosing 'the secrets of national character', to the translation and transmittal of ideas about the Christian 'God', and to accepting the 'literal truth' of the Bible. Africans, especially the Zulu king, Dingane, disputed these teachings in discussions about the existence of God, suitable indigenous names for such a being (including uThixo, modimo, and unkulunkulu), and his attributes (all- powerful, or merely old), arguing for the significance of metaphor rather than literalness in understanding the world.\n      </p>", "This paper focuses on the famous prewar internationalist Nitobe Inaz\u014d, and inquires into the origins of his Christian faith. Born in 1862 in Morioka in the last years of the Tokugawa period, he imbibed Christianity while attending the Sapporo Agricultural College. That institution's unique historical environment, and the spiritual legacy implanted there by its charismatic founding president, William S. Clark, is described, and it is demonstrated how Inaz\u014d and his classmates were profoundly influenced by New England puritan values in their early exposure to Protestant Christianity. It follows Inaz\u014d on his six-and-a-half years of study abroad, and traces his inward struggles to attain a genuine Christian faith free from the taint of foreign culture. His academic studies in the United States and Germany is described in detail. Special attention is paid to his Quaker religious experiences, since these left indelible marks upon his later life and career. Peculiar tenets of his faith and mentioned, and one in particular-the doctrine of pacifism-is highlighted; one which many people who have studied Nitobe's career feel he failed to resolve adequately. Finally, there are some remarks about the legacy of the Sapporo Band, of whom Sat\u014d Sh\u014dsuke, \u014cshima Masatake, Uchimura Kanz\u014d, Miyabe Kingo, and Nitobe stand out most notably today.\n      </p>", "Despite growing interest in examining the role of religion in business ethics, there is little consensus concerning the basis or standards of \"good\" or ethical behavior and the reasons behind them. This limits our ability to enhance ethical behavior in the workplace. We address this issue by examining worldviews as it relates to ethics research and practice. Our worldview forms the context within which we organize and build our understanding of reality. Given that much of our academic work as well as business practice operate from a modern worldview, we examine how modernism shapes our beliefs and approaches to ethics in business and academia. We identify important limitations of modernism in addressing moral issues and religion. We then introduce the Christian worldview as an alternative approach to examining ethical issues in business\n      </p>", "The article describes and probes the conversion of Chinese temporary migrant workers in Israel to evangelical Christianity. Since 1995 thousands of Chinese workers have been recruited, mainly from villages across Fujian, for construction work in Israel, in 1998 an evangelical church was established in Tel Aviv, and its personnel evangelize with considerable success among Chinese workers. The work visa of Chinese workers in Israel is limited to a maximum of five years. Consequently , their church membership is limited in duration, and the church plays no role in the facilitation of migrants' seulement. The constricted role of the church forcefully raises the question of why Chinese workers convert to Christianity. This article draws attention to the impact of conversion on the life of Chinese workers upon their return to China. The article argues that a conversion to Christianity in Israel permits Chinese temporary migrants to accumulate cultural, symbolic, and social capital, which can be effectively deployed in China.\n      </p>", "In the late 1980s, after decades of refusal, the Forest Tobelo foragers of northeastern Halmahera, Indonesia, converted to Christianity. The version of Christianity they accepted was not the one offered (or imposed) by coastal Tobelo-speaking communities with whom they share kinship and affinal ties, but was brought to the region by the American-based New Tribes Mission. This essay examines the factors and motivations behind this change, and offers an explanation that takes into account local histories, larger political and economic changes, such as deforestation and land encroachment, and the rarely examined topic of missionary methodologies. The Forest Tobelo decision to convert is best understood as an attempt to maintain their distinct identity from coastal communities with whom they have a long history of poor relations; the methods used by the New Tribes Mission made conversion an attractive option at that time.\n      </p>", "Childlessness is an issue of deep religious concern in Africa. Men, women and couples with problems of sexuality and childlessness make use not only of the resources of traditional African religions but also of the many Pentecostal/charismatic churches and movements that have burgeoned throughout sub-Saharan Africa in the last three decades. Initially this was the domain of the older African independent churches, as far as the Christian response to childlessness is concerned; the new Pentecostals have taken on the challenge too. Based on the same biblical and traditional worldviews that events have causes, these churches have mounted ritual contexts that wrestle with the issues of sexuality and childlessness. In pursuing this salvific endeavor, however, the needs of those who may never have children seem to have been neglected by the churches considered here and represented by the Pure Fire Miracle Ministries, a Ghana/Nigeria charismatic church located in Ghana. This partial approach to 'healing' childlessness has led to one-sided interpretations of what it means to be fruitful and prosperous and deepened the troubles of the childless.\n      </p>", "To varying degrees the contributors to this symposium on The Holy Reich challenge both its arguments and its findings. Taking issue with its methodology, pointing to what they believe are fundamental mistakes, errors, and other shortcomings, they argue the work reflects tendentiousness and a lack of originality; a refusal to explore countervailing evidence or to acknowledge prior work. The author analyses these critiques comparatively and from multiple perspectives, and offers rejoinders point by point. What appear to be comprehensive and authoritative critiques are, upon closer inspection, a series of misinterpretations, and too often (as is demonstrated through close scrutiny of their arguments and evidence) distortions and fabrications. As is demonstrated, some of the respondents do not actually address the evidence provided in the book, while others extrapolate from minor points of evidence and analysis to cast unfounded doubts upon the soundness of the author's scholarship. Most problematically, their attempts to provide their own countervailing empiricism are frequently sloppy or simply wrong. The author compares the respondents and finds revealing patterns that help the reader understand the nature of their frequently groundless criticisms\n      </p>", "The relations between religion and politics are examined on the basis of several case studies to assess the mutual and varied attitudes according to churches and states, times and countries: collusion, forbearance, tactical agreement, refusal to compromise, opposition. Current history points out the progression of Islam which imposes its own institutions, the role of Christianity as a matrix of modernity, and the participation of new churches in development, while political ideologies and rites disappear. In every state, a strong religious mobilization produces organizational inventions, a growth of piety, associative and charitable movements. In a deeply religious Africa, the actual changes reveal the seduction of the Book (Bible, Qur'\u0101n), the need for authenticity and inculturation, pluralism of allegiance, and an adoption of democracy as everywhere, while beliefs and practices of traditional religions are declining.\n      </p>", "This focus engages with what I see broadly as two (there are more) different discourses around African sexuality in the 1920s and 1930s. In one, concern for sexuality was linked to a moral panic around the behaviour of young girls and boys who were attempting to assert their independence from what were essentially patriarchal forms of control. In contrast to this, I look at other currents around sexuality for the same period and examine how Christian Africans learned about sex, and what they were taught.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Aborigines successfully incorporated Judaeo-Christian myths, Jesus, and the Prophets of the Old Testament into their worldview. This provides a neat refutation to the still commonly held assumption that Aboriginal religious life is rigid and unchanging. This paper contrasts the way in which Christianity has helped break down the separation between cultural groups with its function as a structure for explicit discourse on Aboriginal / non-Aboriginal relations and inequality.

In the past few years the Catholic Church endeavored on an inculturation (inkulturasi) program that would be more accommodating towards these kinds of local customs. Inculturation, however, carries varying significance for the local population and for the Catholic Church. The Hoga Sara have resolved to practice Roman Catholicism as a form of parallel or supplementary religion to their own traditional belief system and practices.\n      </p>", "Swinburne shared a tradition of classical philology with Hopkins. In the Greek of Aeschylus, Herodotus, and Euripides, 'dapple' was a construction for a Dionysian ambiguity of language and reality. To the triumphalist reinterpretation of this by Christianity, Hopkins adhered, while Swinburne embraced its bleaker 'original' as reconstructed from the Renaissance, without pretending it was actually recoverable. The aesthetic influence of Ruskin, the comparable case of A. H. Clough, the challenge to Victorian poetry set by Plato and Dante, and the opinions of T. S. Eliot, are considered. Sharing an imperialist requirement to be omni-referent, Swinburne's patterning frames a postmodernist condition Hopkins's 'dapple' exemplifies.\n      </p>", "The Hmong in the United States have undergone radical culture change through their recent experiences of the war in Laos, refugee resettlement, and Christian conversion. This article analyzes the influence of these changes on the health ideas and practices of the Hmong in Kansas City, the primary study population. Although shamanism and ancestor worship have been abandoned, attenuated concepts of spirit illness and soul loss exist in health beliefs and patterns of illness, notably fright illness (ceeb). Their eclectic set of ideas and practices is derived from several systems, including Chinese medicine, Protestant Christianity, and biomedicine. To explain the varied health ideas and practices, Last's concept of medical culture is useful because it provides a framework for understanding medical traditions drawn from differing cultural systems. The Hmong have created a unique medical culture through their incorporation of new therapies as well as the use of some traditional methods of healing.\n      </p>", "In this article I examine textual authority and religious language in an African Christian church. Known as the Masowe weChishanu, members of this church refer to themselves as \"the Christians who don't read the Bible.\" I focus on how religious language in Masowe ritual highlights the performative nature of religious authority. In particular, I show how prophets in the church denigrate the role of religious text by working to create a \"live and direct\" connection to God through their sermons. Drawing on the ethnography of reading and ritual, and contributing to the newly emerging interest in an anthropology of Christianity, I show how Masowe recast the authority of the text as a political and religious object by making it unnecessary. The Bible becomes significant in its absence, challenging an understanding of scriptural religion as objectified in texts.\n      </p>", "Critics have done little to contextualize the Inkling Charles Williams within the tumultuous period of the mid-twentieth century, ignoring his connections to high modernism and treating him as a minor writer of fantasy fiction. The 2002 publication of his letters to his wife, however, reveal the danger of divorcing him from his historical moment and permit a more nuanced biographical contextualization. Neither altogether incredible thrillers, nor mere defenses of his extraordinary Christianity, all of his novels represent an odd marriage of the supernatural and the realistic, the latter informed by the terrible uncertainty of the early-to mid-twentieth century. His last novel, All Hallows' Eve (1945), is best understood in the context of profound angst provoked by the war: here we see Williams in his modernist guise, using literature as a direct and urgent response to the century's second climacteric.\n      </p>", "The present article is an inquiry into the relationship between Logbara traditional personal names and religion. As context for the study, the literal and real meanings of Logbara personal names, and the naming-ceremony conferring such names, are considered. The article lists as many personal names associated with religion as could be gathered, with a detailed analysis of their meaning. This is followed by a consideration of the frequency of these names compared to other personal names. Elaborating on this proportion, an explanation is attempted. This conclusion summarizes the main points of the article, the final paragraph inferring that Logbara personal names associated with religion are actually few in number. This is explained by the fact that the social and psychological function of Logbara names does not seem to apply to names associated with religion, as problems arising within religion also find a solution within religion. Moreover, one must not overlook the impact of Christianity and Islam on traditional religion in general.\n      </p>", "Anglo-Saxon archaeology can offer very few examples of deliberate, irretrievable deposition outside the mortuary arena, unlike the British and Continental archaeological evidence for the Roman and Iron Ages. With the exception of the furnished cemetery sites, Anglo-Saxon archaeology is notably short of 'ritual' deposits or structures until the arrival of Christianity, and we are equally short of ritual centres or sites expressing communal effort. It may be that any belief systems supported by the people inhabiting lowland England between the ending of Roman Britain and the Conversion left no surviving archaeological trace. In this context, however, furnished burials, accepted by archaeologists as a ritual display for an audience, may be ready for reinterpretation. Recent evaluation of Anglo-Saxon mortuary ritual has studied furnished burial almost solely in terms of conspicuous display, social organization and the relationship between the individual and the symbolic social messages of the goods with which they were buried. This paper argues that a rigid distinction between 'votive' and 'burial' deposition could be misleading, and that this distinction may be preventing us from seeing that the mortuary ritual should be recognized as an expression of a communal belief system, as well as carrying other important social messages.\n      </p>", "This paper investigates the relationship between ethics and income among individuals of different religions in the HKSAR of China. The presence of both traditional Chinese religion and Christianity from the West makes our study particularly interesting. The content of ethical beliefs varies with religion and thus the effect of ethics on income may also vary across religion. Furthermore, a reverse causal relationship may run from income to ethics. Since culture and taste affect the consumption behavior of a person, depending on the religion of the person, a person with a higher income may or may not like to 'acquire' more ethics. Our empirical results find that there is indeed a simultaneous relationship between income and being ethical so that a single equation estimation of income on ethics and vice versa generates biased estimates. Using a two-stage instrumental variable estimation, our study finds that being ethical contributes to higher income for Christians and the non-religious group, but lowers it for people of traditional Chinese religion. On the other hand, an increase in income increases the likelihood of a person's being ethical for both Christians and the people of traditional Chinese religion, but reduces it for the non-religious group.\n      </p>", "The commonalities of eastern Africa's history from colonial occupation to the formation of nation states and their post-postcolonial decay, the region's shard experiences with the religions of the book\u2014first Islam and later Christianity\u2014and its shared struggle with the physical, social, political and epistemological predicament of HIV//AIDS, make East Africa, with its cultural and historical diversity, a suitably coherent field to study the relationship between religion and the experience of AIDS-related suffering. The papers in this issue explore how AIDS is understood and confronted through religious ideas and practices, and how these, in turn, are reinterpreted and changed by the experience of AIDS. They reveal the creativity and innovations that continuously emerge in the everyday life of East Africans, between bodily and spiritual experiences, and between religious, medical, political and economic discourses. Countering simplified notions of causal effects of AIDS on religion (or vice versa), the diversity of interpretations and practices inserts the epidemic into wider, and more open, frames of reference. It reveals East Africans' will and resourcefulness in their struggle to move ahead in spite of adversity, and goes against the generalised vision of doom widely associated with the African AIDS epidemic. Finally, it shows that East Africans understand AIDS not as a singular event in their history, but as the culmination of a century-long process of changing spiritual imaginaries, bodily well-being and likelihoods. Intimately connected to political history and economic fortunes, it presents itself at present as an experience of loss and decay, yet it remains open-ended.\n      </p>", "Uchimura Kanz\u014d (1861-1930) was an extremely accomplished Meiji Christian convert who emphasized a Christianity he considered in tune with traditional Japanese religiosity and free of Western influence. When a child, he observed his family's distress as Meiji rulers dismantled the Tokugawa political system. Then he assumed responsibility for their support when he turned sixteen. Though thus burdened by family responsibility, he finished a Japanese undergraduate degree in fisheries science, studied further in the United States, and then returned home to encourage Bible study among the Japanese. He became a respected essayist. The result: a complete works of more than twenty thousand pages and many loyal followers who helped form the new democratic Japanese society after 1945. Samples of his writings cover such themes as these: Old Testament-style prophecy; Japan's role to emphasize Christianity's Asian roots; the Christian believer's utter dependence on God; Christian morality; and churchless Christianity as Japan's contribution to world Christianity.\n      </p>", "Drawing on recent anthropological debates on temporality, hope, and the relationship between Christian eschatology and political action, I use Alain Badiou's reading of St. Paul's epistles to trace out the internal logic of a left-leaning Southern California church in the Vineyard, a strongly charismatic Christian denomination. I argue that members of this church see progressive politics as a function of the incomplete eschatological event of Jesus's redemption of the world. This view of progressive politics as demarcating an ontological divide serves to foreclose certain forms of political organizing and alliances because such political activity, being recognizable, does not fit the condition of radical alterity associated with the divine in church members' religious practice.\n      </p>", "Despite the drastic curtailment of missionary activity in Japan that resulted from Toyotomi Hideyoshi's ban on Christianity in 1587, letters of the Jesuit missionaries reveal that the ban did not prevent the conversion of one lady, G\u014d, a woman of the Maeda house and Hideyoshi's own adopted daughter. This study explores the circumstances of Go's exposure to Christianity in Osaka both before and after the enforcement of the anti-Christian decree. It also traces her life story in Bizen and Kyoto, where she was converted to Christianity by a woman catechist. G\u014d's story is important not only for her association with Hideyoshi, but also as a case study for the religious communities and practices that formed among upper-class women in late sixteenth-century and early seventeenth-century Japan.\n      </p>", "The two love commands attributed to Jesus clearly show the basic feature of Christianity as a \"religion of love.\" However, it may be argued that there is conflict between these commands, so that the Christian idea of love confronts a deep paradox: on the one hand, it takes loving God as the ultimate foundation of loving one's neighbor and loving one's neighbor as the perfect manifestation of loving God. On the other hand, it gives supremacy to loving God over loving one's neighbor, with the result that, in cases of conflict, Christianity has to sacrifice loving one's neighbor to loving God and thus to negate the second great command by the first.\n      </p>", "A Sri Lankan folktale presenting Jesus as a delusory emanation of M\u0101ra is discussed here for its significance in understanding how Christianity was seen by the early-modern Sinhalese. By depicting Jesus as demonic and his teachings as inimical to Buddhism, Sri Lankans situated Christianity in the context of the cosmic rivalry between the Dhamma and the disordering forces of M\u0101ra. The Hindu background of certain motifs in the folktale is considered, as are its probable origins in the religiopolitical milieu of the eighteenth-century Kandyan kingdom and its relevance to later Buddhist revivalists. This study also questions empiricist approaches to Sri Lankan historiography, and proposes that folklore provides scholars with an invaluable supplement to Western documentary materials and the island's official chronicles when attempting to reconstruct the indigenous perception of European Christianity.\n      </p>", "At a time when sectarian tension is being viewed as a threat to global peace and religions are being called on to promote ecumenical dialogue and condemn militant fundamentalism, this article offers a critical geographical enquiry into the role of Christianity in the making of a peaceable West. Christianity's historical alignment with the Western project and imbrication in histories of colonialism and imperialism raises questions about its capacity to serve as a progressive force in global affairs today. Placing Christianity under postcolonial scrutiny, this article argues that Christianity offers a variety of complex, contradictory, and competing approaches to peace building that variously defend the hegemonic ambitions of the West on the one hand and support critical practices that usurp and decenter the sovereign supremacy assumed by the West on the other. Critical geographical enquiry can offer Christianity a heightened self-understanding of the role of location, space, and place, in the framing, enactment, and impacts of its different colonial and postcolonial visions. Using the case of the Roman Catholic Church for illustration, the concepts of \"milieux of translation,\" referring to the social, economic, political, and cultural prisms through which theology becomes refracted into praxes, and \"formations of the secular,\" referring to the conditions in secular democracies that permit religions prescribed access to the public realm, are advanced as key to any understanding of the situated production and mobilization of Christianity's strategies for peace.Future dialogue between Christianity and (institutional) geography might usefully begin with an exchange of ideas on how the wider project of historicizing, relativizing, and provincializing the West might best contribute to improved interfaith, intercultural, and intercivilizational dialogue. \u5c0d\u5b97\u6d3e\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u4e14\u662f\u65c5\u7f8e\u7cfb\u88ab\u8996\u65b9\u5168\u7403\u548c\u5e73\u7684\u5a01\u8de1\uff0c\u5c0d\u5b97\u6559\u88ab\u8981\u6c42\u4fc3\u904a\u666e\u4e16\u6ed1\u6d3b\u5e76\u88ab\u8b74\u8cac\u65b9\u539f\u6559\u65e8\u4e3b\u6587\u6b66\u88dd\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u6839\u6e90\uff0c\u5728\u9019\u7965\u4e00\u5c0f\u4e16\u4ee3\uff0c\u91dd\u8ca1\u57fa\u7763\u6559\u5728\u5efa\u7acb\u548c\u5e73\u897f\u65b9\u8feb\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u4f3a\u8da3\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u5c0f\u6279\u5224\u6027\u7684\u5730\u7406\u5ee3\u5747\u3002\u57fa\u7763\u6559\u52fb\u897f\u65b9\u4e16\u754c\u5728\u670b\u53f2\u4e0a\u7684\u7d50\u76df\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u6b96\u6c11\u4e3b\u6587\u670b\u53f2\u548c\u5e1d\u570b\u4e3b\u53c8\u52a9\u53f2\u4e0a\u7684\u6c61\u9f20\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u4eba\u5011\u676f\u7591\u5176\u4f5c\u65b9\u89e3\u6c7a\u5c0d\u4eca\u4e16\u754c\u5168\u7403\u4e8b\u52aa\u4e2d\u7684\u904a\u6b65\u529b\u91cf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u683c\u57fa\u7763\u6559\u7f6e\u4e8e\u540e\u761f\u6c11\u80cc\u666f\u52a0\u4ee5\u57e0\u67e5\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4e3b\u4eba\u65b9\uff0c\u57fa\u7763\u6559\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u591a\u795e\u9748\u773e\u7684\u3001\u77db\u76fe\u7684\u548c\u7adf\u7b8f\u7684\u821f\u6cd5\u672a\u4fc3\u904a\u548c\u5e73\uff0c\u4e00\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u897f\u65b9\u7684\u9738\u6756\u9f4a\u5fc3\u8faf\u5992\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u65b9\u9762\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u8ecd\u800d\u7684\u5b89\u8e10\u884c\u529f\uff0c\u5b78\u5938\u5e76\u4fee\u6539\u4e86\u897f\u65b9\u6240\u5047\u5761\u7684\u7d71\u6cbb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3002\u6279\u5224\u6027\u7684\u5730\u7406\u56b4\u5747\u53ef\u4ee5\u65b9\u57fa\u7763\u6559\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u5c0f\u589e\u9ad8\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5373\u5728\u5176\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6b96\u6c11\u548c\u540e\u7a2e\u6c11\u8996\u91ce\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u5f71\u5436\u4e0b\uff0c\u5176\u624d\u5730\u621a\u3001\u7a7a\u9593\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u4ee5~\u53f8\u5929\u4e3b\u6559\u6559\u820d\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u5148\u4f8b\uff0c\u201c\u7ffb\u6a3a\u7684\u671d\u5411\"\u901b\u4e00\u6982\u5ff5\u6307\u7684\u662f\u793e\u820d\u3001\u8a6e\u6fdf\u3001\u653f\u6cbb\u548c\u6587\u5316\u7684\u68ad\u7e9c\uff0c\u795e\u5b5d\u901a\u8ff0\u9019\u4e9b\u88ab\u6298\u5c04\u6210\u65b9\u5177\u4f53\u59a5\u8e10:\u201c\u4e16\u4fd7\u5f62\u5f0f\"\u9019\u4e00\u6982\u5ff5\u6307\u7684\u662f\u4e16\u4fd7\u6c11\u4e3b\u570b\u5bb6\u5141i\u5348\u5b97\u6559\u898f\u5b9a\u904a\u5165\u516c\u5171\u9818\u57df\u7684\u4f59\u4ef6\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u7763\u6559\u6240\u6236\u751f\u548c\u63a8\u529f\u7684\u548c\u5e73\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7f8e\u93c8\u3002\u57fa\u7763\u6559\u52fb(\u673a\u62d8)\u5730\u7406\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u672a\u4f86\u5c01\u6d3b\u4e0d\u59a8\u9996\u5148J\u00c1\u4ea4\u6d41\u60f3\u6cd5\u6c57\u59cb\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u600e\u7965\u7279\u897f\u65b9\u4e16\u754c\u670b\u53f2\u5316\u3001\u76f8\u6d88\u5316\u3001\u548c\u9053\u5730\u5316\u624d\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6539\u5584\u4e0d\u540c\u5029\u4ef0\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6587\u5316\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u6587\u660e\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u6d88\u6d3b\u3002\u4e09\u96f6\u8abc\u6703\u5747\u76e1\u91cf~IX\uff0c JfiMl\u5b88\u4e3b\u8db3\uff0c\u591a\u5b87\u99b3fj}'\u6bcf\u5929\u4e3b\u70ad~tff\u4fee\u6539\u6388\u3002 En un momento en el que la tensi\u00f3n sectaria se columbra como una amenaza para la paz global y cuando a las religiones se las convoca para promover el di\u00e1logo ecum\u00e9nico y condenar el fundamentalismo militante, este art\u00edculo presenta una indagaci\u00f3n alrededor del papel de la Cristiandad en la construcci\u00f3n de un Occidente pac\u00edfico. El alineamiento hist\u00f3rico de la Cristiandad con el proyecto occidental y las imbricaciones con historias de colonialismo e imperialismo, generan interrogantes sobre su capacidad para servir como una fuerza progresista en los problemas globales de la actualidad. Al colocar a la Cristiandad bajo el escrutinio poscolonial, en este art\u00edculo se arguye que la Cristiandad ofrece una variedad de enfoques complejos, contradictorios y antag\u00f3nicos sobre c\u00f3mo hacer la paz, que al tiempo que defiende las ambiciones hegem\u00f3nicas de Occidente por un lado, apoya pr\u00e1cticas cr\u00edticas que usurpan y cuestionan la supremac\u00eda soberana asumida por Occidente, por el otro. El estudio geogr\u00e1fico cr\u00edtico puede ofrecer a la Cristiandad una destacada autocomprensi\u00f3n del papel de la localizaci\u00f3n, espacio y lugar, en la enmarcaci\u00f3n, aplicaci\u00f3n e impactosde sus diferentes visiones coloniales y poscoloniales.

Instead of discarding the concept for anthropology, however, as some scholars have proposed, I suggest that indigenous discourses referring to and practices of belief represent an important field of anthropological inquiry, particularly as concerns non-Western forms of Christianity. In this article, I argue that people's ideas of and experiences with spiritual entities engender particular ways of talking about and practicing belief. Analyzing religious practices among the Zambian Gwembe Tonga, it is shown that some conceptual problems can be overcome by shifting the focus from belief as a stable and perpetual interior state of religious practitioners to the practice of cyclically regenerating a condition of internalized \"believing.\"\n      </p>", "This article examines the context and content of two African philosophers, Akhenaten and Origen, living hundreds of years apart, to establish through reference to texts and records that the memories of the old system found their way into the era of Christian development. The authors contend that the religious ideas that originated in ancient Egypt did not vanish with the arrival of the Christian faith. Indeed, they suggest that there is a connective link, an intellectual chain, a continuity of form and substance that exists from Akhenaten to Origen. The authors argue that although there was a break in the ancient tradition when Christianity entered Africa, it was not an immediate or a clean break, as if one had snapped a twig.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "In this article, we use a combination of ethnographic data and empirical methods to identify a process called \"absorption,\" which may be involved in contemporary Christian evangelical prayer practice (and in the practices of other religions). The ethnographer worked with an interdisciplinary team to identify people with a proclivity for \"absorption.\" Those who seemed to have this proclivity were more likely to report sharper mental images, greater focus, and more unusual spiritual experience. The more they prayed, the more likely they were to have these experiences and to embrace fully the local representation of God. Our results emphasize learning, a social process to which individuals respond in variable ways, and they suggest that interpretation, proclivity, and practice are all important in understanding religious experience. This approach builds on but differs from the approach to religion within the culture-and-cognition school.\n      </p>", "As a disadvantaged minority, Dayaks have turned to Christianity as a way to maintain their ethnic identity in the face of threats from their Muslim neighbors. Given Indonesian state policies' compelling conversion in the case of interfaith marriage, most anthropological analyses would attribute the anguish Christian Dayaks experience over such marriages to the threat it poses to their community-building efforts. But Dayaks themselves anchor their concerns about intermarriage in religious and familial obligations, not in the maintenance of collective religious and ethnic identities. Drawing on the work of Fredrik Barth, I argue that understanding the nature of interfaith marriage and the fears it arouses requires anthropologists to consider not only the macrolevel of state policies and the median level of collective identities but also the more intimate emotional and experiential level of the family and the individual.\n      </p>", "Si en el polite\u00edsmo griego los hombres se glorificaban a s\u00ed mismos y a sus pulsiones, el monote\u00edsmo judeo-cristiano representa la enajenaci\u00f3n del hombre consigo mismo y con sus instintos naturales.

Dionysus is transformed into a metaphor of existence in which pain does not stand for any argument against life's assertion; the one god of Western tradition, on the other hand, has to be destroyed in conscience because he has been transformed into the main obstacle to man's self-accomplishment. It is not religion in general that is always shown as a human being's self-interpretation which is transformed in the core of Nietzsche's criticism, but a moral interpretation of the synonymous world of Christianity that showed itself at odds with man's erotic drives.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "Previous studies on the hillside farmers of northern Thailand often focused on their swidden (slashand-burn) agriculture of upland rice and cash crop cultivation and paid little attention to livestock production and consumption, including that of pigs. I describe the household-level pig production and consumption in terms of the number of pigs slaughtered and the number of pigs supplied to others, or acquired from others, in a Hmong village of smallholders in northern Thailand. Study results are based on pig consumption in 17 selected households over two years (January 2005 to December 2006). The number of pigs slaughtered in each household ranged from zero to ten, with an average of 2.4 pigs per household per year. Pigs were slaughtered mainly for ritual events, particularly for annual ancestor worship and New Year ceremonies. A total of 80 pigs were slaughtered, with 78% being killed during ritual events including Christmas and 22% for non-ritual events including children moving up a grade in school. Most Christian households stopped slaughtering of pigs in ancestor worship conducted by a shaman, but continued to do so in Christmas and New Year rituals. A total of 23 pigs were supplied to others, of which two were given to people outside the village, while of a total of 37 pigs acquired, 17 were obtained from outside the village. A total of 80 pigs were slaughtered, including one improved-breed pig that was killed during a marriage ceremony soon after it was acquired from the city. The following changes in pig consumption are inferred to have taken place due to recent socioeconomic changes: (1) diversification of the type of events in which pigs are slaughtered as a result of the introduction of Christianity and the national educational system; (2) active pig acquisition from outside the village as a result of the use of motor vehicles; and (3) the acquisition and slaughtering for events of improved-breeds of pigs which are not kept and used for breeding.\n      </p>", "Although Christian missions were present in China by A.D. 671 and mission-introduced medical and educational institutions have flourished, Christianity has never gained an important place in Chinese religious life.

However, because the African posting involved a substantial devaluation in the material benefits to be derived from missionary service, West Indians vigorously objected to the idea of making Africa their home. They demanded instead to be perceived and treated as foreigners on the same footing as Europeans. Although they were subsequently defined as part of the same footing as Europeans. Although they were subsequently defined as part of the expatriate workforce of the Mission, they were still denied parity with Europeans in the allocation of scarce benefits on the basis of racial considerations. Unresolved tensions over the redistribution of scarce resources led to the premature collapse of the West Indian scheme.

In general, I contend that nurturing innocence involves overlooking the inadvertent and advertent destruction and suering that has resulted from U.S. interventionist policies and actions in the 20th and 21st centuries. Finally, I argue that the cultivation of innocence, which is often supported by Christian theological language, contradicts central Christian beliefs.\n      </p>", "This essay explores conversion to the East African Revival as a way that Gikuyu women and men argued about moral and economic change. Rural capitalism in the 1930s and 1940s attacked the material basis of Gikuyu gender order by denying some men land. Familial stability was at stake in class formation: landless laborers could scarcely be respectable husbands. Rural elders and revivalists offered contending answers to the terrifying problem of gender trouble. Literate male elders at Tumutumu Presbyterian church used customary law and church bureaucracy to discipline young men and women. Revivalists, many of them women, talked: they confessed private sins vocally, cleansing themselves of sorcerous familial strife. Tumutumu's debate over Revival played out as a contest between the oral politics of conversion and the bureaucratic power of church elders. Mau Mau continued the debate.\n      </p>", "This paper refers to a participant-observation study of pilgrimage toward the Shrine of Monte Carmine, in southern Italy. The main focus is on the procession made on the day of celebration of the Virgin Mary venerated as Madonna del Carmine. The paper argues that the true raison d'\u00eatre of the pilgrimage resides in the presence of a dominant symbol. This is perceived by devotees as sacralizing the space and making sense of their performance. It also refers to a mythical time. The study is also concerned with the critical analysis of the issue of pilgrimage in general, with some of the most important meanings and functions which anthropology variously attaches to it.\n      </p>", "Is modernism a legitimate form of Christianity; or is it a perversion of Christianity? This article first analyzes the fundamentalist's charge against modernism; then the liberal defense is carefully examined, and certain ambiguous statements are analyzed; a final section indicates the real as contrasted with the apologetic significance of modernism. The movement is not a continuation of the traditional theology of Christianity, but rather a rediscovery of the historical Jesus, and an attempt to organize Christian devotion in relation to him rather than in relation to the standardized doctrines about him.\n      </p>", "This article investigates whether Aristotelian magnanimity is compatible with Christianity. According to Aristotle, this virtue is displayed in claiming and deserving great honors and accompanied by a disdain for others, all of which looks remarkably like the Christian sin of pride. This article argues that in spite of these apparent difficulties Aristotelian magnanimity is compatible with Christian morality, that the deserving Christian may, without prejudice to the virtue of humility, claim great honors, recognize his own superiority, and look down on others. The article concludes with an account of the contemporary political importance of these issues. Responding to scholarship that argues that Christianity's undermining of magnanimity is responsible for modernity's lack of great statesmanship, it is contended on the contrary that in the modern world Christianity alone can make magnanimous statesmanship possible.\n      </p>", "Anton Boisen was both a psychologist of religion and a schizophrenic.

This essay attempts to account for Boisen's most idiosyncratic psychotic products, drawing on theories of Jung and Bateson. Boisen and Jung both used experiences deriving from psychotic episodes to shape their subsequent life work. Boisen remained within liberal Protestantism, relinquishing his own \"crazy\" critique of Christianity developed during his mental illness. This critique is expressed through Boisen's notion of the \"Family of Four,\" a plan for world renewal that he himself never adequately interpreted.\n      </p>", "This article explores the rise of the True Jesus Church (TJC) as part of an emerging indigenous Chinese Christianity. Begun in 1917 under the influence of American Pentecostalism, the TJC developed into a lively popular sect with more than a million members by the 1990s. The birth of this independent and often antiforeign group coincided with, and was aided by, the surge of patriotism in the early Republican period and arguably constituted a religious expression of Chinese nationalism. More importantly, the TJC\u2014with its messianic proclamations and bold displays of Pentecostal power\u2014helped shape a twentieth-century Protestant millenarian movement in China amidst political disintegration, foreign aggression, and widespread suffering. Its growth signaled an evolution of popular religion in which Christianity joined local beliefs in supplying the core ideology of sectarian movements.\n      </p>", "Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca ultimately rejected completely both traditional Christianity and the institution of the Church. The roots of his religious crisis of 1927, which lie buried in the conflicts of his adolescent years, find first expression in the \"Libro de poemas\" (1921), taking at least three forms: (1) the use of small animals to voice religious questions, as in \"Encuentros de un caracol aventurero\" and \"\u00a1Cigarra!,\" (2) a contemplation of nature cloaking a deep spiritual debate, as in \"Canci\u00f3n oto\u00f1al\" and \"Los \u00e1lamos de plata,\" or (3) the unorthodox juxtaposition of Biblical figures with those from classical mythology to raise doubts about Christianity, as in \"Mar\" and \"Ma\u00f1ana.\" These poems, little-studied but typical of about one third of the collection, merit serious examination because they contain the first evidence of Lorca's religious struggles and associated imagery developed in later works, such as \"Poeta en Nueva York\" and \"Llanto por Ignacio S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00edas\".\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "The adoption of Christianity by Tswana people in southern Africa during the nineteenth century generally involved being inspired in some way by stories and ideas presented in the Bible, but the role of Christian scripture varied according to local and personal circumstances. Although European missionaries introduced Christianity to the Tswana, they had little control over the different ways that early Tswana converts perceived, adapted and proclaimed the new teaching. This was particularly true among western and northern Tswana in the mid-nineteenth century before the extension of colonial rule into the interior, as many Tswana communities remained largely intact and were able to accommodate Christianity on their own terms. Rather than being simply a European-made tool, the 'lefoko la Modimo' (word of God) was also an expression of Tswana beliefs and aspirations, composed not on passive objects of missionary evangelism, colonial rule or scholarly inquiry 'but on tablets of human hearts'.\n      </p>", "The author argues that the psyche crafts an affective metaphor for death out of the separation drama of infancy. Emergence of self from the mother-infant dyad can accomplish cohesion of fragmentary unconscious mentation strong enough, following Winnicott, to make possible a belief in God. Through developmental synergy between female and male elements, a sense of participation in an eternal principle of being can be achieved, sustaining the ego against anxieties over disintegration, and death as its analog. Myths of the child god illuminate the equation of fragmentation with death of self. Christianity expresses how the cohered self can transcend fragmentation.\n      </p>", "Christianity has influenced Western culture more than any factor save human nature itself, and yet its influence is now greatly diminished. Reactions to this have usually taken the form of a Hegelian affirmation that Christianity, having served its historical purpose, is no longer important in itself; a nostalgic conservatism which rejects the culture of modernity simply; or a revivalism which ignores it. An alternative view rests on an analysis of culture and the enlightenment process of secularization to which the Church reacted by closing in on itself until the Second Vatican Council affirmed the legitimate autonomy of the secular. The Church itself, partly to blame for secularization through its practical demystification of nature and attempt to coercively supplant all pre- and non-Christian religious experience, should engage modernity while giving witness to human dignity and promoting a more human culture. Such a constructive recovery of Christian culture must avoid both politicization and moralism.\n      </p>", "Protestant Christianity has been a prominent part of the general religious resurgence in China in the past two decades. In many ways it is the most striking example of that resurgence. Along with Roman Catholics, as of the 1950s Chinese Protestants carried the heavy historical liability of association with Western domination or imperialism in China, yet they have not only overcome that inheritance but have achieved remarkable growth. Popular media and human rights organizations in the West, as well as various Christian groups, publish a wide variety of information and commentary on Chinese Protestants. This article first traces the gradual extension of interest in Chinese Protestants from Christian circles to the scholarly world during the last two decades, and then discusses salient characteristics of the Protestant movement today. These include its size and rate of growth, the role of Church-state relations, the continuing foreign legacy in some parts of the Church, the strong flavour of popular religion which suffuses Protestantism today, the discourse of Chinese intellectuals on Christianity, and Protestantism in the context of the rapid economic changes occurring in China, concluding with a perspective from world Christianity.\n      </p>", "One of the prominent features of present-day Christian thinking is a somewhat widespread dissatisfaction with the traditional Christology. The present article seeks to indicate the considerations which entered into the formulation of that Christology in the early days of Christianity, and to show certain weaknesses in the arguments of Bishop Gore as expressed in his recent book. In conclusion, the article indicates the religious motives underlying the modern revolt against the traditional Christology.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "Islam is beginning to have a significant presence in the predominantly Christian nation of Solomon Islands. A few well-educated Islanders were drawn to Islam's elegant monotheism and promise of unity in the 1980s and early 1990s, but numbers have grown significantly in the years following a violent civil conflict (1998-2003). Many of these new Muslim converts, especially those from the island of Malaita, seem preoccupied with the problem of sin and blame Christianity for destroying customary rules, especially those enforcing gender segregation. Echoing long-standing Malaitan critiques of Christian freedom, they say that Christians rely too heavily on God's grace and their own ability to resist temptation. Unlike Christianity and similar to the traditional religion of the islands, Islam provides clear moral rules for living. Seeking an escape from a cycle of sin and redemption, these ex-evangelical Christians now see in Islam the possibility of becoming sinless.\n      </p>", "In Kerala State, South India, approximately one quarter of the population is Christian, many of whom claim a religious heritage nearly two thousand years old. This article focuses on a tradition, prevalent in the highly Christianized Kottayam district in Kerala, in which local lore and festivals associate Hindu patron deities and Christian patron saints as siblings. The relationships of these interreligious sacred sibling pairs, described alternately as contrary and cooperative, provide an apt metaphor for the complex communal relations between their Christian and Hindu devotee communities. This relational ambivalence is challenged, however, by unambiguous religious rhetoric that argues for an irreparable disparity between Christianity and Hinduism, or else for the negation of the boundaries that distinguish them. As this genre of sacred sibling associations presently appears to be on the wane, I also explore the tensions inherent in ethnographic enthusiasm for, versus native dismissal of, such traditions.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "In any given time and place, religious pluralism reflects a set of cultural attitudes about the nature and role of religion in society.

Pentecostalism paves the way for a renegotiation of roles within indigenous Fijian society because individualism is set within a worldview emphasizing key indigenous values of faith and service to community. Pentecostalism also constructs an imagined (and a real) world community of Christians in which Fijians and other marginal groups participate on a more equal basis than they do in international economic and political relations. By endorsing values strongly associated with the indigenous community, however, Pentecostalism often prevents questioning ethnic inequalities within the nation of Fiji, despite the fact that Pentecostal churches see themselves as uniting individuals across cultural barriers.\n      </p>", "Edward Mortimer looks at the history of Western secularism in the light of the recent resurgence of religious themes in international relations.

Ambiguous language used in defensive rituals can heighten people's senses of the risks they are confronting and also compel people to perform those rituals again in the future. In this article, I illustrate this argument by examining Fijian Methodist masu sema (chain prayers), which are conducted to defuse the dangers that beset society, including curses from demonic ancestors. I argue that Fijian cultural themes of present-day human powerlessness are generated largely by competition between Methodist and chiefly authorities. \"Chain prayers\" are attempts to negate the power of dangerous ancestors, but in requesting God's help, ritual participants cast themselves as powerless. Verbal ambiguity in chain prayers gives \"demons\" lives of their own, compelling their future circulation.\n      </p>", "It is often suggested in contemporary anthropology that Western views of nature are fundamentally different from those in \"societies of nature,\" supposed to conceptualise the environment in non-dualistic terms.

However, many features assumed to characterise non-Western views of nature, such as animistic beliefs and images of communion with nature, form an integral part of scholarly Roman Catholic thought as well as of popular religious practices.

Here, however, established anthropological assumptions on topics including transcendence, modernity, asceticism, and genealogy are reconsidered through a fieldwork-based examination of American Mormonism, a religion which posits relationships between the mortal and the divine that are unique in Christianity. Despite their strong belief in Christ, Mormons have often been labelled as 'not really Christian' by mainstream churches.

In human history the former has usually dominated relations to alien groups, the latter, relations within the group.

These include the rise of an immense federal bureaucracy and (if we understand the welfare state as comprising the phenomenon of \"consumer capitalism\") a trivialization of liberty and public life. What, then, must we do? I suggest in this article that Christianity provides a clue - the value of which is not confined to Christians.

In its place are emerging hundreds of new-paradigm churches, which are appropriating stylistic and organizational elements from our postmodern culture. This reformation, unlike the one led by Martin Luther, is challenging not doctrine but the medium through which the message of Christianity is articulated. Appropriating contemporary cultural forms, these postdenominational churches are creating a new genre of worship music; they are restructuring the organization of institutional Christianity; and they are democratizing access to the sacred by radicalizing the Protestant principle of priesthood of all believers.

Based on the analysis of Oromo ethnography, history, the system of thought and their contemporary political movements, the paper argues that Oromo nationalism is the antithesis of the Ethiopian state/official nationalism supported by the Orthodox Church. It also demonstrates that Islam is not a driving ideological force of Oromo's political struggle. On one the hand, it is in contradiction with many aspects of the pre-existing culture such as Gadaa-Qaaluu and other values from which the nationalists try to take inspiration to build their future. On the other hand, from the strategic perspective, the adoption of Islam or Christianity as an ideological tool of their nationalism would be a factor of more division and fragmentation.

A reavalia\u00e7\u00e3o da cristianiza\u00e7\u00e3o do reino do Congo pressup\u00f5e a an\u00e1lise do interesse da fam\u00edlia real, do efectivo enraizamento na popula\u00e7\u00e3o da nova religi\u00e3o com uma configura\u00e7\u00e3o pr\u00f3pria e das condi\u00e7\u00f5es da sua eros\u00e3o no tempo longo.\n      </p>", "The two primary philosophies upholding reason today are Objectivism and Christianity. They may seem like strange bedfellows, but many of the large perceived gaps between them disappear upon close inspection. This paper analyzes five areas (creation; tabula rasa; life as the ultimate standard; romantic love, sex and marriage; and altruism and the trader principle) in which Objectivist philosophy can be enhanced by assuming Christian philosophical axioms. The argument focuses on Christianity as a philosophy and intentionally does not assume a transcendent God. In each case, the Christian philosophical axioms are more realistic and better supported empirically than the Objectivist axioms.\n      </p>", "Hobbes regarded traditional Christianity as one of the leading threats to the preservation of civil peace. This article argues that he responded to this threat by developing an innovative reinterpretation of Christianity designed to tame it from within. This reinterpratation involved the reshaping of leading Christian doctrines around the same liberal principles that underlie his conception of political authority, the natural law principles of equality of right and inalienable rights. Although this political \"liberalization\" of Christianity may well have enhanced the prospects of civil peace, it did so by undermining doctrines central to Christianity's biblical roots. /// Hobbes consid\u00e9rait le christianisme traditionnel comme l'un des principales menaces au maintien de la paix civile. Cet article d\u00e9montre que Hobbes a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 cette menace par une r\u00e9interpr\u00e9tation novatrice du christianisme principes m\u00eames de cette doctrine pour en att\u00e9nuer (contrer) les impacts. Cette r\u00e9interpr\u00e9tation comportait le refa\u00e7onnement des principales doctrines ehr\u00e9tiennes autour des concepts lib\u00e9raux propres \u00e0 sa conception d'autorit\u00e9 politique, soit les principes de la loi naturelle de l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des droits et de l'inali\u00e9nabilit\u00e9 des droits. C'est en minant les doctrines centrales aux racines bibliques du christianisme que cette &lt;&lt; lib\u00e9ralisation &gt;&gt; du christianisme a peut-\u00eatre pu augmenter les chances de conserver la paix civile.\n      </p>", "Uturu has been a site of Christian missionary activities since the late nineteenth century. Churches, schools, and a rehabilitation complex are visible accomplishments of the missionary churches. There are also state educational institutions and private medical centers. The majority of people living in Uturu have become Christians through affiliation with one of the many churches. However, when compared to her neighbors Uturu has responded more slowly and cautiously to change. Many traditional customs continue to be cherished. Christian converts, therefore, face the question of how to deal with the indigenous practices that their new religion condemns. Attempts to answer this question have caused some social conflicts. Widowhood practices, which are the focus of this study, have provided the strongest incentive for conflicts. By examining widowhood practices, we shall better understand the factors that have determined the Uturu community's receptivity to change.\n      </p>", "By the end of the sixteenth century, the Japanese mission had become the largest overseas Christian community that was not under the rule of a European power. Its uniqueness was emphasized by Alessandro Valignano since 1582, who promoted a deeper accommodation to Japanese culture. It was also understood by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who issued the first national anti-Christian laws while he was unifying the Japanese empire. The main reason for the religious success of the Catholic Church in Japan was, undoubtedly, the engagement of many converts and their descendents. This article deals with the role of Japanese lay people within the Church, analyzing how individuals gave support to daily activities and how the communities strengthened themselves through the formation of brotherhoods. Japan was then the sole overseas country where all members of those confraternities were locals, in spite of the presence of a colonial elite.\n      </p>", "Eastern Lightning, also known as the Church of Almighty God, teaches that Jesus has returned to earth as a Chinese woman. It originated in China's rural north in the early 1990s and is now the largest Christian-related new religious movement. This article provides an introduction to the group's beliefs, and the ways the Chinese government and Chinese Protestants have responded to it. It finds that while posing a very contemporary challenge for the Chinese state and Protestant communities, Eastern Lightning also reflects the influence of heterodox religious traditions that stretch back far into China's past.\n      </p>", "Attitudes toward twins in Ekiti Yoruba society have remained remarkably consistent over the past hundred years even while the outward signs of their treatment have radically changed. Twins were considered to be extraordinary beings in the past and continue to be considered so. However, the markers of this extraordinariness have shifted from open expressions reflected in publicly displayed twin shrines to private, personal shrines kept in individual rooms. This essay examines both the everyday ways by which the special status of twins is muted and the special circumstances in which this tendency is overridden.\n      </p>", "This article brings together theories of local modernity and of linguistic ideology to analyze the way the Urapmin of Papua New Guinea have encountered modern linguistic ideology through their Christianization. Against the prevailing anthropological focus on the indigenization of modernity, this article argues the importance of attending to cases in which people grasp the content of modernity on its own terms. Studying this kind of local modernity allows us to model an important kind of contemporary cultural change and discover neglected aspects of modernity as refracted through the experiences of people new to it. Here, an analysis of the Urapmin encounter with modern linguistic ideology reveals that ideology's rootedness in a model that ties meaning to intention and truthfulness and favors the speaker over the listener in the construction of meaning. It is suggested that an awareness of the biases of this ideology can open up new topics in linguistic anthropology.\n      </p>"], "words": {"essay": {"number": 3, "prob": 2.4843794641193497e-05},
