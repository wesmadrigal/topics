{"total_words": 384, "documents": ["Television is among the many mechanisms that transmit information about sex-appropriate behavior to children. In order to examine whether television cartoons portray male and female characters using science and technology in a different manner, we examined the amount and type of science and technology utilized by characters in popular children's cartoons. Results revealed that most characters in these cartoons were male who were often depicted using science and technology, usually while being aggressive. When female characters were shown, they were portrayed as both able and prosocial, using science and technology for the greater good of others, rather than for destruction. In addition, female characters performed prosocial behaviors such as caring and sharing, showed self-confidence and explained things to others, and were less angry and violent than were male characters. Our findings suggest that the portrayal of female characters as competent may be successfully linked with the tendency to also show them as prosocial. Despite relatively positive portrayal of female characters, however, their appearance was rare and most likely not the main focus of the action.\n      </p>", "The mass media provide a series of arenas in which symbolic contests are carried out among competing sponsors of meaning. Measuring the display of competing interpretations is a way of assessing relative success. The Cold War period involved a long competition within the United States between two competing advocacy networks, each offering a general package on issues of nuclear war and Soviet-American relations. This paper examines how this contest was played out in one particular arena--that of editorial cartoons. Our results suggest certain dilemmas and vulnerabilities in Cold War packages and the strong cultural appeal of Common Security packages in spite of the access and resource handicaps of their sponsors.\n      </p>", "This article uses the twin concepts of the porous public and the transnational dialectic to analyse the recent Muhammed cartoons conflict. The porous public concept points to the way national public spheres are increasingly penetrated by inbound and outbound influences. The transnational dialectic concept suggests that globalization is a learning process in which globalization is simultaneously outcome and cause of social and political activities. During the cartoons conflict, the porosity of the Danish public was evident in (1) the transnational activities of national media, in (2) the role played by transnational news channels, in (3) the transnational activities of Muslims living in Denmark, and in (4) the role played by 9/11 as a transnationally shared event. Based on these findings, the concept of the transnational dialectic is employed to show how the Muhammed cartoons conflict constituted a learning process for Danish society, a process which has resulted in an increased level of global consciousness and an altered self-conception of Denmark's place and role in the world. Following the analysis of the Muhammed cartoons, the article discusses how the concept of the porous public relates to that of the transnational public sphere.\n      </p>", "By reflecting on a variety of cartoon representations of teachers and their work, this paper outlines a semiotic approach to undertaking research on teachers' professional cultures.\n      </p>", "A content analysis of imagery in editorial cartoons published from 1989 to 1991 suggests that the primary emotional function of these cartoons is the ritual humiliation of leaders through shame and ridicule. Indulgence and fear are also frequent themes of the cartoons, as are dangerous men, enemies, and death. Sexuality, birth, and children appear infrequently. Contrary to DeMause's hypothesis, there is no unusual change in the imagery during the period leading up to the Gulf War. Saddam Hussein may have served the American psyche more as a target for externalizing guilt feelings than as a feared enemy.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "This paper explores the use of cartoons in the classroom as a means of introducing and teaching American culture.

Biblical and Puritan themes do not occur in significant proportions until 1960. There is also a large increase during 1960-68 of cartoons dealing with supernatural objects. More important, the amount of criticism of the clergy increases during 1930 to 1953 and then gradually decreases to a new low. These trends suggest that the clergy are becoming less differentiated from the rest of society while traditional mythologies are becoming more vulnerable to public ridicule. The church as an institution is also being perceived increasingly as a possible target of humor.\n      </p>", "Political cartoons enjoy a wide appreciation among readers.

Cartoons were further examined for possible changes in the styles of characterization of U. S. blacks since the post-Word War II period. Although black characters were extremely rare throughout the 42 years, the relative numbers of blacks depicted decreased with the passage of each time period. Styles of portraying black characters also changed markedly over the years, in keeping with the changing status of blacks in the United States. All cartoons from the earliest period presented U. S. blacks in stereotypic occupational roles, cartoons in the late 1960s and early 1970s were dominated by racial themes, and blacks appeared in \"token\" roles in the majority of cartoons from the most recent period investigated. In the entire 42 years, only a single U. S. black appeared as a main character in a cartoon in which race was completely irrelevant.\n      </p>", "This article turns to an unexplored genre of Russian letters-the Yiddish cartoon-in order to consider how the most popular Russian Jewish newspaper of the early twentieth century participated in the Revolution of 1905-07. By exploring cartoons published in Der fraynd (St. Petersburg, 1903-1913, renamed Dos lebn February-July 1906) Sarah Abrevaya Stein reflects on how the Yiddish press reflected and shaped evolutions in Russian Jewish popular opinion: in particular, the temporary shift away from nationalist and toward opposition and socialist politics. This article also considers why the revolution ended in the world of Yiddish letters some months earlier than it did in the Russian, in the wake of the Bialystok pogroms of June 1906. This event, Stein demonstrates, catalyzed a redirection in the aesthetic and political tenor of popular Yiddish sources, prompting the cartoon to be replaced with the photograph and the politics of opposition with nationalism.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "For well over a century German editorial cartoonists have used the Michel figure to represent the concerns and aspirations of their compatriots.

Such representations became more prevalent after German unification in 1990. This article comments on ten editorial cartoons which highlight the evolution of the twin Michel.

Temporal correlation and other indirect inference suggest that television is at least a partial cause of the change. Television's influence on shared images is also noted by the cartoonists themselves. The findings suggest that television may increase the likelihood that cultural symbols can be used to direct a nation's attention, to manipulate public opinion, and to mobilize behavior.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "           ", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

This article provides a new perspective on the rise of art-historical consciousness by examining publications associated with the Raphael Cartoons, then at Hampton Court. Through a wide range of engraved reproductions and written commentaries, the Cartoons not only came to be the most visible Old Master paintings in England in the period, but also became central to an on-going process whereby ideas about painting were formulated in terms of artistic standards and historical development. The Cartoons publications illustrate a trend in which works of art formerly enjoyed privately by royal or aristocratic collectors became increasingly accessible to wider audiences. In consequence, ideas associated with these works penetrated diverse levels of society and art-historical consciousness assumed a public value.\n      </p>", "In this article, I examine the literary single-panel cartoons and caricatures in smart magazines the New Yorker, Vanity Fair, and Esquire, which reflect each magazine's bibliographic code, emphasizing a burgeoning \u201csmart\u201d audience, and efforts to promote popular cultural tastes and celebrities.

It focuses particularly on the work of two prominent cartoon artists, Friedel Stern and Kariel Gardosh (Dosh), who made their careers in Israel in the 1950s and '60s and whose politically charged images have been sanitized over time. It looks at how attitudes towards certain imagery have changed so that political commentary that was seen as relevant and acute during early statehood eventually lost its political edge through historical handling and revision. These two cartoonists provided strong visual symbols of early Israeli national identity, which invariably had political motivations, and yet their legacy as political commentators during a crucial period in Israeli political history is often overlooked.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

To investigate the meanings given to various terms, a set of 25 stick-figure cartoons was devised, covering a range of social situations between peers. These cartoons were shown to samples of 8- and 14-year-old pupils (N - 1,245; n = 604 at 8 years, n = 641 at 14 years) in schools in 14 different countries, who judged whether various native terms cognate to bullying, applied to them. Terms from 10 Indo-European languages and three Asian languages were sampled. Multidimensional scaling showed that 8-year-olds primarily discriminated nonaggressive and aggressive cartoon situations; however, 14-year-olds discriminated fighting from physical bullying, and also discriminated verbal bullying and social exclusion. Gender differences were less appreciable than age differences. Based on the 14-year-old data, profiles of 67 words were then constructed across the five major cartoon clusters. The main types of terms used fell into six groups: bullying (of all kinds), verbal plus physical bullying, solely verbal bullying, social exclusion, solely physical aggression, and mainly physical aggression. The findings are discussed in relation to developmental trends in how children understand bullying, the inferences that can be made from cross-national studies, and the design of such studies.\n
