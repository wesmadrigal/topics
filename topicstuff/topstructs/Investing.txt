Its conceptual origins can be found in the early history of civilization, with it's modern roots in the 1960s. This paper provides an overview of the breadth and depth of the concept and practice of socially and environmentally responsible investing, describes the investment strategies that together define SRI as currently practiced in the U.S., offers several observations about some of the factors fueling its dramatic growth, and presents data showing that investors who choose to invest in a socially and environmentally responsible manner can do so without giving up investment returns. SRI has matured to a point where virtually any investment need can be met through portfolio design that integrates an investor's personal values, institutional mission, and/or social priorities. The socially responsible investment industry in the United States is a young phenomenon. Even referring to it as an \"industry\" ten years ago may have been a bit of a stretch. While it has grown dramatically in recent years, it is an area of work, of study and of practical application that continues to evolve in many significant ways. One intriguing example of the ongoing development of the field can be found in the analysis of the language used to describe it. The terms social investing, socially responsible investing, ethical investing, socially aware investing, socially conscious investing, green investing, values-based investing, and mission-based or mission-related investing all refer to the same general process and are often used interchangeably.\n      </p>", "Social investing, though not yet fully mainstream, has the potential to obtain such status. Questions relating to the future of social investing include the following. (1) What properly falls within the ambit of social investing? Assuming that no single definition of social responsibility is feasible, what then are the limits? (2) What do we need to know about investor psychology concerning social investing? What motivates people to buy socially screened investments and why do they sometimes act inconsistently? (3) How can we improve the measures of social performance? Is it possible to develop GAAP and GAAS equivalents for social reporting? (4) Should social reports by firms be audited? If so, how? (5) What sorts of public policies are necessary to support the social screening of investments?\n      </p>", "Socially responsible investing identifies the fiduciary duty and liability for financial advisors serving individual and institutional clients when consulting in the SRI space. This article first discusses the role of a fiduciary emerging from both a legal and an ethical basis. Further, the special aspects of maintaining fiduciary duty and minimizing fiduciary liability are described as they relate to SRI. A number of recommendations are discussed: legal, ethical, and practice. This study argues that prudence focuses more on the process of decisions rather than their outcomes, as measured exclusively by rate of return.\n      </p>", "This paper makes three important points regarding socially responsible investing. First, the current methodology involving SRI fund divestiture of the securities of firms that engage in socially irresponsible activity often results in unacceptable unintended consequences. Second, in many cases the proper methodology for SRI funds may be purposely to include the securities of such firms in the portfolio in an effort to internalize socially irresponsible interfirm spillovers. Finally, that SRI fund managers may be able to bound their performance by organizing as closed-end funds subject to takeover and liquidation if the stated socially responsible objectives are not met.\n      </p>", "The purpose of socially responsible investing (SRI) is to: (1) allow investors to reflect their personal values and ethics in their choices, and (2) encourage companies to improve their ethical, social, and environmental performance. In order to achieve these ends, the means SRI fund managers employ include the use of negative screening, or the exclusion of companies involved in \"sinful\" industries. We argue that there are problems with this methodology, both at a theoretical and at a practical level. As a consequence, current SRI offerings cannot accurately reflect the values and ethical beliefs they propose to represent. Moreover, the use of a priori criteria is potentially misleading, as we show by discussing examples of glue and wine making. Applying this flawed approach SRI funds fail to influence the direction of the firms they deem most in need of redirecting. Rather than engaging in the simple a priori assumption that some industries are \"saints\" while others are \"sinners\" (Freeman, 2007) we suggest a new framework upon which the SRI screening methodology could be grounded. Embracing the philosophical tradition of American pragmatism, we suggest that SRI methodology could be improved by engaging in an analysis based on (1) the actual impacts of the company's products and services, (2) the company's relationships with its specific, real stakeholders, and (3) the contingent environment (social, economic, political, legal, and cultural) in which the business operates.\n      </p>", "Over the past two decades, the phenomenon of socially responsible investing has become more widespread. However, knowledge about the individual socially responsible investor is largely limited to descriptive and comparative accounts. The question of \"why do some investors practice socially responsible investing and others don't?\" is therefore still largely unanswered. To address this shortcoming in the current literature, this paper develops a model of the decision to invest socially responsibly that is grounded in the cognition literature. The hypotheses proposed in the model are tested with an experimental survey. The results indicate that the framing of the investing situation influences the likelihood of engagement in socially responsible investing and how much return the individuals are willing to sacrifice when choosing socially responsible over conventional investments. The study does not find support for a relationship between expectations about corporate social responsibility and the likelihood of engagement in socially responsible investing.\n      </p>", "Infrastructure assets around the world are shifting from public to private ownership. This article investigates how institutional investors are investing beyond their traditional financial and geographic borders and are increasingly serving as owners of infrastructure assets. It shows how infrastructure assets have specific geographies of information embedded in their investment returns and discusses the growing interest of institutional investors in investing in the infrastructure landscape. While infrastructure investments are considered globally, opportunities depend on the availability of specialist information in the region of investment. The article demonstrates that the low-risk, geographically varied returns match the diversification objectives of pension fund portfolios. Relational investing is important in implementing strategies for investing in the infrastructure, since the bidding on and ensuing ownership and management of infrastructure assets around the world require a combination of financial, legal, and technical expertise. The article addresses three distinct economic geography literatures: the geography of finance, pension fund research, and emerging debates on \"relational geometries.\"\n      </p>", "With assets of over US$1.0 trillion and growing, public pension funds in the United States have become a major force in the private sector through their holding of equity positions in large publicly traded corporations. More recently, these funds have been expanding their investment strategy by considering a corporation's long-term risks on issues such as environmental protection, sustainability, and good corporate citizenship, and how these factors impact a company's long-term performance. Conventional wisdom argues that the fiduciary responsibility of the pension funds' trustees must be solely focused on their beneficiaries and, therefore, their investment criteria must be based strictly on narrowly defined financial measures. It is also asserted that well-established financial measurements of corporate performance already include long-term risk assessment through discounted present value of future flow of earnings. Consequently, all other criteria are contrary to the best interest of the pension funds' beneficiaries. In this paper, we assert that, contrary to conventional wisdom, pension funds, and for that matter other mutual funds, must be concerned with the long-term survival and growth of corporations. These measures are generally referred to \"socially responsible investing\" (SRI) and when applied to corporations, it is termed \"socially responsible corporate conduct (SRCC).\" We demonstrate that current measurement of future risk assessment invariably understates, and quite often completely overlooks, these long-term risks because of the inherent bias towards short-run on the part of financial intermediaries whose compensation depends greatly on short-term results. Furthermore, there is ample evidence to suggest that these intermediaries have been engaging in self-serving practices and thus failing in their duties to serve their clients', i.e. pension funds', best interests. Because of their large holdings in the total market as well as individual companies, these funds cannot easily divest from poorly performing companies without destabilizing the companies' stock and overall markets. Hence, they must opt for a strategy of emphasizing investment criteria that encourage companies to take into account long-term aspects of their operations in terms of their impact on environment, sustainability, and community welfare, to name a few. We argue that an exclusionary, and even a primary, focus on short-term financial criteria is no longer a viable option. It also calls for the pension funds to encourage greater transparency and accountability of the entire corporate sector through improved corporate governance. Thus socially responsible investing practices are not merely discretionary and desirable activities; they are a necessary imperative, which both the corporations and public pension funds, and other large institutional holders, will ignore at serious peril to themselves. Finally, the paper considers some of the recent developments where corporations have been responding to these challenges and how their actions might be strengthened through greater disclosure and transparency of corporate activities. It also makes recommendations for the pension funds to support further research in creating new measurement standards that further refine the concept of socially responsible investing as a necessary ingredient of long-term corporate survival and growth in the context of a changing economic, environmental and socio-political dynamic.\n      </p>", "This article contributes to the literature on national varieties of socially responsible investment (SRI) by demonstrating how Scandinavian SRI developed from the 60s and onwards. Combining findings on Scandinavian SRI with insights from previous research and institutional theory, the article accounts for the role of changes in societal values and norms, the mechanisms by which SRI practices spread, and how investors adopt and transform practices to suit their surrounding institutional contexts. Especially, the article draws attention to how different categories of investors act as institutional entrepreneurs during specific historical periods, and how these roles come to shift as institutional rule systems of varying societal levels change. Thus, the insights gained are useful in the future research agenda concerned with advancing knowledge on idiosyncrasies and commonalities of national SRI manifestations, and to understand the reasons underlying such characteristics.\n      </p>", "Since the 1980s and even more markedly in the 1990s, new public policies and programs with \u00abchild\u00bb or \u00abchildren\u00bb in the title have proliferated in Canada. This article makes the claim that this shift in policy focus marks the appearance of a new policy paradigm. The article supports this claim first by describing change over time, characterizing it as shift from a paradigm in which parents have full responsibility for their children's well-being to one that can be labeled an investing-in-children paradigm, in which responsibility for children's well-being is shared by families and the broader community. In each case, the role of the state and its public policy choices are quite different. The article next accounts for the change, attributing it not only to new social and economic risks but also to the work of a social-learning network made up of advocates and experts from civil society and inside the state. /// Depuis les ann\u00e9es 1980 et 1990, les politiques publiques dont le titre contient les mots \"enfant\" ou \"enfance\" ont prolif\u00e9r\u00e9 au Canada.

The framework is developed with respect to the UK and US pension funds (as these share certain common legal characteristics) and focuses on the changes that pension funds adopting such a strategy should make to their investment strategies and governance (particularly through the formulation and articulation of clear investment mission and strong investment beliefs). The article proceeds with a review of socially responsible investment (SRI) and more recent responsible investment (RI) literature, in the context of growing public awareness (but not necessarily understanding) of the concept of sustainability (\"Literature review of SRI field: SRI, RI and sustainable investing\" section). It then examines the literature on pension fund governance, arguing the need for more detailed practical guidance for funds moving towards sustainable investing, especially for those implementing a sustainable investing strategy (\"Anglo-American pension fund governance\" section). It presents the framework for the practical implementation of sustainable investing in the \"Sustainable investing framework\" section. Finally, we review the relevant Anglo-American legal backdrop, outlining how pension funds adopting our framework should approach their fiduciary obligations, and then discussing potential regulatory enablers of sustainable investment (\"Legal context: barriers to and enablers of sustainable investing\" section).\n      </p>", "Many firms are moving to make virtual interfaces their primary, or even sole, points of customer contact. In this environment, some traditional service quality dimensions that determine customer satisfaction, such as the physical appearance of facilities, employees, and equipment, and employees' responsiveness and empathy are unobservable. In contrast, trust may play a central role here in enhancing customer satisfaction. We model trust as an endogenously formed entity that ultimately impacts customer satisfaction, and we elucidate the linkages between trust and other factors related to the performance of the online service provider and to the service environment. The model is validated using two samples-one comprising 225 online investors of a large online broker, and the other comprising 203 members of the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII). The findings suggest that perceived trustworthiness of an online broker is a significant antecedent to investors' satisfaction, and that perceived environmental security and perceived operational competence impact the formation of trust. The results have important managerial implications.\n      </p>", "The ultimate challenge with which we are presented in connection with social investing is no more and no less than this: enhancing the function of conscience in the modern global business corporation. As with individual conscience, however, corporate conscience can be influenced in two ways: from the inside and from the outside. Investment decisions provide external influences, while management values provide influence from the inside.\n      </p>", "Religious organisations are major investors with sometimes substantial investment volumes. An important question for them is how to make investments in, and to earn returns from, companies and activities that are consistent with their religious beliefs or that even support these beliefs. Religious organisations have pioneered responsible investment. Yet little is known about their investment attitudes. This article addresses this gap by studying faith consistent investing. Based on a survey complemented by interviews, we investigate religious organisations' attitudes towards responsible investment including opinions, practices and the impediments for implementing faith consistent investing. Although our results cannot be generalised because of the non-random character of our sample, six main characteristics of faith consistent investing are drawn: investing is not perceived as being in contradiction with religious values, religious values are important drivers, there is a strong community around faith consistent investing, religious investors are pioneering impact investing, implementing faith consistent investing is not without difficulties, and practices vary across regions. The survey also reveals that faith consistent investing has many commonalities with secular responsible investors.\n      </p>", "When one talks about market efficiency, it is important to distinguish between ideas whose implications are obvious and consequently travel quickly and ideas that require reflection and special expertise for their evaluation and consequently travel slowly. If the market is inefficient, it will not be inefficient with respect to the first kind of idea, which is unlikely to be misevaluated. Any market inefficiency, hence any investment opportunity, will arise instead with respect to the second kind. The second kind of idea -- rather than the obvious, hence quickly discounted, idea relating to \"long-term\" business or economic developments -- is the only meaningful basis for \"long-term investing.\"\n      </p>", "Golf, like life, has complexities and challenges comparable to investing, and the secret to success in each is self-discipline. We have been wisely advised to learn models of thinking in one area and apply them to problem solving in others. From Scotland came the origins of golf and investing, and from Scotland came a fine player and great teacher, Tommy Armour. His lessons are universal.\n      </p>", "In this paper, I examine various popular notions concerning the ethics of investing. I first consider and reject the absolutist view that it is always wrong to invest in \"evil\" companies and the view that what makes investments in evil companies morally objectionable is the fact that by making such investments, investors are taking steps to benefit from the wrongdoing of others. I then defend the view that what makes certain investments morally objectionable is the fact that by making such investments, investors enable others to do wrong. According to this view, when weighing the purchase of a certain company's stock, investors should ask themselves the following question: \"Would this sort of investment, if made by many people, enable others to do wrong?\" If the answer to this question is yes, and if an investor nevertheless makes the investment in question, he can justifiably be accused of moral wrongdoing.\n      </p>", "Those who argue for diverting pension investing from its traditional goal to such other goals as equal employment opportunity, occupational safety and health, consumer protection, environmental protection, energy conservation, human rights, inner city redevelopment and low income housing, have termed their proposals \"socially responsible\" investing. The author prefers the term \"divergent\" investing, which avoids the implication that objections to such proposals are necessarily antisocial and irresponsible. A Wisconsin law mandating that at least 70 per cent of the State Teachers Retirement Fund be invested within Wisconsin was repealed in 1945--possibly because of the performance history of the resulting portfolio. But divergent investing is likely to be tried again and again until the lesson is overwhelmingly clear: The pension fund that diverges from exclusive concentration on performance performs less well than one that doesn't. Who decides what the goals and priorities of a divergent portfolio should be? If a construction union invests in mortgages to finance a construction project on which its members will have jobs, who will choose the projects? If state and local pension funds are used to finance local projects, won't politics replace market returns as the investment criterion? When a pension fund engages in divergent investing, the special interests with the most muscle are likely to choose both the divergent goals and the specific investments. Because divergent investing interferes with investment performance, it interferes with retirement security. Until retirement benefits are adequate, divergent investing is an unconscious--or, if conscious, a contemptible--effort to take money away from the elderly, who themselves need financial aid as much or more than any other group in our society.\n      </p>", "The practice of investing in distressed companies is popularly known as \"vulture\" investing. The risks of investing in this market are highly firm specific and idiosyncratic. Investors who are adept at managing these risks, who understand the legal rules that must be followed in corporate bankruptcy, and who are skilled at identifying or creating value in a distressed situation consistently earn the highest returns in this market.\n      </p>", "This paper explores the importance and price implications of style investing by institutional investors in the stock market. To analyze styles, we assign stocks to deciles or segments across three style dimensions: size, value/growth, and sector. We find strong evidence that institutional investors reallocate across style groupings more intensively than across random stock groupings. In addition, we show that own segment style inflows and returns positively forecast future stock returns, while distant segment style inflows and returns forecast negatively. We argue that behavioral theories play a role in explaining these results.\n      </p>", "A survey of 120 U.S. firms indicated substantial East-West trade activity. However, almost no joint ventures between U.S. firms and Eastern European enterprises were found. There seemed to be a strong negative attitude among U.S. executives with regard to joint ventures with Eastern Europe. This negative attitude was partitioned into two parts, that dealing with the executives' perception of political risk and that associated with the belief that more managerial time is required to supervise ventures in Eastern Europe. Executives knowledgeable about Eastern Europe show more concern for the latter aspect, while those less familiar with Eastern Europe are more likely to worry about the political risks.\n      </p>", "This paper discusses the economic impact and political consequences of ethical investing, with particular attention to the case of South Africa. The origins of ethical investing are examined, along with the institutions and strategies by which ethical investing operates today. Of immediate relevance to managers is a recent judicial decision upholding Baltimore's divestment ordinance. The discussion concludes with an assessment of the likely consequences of ethical investing for U.S. multinationals in Southern Africa.\n      </p>", "The favorite investment strategies used by both individual investors and professional money managers include those that are based on the PE and PEG ratios. While much popular as well as academic attention has been bestowed upon the former, the sole previous research documents the extraordinary performance of a PEG-based investment strategy for growth stocks during the 1980s. Here we examine the robustness of this anomalous finding to an expanded sample during a subsequent period. Our findings suggest that PEG investing remains a profitable investment strategy, and that it extends its reach beyond the domain of growth stocks. Additionally, we document a risk profile for PEG-based strategies that is likely to be counterintuitive for most value investors.\n      </p>", "Successful investing can be almost easy: Avoid harmful \"accidents\" and do what will achieve your own most important long-term objectives. The very human irony is that learning this lesson can take so many years that by the time we \"get it,\" it may be too late to use the lesson because the powers of compounding need time.\n      </p>", "The question of whether, and to what extent, business managers have obligations to stakeholders has been the principal theme in much of recent business ethics literature. The question of whether shareholders have obligations to stakeholders, however, has not been addressed sufficiently. I provide some needed attention to this matter by examining the positions of shareholders in the contemporary world of investing. Their positions are considerably different than that often envisioned by business ethicists and economists where shareholders determine the directions of corporate activities through their voting decisions. Typical contemporary investors rarely control corporate activities. If they own corporate securities directly, generally they own too small an interest to exercise control. And, in most cases, they do not even own corporate securities directly, but, rather, own shares in funds. Because of the positions of shareholders today, it is highly questionable whether most have obligations to stakeholders. This has a significant implication for business managers. Whether or not shareholders have obligations to stakeholders, business managers have a greater obligation to educate shareholders about how corporate activities affect stakeholders. I provide a justification for that obligation and comment on how business managers might begin to fulfill it.\n      </p>", "A central and contentious debate in many literatures concerns the relationship between financial and social performance. We advance this debate by measuring the financial--social performance link within mutual funds that practice socially responsible investing (SRI). SRI fund managers have an array of social screening strategies from which to choose. Prior studies have not addressed this heterogeneity within SRI funds. Combining modern portfolio and stakeholder theories, we hypothesize that the financial loss borne by an SRI fund due to poor diversification is offset as social screening intensifies because better-managed and more stable firms are selected into its portfolio. We find support for this hypothesis through an empirical test on a panel of 61 SRI funds from 1972 to 2000. The results show that as the number of social screens used by an SRI fund increases, financial returns decline at first, but then rebound as the number of screens reaches a maximum. That is, we find a curvilinear relationship, suggesting that two long-competing viewpoints may be complementary. Furthermore, we find that financial performance varies with the types of social screens used. Community relations screening increased financial performance, but environmental and labor relations screening decreased financial performance. Based on our results, we suggest that literatures addressing the link between financial and social performance move toward in-depth examination of the merits of different social screening strategies, and away from the continuing debate on the financial merits of either being socially responsible or not.\n      </p>", "Recent years have witnessed an increasing growth in mutual funds that invest according to social criteria. As a consequence, the financial performance of these portfolios has attracted the interest of academics and practitioners. This paper investigates the performance of a sample of socially responsible mutual funds from seven European countries investing globally and/or in the European market. Using unconditional and conditional models, we assess the performance of these funds in comparison to conventional and socially responsible benchmark portfolios. The results show that European socially responsible funds present in general neutral performance in relation to both conventional and socially responsible benchmarks. However, performance estimates seem to be slightly higher when funds are evaluated in relation to socially responsible indices. Our results also show that socially responsible funds are more exposed to conventional than to socially responsible indices. Furthermore, conventional benchmarks are better able to explain fund returns than socially responsible benchmarks. These findings are robust to both unconditional and conditional models of performance. We also observe that conditional models lead to a slight improvement of performance estimates and to the explanatory power of the models, both when conventional and socially responsible benchmarks are considered. This is consistent with most previous empirical findings on conditional performance evaluation. Our results show that investors who wish to hold European funds can add social screens to their investment choices without compromising financial performance.\n      </p>", "When coupled with a stock's current price, a readily available piece of information-the 52-week high price-explains a large portion of the profits from momentum investing. Nearness to the 52-week high dominates and improves upon the forecasting power of past returns (both individual and industry returns) for future returns. Future returns forecast using the 52-week high do not reverse in the long run. These results indicate that short-term momentum and long-term reversals are largely separate phenomena, which presents a challenge to current theory that models these aspects of security returns as integrated components of the market's response to news.\n      </p>", "In a recent article in this journal entitled \"The Ethics of Investing\", William Irvine argues that what he calls the 'Evil-Company Principle' is an inadequate guide to ethical investing. In its place, he proposes what he calls the 'Enablement Principle'. In reply, I argue that his rejection of the Evil-Company Principle is premature and that his Enablement Principle presupposes acceptance of the Evil-Company Principle.\n      </p>", "In this article, we document the growing influence of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the realm of socially responsible investing (SRI). Drawing from ethical and economic perspectives on stakeholder management and agency theory, we develop a framework to understand how and when NGOs will be most influential in shaping the ethical and social responsibility orientations of business using the emergence of SRI as the primary influencing vehicle. We find that NGOs have opportunities to influence corporate conduct via direct, indirect, and interactive influences on the investment community, and that the overall influence of NGOs as major actors in socially responsible investment is growing, with attendant consequences for corporate strategy, governance, and social performance.\n      </p>", "This article discusses socially responsible investing (SRI) and tobacco. SRI allows investors, both institutional and individual, to express their concerns and make their social and ethical stands known to the companies they invest in and patronize. The tobacco industry is active in every country on the globe and generates huge profits, while tobacco use is responsible for 4 million deaths every year. The authors explore past and current views on investment in tobacco, partly based on a survey conducted by the Tobacco Free Initiative of the World Health Organization (WHO). There is clearly a trend toward divestment from tobacco for both ethical and financial reasons. Tobacco-free investments can be both ethically sound and financially profitable.\n      </p>", "The growing concentration of investing in institutional hands has been accompanied by increased competition for the individual's savings dollar. This competition has focused on \"performance,\" defined as near-term capital appreciation. As a result, institutional investment portfolios have increased common stock ratios, concentrated in a relatively few securities, and increased portfolio turnover. Consequently movement of institutional funds has had an important impact on prices and price-earnings ratios and has not increased market stability. Stock exchange firms have developed special services to take care of these institutions, trading on regional exchanges and \"Third Markets\" has increased, and the disposition of institutional brokerage commissions has interested regulatory authorities. The capital markets have also been affected, as funds have flowed into equities and away from debt. Continuation of these trends will significantly change the nature of institutional investors, the stock exchange institutions that serve them, and the capital markets themselves.\n      </p>", "This anthropological study of the world of institutional investing focuses on nine large pension funds. Using traditional anthropological methods, the authors observed these funds at work and conducted wide-ranging interviews with people involved in every phase of the funds' investment operations. In talking about what they do and why they do it, these insiders effectively set the research agenda. The authors' most important finding is the extent to which economic and financial analyses do not dominate investment decision-making. Instead, in choosing investment strategies, evaluating investment options and hiring, firing and retaining external managers, fund executives appear to be motivated more by the kinds of cultural influences that drive less consequential decisions. These include the quirks of institutional history and corporate politics, the desire to displace responsibility, and the demands of maintaining smooth personal relationships. As the American economy comes to depend more and more on institutional capital, these findings raise troubling questions for the long term.\n      </p>", "\"Ethical investing\" is interpreted in the following paper to be the use of non-financial normative criteria by investors in the choice of securities for their portfolios. Ethical investors may aim at fulfilling duties they feel they have, possibly including increasing the amount of good in society through the consequences of their buying and selling behavior. The main duties are those of not-profiting from bad corporate behavior and of punishing bad (or rewarding good) firms. The main consequence desired is that managers manage corporations in a more ethical manner. But ethical investors (as opposed to some other kinds of investors who are also interested in normative issues) also aim at receiving returns based on the market risk of their investments. If the aim of managers is to maximize shareholder wealth, then ethical investors can fulfill their duties or achieve their desired consequences only if their trading activities affect shareholder wealth, i.e., share price. A theoretical argument is presented to show that this trading activity will not affect share price or return. In addition, reference is made to results of empirical studies which show that ethical stocks yield market returns, i.e., that the share price of ethical firms is unaffected by the actions of ethical investors. If the trading activity of ethical investors fails to affect share price and return, then these investors fail to fulfill any of their goals or to achieve their ends.\n      </p>", "Most managers use some type of value criteria--dividend discount model rankings, low price/earnings ratios, low price/book values and the like--when selecting stocks. But the returns to value investing depend greatly on how the method is applied. For example, the investment results of a strategy that picks the \"top\" stocks according to a pure value model, with no adjustments to control for systematic risk factors, were out of control during the 1987-90 period. The most undervalued stocks did not perform as well as the most overvalued stocks. Fortunately, various methods of risk control can be easily incorporated into value strategies. An Arbitrage Pricing Theory approach called the Risk Attribute Model (RAM), for example, controls a portfolio's exposures to such risk factors as economic growth, credit cycles, long-term interest rates, short-term interest rates, inflation, U.S. dollar changes and the overall market effect. The proper use of RAM in an optimized portfolio process provides much higher returns, at lower risk, than simply picking the most undervalued stocks. Value, like other stock ranking techniques, should be applied with discipline. Value works better when employed with optimized risk factors than without. Moreover, actively tilting a portfolio's exposure to various macroeconomic factors, in accordance with the manager's expectations of their behavior, can add even more value.\n      </p>", "Economically targeted investments (ETIs) are capital projects that are expected to provide economic benefits to the economies of the regions in which they occur. Pension plans have been encouraged by both public officials and other constituencies to factor these collateral benefits into the decision-making process when selecting investments. Detractors see this as social investing that constrains portfolio choice, compromises the integrity of the pension fiduciary, and results in suboptimal financial performance. Proponents agree that investment performance standards should be kept at a high level. However, they point out that externalities, such as new jobs, broader tax bases, and stronger local economies, are real and that they can be important to a pension plan's participants and beneficiaries under the right circumstances. This article argues that carefully selected ETIs may improve the overall performance of a portfolio of pension assets and benefit plan participants in the process. The critical prerequisite to considering an investment's externalities is assessing whether the project will probably be financed by another investor if turned down by the pension fund (the relatively efficient market model) or will fail to find a suitable investor (the inefficient market model).\n      </p>", "\u03b1-investing is an adaptive sequential methodology that encompasses a large family of procedures for testing multiple hypotheses. All control mFDR, which is the ratio of the expected number of false rejections to the expected number of rejections. mFDR is a weaker criterion than the false discovery rate, which is the expected value of the ratio. We compensate for this weakness by showing that \u03b1-investing controls mFDR at every rejected hypothesis. \u03b1-investing resembles \u03b1-spending that is used in sequential trials, but it has a key difference. When a test rejects a null hypothesis, \u03b1-investing earns additional probability towards subsequent tests. \u03b1-investing hence allows us to incorporate domain knowledge into the testing procedure and to improve the power of the tests. In this way, \u03b1-investing enables the statistician to design a testing procedure for a specific problem while guaranteeing control of mFDR.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Being that institutional investors prefer socially aligned organizations, this study explored to what extent the corporate actions and/or social/environmental investments influenced their decisions. Our results suggest that there are specific variables that affect the perceived value of the organization, leading to decisions to not only invest, but whether to hold or sell the shares, and therefore having a consequential impact on the capital market's valuation.\n      </p>", "Long-short strategies have generated controversy and institutional interest for more than 10 years. We analyzed the efficiency gains of long-short investing, where we defined efficiency as the information ratio of the implemented strategy (the optimal portfolio) relative to the intrinsic information ratio of the alphas. The efficiency advantage of long-short investing arises from the loosening of the (surprisingly important) long-only constraint. Long-short and long-only managers need to understand the impact of this significant constraint. Long-short implementations offer the most improvement over long-only implementations when the universe of assets is large, asset volatility is low, and the strategy has high active risk. The long-only constraint induces biases (particularly toward small stocks), limits the manager's ability to act on upside information by not allowing short positions that could finance long positions, and reduces the efficiency of traditional (high-risk) long-only strategies relative to enhanced index (low-risk) long-only strategies.\n      </p>", "A great deal of academic empirical research has been published on value and growth investing. We review and update this literature, discuss the various explanations for the performance of value versus growth stocks, review the empirical research on the alternative explanations, and provide some new results based on an updated and expanded sample. The evidence suggests that, even after taking into account the experience of the late 1990s, value investing generates superior returns. Common measures of risk do not support the argument that the return differential is a result of the higher riskiness of value stocks. Instead, behavioral considerations and the agency costs of delegated investment management lie at the root of the value--growth spread.\n      </p>", "This paper is a report of an empirical psychological study of the relationship between the ethical and financial beliefs and desires of ethical investors. Semi-structured interviews of 20 ethical investors have been carried out by the project 10 of which have been analysed using qualitative data analysis software. All of our participants faced the problem that, while they had ethical concerns, they were not prepared to sacrifice their essential financial requirements to address them. We found four common ways of dealing with this problem: they divided up their money into core and surplus accounts; they decided that it was enough to only be a partial ethical investor; they avoided detailed consideration of the costs of ethical investment, and they avoided rigorous ethical thinking. One equilibrium position arising from these responses is a portfolio approach to ethics, which allows people to assuage their consciences by investing only a small proportion of their investments ethically, while leaving the rest in non-ethical investment vehicles.\n      </p>", "Non-American firms have recently begun investing larger sums of money in the U.S. Such increased activity has created a great deal of interest and concern.

Although the size of the U.S. market and the attractiveness of a new market or the desire to preserve the existing U.S. market were the most frequently cited reasons for new investment in the U.S., factor analysis reveals that these reasons merely reinforce the primary motive: namely, the desire to benefit from a higher level of U.S. technology and innovation.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "Small stocks are widely believed to provide higher rates of return than larger-capitalization stocks. But early research into small-stock returns failed to consider certain economic aspects of small-stock investing--namely, the extra risk and additional illiquidity associated with small stocks. These may very well explain the mysterious return to smallness. Adjusting the returns on a broad universe of equity portfolios for risk and transaction costs gives a more realistic picture of the returns actually available to small-stock portfolios. While adjustment for risk significantly reduces the raw total returns to small-stock portfolios, transaction costs do the most damage. This result is a function, not only of the higher cost of trading smaller, less liquid stocks, but of the turnover required. Turnover rates increase systematically as portfolio market capitalization decreases and as rebalancing frequency increases. For all but the very smallest decile of market capitalization, a strategy of rebalancing every six months results in zero or negative excess returns. The actual returns available to practicable small-stock portfolios are much smaller than those documented in previous studies and apparently expected in practice.\n      </p>", "When a government cannot commit to future policies, investors face the risk of opportunistic behavior in addition to uncertain market conditions. We show that although reducing market uncertainty is sometimes essential for investment, it may aggravate problems of opportunism. The better informed the investor is before investing, the more information the government can infer from observing that investment takes place, in turn enabling more efficient rent extraction. This signaling effect can dominate; if the investor receives \"too accurate\" information before investing, the only equilibrium is the one in which no investment occurs.\n      </p>", "There are certain regulatory and fiscal issues facing investors in the emerging NPA business.

This Article proposes modifying three recent developments in materiality doctrine to take into account moody investing.

This Article also recommends modifying the judicial \"total mix\" analysis of the materiality of information to include a \"total affect\" analysis of information.

To link these, we developed a classroom simulation in which groups of students roll dice that simulate the success of three incestments.

As the simulation proceeds, some groups have great success with this last investment\u2014they become the \"Warren Buffetts\" of the class, accumulating far greater wealth than their classmates. For most groups, however, this last incestment leads to ruin because of its volatility, the variance in its returns. The marked difference in outcomes surprises students who discover how hard it is to separate luck from skill. The simulation also demonstrates how portfolios, weighted combinations of investments, reduce the variace. Students discover that a mixture of two poor investments emerges as a surprising performer. After this experience, our students immediately associate financial volatility with variance. This lesson also introduces students to the history of the stock market in the U.S. We calibrated the returns on two simulated investments to mimic returns on U.S. Treasury Bills and stocks.\n      </p>", "Most studies into the performance of socially responsible investment vehicles have focused on the performance of sustainable or socially responsible mutual funds.

Importantly, RTQ scores were positively correlated with the riskiness of respondents' actual investment portfolios, meaning that investors with high risk-tolerance score tend to have higher-risk portfolios.

Yet whether there is an economic return to the taxpayer for investing in educational justice is often not considered. It is possible that the economic benefits of reducing inadequate education exceed the costs, returning a healthy dividend to the taxpayer. This article addresses a four-decade quest to ascertain the fiscal consequences of investing in effective approaches to reduce inadequate education in the United States. It uses economic analysis to calculate both the costs of effective strategies to raise high school graduation rates and their benefits to the taxpayer in higher tax revenues and reduced costs of criminal justice, public health, and public assistance. The results suggest that improving educational justice provides substantial returns to taxpayers that exceed the costs.\n      </p>", "This paper uses elementary mathematics to obtain a formula that is applicable to a wide variety of financial planning problems for which inflation should be considered.

This article goes beyond the popular view to examine where the real action typically occurs-in the Dialogue process where corporations and shareholder activist groups mutually agree to ongoing communications to deal with a serious social issue. Use of the capitalized word \"Dialogue\" is intended to distinguish this formal process between corporations and shareholders from all the other forms of dialogue or twoway communication exchanged between a corporation and its stakeholders. The phenomenon of Dialogue between a corporation and dissident shareholders has not been analyzed in the academic literature or in the popular press because it occurs behind the scenes and out of sight from media scrutiny. Yet this is where a great deal of social change initiated by shareholder activists is negotiated. This article contributes both theoretically and empirically to the study of Dialogues between shareholder activists and corporations.

The primary method employed is to examine early books on investing published in the U. S. Early authors described stock market operations including manipulations of security prices by the bulls and the bears. Their solution to this manipulation was to educate investors and provide company information, mostly through directories and manuals. This study shows that financial and other information was thought by the authors to be critically important at the time that the securities markets were first called upon to provide capital to the railroad industry, the first modern business in America.\n      </p>", "Investors earn positive excess returns on high interest rate foreign discount bonds, because these currencies appreciate on average. Lustig and Verdelhan (2005) show that investing in high interest rate foreign discount bonds exposes them to more aggregate consumption risk, while low interest rate foreign bonds provide a hedge. This paper provides a simple model that replicates these facts. Investing in foreign currency is like betting on the difference between your own intertemporal marginal rate of substitution (IMRS) and your neighbor's IMRS. These bets are very risky if your neighbor's IMRS is not correlated with yours, but they provide a hedge when his IMRS is highly correlated and more volatile. If the foreign neighbors that face low interest rates also have more volatile and correlated IMRS, that accounts for the spread in excess returns in the data.\n      </p>", "This paper tests whether the pattern of related and unrelated acquisitions is consistent with the existence of cost disadvantages to cross-border investing. Data from the U.S. chemical industry (1978-89) are consistent with the implication that foreign investors are more likely than domestic investors to make closely related acquisitions. The data also indicate that U.S. FTC antitrust policy affected the pattern of domestic acquisitions.\n      </p>", "The authors analyse the performance of an art investment by applying a price index based on auction house prices. They examine the evolution of one segment of the art market -Surrealist paintings -and compare it with the risk-return profile of alternative asset classes. They find that the prices of Surrealist paintings not only increased more than inflation during the period 1990-2006 but were higher than the return on more traditional asset classes such as (large-cap) stocks and bonds. On a risk-return adjusted basis, investing in specific segments of the art market proves to be similar to investing in small-cap stocks and real estate. Investing in a highly specialized art movement may thus yield more attractive returns than is suggested in the literature. The authors conclude that a policy of selecting an appropriate art movement could provide interesting returns for investors and enhance their portfolio diversification. Les auteurs analysent le rendement d'un investissement dans les arts en appliquant un indice de prix bas\u00e9 sur les prix des maisons de vente aux ench\u00e8res. Ils \u00e9tudient l'\u00e9volution d'un segment du march\u00e9 des arts, la peinture surr\u00e9aliste, et la comparent au profil risque-rendement d'autres cat\u00e9gories d'actifs. Ils d\u00e9couvrent que les prix des \u0153uvres surr\u00e9alistes non seulement ont augment\u00e9 plus que l'inflation durant la p\u00e9riode 1990-2006, mais ont \u00e9t\u00e9 sup\u00e9rieurs au rendement de cat\u00e9gories d'actifs plus classiques comme les titres (\u00e0 forte capitalisation) et les obligations. Sur une base risque-rendement ajust\u00e9e, investir dans des segments pr\u00e9cis du march\u00e9 de l'art s'av\u00e8re semblable \u00e0 un investissement dans des titres \u00e0 petite capitalisation ou dans l'immobilier. Investir dans un mouvement artistique hautement sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 peut ainsi fournir un rendement plus attrayant que ce que le laisse croire la litt\u00e9rature. Les auteurs concluent qu'une politique de s\u00e9lection d'un mouvement artistique appropri\u00e9 pourrait offrir aux investisseurs des rendements int\u00e9ressants et favoriser la diversification de leur portefeuille. Los autores analizan el rendimiento de la inversi\u00f3n en las artes aplicando el \u00edndice de predos de las casas de subastas y llevando a cabo un estudio de la evolud\u00f3n de un segmento del mercado del arte, en este caso el de la pintura surrealista, y una comparaci\u00f3n con el perfil riesgo-retorno de otras clases de activos. Se observa como resultado que los predos de los cuadros surrealistas no solo aumentaron m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la tasa de inflad\u00f3n durante el periodo de 1990 a 2006, sino que se posidonaron por endma del retorno de categor\u00edas de activos m\u00e1s tradidonales como las acdones de gran capitalizaci\u00f3n y las obligadones.

This results in a penalty for foreign investors who buy and hold German dividend-paying stocks. I document that, as a result of the credit, the ex-day drop exceeds the dividend by more than one-half of the tax credit, and show that futures and option prices embed more than one-half of the tax credit. The existence of the credit creates opportunities for cross-border tax arbitrage-in which foreign holders of German stock transfer the dividend to German shareholders-and implies that it is tax efficient for foreign investors to hold derivatives rather than investing directly in German stocks. The empirical findings are consistent with costly tax arbitrage activity by German investors, who face tax risk due to antiarbitrage rules. Since dividend tax credits exist in many other countries, the findings are potentially of broad interest.\n      </p>", "Virtual communities are a significant source of information for consumers and businesses. This research examines how users value virtual communities and how virtual communities differ in their value propositions. In particular, this research examines the nature of trade-offs between information quantity and quality, and explores the sources of positive and negative externalities in virtual communities. The analyses are based on more than 500,000 postings collected from three large virtual investing-related communities (VICs) for 14 different stocks over a period of four years. The findings suggest that the VICs engage in differentiated competition as they face trade-offs between information quantity and quality. This differentiation among VICs, in turn, attracts users with different characteristics. We find both positive and negative externalities at work in virtual communities. We propose and validate that the key factor that determines the direction of network externalities is posting quality. The contributions of the study include the extension of our understanding of the virtual community evaluation by users, the exposition of competition between virtual communities, the role of network externalities in virtual communities, and the development of an algorithmic methodology to evaluate the quality (noise or signal) of textual data. The insights from the study provide useful guidance for design and management of VICs.\n      </p>", "Are there any long standing benefits in international equity investing? Did the acceleration of global financial integration bring clearly measurable benefits to international equity investors? Is there a convergence of equity market profitability around the world? These are the main questions of this paper. All of these questions got an affirmative answer, but, as it may be immediately suspected, many durable qualifiers and caveats apply. Section 1 reviews some key propositions of modern investment theory and some recent evidence on the benefits of international asset allocation on equity markets. It is argued that the desired benefits -as predicted by theory -can be and have been captured in terms of better risk/return trade-offs due to international diversification of equity portfolios. Manifest benefits aside, however, many dampening factors come into play when considering long term capacities of realising these benefits. Mainly the changing correlation structure of global markets and the increased currency risk, which still remained very difficult to hedge, were identified as permanent factors to limit the power of international diversification in pushing out the efficient frontier of the equity set. Section 2 presents comparative evidence on global equity markets' performance and gives an account of the wide variations in the US dollar denominated returns of major markets, developed and emerging. There is some support to the view that a certain convergence can be depicted in the profitability levels of different markets. Exchange rate movements, however, accounted for almost one third of variations in profitability on average. As of April 2007, stock market valuations did favour emerging markets (and to some extent EU-27) when compared to Japan or the US.\n      </p>", "Ce texte compare les diff\u00e9rentes strat\u00e9gies de gestion et d'investissement des revenus li\u00e9s aux ressources naturelles en Alberta et en Alaska pendant la fin des ann\u00e9es 70 et les ann\u00e9es 80.

The paper not only examines the origins, objectives, organization and management of the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund and the Alaska Permanent Fund, it also compares the performance of each between 1976 and 1989 and assesses their respective limitations. It pays particular attention to those political, ideological, and economic determinants that have shaped the respective development and use of these two instruments of public policy.\n      </p>", "The solution offered in this book (reviewed together with Complexity, Risk, and Financial Markets) to the problem of complex and uncertain markets is to pursue interdisciplinary knowledge and creativity.

The empirical basis underlying the arguments of the article is provided by investor manuals, newspaper reports, advice brochures, stock price lists, financial charts, and novels from the period. The analysis focuses on the instruments and processes making possible a financial knowledge that could be legitimately acquired and utilized by separate, unrelated, individual actors dispersed over the territory. The core argument is that this knowledge should be understood as an integrative social practice-that is, as a nexus of legitimating discourses, rules, skills, and cognitive instruments that transformed financial investing into a socially desirable activity. At the same time, they generated forms of financial knowledge that were no longer embedded in local conditions, but could be transported across various contexts. The dominant modes of evaluating financial securities include the new instruments of balance sheet analysis, problem solving, and charts. In this integrative nexus of discourses and cognitive instruments, financial activities became first and foremost an object of knowledge. The investor's social and personal responsibilities became dependent upon his financial knowledge. This stance, together with the social desirability of financial investing and with the cognitive instruments provided to individual, dispersed actors, constitutes the ground for the expansion of financial investing.\n      </p>"], "words": {"desirable": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "results": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "existing": {"number": 1, "prob":
