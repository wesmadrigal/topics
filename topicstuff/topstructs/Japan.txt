It is not clear which model it will follow: the European, American or its own model. Through the analysis of the historical roots of SRI, the key actors and motivations that have contributed to its diffusion, the paper provides explorative grounds to sketch the translation mechanisms of SRI in Japan and offers insight into its future path. Based on primary and secondary sources of information, the paper shwos that although SRI in Japan holds some similarities with the U.S. and especially with the European model, it remains unique. It highlights the importance of translation and reinterpretation in adopting a practice in a new context. SRI in Japan is still in a dynamic construction process. Although we expect it to develop further, it is difficult to depict its future shape and form.\n      </p>", "Dictyostelid slime molds were isolated from forest soils of the three main islands of Japan, Honshu, Shikoku and Hokkaido. Twenty-six species were recovered, including three undescribed. Dictyostelid species richness in Japan is twice that found in Ohio or Europe while it is comparable to that of eastern North America from Key Largo, Florida to Maine. This relatively high species richness is believed to be due to a number of factors: 1) moist climate of considerable temperature range; 2) protective insular environment; 3) maintenance of much of the mountainous interior of Japan in forest; and 4) preservation of original forest remnants throughout the islands. Distribution of dictyostelid species in Hokkaido and northeastern United States is similar and has elements in common with the distribution of herbaceous and woody plant species in these regions. When the four studied temperate forest areas (eastern North America, western Himalaya Mountains of India, Europe, Japan) are compared, Japan and eastern North America are most alike in terms of dictyostelid species shared in common, but all studied areas have some species in common as well as one or more endemics.\n      </p>", "The eutrophication of Lake Biwa, the most important water resource in Japan, has focused national and international attention on the need for integrated land and water management within the context of the Catchment Ecosystem. An exceptional rate of economic growth since 1954 coupled with a lack of awareness of the relationships between human activities and water quality led to the rapid pollution of the lake. The control of industrial point-sources of pollution failed to reduce the pollution loads of nitrogen and phosphorus entering the lake which were found to be dominated by domestic effluents. These latter represent quasi non-point sources and in a country where sewage treatment facilities are sparse, water management has developed through active public cooperation. River loadings have been controlled by a set of well co-ordinated activities influencing industrial location, modes of production and life-style, and including water treatment measures, land use controls and environmental education. However, once established, the recycling of nutrients within a lake can cause management problems for tens of years and for integrated river basin management to be effective an anticipatory approach must be developed.\n      </p>", "During the past 15 years Japan has experienced unprecedented, high unemployment rates and low (often negative) inflation rates.

Many of these resources could be obtained from currently unutilized or waste portions of other products. Important sources of biomass include woodlands, native grasslands, wastelands, and farms. Although much biomass is seasonal and difficult to handle, continued technological advances may allow utilization while at the same time improving the environment. /// Le Japon, un petit pays montagneux ayant peu de r\u00e9serves \u00e9nerg\u00e9tiques, a des resources de biomasse vari\u00e9es qui pourraient \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es comme source d'\u00e9nergie.

The strong, positive linear relationship between platform gradient and tidal range implies that platform width may be largely independent of tidal range, although regional negative correlations between platform gradient and width suggest that platforms become narrower with increasing tidal range.Platform width increases with wave intensity, and the widest platforms are oriented toward the dominant waves. The width of the platforms also decreases with increasing rock dip. A structural classification, based upon combinations of rock dip and strike, relative to the orientation of the cliff face, helped to explain variations in platform width in Canada and Japan. Changes in structural class induced by variations in coastal orientation may partially account for differences in the width of platforms on headlands and in embayments. Platform width is also influenced by the presence and type of cliff-foot deposits.\n      </p>", "We investigated the denning ecology of 19 (12 males and 7 females) radiocollared Asiatic black bears (Ursus thibetanus) from 2001 to 2004 in the Misaka Mountains, central Japan. We approached 14 dens of 5 females on foot. Thirteen dens were located in cavities that formed between the roots of trees growing on the upper edges of landslides or steep inclines, and 1 den was located in a cavity under a rocky ledge. We were unable to access 39 more dens for which we had approximate locations due to a combination of distance from roads, steep terrain, and high shrub densities. All 53 dens we approached or approximately located were on steep slopes. There were few large trees with large cavities in the study area, which may explain why we failed to find any dens in such cavities.\n      </p>", "Background: The expected ratio of male to female births is generally believed to be 1.05, also described as the male proportion of 0.515. Objectives: We describe trends in sex ratio at birth and in fetal deaths in the United States, in African Americans and in whites, and in Japan, two industrial countries with well-characterized health data infrastructures, and we speculate about possible explanations. Methods: Public health records from national statistical agencies were assembled to create information on sex ratio at birth and in fetal deaths in the United States (1970-2002) and Japan (1970-1999), using SPSS. Results: Sex ratio at birth has declined significantly in Japan and in U.S. whites, but not for African Americans, for whom sex ratio remains significantly lower than that of whites. The male proportion of fetal death has increased overall in Japan and in the United States. Conclusions: Sex ratio declines are equivalent to a shift from male to female births of 135,000 white males in the United States and 127,000 males in Japan. Known and hypothesized risk factors for reduced sex ratio at birth and in fetal deaths cannot account fully for recent trends or racial or national differences. Whether avoidable environmental or other factors-such as widespread exposure to metalloestrogens or other known or suspected endocrine-disrupting materials, changes in parental age, obesity, assisted reproduction, or nutrition-may account for some of these patterns is a matter that merits serious concern.\n      </p>", "This article investigates whether women are, as many claim, \"moralists\"-that is, moral and ethical standard-setters who seek clean politics and have strict standards for public officials. An analysis of data from the 1996 Japanese Elections and Democracy Study survey and from 18 focus groups conducted in 1996 indicates that women in Japan are not moralists. As elsewhere, there is a gender gap in Japan on \"issue preference sets,\" with women favoring a \"care\" agenda, but women assign political ethics less importance than do men, even though women are more likely to see adverse effects from political corruption. Studying people's judgments of four ethics scenarios reveals minimal gender gaps; controlling for education and age, women's judgments overall are less, not more, strict than men's. Among women, age is a better predictor of moralism than education; older women are stricter than younger women on political ethics. This is attributed to gender-based differences in moral reasoning: Japanese women and men both rely heavily on a \"relation-based\" frame (which is situation-specific and requires extensive social information), but gender stratification patterns create information inequalities. Younger women lack social information necessary for judging political misconduct, whereas older women overcome the information deficit through life experience.\n      </p>", "End-stage renal disease (ESRD) affects 230,000 Japanese, with about 36,000 cases diagnosed each year. Recent increases in ESRD incidence are attributed mainly to increases in diabetes and a rapidly aging population. Renal transplantation is rare in Japan. In private dialysis clinics, the majority of treatment costs are paid as fixed fees per session and the rest are fee for service. Payments for hospital-based dialysis are either fee-for-service or diagnosis-related. Dialysis is widely available, but reimbursement rates have recently been reduced. Clinical outcomes of dialysis are better in Japan than in other countries, but this may change given recent ESRD cost containment policies.\n      </p>", "Aim The aim of the present study is the distribution analysis of species richness of ichthyofauna at the east and west coasts of the Japan Sea for the purpose of identification of natural biogeographic boundaries, subsequent faunistic zoning and comparison between faunistic and bioclimatic (bio-oceanographic) zoning patterns. Location Japan Sea (Korean-East Sea). Methods All statistical procedures are based on well-tried and widely accepted numerical methodology and the STATISTICA program package. For identifying the statistically meaningful (non-random) maxima and minima in species richness, arithmetical differences in the number of species at ith and i + 1st latitudes are calculated, also trend residuals obtained by smoothing the moving average by three points and residuals in polynomial trends are analysed. Subsequent clustering of species lists for separate biogeographical units marked by local maxima and minima in species richness permits to identify the extent of mutual correspondence between the units and to make an outline for faunistic zoning. Similarity degree of faunistic lists was estimated in terms of Czekanowski-S\u00f6rensen coefficient. Results Quantitative analysis of latitudinal distribution of species richness (1130 species) of the Japan Sea ichthyofauna is indicative of the position of the following 10 local maxima and minima: at 35, 40, 43, 47, 49 and 51\u26ac N on the west coast and at 36, 39, 43 and 46\u26acN on the east coast. In most cases local minima of the polynomial trend residuals are coincident with southern boundaries of faunistic units while local maxima with northern boundaries. Separated analysis of qualitative composition of ichthyofauna of the west and east coasts of the Japan Sea discloses 11 areas of the greatest faunistic similarity. Main conclusions The latitudinal variations in the species richness near both sea coasts represent an alternation between relatively flattened smooth portions (cach 1 unit long) and sufficiently steep jumps between them. Regular interchange between local minima and maxima of species richness is accountable to spatial non-uniformity of hydrological structure resulting from alternation of variously directed and differently heated (warm and cold) circulations of waters and frontal zones. It is notable that faunistic zoning does not initially require any exact knowledge of biotic taxonomic composition and may be produced only from the variation pattern of the species richness under study. The suggested faunistic zoning scheme distinguishes the following provinces: South Korea, East Korea, South Primorie, North Primorie, Northern Japan Sea, Middle Honshu, Uetsu, Tsugaru, Soya and West Sakhalin. The comparison between faunistic units and distribution of temperature parameters and currents permits identification of subarctic, cold-temperate, mild-temperate and warm-temperate bioclimatic zones existing in the Japan Sea.\n      </p>", "Objective: To document the effect of the liberalisation of the Japanese tobacco market on Japanese smoking rates and on Japanese tobaceo industry practices. Data source: Asahi Shimbun (major daily newspaper) from 1980 to 1996. Study selection: Review of media coverage on the effects of market liberalisation following the imposition of the USA's section 301 trade sanction. Data synthesis: The opening of Japan's tobacco market to foreign cigarette companies stalled a decline in smoking prevalence. Smoking rates among young women increased significantly, and also appear to be on the rise among adolescents. Aggressive marketing and promotional activities by US and Japanese tobacco companies in response to trade liberalisation appear responsible for these adverse trends. Steep increases in sales through vending machines were also possible contributors to the rising smoking prevalence among adolescents. On the positive side, market liberalisation indirectly promoted smoking control efforts in Japan, by causing an anti-smoking movement to coalesce. Conclusion: Market liberalisation in Japan played a significant role in increasing smoking prevalence among young women and adolescents while helping to transform the issue of smoking in Japan from a matter of individual choice to a public health problem.\n      </p>", "Using starch gel electrophoresis, allozyme variation was studied in 332 individuals collected from 19 populations of the Japanese newt, Cynops pyrrhogaster, from eastern Japan. The populations were roughly divided into northern and southern units, which corresponded to previously named local races, the Tohoku and Kanto races. Abrupt shifts in electromorph frequencies were observed at a locus in the boundaries of these two races. Substantial differentiation also occurred within each local race, and the genetic variability was greater in the Kanto race than in the Tohoku race.\n      </p>", "Semiconductor manufacturing is one of the most successful of the high-technology industries of Japan-industries which have registered exceptionally rapid growth rates during the last fifteen years. It has often been assumed that high-technology industries tend to choose provincial and peripheral locations and until recently, the evidence has shown that Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have indeed opted for locations in outer regions of the country. For various reasons to do with transport and communications, land availability, local government policy and labour supply, the southernmost island of Kyushu has emerged as a major regional concentration of memory chip assembly. But, research and development in the industry has always remained firmly centred in the capital region and current trends in automation and in production generally, seem to indicate that locations in the metropolitan prefectures will become more attractive from the viewpoint of firms seeking new sites for factory development. Meanwhile, changes in the yen-dollar exchange rate, together with pressures arising from trade friction between Japan and the United States, are conspiring to persuade many of Japan's semiconductor manufacturers to give priority to the expansion of production at locations overseas.\n      </p>", "To manage brown bear (Ursus arctos yesoensis) populations, it is necessary to monitor harvest and evaluate sex and age characteristics of harvested bears. I investigated characteristics of an indiscriminate brown bear harvest in the Oshima Peninsula, Hokkaido, Japan, by interviewing hunters and determining the sex and age of bears killed from 1983 through 1987. Harvest structure differed by seasons and methods. Females with cubs were killed during den hunts 10 times more often (P &lt; 0.001) than during postemergence hunts in spring (Jan-May). A higher (P = 0.028) ratio of males (excluding young bears) was taken in traps when compared with those pursued and shot in summer and autumn (Jun-Dec). There were reproductive, status-related differences in the proportions of adult females taken in spring harvest and those taken in summer and autumn harvests. During spring, the proportion of females with cubs was lower (P = 0.043), whereas the proportion of females with yearlings was higher (P &lt; 0.001) than during summer and autumn. Den hunting should be prohibited to protect females with cubs.\n      </p>", "This paper analyzes gendered social identity in Japan and the United States, countries with comparable postindustrial economic systems but distinct cultural traditions. Using national surveys (1995), we find gender differences in value orientations to be neither systematic nor consistent. They often disappeared after controlling for demographic and human-capital variables, though not so often for Japan. Other variables proved more important predictors of values than gender, although in different ways in Japan and the United States. We conclude by reassessing the use of the term gender in social research and the cultural meaning of gender relations by addressing the feminist concerns with issues of gender location.\n      </p>", "Objective: To estimate the prevalence of smoking and the attitudes towards the restriction of smoking at work among female nurses in the national hospitals in Japan. Design: Questionnaires mailed to 14 randomly selected national hospitals and sanitariums in Japan in 1993. Subjects: 2207 female nurses. Main outcome measures: Smoking status and history, and attitudes towards the restriction of smoking at work. Results: The prevalence of smoking among female nurses was 18.6%, which was higher than the age-adjusted prevalence of the general female population using this study's subjects as a standardised population. Banning smoking in the hospital in which they worked was supported by 15.0%, whereas 81.6% supported the restriction of smoking. Conclusions: The results showed that smoking is more common among female nurses than among the general female adult population. The survey suggested that nurses favour restriction, but not banning, of smoking.\n      </p>", "The destruction of Japan's cyclotrons by Occupation Forces after the Pacific War resulted in a major setback for experimental physics in that country. Key figures such as Yoshio Nishina, Sin-itir\u00f4 Tomonaga, and Ry\u00f4kichi Sagane strived to help Japan rebuild its scientific infrastructure and regain some of its former eminence in the field, but in the wake of the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the atom had new meaning. Local residents objected to the establishment of the Institute for Nuclear Study in Tanashi, Tokyo. Despite their protests, construction went ahead and the Institute of Nuclear Study (INS) opened in 1955. Within a few years, physicists sought to establish a second major accelerator facility. Sectionalism among physicists and shortage of funds plagued attempts to establish the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics (KEK) which eventually came into being in 1970. This paper reveals some of the problems that physicists faced and how they sought to overcome them within the context of a defeated Japan, wary of military research, and desperately seeking to rebuild its economy. Physicists sought to influence the direction of science policy and to deal with the concerns of citizens in a newly democratic Japan.\n      </p>", "The translation into bamboo, in Japan in 1940-1, of that most evocative of Modernist furniture designs of the 1920s, the tubular steel \"chaise-longue\" designed by Le Corbusier, Charlotte Perriand and Pierre Jeanneret, has long presented an enigma. This article explores both the larger background to, and the immediate circumstances of, this transformation. It also considers the legacies of Japanese craft production initiatives in the inter-war years to the development of Japanese industrial design in the early post-war years, and of Charlotte Perriand's experience of Japan to her post-war work.\n      </p>", "Japan has been experiencing a continuing decline in fertility and an increase in premarital conceptions and abortions among young people. Child rearing is often viewed as a burden. In response, Japan is now seeking ways to improve the child-rearing environment for parents. In this context, we conducted a prospective study among 206 pregnant women in Sukagawa City, Fukushima, to explore the influences of pregnancy intention on child rearing. We found that unintended pregnancy was associated with a higher risk of negative child-rearing outcomes, including lower mother-to-child attachment, increased negative feelings of mothers and a lower level of participation of fathers in child rearing. Unintended pregnancy exacerbates the real and perceived burdens of child rearing. Japan is currently facing a conflict between wanting to reduce unintended pregnancies and increase the national fertility rate. We believe the government needs to address the social challenges affecting people's family lives, which underpin low fertility, rather than focus on fertility decline per se. We suggest Japan seeks to reduce unintended pregnancies and provide support to parents at high risk of child-rearing difficulties. We also suggest adopting a comprehensive approach to improving the lives of young couples, with a focus on adolescents, including life-skills education to prepare for adulthood, marriage and parenthood. /// Le Japon a enregistr\u00e9 une baisse suivie de la f\u00e9condit\u00e9 et une augmentation des conceptions pr\u00e9maritales et des avortements chez les jeunes.

Population ageing, combined with the fact that disability is most common among the elderly, has focused attention on trends in old-age disability. This study estimates trends in functioning and disability among Japanese elderly from 1993 to 2002 and contracts the patterns with those found in the USA. Japan is an especially interesting country because its age structure is relatively old, and it currently has the highest life expectancy in the world despite the fact that just 50 years ago its life expectancy was in the bottom half of all countries. As in the USA, disability rates have fallen. If it were not for the gains in disability between 1993 and 2002, there would have been 1.1 million more disabled elderly in 2002.

Every night the foxes covered 29% of their ranges, moving about 6 km. Foxes spent from 18 to 50% of their activity time around houses, moving quickly from one village to another. A few scats collected in the area revealed that &gt;50% of the diet is of human origin. The range overlap was substantial, both among females (as reported for urban foxes) and among males (not previously reported). The distribution of food scraps is therefore a likely factor influencing the ranging behavior of foxes not only in urban environments, but also in rural areas.\n      </p>", "In Japan, levels of predation by Asiatic black bears (Ursus thibetanus) remain great despite the killing of over 1,000 nuisance bears annually. Alternatives to lethal control of nuisance bears are needed. We examined the usefulness of Gallagher electric fences to reduce depredation by bears in Nagano prefecture, central Japan. We established 26 electric fences around crops and apiaries during 1997 and 1998. No bear successfully raided a fenced area during the study period. We recorded evidence of a bear walking up to an electric fence on 7 occasions and bear activity in the vicinity of an electric fence on 16 occasions. Electric fences used with other techniques-such as planting crops that are not attractive to bears in fields adjacent to forests, aversive conditioning, lethal control of particular nuisance animals, protecting remaining broadleaf forest stands, and reconverting monospecific tree plantations to broadleaf forests-may reduce levels of bear depredation in Japan.\n      </p>", "I investigated the number of embryos, corpora lutea, and placental scars in Sorex unguiculatus from Hokkaido, Japan, and reported supplemental data on reproduction in S. caecutiens and S. gracillimus.

Using medium resolution satelite imagery, acquired over an industrial mountain area near the city of Naeba, in the central part of Honshu, Japan, this study attempts to characterize forest cover types situated in an area affected by prolonged anthropogenic land use and land cover change (LUCC) processes. The image was topographically corrected, and training sites selected and assessed for their spectral separability between forest classes. Using the ground truthed training sites and a supervised spectral angle mapper (SAM) classifier, dominant forest cover types were classified. Post-classification forest cover classification accuracies range between 77-89%. Results highlight how an assessment of the spectral separability of forest cover types prior to image classification, combined with ground validation that focuses on documenting and noting areas affected by human modifications to the forest, can aid in refining the forest classification training areas, which in turn can lead to improved image classification accuracies. Through refinement of the training areas used in the classification via ground truthing, it is possible to account for localized land use and land cover disturbances (ie forest harvesting, thinning) that create non-representative training areas. It is then possible to select additional training areas that are more representative of a forest spectral class and not a localized anomaly created via human disturbance.\n      </p>", "Aim The aim of the present study is the analysis of the latitudinal distribution of taxonomic richness (number of genera and families) of ichthyofauna at the western and eastern coasts of the Japan Sea for the purpose of identification of natural boundaries, and subsequent comparison with results obtained using the distribution analysis of species richness. Location Japan Sea (Korean - East Sea). Methods All statistical procedures were based on well-tried and widely accepted numerical methodology and the STATISTICA program package. For identifying the statistically meaningful (non-random) maxima and minima in taxonomic richness (n), arithmetic differences in the number of taxa at ith and i - 1th geographical latitudes and the measurements of $D=(\\sqrt{n_{i}}-\\sqrt{n_{i-1}})^{2}$ , as well as residuals in polynomial trends and clustering (Ward's method) of genera and family lists, were analysed. The relationship between the number and the scope of taxa was approximated by Zipf-Pareto-Mandelbrot frequency distribution: p(N)=k/N1+k, where p(N) is a relative number of taxa, each of them includes N taxa of the next lower rank; k is a constant. The determination of the constant was made by a nonlinear estimation procedure using quasi-Newton algorithms approximating the second-order derivatives of the loss function to guide the search for estimation of the minimum/best parameter estimates. Results The comparison between all the types of analysis gives similar results and the boundaries of faunistic units identified from taxonomic lists of species, genera and families are practically coincident at herein accepted regional biogeographical scaling. The relation between the number and the scope of taxa is approximated satisfactorily by Zipf-Pareto-Mandelbrot model. Main conclusions The differences obtained by other authors in the results of zoning by species, genera and family lists are largely pre-determined by commonly used quantitative analytical methods: theoretical-and-graph methods and clustering procedures. The distribution analysis of species and superspecific taxa gives closely approaching results for relatively high latitudes and sharply diverging results for relatively low latitudes. The Zipf-Pareto-Mandelbrot distribution describing the relation between the number and the scope of taxa uniquely pre-supposes definite quantitative relationships between various rank taxa. So, the predicted species number S may be calculated on observed genera number G. If the values of species/genus ratios (S/G) are tabulated for various G, it turns out that the relationship S/G shows an almost linear variation (between 1.78 and 2.50) in the interval between twenty and 1000 species, abruptly rising with further increase in the length of species list. Therefore, the S/G ratios widely used and considered important by various ecological and biogeographical concepts are a statistical artefact.

Modern Japan was the first major industrial economy to emerge from outside the Western tradition. Economically devastated in 1945, by 1990 Japan had the world's second largest economy and a GDP per head 20 percent greater than that of the United States. In this paper it is argued that one reason for Japan's success is that the costs of achieving cooperation and specialization are lower in Japan than in the West. Cooperation and specialization have been acknowledged to have a beneficial impact upon productivity ever since Adam Smith wrote about cooperative specialization in the context of the division of labor. Modern economic theory, however, suggest that in a world of self-interested individuals the costs of achieving cooperation and specialization are substantial. In this paper it is argued that the cultural value system that Japan has inherited from its preindustrial past, and particularly the Tokugawa period, helps facilitate cooperation between individuals and encourages them to undertake productivity-enhancing investments in specialization. This lowers the costs of achieving cooperative specialization. In turn, the lower costs of achieving cooperative specialization have helped Japanese enterprises adopt practices such as self-managing work teams and long-term supplier relations that are consistent with obtaining a productivity-based competitive advantage in the world economy.\n      </p>", "We examined the stomach contents of 87 finless porpoises (Neophocaena phocaenoides) in the Ariake Sound-Tachibana Bay area and Omura Bay in western Kyushu, Japan, between 1987 and 1992. Fish (Gobiidae and Atherinidae) were the most numerous and most frequently occurring prey in Omura Bay, whereas both cephalopods (Octopodidae, Sepiidae, Sepiolidae/Sepiidae, and Loliginidae) and fishes (Clupeidae, Engraulidae, and Sciaenidae) were equally important in Ariake Sound-Tachibana Bay. Species compositions in the commercial catch differed between the 2 waters, suggesting that differences in prey availability may explain the geographical variation in diet. Finless porpoises in Ariake Sound-Tachibana Bay showed ontogenetic and seasonal variations in diet. The mean length at weaning was estimated to be 101 cm, corresponding to approximately 6 months of age. Calves fed on small-sized demersal fish and cephalopods. The predominant prey species for sexually mature individuals (including lactating females) consisted of konoshiro gizzard shad (Konosirus punctatus) and cephalopods. Seasonal availability of these organisms may be related to births in the fall-winter season in Ariake Sound-Tachibana Bay. Size-dependent prey selectivity was equivocal. Day-night difference in foraging time was not indicated by the index of stomach fullness.\n      </p>", "In the latter half of the twentieth century, developed countries of the world have made tremendous strides in organ donation and transplantation. However, in this area of medicine, Japan has been slow to follow. Japanese ethics, deeply rooted in religion and tradition, have affected their outlook on life and death. Because the Japanese have only recently started to acknowledge the concept of brain death, transplantation of major organs has been hindered in that country. Currently, there is a dual definition of death in Japan, intended to satisfy both sides of the issue. This interesting paradox, which still stands to be fully resolved, illustrates the contentious conflict between medical ethics and medical progress in Japan.\n      </p>", "Prime Minister Koizumi Junichiro stepped down in September 2006 after a five-year term in which he reshaped Japanese politics by undermining his own party's political machine, stretched the constraints on Japan's military role, and promoted a program of \u201cstructural\u201d economic reform.

Our objective was to determine if killing bears reduces depredation costs. We focused our study on Nagano Prefecture, where 2,562 nuisance bears were reported killed and where reported depredation cost exceeded \u00a51,430 million between 1979 and 1999. We used mixed models with repeated measures to determine if annual depredation costs were associated with the number of bears killed. Our data set included 15 years (1985-99) of kill and cost data for 122 municipal jurisdictions within 10 regions. We performed analyses at the regional level based on combined harvest and nuisance kill data, and at the municipal level based only on nuisance kill data. We classified the number of kills into 3 classes (low, medium, high). Analyses were repeated using prior-year kills to examine whether a possible time-lag existed. Annual depredation costs were positively associated with the kill data at the regional level (F = 5.51; 2, 72.3 df; P = 0.006) during the same year. However, we observed no association based on prior-year kill data (F = 0.96; 2, 65.1 df; P = 0.390), suggesting that depredation costs and bear kills are a function of nuisance bear numbers rather than reflecting a causal relationship between the 2 measures. Nuisance bear numbers may in turn be affected either by the availability of natural foods or by general population trends. At the municipal level, depredation costs were not associated with the number of nuisance bears killed during the same year (F = 1.36; 2, 466 df; P = 0.258) or the prior year (F = 0.42; 2, 459 df; P = 0.656). Our results suggest that systematically killing Asiatic bears may not be an effective tool for mitigating nuisance costs. In municipalities where nuisance costs remain high, we recommend that alternative methods be tested for their efficacy in mitigating costs. Such methods may include public education, changing or removing financial incentives to kill bears, changing crop rotations to crops that are not attractive to bears in risk areas, promoting natural food production, using electric fences, and applying aversive conditioning techniques.\n      </p>", "Platycrater arguta (Hydrangeaceae) is a small deciduous shrub of the Sino-Japanese floristic region, where it occurs in montane sites mostly covered with warm-temperate deciduous forest. This sole representative of its genus contains two varieties dijunctly distributed between East China (var. sinensis) and South Japan (var. arguta). To illuminate the biogeographic and demographic history of this rare species, we conducted a survey of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequence variation (trnD-trnE, trnH-psbA) within and among twelve populations (four from China, eight from Japan, 129 individuals in total) representing the overall distributional range of the species. Based on a total of 19 haplotypes identified, P. arguta was found to harbor surprisingly high levels of haplotype and nucleotide diversity (hT = 0.882; \u03c0T = 0.00475), possibly associated with its lon gevolutionary history. Spatial analysis of molecular variance found two regional phylogroups, corresponding to var. sinensis and var. arguta, and supported by genealogical (unrooted network) analysis of haplotypes. Using a coalescent-based model of 'divergence by isolation with migration', the likely vicariant origin of these varieties was dated to the mid-Pleistocene (ca. 0.89 mya). Very similar haplotype mismatch distributions indicate that var. sinensis and var. arguta underwent past demographic growth almost simultaneously (dated to ca. 0.43 and 0.45 mya, respectively), suggesting climate-induced expansion. However, var. sinensis likely experienced a mere demographic expansion in a narrowly circumscribed mountain rante, while var. arguta underwent a spatial northward expansion that might have consisted of a series of bottlenecks, leading to genetically impoverished populations that most likely derived from initial population(s) in southern Kyushu. Our results endorse the recognition of two 'evolutionarily significant units' within P. arguta, corresponding to var. sinensis from East China and var. arguta from South Japan.\n      </p>", "We used aerial surveys and line-transect methods to estimate the abundance of the finless porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides) in Omura Bay, Japan.

Cross-national comparisons highlight the similarity in relative mobility pattern between Japan and Western nations and at the same time the Japanese distinctiveness in absolute mobility rates especially regarding the demographic character of the Japanese manual working class. The results of cross-temporal comparisons of mobility pattern report some systematic trends in total mobility, inflow and outflow rates, reflecting the Japanese experience of late but rapid industrialization. The pattern of association between class origin and class destination, however, was stable in postwar Japan. It is therefore the combination of distinctive absolute mobility rates and similar relative mobility rates that characterizes the Japanese mobility pattern in comparison with the Western experience. Furthermore, Japan's distinctive pattern of postwar social mobility is characterized by a combination of rapidly changing absolute mobility rates and comparatively stable relative mobility rates.\n      </p>", "Theatre is an influential site where gender ideals and roles are produced and performed; a laboratory where they can be naturalized.

Cryptosporidium spp. was found only in a raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides), and Giardia spp. was detected in a mandarin duck (Aix galericulata) and two ruddy shelducks (Tadorna ferruginea). In this study, the prevalences of these parasites were found to be low. However, these results suggested that the infected animals could serve as a source of contamination for surface water.

We have taken up the task of summarising this tradition here so that some insight can be gained into the unique issues that characterise the practice of medicine in Japan. We borrow from the sayings of Tohkaku Wada, a medical philosopher of late eighteenth-century Japan, for a look at Japanese medical tradition. Wada's medical thought was very much reflective of the Buddhism, Zen, and swordsmanship that informed eighteenth-century philosophy in Japan. His central concepts were \"chu\" and \"sei\", that is, complete and selfless dedication to the patient and the practice of medicine.

The obstetrician's access to and control over specialized obstetrical technology reflect and legitimate his authoritative status. In Japan a prevailing cultural view of birth as a natural and healthy event places a value on using the least possible amount of obstetrical intervention in the birthing process. This results in the valuation of the potential, rather than the actual, application of obstetrical technology. In contemporary Japan midwives remain integral participants in maternity care and attend normal deliveries in the hospital setting. But because of the culturally depicted potential for pathology at the time of birth, the obstetrician--the birthing specialist who controls the more complex technological tools--is viewed as having greater authoritative knowledge than the midwife and the woman giving birth.\n      </p>", "The aim of this paper is to investigate the potential for entrepreneurship in Japan using the Employment Status Survey, which is the only government-administered survey that includes questions about the desire to become an entrepreneur. We find that there are still a number of potential entrepreneurs in Japan, despite a recent decline in the number of new firms being established. We also find that there is a large regional variation in the distribution of entrepreneurial potential, with clustering into a few regions and the level in Tokyo being exceptional. Further, using panel data on 47 prefectures from 1982 to 1997, we examine the determinants of entrepreneurial potential. The estimation results show that the price-cost margin, market size, market growth and the unemployment rate have positive effects on the potential for entrepreneurship.\n      </p>", "Downsizing and layoffs are an important mechanism for U.S. firms to cope with their strategic and economic environment. In contrast, the Japanese tradition of lifetime employment limits the ability of firms to employ layoffs as a strategic measure, relegating its use to conditions of financial distress. This paper provides the first comparison of layoffs in Japan and the United States and examines stock price reactions to layoff announcements in each country from 1990 to 1994. Agency theory and Aoki's cooperative game theory are employed to discuss differences in the governance structures of U.S. and Japanese firms and their implication for stock price reactions. Results show that layoff announcements trigger negative returns for both U.S. and Japanese firms. Specifically, layoff announcements of U.S. firms are associated with a negative 1.78 percent abnormal return, while layoff announcements for Japanese firms are associated with a negative 0.56 percent abnormal return. To better understand the impact of layoffs, this study examines the relationships between stock price reactions and various layoff characteristics (such as whether the layoff is proactive or reactive or whether the layoff is the first in the industry). Implications of the findings are discussed.\n      </p>", "Re-examination of the morphology and habitat of plants that have been classified as a variety of Scabiosa japonica, var. acutiloba H.

With a careful examination of the survey text, nevertheless, this study provides a completely opposite result. In other words, the average score of subjective well-being is significantly associated with the level of national income per capita. The study also finds that not only the level of national income per capita but also its growth rate is a significant explanatory variable. However, it is also suggested that a structural subsidence of subjective well-being occurred in the late 1990s, when many Japanese people lost confidence in their traditional economic system.\n      </p>", "In this article we analyze an annual live-fire exercise held by Japan's Self-Defense Forces for the general public. On the basis of our analysis, we suggest that anthropologists seriously examine the military establishments of technologically advanced societies. If anthropologists want to understand violent acts, we need to study the perpetrators of such acts and not only their victims. In most of the scholarly literature, violence is seen as anomalous and disruptive-as the reverse of social order. In contrast, we demonstrate how violence can also be understood as an object of fascination, enjoyment, and celebration. We show how the link between violence and the military is variously concealed, naturalized, or blurred in events such as the live-fire exercise.\n      </p>", "This paper examines the archaeology of salmon fishing in Japan, mostly during the Jomon period. The starting point is Sugao Yamanouchi's 'salmon/trout theory', which suggested that the greater density of Jomon sites in northeastern Japan could be linked to greater availability of dog salmon (Oncorynchus keta) and trout (O. masou) in this area. Many archaeologists disputed this theory on the grounds that bones of salmon were very rarely recovered during archaeological excavations. Fine sieving of deposits does, however, enable salmon bones to be recovered, as the author has demonstrated on many archaeological sites. The varying frequencies of salmon bones on different sites enables those sites to be classified into four types: A, producing complete vertebrae only; B, producing vertebral fragments; C, producing vertebral fragments, and cranial elements; and D, producing complete vertebrae and cranial elements. Differential preservation is argued not to be responsible; it is argued that different patterns of capture, processing, storage, transport and consumption have caused the pattern.\n      </p>", "The Business Ethics Index (BEI) was expanded in Japan.

All individuals except for a female were collected in 5 geographically discrete coastal waters where Japanese porpoises are mainly distributed: Sendai Bay-Tokyo Bay, Ise-Mikawa Bays, Inland Sea-Hibiki Nada, Omura Bay, and Ariake Sound-Tachibana Bay. We analyzed 345 base pairs of the control region for all animals and detected 10 haplotypes. Two of those were shared by animals from &gt; 1 area, whereas the other 8 were each found only in 1 area. The most common haplotype in Ise-Mikawa Bays and Ariake Sound-Tachibana Bay was not found at other locations. Analysis of the frequency distribution of haplotypes quantified genetic differentiation, and measurements of gene flow indicated limited dispersal of animals among locations. We conclude that finless porpoises in each of the 5 locations belong to distinct populations.\n      </p>", "This article examines the narratives of wartime victimhood and victimization in Japan's junior high school history textbooks in the early 1980s and in contemporary times from the perspective of national identity.

It also argues that contemporary narratives contest the notion of a monolithic Japanese identity and challenge Japan's monopoly over writing its own national history.\n      </p>", "In this article, I explore the appropriation of the notion of \"codependence\" in Japan, as alcoholism increasingly becomes a subject of social concern. Codependence is pathologized in the 1980's American popular psychology, which regards accommodation to social relationships as a compromise of the self. Yet, in Japan, the notion resonates with postwar national ideologies of the normal-that is, of Japanese society as held together through family-like intimacy and highly cultivated sensitivities to social demands. Japanese women who define themselves as codependent must forge a distinction (blurred by dominant cultural ideology) between socially valued interdependence and \"unhealthy\" or systematically exploitative forms of asymmetrical ties. Forging this distinction allows women to reject exploitative demands of society while continuing to function within familial and neighborhood communities. To the extent that women can forge distinctions between \"dependence\" and \"codependence,\" they may be better able to resist state and social demands that come at their expense.\n      </p>", "Challenging the normative practice of interment, scattering ashes emerged as a new ritual in Japan during the 1990s. Both sensational and controversial, the practice has met with cries of protest and enthusiastic support. As an expression of their respect and affection, people in Japan are expected to venerate the family dead at a family altar and a family grave. Because maintaining the grave evokes the cherished notion of filial piety, some regard scattering ashes as a threat to memorial tradition. But the bereaved who scatter their kin's ashes continue to memorialize their kin by selectively altering certain aspects of memorial activity. They create personally significant ways to honor their loved ones. Scattering ashes, characterized by innovation and flexibility, has increased the range of memorial practices in Japan.\n      </p>", "In the post-Cold War era, India and Japan have been moving closer.

We found that the species with higher synchronized flowering within a population had larger fluctuation of annual seed production at the population level. The coefficient of concordance of flowering and the coefficient of variation of annual seed production were continuously distributed among species, making it difficult to distinguish masting from nonmasting species. The annual seed production patterns of the 16 species were classified, by cluster analysis, into groups that synchronize their fluctuation of annual seed production. This analysis showed a highly synchronized annual seed production, not only among congeneric species, but also among species of different families. Although our results have some insufficiency of statistical significance, they did show that predator satiation, both in a population and a guild, effectively operated for many species to enhance seed survival at the pre-dispersal stage. They also showed that pollination efficiency was likely to be operating at the population level for half of the wind-pollinating species. However, generalist predator satiation at the postdispersal seed stage may not operate in a simple, detectable manner in this species-rich forest community. It is highly probable that there are combined effects of several factors: limited weather triggers for flowering, common flowering physiology among taxonomically related species, and the ecological advantages at the population and guild levels, may cause multiple species to have synchronized fluctuation patterns of seed production.\n      </p>", "I investigated the history of the brown bear (Ursus arctos yesoensis) harvest in the Oshima Peninsula, Hokkaido, by analyzing hunting statistics and interviewing hunters. The mean annual harvest between 1909-38 and 1963-93 was 38.8 bears (SD = 21.3) and 76.0 (SD = 29.8) bears, respectively. During 1966-87, when spring prophylactic hunting was allowed, 58% of the harvest (n = 1,849) was taken during March-May and 32% during September-November. After the spring prophylactic harvest was abolished in 1990, harvests during March-May declined to 21% (n = 287) while September-November harvests increased to 61% of the total. Furthermore, proportions of males and adults in the harvest increased and proportion of females with young bears and cubs declined. Between 1983 and 1987, the spring harvests occurred mainly in the principal bear habitat in the interior of the peninsula, whereas summer and autumn harvests occurred in farmlands or residential areas along the coast or in valleys. Total harvest did not always decline after spring harvest was stopped because of increased autumn harvests resulting primarily from control actions. Further measures should be taken to decrease total harvest of brown bears in this region.\n      </p>", "For many Western corporations, Japan poses formidable barriers to export and investment. Although trade policy confrontations with Japan have been scrutinized, the strategies pursued by Western corporations in attempting to penetrate the Japanese economy remain poorly understood. This paper addresses this lacuna via a corporate case study. Conceptually, we provide an alternative to the established theory of the international firm, outlining a model that integrates the related concepts of spatial entry advantages--spatial entry barriers, learning-bargaining processes, and control-efficiency considerations. We explore the model empirically by examining MacMillan Bloedel's (MB's) strategy of export (and investment) diversification toward Japan. The data come mainly from unstructured interviews with representatives inside and outside the firm. The analysis documents the extensive marketing initiatives undertaken by MB in pursuit of Japanese markets and the substantial changes required in its British Columbia-based production facilities. In the terms of the model presented, MB has invested to an unusual degree (among forest product corporations) in understanding Japanese markets and in gaining bargaining leverage in order to exploit its entry advantages effectively. More so than rival firms, which have relied on traditional ways of tapping into Japanese markets, MB has stressed the efficiency benefits of having greater control within the Japanese distribution system.\n      </p>", "The preoccupation of critical IPE theory with the global neo-liberal programme of deregulation and restructuring tends to hide the emergence of alternative patterns of regulation in different sites of global transformation. Currently, Japanese capitalism projects on a regional plane, concepts of regulation that negate neo-liberal discourse. The contours of the regionalization of Japan's state and economy are taking shape in the form of tightly coordinated production networks, administrative guidance of investment patterns, and a regional division of labour. The paper traces the roots of Japan's regulation strategy for the Asian region to a historical logic of ideological, political and institutional responses of Japanese capitalism to structural change in the world order. At three successive moments in the history of Japanese capitalism, the strategic competence, conscious compromises and 'sense of direction' of administrators played a critical role. It is contended that an account of the history of this intellectual stratum in the process of social differentiation will not only shed light on the persistence of Japan's enigmatic political culture, but also clarify the absence of liberal ideas in Japanese concepts of regulation.\n      </p>", "The introduction of McDonald's and indigenous fast-food restaurants reflects changes in the Japanese diet, eating behaviors, and social patterns. But these changes are not the expression of urban anomie and social fragmentation often attributed to postmodern society and symbolically represented by the ubiquity of these restaurants. Indeed, eating and social patterns within such establishments suggest that they provide opportunities for intergenerational commensality, conviviality, and intimacy that are less evident in some of the traditional Japanese fast-food establishments, where snacks and meals likewise are quickly served and quickly consumed. The proliferation in Japan today of these fast-food establishments reflects changes in Japan as part of global processes, rather than Westernization per se; such eating venues are used in ways that are consistent with patterns long established in Japanese culture.\n      </p>", "Understanding what determines a species' range is a central objective in ecology and evolutionary biology. It has important applications for predicting species distributions and how they might respond to environmental perturbations. This paper describes a mechanistic approach to predict past and present distribution of the Japanese serow (Capricornis crispus) on Honshu, Japan. We applied state-of-the-art microclimate and animal biophysical/behavioral models coupled with climate and vegetation data to estimate the distribution of potential range expansion under protection. We tested the model results against detailed empirical distribution data from the Ministry of the Environment for a five-prefecture area in central Honshu. We also applied the models to time-series land use/cover maps to investigate the historical transitions in habitat suitability during 1947-1999 in the Arai-Keinan region. This is the first time to our knowledge that mechanistic models have successfully predicted the landscape scale distribution of a mammal species in the absence of other animal species interactions, such as predators. In this case, animal energetics/behavior-plant interactions seem to be critical. Forest cover appears to be important in summer and winter for suitable serow habitats. The energetics model results indicate that the serow can overheat in some open environments in midday hours in summer. In winter, simulation results suggested that forest cover provides effective refuge to avoid increased metabolic demands of cold temperatures and strong winds. The model simulations suggested that land use/cover changes documented during 1947-1999 resulted in increased suitable serow habitat due to expanding forest cover from agricultural marginalization and ecological succession. The models provide a unique tool for estimating species' range expansion under protection or for selecting suitable reintroduction sites.\n      </p>", "Managing an increasingly negative view of old age as the time of decline, older persons in Japan have shaped pre-funerals as ceremonies of later life celebrating their agency, self-sufficiency, and personal pleasure in steering their remaining years. Whereas new policies have been employed to handle the growing social and economic stress of eldercare on the nation's shrinking younger population, pre-funerals ceremonially engage Japan's aging society, where longevity is considered not a gift but a burden. Using symbols and practices found in various life-cycle rites in Japan, during pre-funerals aging persons express their gratitude and say goodbye to those close to them. By designing, conducting, and consuming their own pre-funerals, older persons playfully construct an age-specific ideal of independence against a treasured, mainstream value of mutual dependence.\n      </p>", "Against China's attempts at cultivating multilateral forums to augment and institutionalize its influence in Central, Northeast, and Southeast Asia, Japan's major foreign policy challenge now is how to secure its own interests in these forums while balancing its relations with China and the United States.\n      </p>", "The male of Pylaemenes guangxiensis (Bi &amp; Li 1994) is described and its distribution range extended to Japan and Taiwan.

Two forms of democratic orientation were investigated in a sample of about 1,000 university students in Japan: a defensive version, which adheres to the formalistic requirements of democracy but is exclusionary and illiberal, and a universalist version that is liberal and tolerant. A defensive orientation is associated with greater chauvinism, a greater sense of threat emanating from foreigners, and a heightened anxiety about economic competition. A universalist orientation is associated with low perceived threat and low chauvinism, a lack of fear of economic competition, and a positive view of the cultural contributions of outsiders. Nativism may indeed be compatible with democratic values, but only with the defensive, exclusionary form. In short, the defensive form is democracy for xenophobes. Such an orientation is not unique to Japan, but is likely to be found in developing democracies as well as in advanced democracies that feel threatened.\n      </p>", "A two-stage budgeting procedure was used to estimate demand elasticities for cigarettes in Japan.

The paper identifies six main trends in children's participation in Japan stemming from this context: Machizukuri (community development and neighborhood improvement), environmental education, synthetic experiential learning, the growth of free schools, the creation of new kinds of gathering places for youth, and direct attempts by the government to fulfill the goal of giving children a voice.

Estimating hazard models for the transition to first marriage separately by gender, living arrangements, and birth cohort, I find that the trend toward later marriage is indeed more pronounced among young men and women living with parents. Conditional on coresidence, however, there is little evidence that access to parental provision of financial resources and domestic services is negatively associated with marriage. I suggest alternative scenarios in which parental resources may contribute to later marriage by facilitating children's independence rather than by keeping them at home.\n      </p>", "The female reproductive cycle of the lizard Eumeces okadae on Miyake-jima, an island of Izu Archipelago, Japan, was studied by autopsy and mark-recapture methods. Mature females ranged from 72-94 mm in SVL and a clutch of eggs was laid from mid-June to early July. Clutch size varied from 4-12 with a mean of 7.6 eggs. Females brooded eggs for about 37 days until hatching. During brooding, females suspended foraging and food intake was reduced markedly. Fat body mass was maximal prior to yolk deposition and minimal just after brooding. Most mature females reproduced biennially, with 47-64% of mature females being reproductive in a given year.\n      </p>", "Uchimura Kanz\u014d (1861-1930) was an extremely accomplished Meiji Christian convert who emphasized a Christianity he considered in tune with traditional Japanese religiosity and free of Western influence. When a child, he observed his family's distress as Meiji rulers dismantled the Tokugawa political system. Then he assumed responsibility for their support when he turned sixteen. Though thus burdened by family responsibility, he finished a Japanese undergraduate degree in fisheries science, studied further in the United States, and then returned home to encourage Bible study among the Japanese. He became a respected essayist. The result: a complete works of more than twenty thousand pages and many loyal followers who helped form the new democratic Japanese society after 1945. Samples of his writings cover such themes as these: Old Testament-style prophecy; Japan's role to emphasize Christianity's Asian roots; the Christian believer's utter dependence on God; Christian morality; and churchless Christianity as Japan's contribution to world Christianity.\n      </p>", "We investigated habitat use by introduced raccoons (Procyon lotor) and native raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides albus) in a northern deciduous forest of Japan to examine the relationship between the 2 species. Spatial and temporal habitat use in the forest was monitored using infrared-triggered cameras. We also surveyed environmental factors at 2 spatial scales: at the macrohabitat scale, we examined forest growth stage, forest fragmentation, and distance from a water source; at the microhabitat scale, we examined forest structure, understory vegetation, and beetle abundance. We then analyzed the relationship between environmental factors and habitat use by each species using generalized linear model. Except for fern coverage, most environmental factors at the micro- and macrohabitat scales had different effects on the habitat use of these species. Moreover, the degree of diurnal activity also differed between the species. These spatial and temporal differences in habitat use between raccoons and raccoon dogs provide further evidence that competition between these 2 species may be limited in this area.\n      </p>", "This paper examines regional characteristics affecting the latent entrepreneurship in Japan, focusing on regional macroeconomic indicators, existing density of establishments and human capital, and business start-up assistance programs by local governments. We define two types of people having the latent entrepreneurship as follows: (1) persons merely wishing to be a self-employed worker, and (2) persons preparing to be a self-employed worker out of the former definition. Total cash earnings and the unemployment rate, which are the macro economic indicators, had positive effects on latent entrepreneurship in Japan. Judging from the significance of their estimations, the latent entrepreneurship is explained by the \"Push hypothesis\". If we examine the problem more closely, it is necessary for us to identify government assistance programs which make the latent entrepreneurs more self-employment.\n      </p>", "In the period from 1992 to 2001, 303 cases of nocardioses were diagnosed in Japan, with the corresponding etiological agents isolated and characterized. Taxonomic analyses of these 303 strains showed that most nocardial infections were caused by members of the Nocardia asteroides group (72.3%). Speciation showed that 72 strains were N. asteroides, 31 strains were N. cyriacigeorgica, 2 strains were N. beijingensis, 81 strains were N. farcinica, and 33 strains were N. nova. Sixty-six strains of N. brasiliensis were the next most prevalent species of the total Nocardia isolates, followed by 14 strains of N. otitidiscaviarum. Infections by N. transvalensis (3 strains) and N. pseudobrasiliensis (1 strain) were also confirmed. The infections due to N. transvalensis, N. cyriacigeorgica, and N. beijingensis were the first reported in Japan. The most common factor that predisposed individuals to nocardial infection in Japan was therapy by immunosuppressive agents (22.4%), including SLE therapy (3.6%), followed by cancer (6.6%), diabetes (3.6%) and AIDS (2.0%). Nocardial infections occurred more commonly in the elderly, with most of the patients between the ages of 61 and 80 years of age. No significant difference regarding infectivity levels between the sexes was observed.\n      </p>", "This study seeks to identify the factors that caused the historic defeat of Japan's longdominant party in the 2009 election.

Apparent decreases seem to be related to loss and fragmentation of habitat, a liberal permit system for depredation kills, and a lack of ecological data to develop management guidelines. From 1996 to 1999, we studied bear habitat relationships at 2 spatial scales in the central mountain region of Japan. We used classification and regression tree analysis (CART) to determine the hierarchical structure of bear use of available habitats. The landscape analysis focused on Nagano Prefecture (approximately 13,585 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), of which bears occupy 60%. Land-cover and land-use data were summarized and compared with the percent of occupied bear habitat within each of the 120 municipalities within the prefecture. The greatest distribution of bears occurred in municipalities with relatively little (&lt;16%) agricultural land use. In areas with &gt;16% agriculture, the presence of national park land and limited human development (&lt;9%) characterized areas occupied by bears. At the local scale within Nagano Prefecture, we determined habitat preference with locations of 13 radiocollared bears. Bears used oak (Quercus spp.)-dominated deciduous and planted, mixed forests in the montane zone (&lt;1,460 m) more than expected. Habitat use at the local scale appeared related to the distribution of natural food resources, particularly hard mast, whereas our landscape analysis indicated that municipalities with abundant bear habitat were primarily associated with areas where agriculture was limited. Because of the complex topography in Nagano Prefecture, agricultural and developed areas often are directly adjacent to bear habitat. Recent patterns of human development have been more diffuse, which may negatively affect resource use on a local scale and bear distribution on a landscape scale.\n      </p>", "This article examines the ways in which oceans were depicted in Japanese geographical writings and maps from the Tokugawa period. It uses these texts to understand how early modern Japanese visions of the Pacific and of maritime Asian waters constructed epistemological frameworks through which the Japanese saw their place in an increasingly complex web of regional and global connections. In the absence of actual adventure on the \"high seas,\" Japanese writers, artists, and mapmakers used the inventive power of the imagination to fill in the cognitive blank of ocean space. I argue that the definition of early modern oceanic space was profoundly ambiguous, a legacy that, it can be argued, left its mark on Japan's modern relationship with the Asian Pacific region.\n      </p>", "This is an exploratory study aimed at establishing the existence of a strategy utilized by large Japanese industrial groups to protect themselves against external threats. A measure is developed to assess the stability of the top 10 shareholders of 134 leading companies in the six Japanese industrial groups-Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, DKB, Sanwa, and Fuyo-over the 1973-93 period. The results demonstrate the use by these companies of their networks of stable shareholdings as a strategic response to deal with threats to group company governance structures arising from the stock market and property boom of the late 1980s (known in Japan as the 'bubble' economy) and its aftermath. Some theoretical and practical reflections are presented.\n      </p>", "Recent molecular evidence of genetically distinct hantaviruses in shrews, captured in widely separated geographical regions, corroborates decades-old reports of hantavirus antigens in shrew tissues. Apart from challenging the conventional view that rodents are the principal reservoir hosts, the recently identified soricid-borne hantaviruses raise the possibility that other soricomorphs, notably talpids, similarly harbor hantaviruses. In analyzing RNA extracts from lung tissues of the Japanese shrew mole (Urotrichus talpoides), captured in Japan between February and April 2008, a hantavirus genome, designated Asama virus (ASAV), was detected by RT-PCR. Pairwise alignment and comparison of the S-, M-, and L-segment nucleotide and amino acid sequences indicated that ASAV was genetically more similar to hantaviruses harbored by shrews than by rodents. However, the predicted secondary structure of the ASAV nucleocapsid protein was similar to that of rodent- and shrew-borne hantaviruses, exhibiting the same coiled-coil helix at the amino terminus. Phylogenetic analyses, using the maximum-likelihood method and other algorithms, consistently placed ASAV with recently identified soricine shrew-borne hantaviruses, suggesting a possible host-switching event in the distant past. The discovery of a mole-borne hantavirus enlarges our concepts about the complex evolutionary history of hantaviruses.\n      </p>", "Facing spiraling medical costs, Japan and many industrialized countries in the West have tried to control reimbursements to medical providers by setting reimbursement rates. The United States' diagnosis-related groups' (DRGs) pricing has attracted a considerable amount of attention in recent years. This article discusses Japan's hospital reimbursement scheme called the point system, which sets a fixed fee for each item of service, and evaluates Japan's system by comparing it with the United States' DRGs. The article points out that Japan's reimbursement scheme encourages individualized care but fails to provide incentives for it to operate efficiently, and that the design of Japan's system has invited cross-subsidization between complex ailments and less complex ones, and between technical procedures and ancillary services. Some Japanese private hospitals survive only by providing more diagnostic tests and drugs.

This commingling process, which has elevated their relations to an \u201cunofficial-in-name-only\u201d status, is the result of three mutually reinforcing factors: re-imagination of colonial ties, sharing of a democratic identity, and the permeating of popular culture.\n      </p>", "Tylopilus alkalixanthus is described from the Cordillera Talamanca of Costa Rica.

Nevertheless approaches to reticulation history with DNA markers are not yet commonly adopted. We have successfully elucidated the biological status of the Vandenboschia radicans complex in East Asian islands by combining analyses of ploidy level, a cpDNA marker (rbcL), and a nuclear DNA marker (GapCp). The results based on 266 individuals collected from 174 localities throughout Japan and Taiwan suggest that complicated hybridizations have occurred involving at least three parental diploid species from within the V. radicans complex and Vandenboschia liukiuensis, which was formerly considered to be distinct from this complex. Triploids are the most common cytotype, but they show no evidence of apogamous reproduction, while all nonhybrid diploids are rare and have very limited distribution. Possible accounts of this phenomenon will be briefly discussed including the possibility of relict distribution and occasional apogamous reproduction.\n      </p>", "South Korea's and Japan's telecommunications sectors developed rapidly, especially in high-speed, low-priced broadband.

Decisions to adopt particular identities are channeled by the institutions of society, historical circumstances, and local contexts. Because selves and societies mutually fashion one another, the ways in which selves construct an identity are commentaries upon transformations in society.

Surveillance in trading restriction zones and epidemiologically related farms revealed 41 seropositive farms, and 16 H5N2 viruses were isolated and characterized from nine of these farms. That these viruses were genetically and antigenically similar to each other suggested that these isolates were derived from a common origin. Complete genomic characterization of all eight gene segments showed that these H5N2 isolates in Japan had high homology to the H5N2 strains prevalent in Central America since 1994. The virus was reisolated from tracheal and cloacal swabs of experimentally inoculated chickens and efficiently transmitted to sentinel chickens in adjacent cages. /// Un virus de influenza aviar de baja patogenicidad del subtipo H5N2 fue aislado por primera vez en ayes de la l\u00ednea ponedora durante el a\u00f1o 2005 en Jap\u00f3n.

The predictive power of the theory has become more reliable with the continuation of surveys over the decades since the theory's inception. Nevertheless, one problem remains unsolved using conventional methodology: how to determine the extent to which the proportion of post-materialists was already increasing during the years preceding the first survey in 1970. This article contributes to the solution of that problem by analyzing the values contained in 33,479 Japanese newspaper editorials from 1945 to 2000. By reflecting the public's values, Japanese newspapers are able to maintain the largest circulations in the world. Moreover, the lifetime employment system in Japan enables us to \"control for\" life-cycle effects on value change, because the age of editorial board members has been constant during the postwar period.

Political alienation can be expressed as comprising two dimensions, political trust and civic-mindedness. Males and people with more years of schooling are more allegiant in general; that is, they are both more trusting and more civic-minded. Evaluations of cabinet performance and support for democratic mechanisms are strongly related to political trust and civic-mindedness. Supporters of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) are no more civic-minded than average but are more trusting politically, whereas Japan Communist Party supporters are more civic-minded but a good deal less politically trusting than average. Independents are below the overall average on both the political trust and civic-mindedness dimensions. Even though party support is unstable, Japan's political system will not lose its stability as long as LDP supporters and independents constitute the majority of Japan's electorate.

The chickens inoculated intravenously with the viruses died within 26 hr after inoculation. Macroscopically, minimal necrosis of the tip of the comb, and hemorrhages of the palpebral conjunctiva, liver, cerebellum, and muscles were rarely observed. Histologically, dead chickens had minimal focal necrosis of hepatocytes with fibrinous thrombi in sinusoids, mild necrosis of splenic ellipsoids with fibrinous exudation, minimal necrosis of the brain, mild necrosis of epidermal cells of the comb with congestion of the lamina propria, and hemorrhages and edema of the lamina propria of the conjunctiva. Virus antigens were seen in the sinusoidal endothelial cells and hepatocytes in the liver, the capillary endothelial cells of the spleen, the capillary endothelial cells and cardiac myocytes in the heart, the capillary endothelial cells and necrotic nerve cells in the brain, the capillary endothelial cells in the lamina propria of the comb, the renal tubular epithelial cells, and the pancreatic acinar cells. The chickens inoculated by natural infectious routes died within 1\u20144 days after inoculation. Macroscopically, some chickens had hemorrhages in the conjunctiva, edematous swelling of the face and wattles, hydropericardium, hemorrhages of the proventriculus and bursa of Fabricius, increased secretion of tracheal mucus, and congestion and edema of lungs.
