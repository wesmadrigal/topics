The hepatocytes were cultured in serum-free modified Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10 mM nicotinamide and 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor. When 6 \u00d7 10\u2075 cells were plated on 35-mm dishes coated with rat tail collagen, the cells proliferated and reached confluence at Day 6 to Day 8. The first subculture was carried out at Day 8 using 0.005% collagenase and gentle pipettings. Most cells were recovered and plated on the new dishes coated with the collagen (first passage). The attached cells could proliferate and reached near confluence when the cells occupied more than two-thirds of the dish surface. About a week after the first subculture, the second one was conducted. Although the number of the recovered cells was smaller than at the first passage, the cells could attach and proliferate to a certain extent. Thereafter, they were maintained for more than 2 mo. but they never overgrew. Albumin secretion into the culture medium was confirmed in the subcultured cells. Ultrastructurally, these subcultured cells possessed hepatic characteristics such as peroxisomes with a crystalline nucleiod and bile-canaliculus structures. When 10% fetal bovine serum and ascorbic acid 2-phosphate were added to the cells of the second passage, they began to proliferate very slowly. These proliferating cells were mainly mononucleate and had a small cytoplasm. In addition, some of them could differentiate into typical mature hepatocytes by forming a three-dimensional structure interacting with nonparenchymal cells. In this experiment, we showed the successful subculturing of parenchymal hepatocytes isolated from adult rats and provided evidence that the subcultured cells still have the potential to proliferate and to differentiate.\n      </p>", "This paper employs notions about the occupational subculture of policing and policing as 'knowledge work' in order to discuss transnational trends in policing. The complex unity between the transnational subculture of policing, which is sustained through knowledge exchange, and the subculture of transnational policing, which is precariously negotiated through practical arrangements for cross-border policing, is viewed as an achievement of the knowledge society.\n      </p>", "The subculture of violence hypothesis and its present empirical status are reviewed. A path model of the subcultural hypothesis is developed and tested with survey data collected from adolescents. The predictions of the subcultural model receive only partial support; only a moderate amount of variation in violent behavior is explained. There is some evidence of interaction between sex and the carrying of a weapon. The use of survey data to test the subcultural hypothesis is criticized, as well as the hypothesis itself, and suggestions for future work are offered.\n      </p>", "The understanding of pathways associated with differentiated function in human epithelial cells has been enhanced by the development of methods for the short-term culture of human epithelial cells. In general these methods involve the use of serum. The subculture and maintenance of epithelial cells in long-term culture has been more problematic. A serum-free medium developed for human bronchial epithelial cells was slightly modified and found to be useful for the subculture and long-term maintenance of not only bronchial epithelial cells, but also tracheal, nasal polyp, and sweat gland epithelial cells from either normal or cystic fibrosis individuals. The cells maintained epithelial-specific characteristics after multiple subcultures. Monolayers of epithelial cells showed junctional complex formation, the presence of keratin, and micro villi. Functional studies with Ussing chambers showed short circuit current (Isc) responses to isoproterenol, bradykinin, or calcium ionophore (A23187) in subcultured tracheal and bronchial cells.\n      </p>", "The year 2000 (Y2K) computer software problem is framed as a technological boundary and cultural object. The author documents and analyzes three subcultures' constructions of Y2K. The three subcultures are millennial (Evangelical-Charismatic-Pentecostal) Christians, militia-patriot survivalists, and computer professionals. Each subculture interpreted, received, comprehended, and explained the cultural object of Y2K. Combining the data from content analysis and interviews, the author creates a detailed picture of each subculture's response to Y2K. She compares and contrasts the three subcultures. Each subculture created a subcultural filter based on previously held value and belief systems, attitudes toward technology and computers, and interpretations of social environments to create a unique picture of Y2K. She examines how each of the subcultures framed technology through the framing of it as a technological object. Each response was located within the technological determinism versus social determinism debate and juxtaposed with its place in the technology as utopian or dystopian.\n      </p>", "The effects of subculture of tissue cultures on the levels of certain mRNAs have been investigated, and the action of cytokinins on the disposition of certain mRNAs between possible non-translating and translating pools has been determined. mRNA preparations were assayed by cell free translation with message-dependent reticulocyte lysate and the in vitro products resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Subculture of the cells caused a rapid stimulation of polysome formation. It also increased the translatable levels of a small group of mRNAs, one of which was present in both bean and soybean cultures. Cytokinins caused a slight increase in polysome levels after subculture, but had no effect on the levels of particular mRNAs, nor on the distribution of mRNAs between a non-translating and translating pool, nor on polysome levels in the absence of subculture.\n      </p>", "This study examines the effects of within-country subcultures on business outcomes. We first argue that individuals' values vary across subcultures. We then suggest that values, as expressed through motivational domains, influence business performance. Finally, joining these two prepositions, we posit that business performance will vary by subculture. Based on data from four regional subcultures in Brazil, a subculture effect was found for both motivational domains and business performance. The results suggest that it is important to consider the cultural variation within a country when examining business outcomes.\n      </p>", "Reproducible subculture of adult human prostatic epithelial cells from normal, benign hyperplastic and malignant tissue has been achieved. Cholera toxin is the key component in the culture system, but use of an optimal basal medium (PFMR-4) supplemented with a high level of serum in collagen-coated dishes also improves growth and serial propagation.\n      </p>", "Subculture, despite the term's wide usage in sociology, has not proved to be a very satisfactory explanatory concept. Several problems in previous subculture research are discussed: (1) the confusion between subculture and subsociety, (2) the lack of a meaningful referent for subculture, (3) the homogeneity and stasis associated with the concept, and (4) the emphasis on defining subcultures in terms of values and central themes. It is argued that for the subculture construct to be of maximal usefulness it needs to be linked to process of interaction. Subculture is reconceptualized in terms of cultural spread occurring through an interlocking group network charactarized by multiple group membership, weak ties, structural roles conducive to information spread between groups, and media diffusion. Indentification with the referent group serves to motivate the potential member to adopt the artifacts, behaviors, norms, and values characteristic of the subculture. Youth subculture are presented as illustrations of how these processes operate.\n      </p>", "In this study, we have demonstrated that Zoysia japonica callus induced from mature seeds can produce high frequencies of plant regeneration and somatic embryogenesis, even following a prolonged period of subculturing. Initial callus cultures were induced from mature seeds of Japanese lawngrass (Z. japonica Steud.) incubated on a medium contianing major N\u2086 medium salts, minor Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium salts, and modified MS medium organic elements supplemented with 3 mg L\u207b\u00b9 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 0.01-0.02 mg L\u207b\u00b9 6-benzyladenine. Compact callus were selected and subcultured monthly on a medium containing 2 mg L\u207b\u00b9 2,4-D, 0.5 mg L\u207b\u00b9 kinetin, 500 mg L\u207b\u00b9 casein hydrolysate, 500 mg L\u207b\u00b9 proline, and 500 mg L\u207b\u00b9 myoinositol. Callus maintained in vitro for 18 mo could be induced to regenerate plantlets with a frequency of &gt;90%. By contrast, 36-mo-old callus cultures failed to produce normal shoot regeneration. However, the addition of CuSO\u2084 to the subculture media maintained &gt;90% regeneration frequencies in such long-term callus cultures. Histological observations revealed that plant regeneration occurred both through somatic embryogenesis and organogenesis pathways. The ability to sustainable regeneration in long-term callus cultures will be valuable to the program of genetic transformation and somaclonal variant selection.\n      </p>", "Current sociological work makes extensive use of the concept of subculture--in the analysis of delinquency, adolescence, regional and class differences, religious sects, occupational styles, and other topics. In the study of these areas, our understanding has been increased by seeing norms that vary from more general standards as manifestations, in part, of distinctive subsocieties. Unfortunately, however, the term subculture is used in several different ways. In over 100 sources reviewed here, three clearly different meanings are found, with resultant imprecision in its application. A new term contraculture, is suggested in order to distinguish between normative systems of sub-societies and emergent norms that appear in conflict situations. The usefulness of this distinction is explored with reference to several substantive areas of research.\n      </p>", "This study examined the extent to which variables derived from strain, subculture, and control theories may be used in conjunction with one another in order to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the etiology of delinquency among both males and females. Self-report data obtained from a sample of 891 male and 885 female high school students indicated that (1) strain, subculture, and control theories served to explain significant, though small, proportions of the variance in male and female delinquency; (2) the subculture model variables accounted for the most unique variance in male and female delinquency involvement; and (3) the combined effects of all three models accounted for more variance than each of the models considered independently among both males and females. The path analysis model developed indicated that the influence of the strain model variables on delinquency were largely indirect through their effect on the subculture and control model variables. The path model assigned primary significance to the subculture model variables and showed identical etiological pathways to delinquency involvement among both males and females. The results of this study suggest that (1) seemingly unrelated theoretical models can be employed in concert with one another to significantly improve our understanding of the processes leading to delinquency; and (2) theories of delinquency are not merely theories of male deviance.\n      </p>", "Since the beginning of the 1990s, Germany has become the center of the Gothic youth subculture. Their lyrics, music, and pronouncements combine a revulsion against a rationalist, production-driven modern society and its alienating effects on the individual, with a nostalgia for the past and a fascination with dark visions and death. Inspired by such diverse sources as Hildegard von Bingen, the Romanticism of Eichendorff, and early expressionism, their radical protest has moved both toward a fundamental critique of an inhuman, one-dimensional society and toward a militant fascist aesthetics. Special emphasis is put on the musical interpretation of poems by Gottfried Benn.\n      </p>", "An in vitro model to establish primary and subcultures of rat kidney proximal tubule (RPT) cells is described. After excising the kidneys and separating the cortex, the cortical tissue is digested with the enzymes DNAse-collagenase (Type I) resulting in a high yield of viable RPT Cells. The isolated RPT cells are then seeded onto rat tail collagen-coated surfaces and grown to confluency in a serum-free, hormonally defined medium. The cell yield can be increased by transferring the conditioned medium on Day 1 to more rat tail collagen-coated surfaces. RPT cell attachment and morphology was better on rat tail collagen-coated surfaces than on bovine collagen Type I coated surfaces. The culture medium was a 1:1 mixture of Ham's F-12 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with bovine serum albumin, insulin, transferrin, selenium, hydrocortisone, triiodothyronine, epidermal growth factor, and glutamine. The RPT cells became confluent in 7-10 d, at which point they could be subcultured by trypsinizing and growth in the same medium. In some studies, 10 ng/ml cholera toxin was added to the culture medium. We could passage the RPT cells up to 14 times in the presence of cholera toxin. The cells were investigated for activity of several markers. The cells were histochemically positive for alkaline phosphatase and \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase activity and synthesized the intermediate filament pankeratin. The RPT cells displayed apically directed sodium-dependent active glucose transport in culture. Hence, the RPT cells retain structural and functional characteristics of transporting renal epithelia in culture. This rat cell culture model will be a valuable tool for substrate uptake and nephrotoxicity studies.\n      </p>", "This article uses the Students Serving Christ student organization to examine the role of student subcultures in higher education. Using subculture theories, this article examines the origins of student subcultures, explores how subcultures are formed and sustained, reveals what counts as normal within and among student subcultures, investigates forms of student resistance, and examines subculture tensions and paradoxes. Recommendations target higher education and anthropology scholars.\n      </p>", "Cohen has suggested that a new subculture arises when it provides a solution to certain problems of adjustment shared among a community of individuals. This concept is tested against the history of a drug subculture in Kentucky, and found to apply to it. Before 1914, when narcotics could be obtained legally, easily and cheaply, there was no drug subculture. After 1914 drugs could be obtained only with difficulty, but could be obtained through contact with addicts, and a subculture emerged. After 1940, the subculture no longer provided a solution to the problem of obtaining drugs, and it declined. These conclusions are based on a measure of involvement in the subculture, and the changing associations, over time, of other variables with this measure.\n      </p>", "Clonal growth and serial subculture of diploid liver epithelial cells from neonatal rats were achieved in a serum-free medium (SFM) supplemented with linoleic and oleic acid linked to fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (fafBSA), epidermal growth factor (EGF), transferrin, insulin, selenous acid, and fetuin. Because it is not known whether factors added to defined media facilitate attachment, support proliferation, or both, a serum-free \"attachment medium\" was first devised in which cells would attach to the substratum without loss of viability. Then a growth medium that would support cell proliferation was developed. Fetuin enhanced the degree of attachment, and the lipid supplements and EGF induced a marked proliferative response. Serum-free medium supported the formation of colonies equivalent in size, number, and morphology to those obtained in serum-supplemented medium. Cells plated at a higher inoculum density and subcultured regularly for up to 25 wk underwent two to three doublings per week and acquired a flattened epithelial cell morphology. Early passages of rat liver epithelial cells, cultured in SFM may be useful in studies of the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation.\n      </p>", "This paper focuses on the failure of sociologists to agree on an operational definition of subculture. As a first step toward remedying this neglect, a paradigm is suggested. The proposal includes eight generic dimensions with differential weights for arriving at a coefficient for the subcultural quality of a collectivity. The dimensions include (1) unique norms/values, (2) jargon, (3) distinct channels of mass communication, (4) style/fad expression, (5) esprit de corps, (6) status criteria, (7) leadership quality, and (8) subcultural institutionalization of needs. In the discussion these dimensions are applied to the American youth subculture.\n      </p>", "The extensive scholarly literature on prisoner subculture has, until quite recently, virtually ignored race relations. The oversight is significant; prisons have a long history of segregation and racial discrimination. Descriptions and theories of prisoner subculture which do not take racial cleavages into account are incomplete and need to be reconsidered. Since the late 1950s race relations have precipitated enormous changes in prisoner subcultures and in prison organization. The Black Muslims challenged the hegemony of white officials and prisoners and their legal activism led to the intervention of the federal courts in prison administration. Present-day prisoner subcultures are characterized by racial polarization and conflict, and by the dominance of blacks and other minorities who now constitute the majority of the national prisoner population. The next generation of research should link the prison society, including its patterns of race relations, to both the unique characteristics of prisons and the culture and social structure of the larger society.\n      </p>", "This field study of the punk rock subculture is an exploratory examination in the much neglected area of Canadian adolescent subcultures. The data consist of transcribed unstructured interviews with subculture members and field notes gathered during the observation period. Functionalist and neo-Marxist theories of subculture were used as guides to inquiry. The results reveal that the punk subculture is a \"classless\" form of delinquent youth culture. Members were seen to be reacting to the age and generational effect of youth employment opportunities. They displayed varying levels of resistance to dominant cultural goals, school, and the family. Severity of the resistance was related to gender. Political attitudes were characterized by a \"libertarian\" consciousness that served to mute political resistance. While members could not address issues of unemployment, poverty, and alienating labour, they were able to achieve status through participation in the subculture and violence. /// Cette enqu\u00eate sur place de la subculture punk rock est une \u00e9tude d'exploration du domaine tr\u00e8s n\u00e9glig\u00e9 des subcultures d'adolescents canadiens.

These references are limited to the English language citations in the major bibliographic reference works such as the International Index to the Social Sciences, the Social Science Citation Index, Sociological Abstracts, and the indexes to the major scholarly journals of religion not cited in these general reference works. During the first half of the twentieth century, scholarly literature on the Mormons dealt primarily with historical and contemporary studies of social geography, rural sociology, agricultural economics, the family, and fertility among the Mormons. Although these topics continue to be studied, since mid-century new foci of interest have appeared in the literature, including the impact of modernization and secularization upon the Mormon subculture and religion; shifting public images of Mormonism; Mormon involvement in politics; Mormon relationships with ethnic groups, especially with blacks; sex roles and the position of women within the Mormon subculture; and the growth of Mormonism outside North America. A somewhat less prominent, but also important, emphasis in the more recent literature is Mormon religiosity and its consequences. Among the potentially interesting topics scarcely addressed in any of the literature on Mormons are social stratification and the distribution of power within the Mormon Church and communities; parent-child relationships (despite a fairly large extant literature on other family topics); deviant behavior, singleness and divorce, the erosion of patriarchy, and internal efforts to deal with these phenomena; plus proselyting, conversion, defection, and schisms within the Mormon movement. Much could also be learned from more extensive studies of the consequences of the large-scale \"exportation\" of Mormonism now underway, especially in the Third World, given the recent observation by prominent non-Mormon scholars that Mormonism may be on the verge of mushrooming into the first new world religion since Islam.\n      </p>", "Recent investigations have explained regional differentials in homicide by reference to a reformulated subculture-of-violence thesis, which posits a southern subculture of violence. These studies heavily emphasize the role of firearms in violent subcultures. This paper develops a model that specifies the relationship between regions and subcultures of violence while determining the relationship of both to gun ownership. Analysis of patterns of gun ownership among individuals shows that the violent values indicative of sub-culture-of-violence membership are unrelated to region when structural factors are taken into account. Moreover, gun ownership is unrelated to the violent values indicative of subcultures of violence. Instead, both region and gun ownership are related to defensive attitudes that are not indicative of a subculture of violence. These results cast doubt on the validity of the reformulated subculture-of-violence thesis that emphasizes a regional subculture of violence with guns as a central feature. While interpersonal violence, such as homicide, may be a function of subcultures of violence, these subcultures operate independently of region and may be associated with, but are in no way dependent on, firearms.\n      </p>", "This study attempted to authenticate the existence of a controversial subculture of gay men, the 'bug chasers', whose main attribute is an active desire to voluntarily contract the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and examine the tenacity with which this subculture actually searches for seroconversion. Using a quasi-randomized survey of personal profiles, bug chasers were compared against barebackers, a culture of gay men that practice intentional unprotected anal intercourse. Bug chasers were authenticated as an observable subculture of barebackers where most reported apathy to the serostatus of their partner or an active want of a serodiscordant partner, and a preference towards practicing unprotected anal intercourse. As anticipated, two subgroups with varying tenacities were found within the sample of bug chasers. Apathetic chasers were found only to be in search of partners with sero-ambiguous status.

How to select or preserve such a valuable morphotype during ESM maintenance (prior to maturation treatment) is still unknown. Several maintenance procedures were tested; 2400 ESM from 10 lines were subcultured each 7 or 14 d on maltose- or sucrose-containing medium without plant growth regulator (PGR) or supplemented with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 6-benzylaminopurine or a low concentration of abscisic acid. Multiple components analyses based on growth rate, macromorphology data, and micromorphology data, collected for 6 mo., allowed for the association of the spiky morphotype with additional traits (defining the phenotype I) such as whitish aspect, high vigor, high growth rate, and complex cellular organization (resulting from high early embryogenic ability). Since a gradual increase in growth rate as well as a decrease in cellular organization were concomitantly observed during the 6 mo. experiment, we concluded that ESM growth and early somatic embryo development were disconnected. In some lines, the progressive loss of early embryogenic ability (aging process) could be decreased using maltose-based and PGR-free medium. For most lines, the aging effect was minimized using a weekly subculture. An improved procedure for ESM maintenance prior to the maturation step is thus proposed.\n      </p>", "As an emergent orientation in sociology, criminology, and criminal justice, cultural criminology explores the convergence of cultural and criminal processes in contemporary social life. Drawing on perspectives from cultural studies, postmodern theory, critical theory, and interactionist sociology, and on ethnographic methodologies and media/textual analysis, this orientation highlights issues of image, meaning, and representation in the interplay of crime and crime control. Specifically, cultural criminology investigates the stylized frameworks and experiential dynamics of illicit subcultures; the symbolic criminalization of popular culture forms; and the mediated construction of crime and crime control issues. In addition, emerging areas of inquiry within cultural criminology include the development of situated media and situated audiences for crime; the media and culture of policing; the links between crime, crime control, and cultural space; and the collectively embodied emotions that shape the meaning of crime.\n      </p>", "While the topic of homosexuality has gradually become largely debated within the Czech context, there is still little known about gay people themselves.

The presence of Acid House within the English countryside, and in particular the Home Counties, is situated as enhancing the problematic status of the subculture. The scale of measures taken against Acid House is related to Thatcherism's 'authoritarian populism'. Acid House is located in terms of a history of similar forms of popular cultural activity.

Aggregate analyses show that values reflecting a subculture of violence have substantial effects on the level of interpersonal violence among high school boys. Contextual analyses suggest that the school subculture of violence operates through a social control process. A contextual measure of school values regarding violence has a direct effect on interpersonal violence, controlling for individuals' commitment to these values. These results contradict the usual explanation of how the subculture of violence affects violent behavior. Further, evidence implying that values regarding violence predict other forms of delinquency suggests that the results may reflect a subculture of delinquency rather than a subculture of violence. Finally, young males are most likely to engage in delinquency when they go to schools where academics are valued, controlling for their own academic values.\n      </p>", "Social planners have been unable to understand and deal with widespread, apparently \"irrational\" recalcitrance among the people whose lives they are attempting to \"improve,\" because they hold an essentially rationalistic view of man.

Drawing on observations of frustration-instigated as distinct from motivation-instigated behavior in Maier's experiments with rats, and on speculations by Toynbee, the author maintains that, to explain, predict and alter the behavior of people in such subcultures, one must recognize the extent to which it reflects that institutionalized nonrational response to frustration which is here termed the \"analgesic subculture.\" The assertion is exemplified by reference to the folk subculture of the Southern Appalachians.\n      </p>", "I introduce two continuous measures of subculture involvement (ideological embeddedness and behavioral-relational involvement), and use them to examine the relationship between involvement in the jamband subculture and the affective meanings (evaluation, potency, and activity) associated with 18 roles that are relevant to that subculture. I expect the two measures of involvement to be related positively to the evaluation and potency of fourteen subculture roles (deadhead, drinker, drug user, environmentalist, festie, hippie, phishhead, rainbow person, rastafarian, raver, stoner, tourrat, vendor, wharfrat), and negatively to the evaluation and potency of four authority roles (capitalist, nark, police officer, venue security officer). Using data from self-administered surveys (N = 418 for familiar subculture and authority roles, N = 219 for less familiar subculture roles), I find that subculture members learn meanings for relevant roles as a result of their socialization in the subculture; more specifically, as a result of their levels of ideological embeddedness and behavioral-relational involvement. This study enhances other investigations of subculture and meaning socialization. First, whereas past studies have examined between-group meaning variation, I investigate within-group meaning variation. A within-group analysis should indicate whether or not groups are heterogeneous, a finding that might reduce negative acts such as stereotyping. Second, I introduce two continuous measures designed to capture two dimensions of subculture involvement: ideological embeddedness and behavioral-relational involvement. Similar to previous conceptualizations of involvement, these two measures represent both attitudinal and behavioral involvement. Third, previous qualitative research within the related Grateful Dead subculture suggests that although not all subculture roles are equal in terms of evaluation, most subculture roles tend to be equal in potency. I further investigate this hypothesis using evaluation and potency to represent the affective meaning of roles, and I examine the implications of these findings for the jamband subculture.\n      </p>", "The process of identification was studied in an attempt to utilize both psychological and sociological explanations of juvenile delinquency to examine the career of the individual delinquent. A positive relationship between level of self-evaluation and identification with a delinquent subculture was found among both self-reported and adjudicated delinquents. Delinquents with strong degrees of identification tend to have high levels of self-evaluation and delinquents with weaker degrees of identification tend to have lower levels of self-evaluation. These results help to spell out a transition process in the career of the delinquent.\n      </p>", "Subcultures are distinguished in terms of what they are not, highlighting differences with broader cultural characteristics. From this perspective, authenticity is drawn from external contrasts. This ethnographic study of a local punk scene shows that internal comparisons among participants centered on consumption styles also construct authenticity. This activity was dominated by three indigenous cultural processes: the publicized possession of consumer goods, stylized presentations of self, and conversational display of acquaintance with punk esoterica. In contrast to previous studies, this article shows how the interpretive particulars of consumption in talk and interaction move beyond style alone to feature the fluid complexity of punk authenticity.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "The primary purpose of this study was to compare and contrast an organization's official culture and its subcultures. The proposition that soft bureaucracies project a rigid exterior appearance, symbolizing what key stakeholders expect, while masking a loosely-coupled set of interior practices, guided this analysis of a police organization. The official culture (crime-fighting command bureaucracy) was examined as an arbitrary set of symbols and meaning structures arranged according to top management preferences. Using qualitative and quantitative data, the organization's subcultures were profiled. It was demonstrated that top management was unable to impose organization-wide conformance with the official culture. There was close conformance to the official culture in only one of five distinct clusters of officers (\"crime-fighting commandoes,\" 21 percent of the sample). Officers in the other clusters (\"crime-fighting street professionals,\" \"peace-keeping moral entrepreneurs,\" \"ass-covering legalists,\" and \"anti-military social workers\") substantially modified or rejected top management's dictates. They represented resistance subcultures, similar in their opposition to official culture, but unique in form. It was concluded that other organizations, not known for their monolithic image and solidarity, also encompass subcultures.\n      </p>", "This article investigates the ideological content of punk cuisine, a subcultural food system with its own grammar, logic, exclusions, and symbolism. As a shared system of praxis, punk cuisine helps to articulate subcultural identity, purpose, and politics. In the case of Seattle punks in the late twentieth century, their cuisine served to critique Whiteness, corporate-capitalism, patriarchy, environmental destruction, and consumerism.\n      </p>", "The fundamental tenet of the violent subculture hypothesis, in its generic form, is that violent behavior results from a set of proviolence values and attitudes. The present research was to test this hypothesis as an explanation of violence in Canadian amateur ice-hockey. Interviews with over 700 players and nonplayers yielded data on values and attitudes; self-reports of fighting and official records of major hockey penalties were used as measures of violent behavior. The results support the violent subculture hypothesis. Individuals who professed values and attitudes supportive of violence were significantly more violent than those who did not. The data do not support the societal version of the hypothesis, described by Wolfgang and Ferracuti and other theorists in the criminological tradition; values and attitudes were poor predictors of off-ice fighting and bore no relationship to social class. What the findings do point to is an occupational subculture, composed mainly of older players in highly competitive select and junior leagues, where professional criteria regarding the use of violence prevail. Compared to younger, house-league boys and to nonplayers, these performers endorsed values and attitudes of violence.\n      </p>", "Efforts to explain regional variations in rates of violent crime have frequently cited the southern subculture of violence thesis. However, the evidence for the existence of such a subculture has been inconclusive. This study investigates regional differences in the levels and determinants of support for interpersonal violence under defensive or retaliatory circumstances. Using data from the 1983 General Social Survey, this research finds that native southerners are disproportionately inclined to condone defensive or retaliatory forms of violence. There is evidence that the public religious culture of the South may play a significant role in legitimizing these types of violence. Some results are consistent with arguments that interregional migration and cohort substitution are attenuating regional differences in views regarding violence. Several directions for future research on violent attitudes are discussed.\n      </p>", "This research examines the hypothesis that violent behavior results from a commitment to a subcultural value and attitude pattern. Special attention is given to Wolfgang and Ferracutti's subculture of violence thesis. Two types of violent behavior are considered--interpersonal violence and violent crime. Findings are drawn from two independent studies: one on the values and attitudes associated with interpersonal violence in a national area probability sample of 1,429 adult Americans, and the other on value differences among 363 men incarcerated in a Michigan prison for various violent and non-violent felonious offenses. The data do not support the subculture of violence explanation of violent behavior. Additional findings are presented which indicate, in the national sample, that neither socio-economic status nor social class values are associated with violence.\n      </p>", "Objective To investigate whether deliberate self harm is associated with contemporary Goth youth subculture. Design Longitudinal cohort study. Setting School and community based study of young people living in the Central Clydeside Conurbation, Scotland. Participants 1258 people aged 19, surveyed in 2002-4 and followed-up since age 11 (1994). Main outcome measures Lifetime prevalence of self harm and attempted suicide and their association with Goth youth subculture, before and after adjusting for confounders. Results Identification as belonging to the Goth subculture was strongly associated with lifetime self harm and attempted suicide, with a prevalence of 53% and 47%, respectively among the most highly identified group, and evidence for a dose-response relation. Adjusting for potential confounders did not significantly attenuate this association. Analysis of other youth subcultures showed that this effect was primarily associated with Goth subculture. Conclusions Identification as belonging to the Goth subculture was the best predictor of self harm and attempted suicide. Although based on small numbers, additional longitudinal analysis suggests both selection and modelling mechanisms are involved, selection mechanisms possibly being more likely.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

This article suggests that lynching was largely a reflection of a facilitating subculture of violence within which these atrocities were situationally determined by cultural factors not reported in census and economic tabulations, or election returns. Lynching declined in the twentieth century, in part, as a result of segregation and disfranchisement policies, but mainly because state executioners replaced lynch mobs in carrying out the will of the white majority.\n      </p>", "Within the youth subculture of \"gothic,\" elements of occultism, the romantic transfiguration of the Middle Ages and a preference for the morbid and fantastic horror stories are mixed together into a fascinating blend. The predominant color is black, as the expression of a melancholic and gloomy feeling towards life. In gothic music as well, gloom is represented through a mixture of styles, including gothic metal, medieval music and Celtic music. In a school in Germany, we developed a major theatrical project that dealt with a circle of themes revolving around death, expulsion and destruction. Selected as the means for expression were poems and modern dance.\n      </p>", "The concept of subculture has long been used routinely in sociology despite many criticisms about the contradictory manner in which it has been defined and applied. One particular problem concerns the untenable distinction often made by sociologists between subcultures and countercultures; another is the implicit characterization of subcultures as either deviant, marginalized groups or heroic resisters against the hegemonic culture of global capitalism. In this paper, we attempt to demonstrate a method of teaching the concept of subculture to undergraduate sociology students that would remedy these two difficulties. We do this by offering working definitions of several terms, including common culture, subculture, idioculture, and social world. We conclude the paper by developing a classroom exercise to help students grasp the main differences between these various terms.\n      </p>", "Several researchers (Reed, 1972; Gastil, 1971; Hackney, 1969) have suggested that rates of interpersonal violence, particularly homicide, are relatively high in the South because the subculture predisposes Southerners to use violence more frequently than others. This thesis has been questioned by Loftin and Hill (1974) and Erlanger (1975) who show that situational and structural factors could account for regional differences in interpersonal violence. Our present data casts doubt on another version of the subcultural thesis. Reed (1972) and Hackney (1969) argue that the relation between cultural differences and interpersonal violence may be indirect: that Southern socialization within the family has a lifelong effect on individuals which is reflected in differential gun ownership among adults and that the differential availability of guns results in higher rates of homicide. Recent research (Zimring, 1968, 1972; Newton and Zimring, 1969) on the \"technical efficiency\" of guns as weapons makes this explanation plausible. We examine the recent survey data bearing on this version of the thesis. Using log linear analysis, we find that the region of residence at age sixteen, that is, the region of socialization, does not make it more probable that an individual will own a handgun as as adult. This cast doubt on the indirect version of the subculture of violence thesis. In conclusion we suggest new directions for research on regional differences in gun ownership and interpersonal violence.\n      </p>", "Notions of authenticity and identity in Dutch gothic subculture focus on the paradox of being a subcultural insider, i.e. being simultaneously an individual and a member of a homogenous group. This paradox also triggers the problem of authentic identity. Gothic insiders emphasize that they are not goths, but that they identify with what they describe as gothic, only to explain later that that is not authentic gothic. I will argue that this denial is a subcultural strategy, a way to 'ward off' classificatory strategies of dominant, non-subcultural culture. Namely, as soon as criteria for sub-cultural identity are conceptualised, they can be copied by outsiders, and this should preferably be avoided. Empirical material will display how gothic subcultural identity is practiced within the monitoring and conceptualising processes prompted by outsiders like the media, and how authenticity seems to be a void, nothing but an abstract, unspoken, sub-cultural morale.\n      </p>", "The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the thesis of a \"subculture of violence\" by examining the realtinships among region, racial composition, and the homicide rate for a sample of 204 Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSAs). The subcultural thesis has been partly discredited by previous studies based on samples of the American States. These studies report no effect of either region or racial composition on the homicide rate once socioeconomic and democraphic variables have been statistically controlled. My results for SMSAs, however, are quite different. Both southern region and racial composition exhibit appreciable partial effects even with theoretically important controls. The analysis also indicates significant interaction between racial composition and region. For SMSAs outside the South, racial compsition is strongly related to the homicide rate, whereas for southern SMSAs there is no significant relationship between these variables. The paper concludes with some suggestions for future on the subcultural thesis.\n      </p>", "Urban subculture theory asserts that living in urban areas provides opportunities for the establishment of social worlds based more on personal interest than on either kinship or traditional affiliations, resulting in urbanites' reduced involvement with kin through selective integration of family into social networks. Based on this theory, and findings supporting it, a model predicting strength of kinship ties was constructed to test its usefulness in predicting the inclusion of kin among individuals' closest personal relationships. At the same time, the model was used to look at the relationship between kinship ties and ties to co-workers, and to test whether there is a work friendship - kinship tie trade-off. Attention was given to differences between age-groups, and to whether kinship ties and co-worker friendships, including any trade-off between the two types of relationships, vary by age, as an indicator of life cycle stage. Regional differences in the application of the model were also considered. Results using a nation-wide sample of workers in the United States suggested that, contrary to urban subculture theory, closeness to kin tends to increase as residence becomes more urban. However, in separate regional and age-group analyses the model did appear to have some application as a predictor of close kinship ties and ties with co-workers, and the workplace did appear to serve as a source of friendships which offset the importance of kinship ties for some age-groups cross-regionally, and across age-groups in some regions of the country. Overall, results suggested that the factors predicting close ties with kin differ for different age-groups, and vary across different regions of the country.\n      </p>", "From the perspective of a social historian, Paul Jakov Smith examines how the great Ming dynasty novel \"Shuihu zhuan\" (Water margin) illuminates forgotten byways of Northern Song society. Despite a separation of five centuries between the received version of \"Shuihu zhuan\" and the events it portrays, Smith is able to use its depiction of arms instructors and swashbuckling manorial lords as a prompt for exploring a Northern Song military subculture, alternately suppressed and abetted by the state, that lies dormant in the Song sources themselves. By comparing the historical world of the Song dynasty and the fictional world of the novel, Smith reveals how \"Shuihu\" straddles the cultural milieux of both the mid- and late-imperial eras and marks the culmination of the Song-Yuan-Ming transition.\n      </p>", "Reproduction of social class through culture has puzzled social scientists especially in the Nordic, advanced welfare states where social equality has been the official policy of governments for most of the postwar period. In the following article, I address this issue through the emotional experience of class that culminates in the weekend excesses of youths and even the street-racing scenes of Helsinki. Based on ethnographic fieldwork with eighteen-to twenty-four-year-old male street racers of Helsinki, I argue that stagnant class locations build on stunted ambition and feelings of injustice. The cultural performances and camaraderie of these like-minded racers support these youths' public, carefree identities and subcultural careers. Instead of resisting exclusion, they conform to it, celebrating \"a room of his own\" where shared risk, craftsmanship, driving skill, and disregard of education prevail.\n      </p>", "This paper presents an ethnographic account of jazz music in Athens.

The paper distinguishes itself from the public health literature on crystal methamphetamine use in this population by shifting the analytic focus from individual-level factors of drug use to the role of social context. While individual-level factors--including self esteem and social awkwardness--are related to methamphetamine use, we argue that these factors arise in and are exacerbated by interactional pressures attendant to Manhattan's gay sexual subculture, which revolve around the expectation of peak sexual performance. Because methamphetamine is associated with increased self-esteem, increased libido, greater sexual endurance, diminished sexual inhibition, and a higher threshold for pain, the drug is used strategically by gay and bisexual men to negotiate sexual sociality and increase sexual pleasure. Hence, we suggest that there exists an elective affinity between Manhattan's gay sexual subculture and the particular pharmacological effects of methamphetamine--whereby the former strongly favours the latter as a systematic pattern of response. In turn, this relationship is linked to unsafe sexual practices or the social conditions that put gay men 'at risk of risk' of HIV infection. /// Cet article s'appuie sur 49 entretiens qualitatifs pour explorer les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents contextuels de l'usage des m\u00e9tamph\u00e9tamines dans un \u00e9chantillon d'hommes gay et bisexuels de Manhattan.

Mientras que los factores individuales, entre ellos la autoestima y las dificultades sociales, est\u00e1n relacionados con el uso de la metanfetamina, defendemos que estos factores aparecen y se agravan por las presiones interactivas y presentes en la subcultura sexual de los homosexuales en Manhattan que gira en torno a las expectativas de un m\u00e1ximo rendimiento sexual.

The effect of these nutrients was investigated on (1) induction, (2) induction and subculture, and (3) induction, subculture and regeneration stages. The basal $MSB_5$ medium was not optimal for each phase of barley culture. Decreased ammonium nitrate, increased potassium dihydrogen phosphate, sodium molybdate, cobalt chloride, and addition of glycine enhanced shoot bud induction and plant regeneration. The different media that were optimal for immature embryo culture were: $MSB_5$ medium supplemented with $20.70 \\mu M$ picloram, 10.30 mM NH4NO3, 6.25 mM KH2PO4, $2.06 \\muM Na_{2}MoO_4$ , $0.55 \\mu M CoCl_2$ , and $26.64 \\mu M$ glycine (for induction); $MSB_5$ medium supplemented with $12.47 \\mu M$ picloram, 10.30 mM $NH_{4}N0_3$ , and $0.55 \\mu M CoCl_2$ (for subculture); and $MSB_5$ medium supplemented with 0.2 \u03bc M picloram and 10.3 mM NH4NO3 (for regeneration). Primary cultures required 6 wk (without transfer) for morphogenic callus formation. Callus required 4 wk of subculture and another 4 wk on regeneration medium for optimal plant regeneration. The revised medium could also promote regeneration of the recalcitrant barley genotype RD-2552.

It was found that all six tumor explants tested became more sensitive to the action of nitrogen mustard on serial subculture, whereas the response of four explants which were X-irradiated was invariant with further subculturing. Furthermore, all but one explant yielded survival curves which were extremely similar, with D&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; values circa 440-610 rad. One line, from a seminoma, however, had a D&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; of 150 rad. These radiosensitive seminoma cells were, however, the most resistant to the action of nitrogen mustard. The increase in sensitivity to nitrogen mustard with serial subculture in vitro was not associated with any change in the proliferative rate of the cells, although it may be associated with an increase in the efficiency of transport.\n      </p>", "Cultured Trichoplusia ni cells in exponential growth were administered X-ray doses of 10,000 R and then subcultured.

From 24 to 96 hr after treatment, the X-irradiated cells were characterized by an increased consumption of oxygen that was nearly twice the amount utilized by control cells. The pH of the cell growth medium increases over 96 hr from 6.3 to 6.6 for irradiated as well as for untreated cultures, but since the number of X-rayed cells is less than half the number of untreated cells, the pH increase, per cell, of medium from irradiated cultures is about twice that of medium from control cultures.\n      </p>", "When bean and soybean tissue culture cells were subcultured into fresh medium the translatable levels of a small group of mRNAs increased rapidly and then decreased to a low level 10 h after subculture.

Culturally Situated Design Tools (CSDTs) are web-based software applications that allow students to create simulations of cultural arts-Native American beadwork, African American cornrow hairstyles, urban graffiti, and so forth-using these underlying mathematical principles. This article is a review of the anthropological issues raised in the CSDT project: negotiating the representations of cultural knowledge during the design process with community members, negotiating pedagogical features with math teachers and their students, and reflecting on the software development itself as a cultural construction. The move from ethnomathematics to ethnocomputing results in an expressive computational medium that affords new opportunities to explore the relationships between youth identity and culture, the cultural construction of mathematics and computing, and the formation of cultural and technological hybridity.\n      </p>", "A human brain cell culture grown in vitro has spontaneously transformed, as determined by morphology, growth characteristics, and karyotype analysis.

Thirty-six patients harbored mixed aerobic and anaerobic microbial flora, and the anaerobic gram-positive cocci were the predominant isolates recovered. The mean microbial recovery for patients with an acute abscess was 2.9 isolates, while in patients with chronic infections the mean microbial recovery was 5. The anaerobic populations outnumbered facultative isolates by two to one, and 34% of anaerobic isolates were recovered from subculture.

Shoot proliferation was influenced mainly by stock origin, with higher responses from the adult material than from the seedling material, and by the number of subcultures, with the largest rates of multiplication and elongation in the first subculture. In the first subculture, the adult material was characterized by high rates of shoot multiplication and shoot elongation, and some shoots were hyperhydric. On the other hand, in the first subculture the seedling material was characterized by lower rates of shoot multiplication and elongation, and some shoots were affected by apical necrosis. In the third and the fifth subcultures, shoot multiplication and elongation declined in both materials, and hyperhydricity or apical necrosis were never found, although higher multiplication and elongation were consistently found for the adult material.

The study of Morse and the fan culture surrounding it is presented in the context of a discussion of recent feminist work on the texts and audiences of popular culture. The textual analysis focuses on those elements of the programmes which contribute to its success as 'quality' television, and particularly on Morse as an example of the role played by nostalgic representations of Englishness in 'quality' media texts of the 1980s. The article goes on to discuss whether the presence of such representations in these programmes leads inevitably to a convergence of 'quality' and conservative ideology. The discussion of the ideological subtexts of the programmes then focuses on the area of gender representation, and on the extent to which feminist influences are discernible in this example of quality popular culture, particularly in its representations of masculinity. The second part of the article presents an analysis of a discussion group involving fans of the series, which was organized as part of a larger qualitative study of the fan culture surrounding the programmes. There is a detailed discussion of the impact of the social dynamics of the group on their readings of Morse. The analysis also focuses on the ways in which the discourses identified in the textual analysis, such as gender representation, quality and Englishness, are mobilized in talk about the programmes. Finally, the nature of the group made it possible to discuss the construction of a feminist subcultural identity in talk about a mainstream media text, and to identify irony and critical distance as key components of that identity, particularly in the discussion of the pleasures offered by the romance narratives of the programmes.\n      </p>", "This paper is an imaginative and enlightening survey of the opinions of about 700 students in the English classes at Mandalay and Rangoon Universities.

Sucrose supported the highest level of growth and the lowest was supported by the sugar alcohols used in the experiments (glycerol, mannitol, sorbitol). The growth and survival of callus were evaluated with different osmotic sources in media containing glycerol, mannitol, or sorbitol at a concentration of 0.2 M each for an extended period of eight subcultures (360 days). Two crucial points were identified: until the third subculture (135 days) the vitality seemed to be elevated; whereas the fifth (225 days) seemed to be a \"point of no return\" for tissues grown in glycerol and mannitol. Pretreatment with osmotic carbohydrates was shown to increase the magnitude of the morphogenetic events of callus subsequently transferred to sucrose-containing medium. Callus grown in the presence of mannitol and sorbitol showed a similar frequency of morphogenetic response. With respect to the media containing glycerol and sucrose, these induced more intense regeneration of shoots. When glycerol was present in the medium, however, we observed a synchronization of the morphogenetic response. Our results suggest that it is possible both to stimulate and to synchronize morphogenesis utilizing osmotic conditioning subcultures.\n      </p>", "This article examines the role of society and culture in shaping the opportunity structure and ambition formation of female gubernatorial candidates in all 50 states over a 40-year period.

The author argues that the female sociopolitical subculture within individual states heavily influences whether or not female candidates will enter and win their respective primaries and general elections. Rather than assuming that individual characteristics are the primary determinants of ambition formation, this research implies that it is necessary to analyze the political behavior within cultural contexts.\n      </p>", "It has been reported that hydroxyphenylethylamines, such as tyramine and octopamine, are toxic to tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) callus cultures grown in the presence of auxins, whereas calli grown in the presence of cytokinins and crown gall cultures are resistant to these amines (P. Christou and K.A. Barton [1989] Plant Physiol 89: 564-568). In an attempt to understand the underlying mechanism of this resistance, we compared the fates of tyramine in tyramine-sensitive and tyramine-resistant tobacco tissue cultures (cv Xanthi nc). The very rapid formation of black-colored oxidation products from tyramine in sensitive tissues suggested that the toxicity might be caused by the oxidation of tyramine by phenol oxidases present in the tissues or released into the medium after subculture. This was confirmed through many indirect procedures (effect of exogenously added tyrosinase, induction of polyphenol oxidase [PPO] activity by auxin, etc.). The study of tyramine structure-activity relationships further suggested that the toxicity of tyramine might be due to the formation of indolequinones after oxidation by PPO. Subculture of calli grown on 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid in a medium containing benzyladenine triggered a slow decrease in PPO activity and dramatic increases in peroxidase and tyramine hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (THT) activities. THT was undetectable in calli grown on 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid but very active in tyramine-resistant crown gall cultures. Moreover, when [3H]tyramine was fed in vivo to tyramine-resistant tissues, it was rapidly integrated into cell walls in the wound periderm formed at the periphery of the calli. Both the conjugation of tyramine and its integration into cell walls could compete with the formation of toxic quinones and therefore play a part in the resistance. Thus, it seems likely that the control of the toxicity of hydroxyphenylethylamines by cytokinins results primarily from changes in the metabolism and the compartmentation of these amines.\n      </p>", "Young leaf segments from plants growing both in vivo and in vitro were cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with auxins [naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)], cytokinins [kinetin (KN) and $N_6-benzyladenine (BA)$ ] and coconut liquid endosperm (CW). The explants from mature leaves did not show any growth and turned necrotic, while those obtained from juvenile leaves growing in vitro developed protocorm-like bodies (PLBs) at their cut surfaces within 4-8 wk depending on the growth medium. An optimum of 18 PLBs developed from leaf explants on medium supplemented with $2.0 mg l^{-1} (8.87 \\mu M) BA$ .

Examination of limited data on student dropouts and evidence from other studies provide a tentative basis for inferring that these changes probably reflected the impact of college attendance. The analysis also seeks to identify political factors contributing to the observed changes in civil-libertarianism. Using multiple regression and path analysis, it is found that exposure to Berkeley's political subculture both contributed independently to changes in civil-libertarianism and also served as a channel for the indirect influence of several entering political attitudes on civil-libertarian change.\n      </p>", "This study reports the selection and characterization of osteogenic precursors from human bone marrow which were isolated by two \"clonings\" and successive subculturing.

They respond to 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D3 by increasing osteocalcin synthesis and secretion, and to parathyroid hormone by increasing cyclic AMP synthesis. After the third subculture in the absence of $\\beta-glycero-phosphate$ , these cell lines formed lots of clusters which exhibit high alkaline phosphatase activity and positive von Kossa staining. X-ray energy spectrum shows that these cells are surrounded by \"budding\" structures containing calcium and phosphorus with a ratio Ca:P identical to those of pure hydroxyapatite.

Ives pursued an extended research program with the aim of challenging the acceptance of relativity theories, and became the most important American opponent of Einstein during that era. As part of his anti-relativistic efforts Ives also performed the famous Ives-Stilwell experiment. Usually interpreted as the first direct confirmation of the time dilation formula of special relativity theory, this experiment was regarded by Ives as proof of what he called the Larmor-Lorentz theory. Ives\u2019s heterodox views about relativity were mainly ignored by the scientific community during his lifetime. After his death, however, his criticisms of what the majority of physicists took for granted helped spark philosophical discussions in the late 1950s concerning the conventional stipulation of distant simultaneity in special relativity theory. Ives\u2019s anti-relativistic beliefs and actions allow for an analysis of the heterodox efforts of an accredited member of the scientific community and the subsequent process of his professional marginalization in a specific historical and scientific context. This paper has three aims: to uncover the epistemic roots of Ives\u2019s opposition to relativity; to analyze Ives\u2019s rhetorical strategies and the reasons why he failed to persuade his peers; and to reveal the divergence between the public network of allies Ives built in scientific publications and the hidden network of allies present in his correspondence. It will become clear that the hardening of Ives\u2019s tone against relativity and Einstein can be understood in light of his progressive marginalization and loss of recognized socioprofessional identity due to his unorthodox ideas. Ives\u2019s case is illuminating for the historical, philosophical, and sociological perspectives it provides on the complex mechanisms by which the margins interact with the mainstream of science, both in the production of certified knowledge and in the contextually contingent redefinition and reconfiguration of the boundaries of acceptable scientific discourse.\n      </p>", "A morphogenetically competent suspension culture was derived from embryonic axes of Glycine max cv.
