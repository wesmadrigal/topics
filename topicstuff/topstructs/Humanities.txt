State funding for heritage tourism helped CTH develop into a major advocacy organization that has provided funding and capacity building services to the state\u2019s heritage institutions while it also cultivated appreciation and understanding of Connecticut history. But because of state budget deficits and the failure of heritage tourism to sustain the state\u2019s history museums, heritage tourism may no longer offer a viable paradigm and CTH must likely develop a new model of the public humanities that engages more directly with public audiences and a wider variety of humanities organizations.\n      </p>", "This paper addresses some of the questions we face in establishing courses on teaching computing to humanists.

It begins with the question: must valid statistical analysis of any literary text be based on a complete linguistic description of the language of the text? It summarizes and evaluates over forty essays, giving details on works discussed, sample sizes used, statistical methods applied, and quotations from the researchers. The essay ends with a polemical summary of what has been done and what the future holds. It emphasizes the importance of extended pre-computational stages of learning about language and discourse analysis; reading previous research, building on and challenging theory; and the use of carefully crafted, small databases to test specific questions.\n      </p>", "The National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act of 1965 is the most ambitious piece of cultural legislation in American history.

As the sciences rely on explicit top-down theories connected to bottom-up maps and models, and whereas the humanities build on bottom-up differences within malleable top-down \u201ctheories\u201d (approaches, themes, theses, programs, methods, etc.), the changes in the sciences during this period contrasted sharply with the changes in the humanities. Part 2 discusses in detail how these two social transformations affected the histories of music theory and cognitive music theory. The former fractiously withdrew from its parent organization (AMS), whereas the latter was welcomed into SMPC. Inasmuch as both music theory and cognitive music theory rely on maps and models, Part 3 examines the metatheoretical importance of these terms for music cognition, music theory, and cognitive music theory. Part 4 speculates about the future\u2014how music cognition, cognitive music theory, and music theory contribute to the structure of musical knowledge. The intellectual potential of this unique triadic collaboration is discussed: psychology provides a commanding empirical framework of the human mind, while music theory and cognitive music theory logically model moment-to-moment temporal emotions and the auditory intellections at the core of musical art.\n      </p>", "This paper attempts to provide an overview of the development of humanities computing during the past twentyfive years.

It is noted that teaching computing to humanities students appears to be viewed with suspicion by some Computer Science and Humanities Departments. The two camps seem to fear, for different reasons, that issues and practices important to their disciplines will be compromised or watered down. This paper describes an attempt to reverse any such attitudes on the part of staff and students and to take undergraduates considerably beyond mere word processing and computer literacy. Various methods and techniques used in the course are presented and their value assessed. The importance of using a consistent computer interface to helping students form a stable conceptual model of computers is considered. We reflect on the value of teaching more about Human Computer Interaction and Artificial Intelligence than is usual in Humanities Computing courses.

The latter group of studies has generally focused on differences in epistemological beliefs for students who are studying in two different domains (e.g., nursing students versus physics students). In this study, we qualitatively investigate whether the epistemological perspectives of 60 science/engineering college students differs across the disciplinary areas of the sciences and the humanities. Our results indicate that such differences do exist and include a proposed grounded theory that describes how students' epistemologies may vary across knowledge domains.\n      </p>", "This bibliography argues a position: reading books and doing library research should play an important role in tracing inter-disciplinary connections in computers and the humanities courses.

Databases may be searched by using controlled vocabularies, free-text (natural language) terms, or a combination of both. A significant cause of recall failure in a free-text search is the inability of the searcher to think of all the terms an author may have used. The current study was undertaken to determine the potential value to humanists of a thesaurus integrating free-text terms from the humanities and social sciences. In the first part of the study, a sample of common-noun subject headings from the \"Humanities Index\" was analyzed to determine how many have at least quasi-synonymous terms. The subject headings were compared to terms in \"The Contemporary Thesaurus of Social Science Terms and Synonyms: A Guide for Natural Language Computer Searching\" to determine the overlap of terminology between the humanities and social sciences. The results indicate a high degree of overlap, suggesting that a thesaurus integrating terms from the humanities and the social sciences would be of value to scholars in both disciplines. Results also demonstrate that a high proportion of common-noun subject headings have at least quasi-synonymous terms useful for searching. In the second part of the study, searches for humanities scholars were conducted on controlled-vocabulary databases, using both controlled vocabulary and free-text terms to determine whether the latter retrieved additional relevant records not retrieved by the controlled vocabulary. The results indicate that combining both approaches yields more relevant items and higher recall than either method alone.

To demonstrate the social and political value of humanistic inquiry, scholars out to save the humanities have produced a series of rhetorical oppositions\u2014between skill and knowledge, between technique and art, and most fundamentally, between scientific method and humanistic method. Although these oppositions are untenable, they have nonetheless fractured fields like law\u2014fields that inhabit all of these ostensibly discrete arenas.\n         Moreover, the implications of these splits and fractures are more than administrative or methodological. They are also temporal.

In the UK, the AHeSSC (Arts and Humanities e-Science Support Centre) has played a coordinating role for seven projects funded by the Arts and Humanities e-Science Initiative.

The ratios regarding the religious background of these graduates are: one third Roman Catholic; one third Calvinist, one eighth Lutheran, and the rest were affiliated with the small Unitarian Protestant and Jewish denominations of the region. Members of Eastern churches (Greek Catholic and Greek Orthodox) were also present in small numbers. The principal means of estimating the under- or over-representation of religious denominations in the student body was analysing the religious composition of graduates from Transylvania only (almost 60% of graduates). Concerning the mainly Hungarian denominations, Unitarians were four times over-represented among graduates, Calvinists 2.7 times, and Catholics 1.8 times. In national surveys, Calvinists and Roman Catholics tended to be under-represented, but it seems this was counter-balanced in Transylvania by the urban nature of the ethnic Hungarian population. Lutherans were over-represented by a factor of 1.7. Most members of this group were Transylvanian Saxons living in German-speaking towns. An over-representation of Jewish students, which applied to both Budapest University and the country as a whole (on account of the sheer number of students attending Budapest University), could not be observed here. Indeed, Jewish graduates were under-represented by a factor of 0.9. The representation indices for the Greek Catholic population (0.16) and the Greek Orthodox population (0.07) effectively demonstrate that Romanians had little chance of graduating from the faculties examined. The analysis of temporal changes in the denominational composition of the student body reveals that Catholics \u2014 both Roman and Greek \u2014 reduced their participation over time, perhaps turning away from Transylvania in favour of Budapest. As a result, Kolozsv\u00e1r University became increasingly Calvinist. Transylvanian Jews underwent the most rapid process of modernisation, progressing from almost total exclusion to over-representation. The reason for Jewish under-representation \u2014 as shown by the initial survey \u2014 was that Transylvanian Jews lagged behind Hungary's urban Neolog Jewish communities. Similar over- an under-representation data demonstrate the differencia specifica of the Faculty of Humanities vs. the Faculty of Science, the differences regarding the social background of non-Transylvanian students, the success at the doctoral level, the recruitment of the elite, etc.\n      </p>", "In the St. Olaf model, students apply their German language skills in existing humanities courses outside the German department.

Mark Olsen's paper discusses this phenomenon and argues for large scale analyses of text databases that would incorporate a shift in theoretical orientation to include greater stress on intertextuality and sign theory. Part of Olsen's argument revolves on the need to move away from the syntactic and overt grammatical elements of textual language to more subtle semantics and meaning systems. While provocative and important, Olsen's stance remains rooted in literary theoretical constructs. Another level of language, the cognitive, offers equally interesting challenges for humanities computing, though the paradigms for this type of computer-based exploration are derived from disciplines traditionally removed from the humanities.

The paper uses concepts from communications theory to explain the features of computer conferencing most important to teachers in organizing on-line classes. Computer conferencing makes possible small group interaction through the rapid and convenient exchange of written texts. We are accustomed to experiencing small group interaction only in face-to-face settings. In computer conferencing one essential feature of face-to-face meetings is lacking, the physical presence of the members to each other, but it is replaced to some extent by new forms of textual self-presentation. The fact that interlocutors cannot see each other means they cannot exchange many of the tacit signs that play an important role in resolving ambiguities and establishing social control. Because of this, communication links tend to be more fragile in on-line systems than in a face-to-face setting. This gives rise to a form of \"communication anxiety\" characteristic of this new medium. Computer conferences are most successful where they are led by a \"moderator\" with specific social and technical functions that compensate for the loss of tacit cues in the on-line setting. Teachers can employ the moderating role to organize an on-line equivalent of the classroom. Effective techniques are identified for instructional applications of computer conferencing.\n      </p>", "This paper gives an account of the 'political understanding' of education, that is, the relationship of power and authority between government, teacher, parent and pupil.

The American Academy agreed to serve as the institutional base for the planning and development activities associated with this project. During the past year the Planning Committee organized several meetings to define the nature and scope of the proposed Center, including a national conference held in April 1974 at Wingspread, Racine, Wisconsin. At the meeting, a group of scholars with wide geographic and disciplinary representation discussed all aspects of the proposal, made useful recommendations, and responded enthusiastically to the concept of a national institute focussing on humanistic activity. The National Humanities Center would be an autonomous institution, located near a major university with suitable arrangements to share that university's resources.

Ces projets ont pour fonction p\u00e9dagogique d'int\u00e9grer aux \u00e9tudes d'ing\u00e9nieur les lettres, les arts et les sciences sociales.\n      </p>", "Nationalism has been largely unrecognized as one of the rules of knowledge production. This is surprising in the case of the humanities where disciplinary boundaries often correspond to national ones. The modern language disciplines such as French, German, and English study national languages and literatures. The rise of nationalism and the development of the literary traditions by these disciplines are historically contemporary. To call something a national literature is not merely to locate it geographically but to claim for it international significance. National literatures are not parochial but representative of all humanity because nations themselves are the subjects of world history. Scholars of the history and literature of the United States thus have needed to constitute their disciplinary objects in national terms. The constitutive role of nationalism in the humanities belies their claims to be apolitical and disinterested.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

In contrast, they tend not to make regular use of formal bibliographic (for example, abstracting and indexing) tools. The soundness of this approach resides in the scholars' familiarity with the literature of their specialization, the role of the literature--especially primary sources--in humanities scholarship, the importance of peer influence, and vocabulary softness in the humanities. An evaluation of the humanist's preferred approach, based on following bibliographic references from documents known to be relevant to twelve scholarly humanities questions, revealed that the approach complements, and in some ways surpasses, more formal approaches by identifying relevant literature not covered by standard bibliographic tools and by providing a more appropriate level of analytical access than the formal bibliographic apparatus. The following of bibliographic references depends critically, however, on the identification of appropriate source documents.\n      </p>", "The article presents a report on four 45 minute sessions with a group of 17 year old humanities students.

Writing's intrinsic subjectivity and the great variety of writing formats appropriate to diverse contexts raise fundamental questions about the empirical bias of the assessment culture taking root in U.S. higher education. At the same time, the academic training of humanist scholars, who typically have primary responsibility for writing pedagogy in universities, may predispose them to skepticism about assessment culture's broader mission. This article narrates the process by which the Humanities Department at Lawrence Technological University implemented a writing assessment process designed to address these challenges and evaluates the data generated by this process.\n      </p>", "The earliest and still most prevalent use of computers in the humanities is the compilation of concordances, rationalized vocabulary lists for literary works.

Whereas the literature in the sociology of science focuses on the natural sciences and defines originality as the production of new findings and new theories, we show that in the context of fellowship competitions, peer reviewers in the social sciences and humanities define originality much more broadly: as using a new approach, theory, method, or data; studying a new topic; doing research in an understudied area; or producing new findings. Whereas the literature has not considered disciplinary variation in the definition of originality, we identified significant differences. Humanists and historians clearly privilege originality in approach, and humanists also emphasize originality in the data used. Social scientists most often mention originality in method, but they also appreciate a more diverse range of types of originality. Whereas the literature tends to equate originality with substantive innovation and to consider the personal attributes of the researcher as irrelevant to the evaluation process, we show that panelists often view the originality of a proposal as an indication of the researcher's moral character, especially of his/her authenticity and integrity. These contributions constitute a new approach to the study of peer review and originality that focuses on the meaning of criteria of evaluation and their distribution across clusters of disciplines.\n
