We examined a number of parameters of population genetic and forensic interest based on the allele frequencies from 15 autosomal STR loci (D8S1179, D21S11, D7S820, CSF1PO, D19S433, VWA, TPOX, D18S51, D3S1358, THO1, D13S317, D16S539, D2S1338, D5S818, and FGA). All the studied loci were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, except loci D18S51 and FGA for both Muslim populations, even after applying the Bonferroni correction. The combined power of exclusion and combined power of discrimination values for all 15 STR loci were 0.9999 and &gt;0.99999, respectively, in both Muslim populations. Gene diversity values ranged from 0.6784 (TPOX) to 0.9027 (FGA) for Shia Muslims and from 0.7152 (CSF1PO) to 0.9120 (D18S51) for Sunni Muslims. The observed heterozygosity (Ho) ranged from 0.5833 (D18S51) to 0.8595 (VWA) in Shia Muslims and from 0.6818 (CSF1PO) to 0.8333 (D21S11) in Sunni Muslims and was lower than the expected heterozygosity (He) for 11 out of the 15 STRs typed. We analyzed the genetic affinities of the Shia and Sunni Muslim populations with their geographically closest neighboring North Indian, Middle Eastern, East Asian, and European populations using distance-based methods, including neighbor-joining trees and multidimensional scaling. In addition, we estimated the genetic contribution of the putative parental populations included in the analysis to the Shia and Sunni Muslim gene pool using admixture analysis. Although we observed a certain degree of genetic contribution from Iran to both Muslim populations, the results of the phylogenetic analyses based on autosomal STRs suggest genetic relatedness with some of the geographically closest neighboring Hindu religious populations.\n      </p>", "In the present article, I discuss Goldziher's contention (echoed in more recent literature) that from the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, Sunn\u012b Muslim scholars (\u02bfulam\u0101\u02be) became increasingly hostile to rational sciences such as logic. On the basis of discussions and fat\u0101w\u0101 by Sunni scholars in the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, I show that this idea is radically mistaken. Mainstream scholars in the Maghrib, Egypt and Turkey considered logic to be not only permissible but actually commendable or even a religious duty incumbent on the Muslim community as a whole (i.e. a far\u1e0d kif\u0101yah). Though there were dissenting voices in the period, such as the Q\u0101\u1e0d\u012bz\u0101del\u012bs, this seems to have been the mainstream opinion of Sunni scholars until the rise of the Salafiyyah movement in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.\n      </p>", "One point at which the difference between Sh\u012b\u02d3\u012b and Sunn\u012b law may dramatically and immediately impact upon the affairs of a Muslim family is on the occasion of the death of one of its members. The operation of the rules of succession frequently leads to very diverse results, depending on the sectarian affiliation of the deceased. The sectarian allegiance of the deceased, however, is not always easily ascertained, and the point may be contested by competing groups of would-be heirs. This essay examines the manner in which the Courts of South Asia approach the question of determining the sectarian affiliation of the deceased when this is necessary in order to resolve conflicts over the devolution of his (or her) estate. After examining the provocative litigation concerning the estate of Miss Fatima Jinnah, who, in life, had refused to identify herself as either a Sunn\u012b or a Sh\u012b\u02d3\u012b, I shall consider the question of whether South Asian Muslims could be given the option of electing whether Sunn\u012b or Sh\u012b\u02d3\u012b law shall govern the devolution of their estates.\n      </p>", "Drawing from work in feminist moral philosophy, Tobin argues that the most common methodology used in practical ethics is a questionable methodology for addressing practical problems across diverse cultural contexts because the kind of impartiality it requires is neither feasible nor desirable. She then defends an alternative methodology for practical ethics in a global context and uses her proposed methodology to evaluate a problem that confronts many Sunni Muslim women around the world.\n      </p>", "Contemporary African American followers of Sunni Islam are self-consciously articulating a form of eating that they see as liberating them from the heritage of slavery, while also bringing them into conformity with Islamic notions of purity. In so doing, they participate in arguments about the meaning of \"soul food,\" the relation between \"Western\" materialism and \"Eastern\" spirituality, and bodily health and its relation to mental liberation. Debates within the African American Muslim community show us how an older anthropological concern with food taboos can be opened up to history and to the experience of the past reinterpreted in terms of the struggles of the present.\n      </p>", "In an effort to raise interest in the subject of Islam's ritual legal material, I discuss here the strengths and weaknesses of three recent studies of Sunni Islamic purity law (\u1e6dah\u0101rah). In light of these studies, I investigate the degree to which theories and models drawn from the fields of anthropology and comparative religion may be said to shed light on Islamic ritual law and practice. As-to varying degrees-each of my selected authors contests the theories of cultural anthropologist Mary Douglas, special attention is paid to her work. My own opinion is that, as long as we proceed cautiously, an awareness of anthropological approaches and cross-cultural data, such as that proposed by Douglas, can be helpful in understanding (the uniqueness of) Islamic ritual law; and that there are wide-ranging benefits for students of Islam, anthropology and comparative religion in doing just this.\n      </p>", "In April 2004 a revolt broke out against the American occupation in the Iraqi Sunni town of Falluja. Besides a military confrontation, it was also a war of words how to conceptualise the clash of interests and values of the indigenous population in opposition to those of the American occupation. At the heart of this clash was the issue who represented the authentic values of Iraq. Authenticity was framed in the concepts of honour and dignity, which have a deep cultural resonance. The article deals with the three stages of the radicalisation of resistance in Falluja, each of them characterized by the predominance of a certain concept of honour and dignity. The first was expressed in tribal culturalist terms, the second in nationalist-religious terms, while the third was framed in radical Salafi terms in defence of the Islamic Umma. All three claims to authenticity are said to represent the true, authentic values of Iraq.\n      </p>", "This article investigates Iraqi schooling during the 1990s under Ba\u2019thist rule and after the regime\u2019s fall in 2003 and compares the treatment of Islam in the curriculum. I focus on the degree to which Iraqi textbooks under Saddam Hussein contained a Sunni bias and the changes introduced immediately after the 2003 US invasion of Iraq in 2003. To what degree did international actors effect curricular reforms during the years that followed the invasion? What educational policies did the Iraqi central government follow since then? I find that, as part of its religious policies during the 1990s, the regime symbolically acknowledged a Shi\u2019i perspective in textbook narratives. However, emergency revisions carried out on behalf of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) by international agencies in 2003\u20134 strengthened the Sunni bias in Iraqi textbooks, rather than erased signs of sectarianism from the textbooks. Since the CPA was dissolved in 2004, the government has gradually introduced more references to the Shi\u2019i tradition into textbook narratives.\n      </p>", "This study analyzes the connections among multilingual language practices, multilingual literacy practices, and social identities in two Sunni madrassahs in Mauritius. The study is framed by sociolinguistic and poststructuralist perspectives on language and identity, and social practice views of literacy. Data collection and analysis involved observations, interviews, and the analysis of written documents. In a national context that has long rejected Mauritian Creole as a language of education and literacy, the madrassah is nonetheless a place where both oral and written Mauritian Creole, among other languages, is used to religiously educate the children. The study revealed that the madrassah is a site where multilingual, multiliterate, and multiscriptural practices are used as resources to provide religious instruction, while at the same time being a place where fluid identities are shaped and negotiated through these resources. These findings suggest that dichotomies between institutionalized and local vernacular literacies and between religious and secular identities do not reflect the complexity of identities being constituted and expressed at the observed madrassahs. Speakers and readers may use multiple oral and written codes to negotiate social identities, with some identities being more negotiable than others.\n      </p>", "This article examines the ever-changing position of women in post-monar-chical Iraq. Ironically, many women's gains obtained under Saddam's Ba'athist regime were subsequently lost under the same regime. The end of Saddam's government in 2003 likewise led to contradictory outcomes for Iraqi women, empowering them in some ways and making them more vulnerable in others. Iraqi women themselves displayed a variety of dispositions, from the pre-2003 Ba'athist-controlled General Federation of Iraqi Women, to Shiite religious conservative women's groups, secular progressive Kurdish women's associations operating in autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan, and American-sponsored progressive women's organizations based in Baghdad. Disentangling the myriad experiences and trajectories of Iraqi women thus stands out as an important, complex, and overdue project for both gender studies and Middle East scholars. This article provides one of the first systematic and contemporary attempts to fill such a void.\n      </p>", "This study examines the curriculum of Islamic higher learning in eastern Iran in the early fifteenth century, based on authorizations to transmit (ij\u0101za) issued by or requested from Jal\u0101l al-D\u012bn al-Q\u0101yin\u012b (d. 838/1434-35), an important Hanafite traditionist and teacher in Timurid Herat. The contents of two ij\u0101zas-whose value as a source for the history of the transmission of knowledge in Islam has been demonstrated by Georges Vajda, A. J. Arberry, George Makdisi, and Jacqueline Sublet, among others-are summarized in schematic form, analyzed in terms of the subjects, texts, and authorities listed in them, and compared with contemporary as well as earlier curricula from other parts of the Muslim world. Viewed within the religio-political context of late fourteenth- and early fifteenth-century Iran, the \"core curriculum\" they represented provides further support for the idea of a Sunni revival under the patronage of T\u012bm\u016br's son and successor, Sh\u0101h-Rukh (811-50/1409-47), and confirms its strongly conservative nature.\n      </p>", "Sunni Islam is at heart a cult of authenticity, with the science of \u1e25ad\u012bth criticism functioning as a centerpiece designed to distinguish authentic attributions to the Prophet from forgeries. It is thus surprising that even after \u1e25ad\u012bth scholars had sifted sound \u1e25ad\u012bths from weak, mainstream Sunni Islam allowed the use of unreliable \u1e25ad\u012bths as evidence in subjects considered outside of the core areas of law. This majority stance, however, did not displace minority schools of thought that saw the use of unreliable \u1e25ad\u012bths as both a danger to social morality and contrary to the stated values of Islamic thought. This more stringent position has burgeoned in the early modern and modern periods, when eliminating the use of weak \u1e25ad\u012bths has become a common call of both Salafi revivalists and Islamic modernists. This article explores and traces the history of the various Sunni schools of thought on the use of weak and forged \u1e25ad\u012bths from the third/ninth century to the present day.\n      </p>", "The notion of \"the rule of the jurist\" is identified exclusively with Ayatollah Khomeini, and was implemented politically following the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979. What was perceived as a revolutionary innovation in \u0160i'a Islam, however, was seen as alien in Sunn\u012b Islam. Traditionally, Sunn\u012b 'ulam\u0101' were identified as \"men of the pen\", whose task was to preserve religious knowledge but not to assume state authority. Sunn\u012b Islamic movements of the twentieth century did not alter this traditional viewpoint. Most of their leaders actually criticized the 'ulam\u0101's submission to secular rulers. Indeed, Sunn\u012b circles\u2014as Khomeini himself\u2014spoke of the urgent need to establish an Islamic government to combat imperialism and Westernization, but did not assign any political function to the religious scholars. The paper focuses on a different view, that of \u0160ay\u1e2b Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 l-Sib\u0101'\u012b (d. 1964), of Syrian origin, who asserted in the late 1930s that 'ulam\u0101 are the best guardians of the nation's rights. Their entry into politics is neither improper nor deviant, he held, but rather a confirmation of the historic reality in the formative period of Islam. Al-Sib\u0101'\u012b's perception was put into practice with the establishment of the Muslim Brethren in Syria in 1946, but this perception failed to gain momentum. The paper illuminates an interesting episode in modern Sunn\u012b political thought: an early Sunn\u012b version of Khomeini's \"the rule of the jurist\". While the Sunn\u012b version remained a textual idea, the \u0160\u012b'ite version turned into living political reality, exposing the asymmetry between the status of Sunn\u012b and \u0160\u012b'ite 'ulam\u0101' in modern times.\n      </p>", "This article is the first comprehensive study of the conceptions of domestic privacy articulated by early sunn\u012b Muslim jurists. Focusing on exegetical and legal sources composed between the seventh and thirteenth centuries CE, I argue, first, that Muslim scholars regarded privacy as a legal category. Second, I demonstrate that notions of privacy developed over time: most scholars living within the first two centuries AH associated privacy with property rights, granting legal protection to assertions of privacy only if violations of privacy entailed an infringement of property rights; by contrast, scholars from the ninth century onwards developed privacy into a separate legal category, protecting it even when no property rights were violated. Finally, I argue that most Muslim scholars adopted an instrumental approach to privacy, which they viewed not as an end unto itself but rather as a means to promote a viable society, to prevent their community from disintegrating, and, ultimately, to ensure the Islamic nature of Society.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "This article analyzes the way in which a distinctly Sunni Islamic identity establishes its internal and external borders at the intersection of the historical perceptions of Christianity and Judaism on the one hand and Shiism on the other.

Drawing upon narrative theory and concepts surrounding canon formation, it is argued that in addition to the arenas of law and theology, community memory as performed through the practice of historical narration is a critical lens through which to understand the nature of authority, identity, and power in Muslim sectarian discourse.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "This paper examines the role that political institutions play in inducing or subduing ethnic identification. I provide a formal model of ethnic identification as a function of institutional design and social context that focuses on one question: what kinds of institutions will induce individuals to identify with the state rather than along ethnic lines? Among other things, the model offers predictions about when political institutions are capable of inducing a national identity. I conclude with an application of the model to the question of institutional design in Iraq. The model provides one explanation for why a period of low Sunni representation in Iraqi government would increase sectarianism, and why a more proportional Iraqi parliament may not remedy the problem.\n      </p>", "On the basis of my analysis of four works composed by al-Suy\u016b\u1e6d\u012b, I argue that hostility to logic was a predominant feature of Sunni scholarship, especially during the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries. Logic was condemned by distinguished Sunni scholars in Valencia, Fez, Aleppo, Iraq, and Mecca, but especially in Egypt and Syria. This conclusion confirms Goldziher's argument that resistance to logic started already in the 2nd/8th century and increased in the 13th and 14th centuries; and disconfirms al-Rouayheb s argument that opposition to logic was never predominant among Muslim Sunni scholars.\n      </p>", "The present study's objective is to analyze the phenomenon of the mustab\u015fir\u016bn in Twelver Sh\u012b\u02bfism in modern times. The term mustab\u015fir is used among (Twelver) Sh\u012b\u02bfites to refer to someone who has left his previous faith, converted to Sh\u012b\u02bfsm and adopted its doctrines. In this study we inquire into the meaning of the term in general, in the Qur\u02be\u0101n and its commentaries, and as a specific term. We examine the motivation for conversion to Sh\u012b\u02bfism, the types and status of converts and the reasons which drive them to convert, the pressures and threats which converts face from Sunn\u012b circles and how converts cope with these and respond to the attacks on them. The study also surveys mustab\u015fir websites and their contents, books which such converts have written, describing their conversion experience, as well as factors which have contributed to the popularity of the conversion movement, among them the support which Iranian cultural missions provide to converts, the Lebanon War of 2006 and the burgeoning popularity of \u1e24asan Na\u015fr All\u0101h, the political protection which many converts enjoy, monetary and economic emoluments given to converts, and Sh\u012b\u02bfte satellite TV stations and websites. The study's main conclusion is that the terms mustab\u1e63ir (\"he who has had his eyes opened\", convert to Twelver Sh\u012b\u02bfism) and istib\u015f\u0101r (the verbal noun: conversion) have taken on a clear and definite meaning, denoting a real trend in recent years, although still relatively limited in scope, so that at present and in the foreseeable future Sunn\u012b Muslims have no reason to fear this trend.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "This paper is presented in three parts and several sections.

A mixed picture is presented which draws attention to many problems that have impeded reconstruction efforts in the country. Some positive developments have also occurred including, for example, the introduction of a new constitution, presidential and parliamentary elections, as well as resumption of schooling for children that by mid-2006 had numbered four million throughout the country.

An analysis of the functions of this theory and a chronological study of some of its fundamental aspects reveal that this theory (i) played an important role in rationalizing the positive law that had frequently been characterized by arbitrariness and lack of coherence. Systematizing the methods by which judicial judgments were reached and bestowing on them the mantle of logic was a prerequisite to a successful attempt at rationalization; (ii) proved to have been responsive to change within the domain of the Shar\u012b\u02bfa-though the same cannot be said of secular developments that opposed the fundamental principles and spirit of religious law. Methodologically, this bears much significance for the Islamicist for it teaches that despite the religious boundaries in which it operated, legal theory was constantly changing.\n      </p>", "Physical, sectarian-based segregation is a recent phenomenon in Baghdad. This essay examines how this urban condition has resulted from U.S. political interventions in occupied Iraq, which have actively reproduced, intensified, codified and spatially reinforced the significance of sectarian difference. It discusses the emergence of sectarian militias, details the violent practices used to consolidate territory, and maps the transformation of once heterogeneous neighborhoods into separate Shi'a and Sunni enclaves. By focusing on intersecting security discourses and the erection of concrete walls by the occupying Multi-National Forces (MNF), the essay argues that Baghdad's new segregated neighborhoods have hardened and intensified patterns of internal conflict, diminishing the potential for reconciliation.\n      </p>", "This paper seeks to explore the wide range of interpretations resulting from the \u1e25ur\u016bf al-muqa\u1e6d\u1e6da\u2018a or 'the disconnected letters' of the Qur\u2019an. Typically considered a paradigmatic case of the mutash\u0101bih in the Qur\u2019an, exegetes have expended much time and energy speculating over the meaning(s) of these enigmatic graphemes. From the earliest exegetes to the later tradition, a chorus of possibilities and theories are encountered. The traditions of interpretations themselves are a testament to the Qur\u2019an's interpretive plurality throughout the centuries. This paper looks at the long tradition of broadly Sunn\u012b Muslim interpretation in regards to the disconnected letters to uncover the historic expansiveness of Qur\u2019anic hermeneutics. Linguistic, mystical and encyclopaedic approaches are especially highlighted for the sake of emphasising diversity. The paper concludes with an exploration of the 'limits' of interpretation as determined by the exegetes in response to the disconnected letters. \u064a\u0647\u062f\u0641 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0636 \ufe97\ufed4\ufe8e\u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0648\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u0637\u0639\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0623\u0648\u0627\u0626\u0644 \u0633\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0622\u0646 . \u0648\u0628\u0627\u0639\u062a\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u062b\u0644\u0627\ufe70 \u0648\u0627\u0636\u062d\u0627\ufe70 \u0644\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0634\u0627\u0628\u0647 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0622\u0646 \u0623\u0646\u0641\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0641\u0633\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u062c\u0647\u062f\u0627\ufe70 \u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631\u0627\ufe70 \u0648\u0648\u0642\u062a\u0627\ufe70 \u0637\u0648\u064a\u0644\u0627\ufe70 \u0641\u064a \u062a\u0623\u0645\u0644 \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0647\u0627 . \u0648\u0645\u0646\u0630 \u0628\u062f\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0641\u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0648\u0642\u062a\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0636\u0631 \u064a\u0639\u0631\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0641\u0633\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u062d\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0648\u0626\u0638\u0631\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0639\u062f\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0644\u062a\u0641\u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0648\u0641 \u0645\u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0634\u0647\u062f \u0644\u062a\u0639\u062f\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u062f\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0648\u0646 . \u0648\u064a\u0633\u062a\u0639\u0631\u0636 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u0627\u0644 \u062a\u0631\u0627\u062b \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0641\u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0646\u064a \u0644\u064a\u0643\u0634\u0641 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a\u0633\u0627\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0631 \u0644\u062a\u0641\u0633\u064a\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0622\u0646 . \u0648\u0633\u0646\u0633\u0644\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u0636\u0648\u0621 \u0628\u0634\u0643\u0644 \u062e\u0627\u0635 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a\u062c\u0627\u0647\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u063a\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0627\ufedf\ufebc\ufeee\u0641\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0633\u0648\u0639\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u062a\u0623\u0643\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0646\u0648\u0639 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0641\u0633\u064a\u0631 . \u0648\u064a\u062e\u062a\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0628\u0628\u064a\u0627\u0646 \" \u062d\u062f\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0641\u0633\u064a\u0631 \" \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0631\u0622\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0641\u0633\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u062a\u0646\u0627\u0648\u0644\u0647\u0645 \u0644\u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0648\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u0637\u0639\u0629 .\n      </p>", "           ", "The goal of this essay is to illustrate how Ebrahim Moosa's method of \"contrapuntal reading\" can be applied fruitfully to the Sunni hadith literature. My case study is the set of penalties (hudud) for illicit sex, which include flogging, stoning, and banishment. I propose a fresh reading of these sacred texts that brings to the fore the ethical dimension of Prophet Muhammad's conduct, especially his strong reluctance to apply these measures. I conclude by identifying four ethical problems that the stoning penalty raises and suggest how the hadith literature can be read to argue against the validity of this specific punishment.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The frequency of endogamous marriages within surnames is greater than randomly expected ones. An incomplete reproductive isolation is observed among the five dominant surnames. Consanguineous marriages occur more often outside the village than inside. Leaving out marriages between long distances, a small median distance of 6.36 km is recorded. The neighborhood area works up to be 552.2 km\u00b2, which is rather small. There is an underlying process of breeding isolation by distance. A generation length of 21 years has been used for examining the temporal change in consanguineous marriages and inbreeding, which generally appears to increase. There is a general trend of decline in consanguineous marriages towards the southern part of West Bengal and eastern part of Assam among the Bengalee Muslims. The frequency of consanguineous marriages is 7.3% out of all marriages (N = 1153) that have taken place in six generations in the population. The first cousin marriage is nearly 50% of all marriages. Patrilineal marriages are common in marriages between second and third cousins. An increase of consanguineous marriages in the younger generation was observed, but the total frequency agrees with a general trend of a decline in the frequency of consanguineous marriages among the Muslims in this part of India.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Based on a survey of relevant \u1e25ad\u012bth exempla and fiqh discussions-including sections dealing with saliva as a premier conductor of pollution, jan\u0101ba (sexually induced impurity), menstruation, mul\u0101masa (contact with the opposite sex), and the question of water already used in ablutions-I argue that the shar\u012b\u02bfa accords all human beings a clean ritual slate from birth, and, what is more surprising, flatly denies the possibility of persons becoming ceremonially contaminated or contributing to the ritual defilement of others under any circumstances. These characteristics make the Islamic \u1e6dah\u0101ra system an intriguing anomaly in the world of religious purity codes.\n      </p>", "Like all other Islamic sects and movements, the Mu\u02bftazil\u012bs were very attentive to the study of the Qur'an and many among their ranks authored books on Qur'anic exegesis. Unfortunately, the overwhelming majority of taf\u0101s\u012br compiled by Mu\u02bftazil\u012bs are not extant and, for a long time, the vast majority of the scholarly community has been under the impression that the only surviving Mu\u02bftazil\u012b tafs\u012br was al-Zamakhshar\u012b's Kashsh\u0101f. However, two other major Mu\u02bftazil\u012b taf\u0101s\u012br have come to light, and now we can begin to determine the contribution of the Mu\u02bftazil\u012b exegetical tradition to the field of tafs\u012br. This study will argue that the demise of the Mu\u02bftazila does not necessarily mean that their tradition of Qur'anic exegesis died out; nor for that matter their theology and religious thought. To this end, it will examine two cases that demonstrate that the Mu\u02bftazil\u012b tradition of Qur'anic exegesis was, at least to some extent, absorbed into the mainstream exegetical traditions of Twelver Sh\u012b\u02bfism and Sunnism. The first case details the influence of al-Jishum\u012b's Tahdh\u012bb on Majma\u02bf al-bay\u0101n by the prominent Twelver Sh\u012b\u02bf\u012b exegete al-\u1e6cabris\u012b.

However, some genomic regions may be selectively neutral or adaptive in hybrids and thus may potentially cross species barriers. We examined postzygotic isolation between ecologically similar species of Louisiana Iris: Iris brevicaulis and I. fulva to determine the potential for adaptive introgression in nature. Line-cross analyses allowed us a general overview of the gene action responsible for fitnessrelated traits. We then used a QTL mapping approach to detect genomic regions responsible for variation in these traits. Although hybrid classes suffered reduced fitness for many traits, hybrid means were equivalent to at least one of the parental species in overall estimates of maternal and paternal fitness during the two years of the field study. The genetic architecture underlying the fitness-related traits varied across field site and year of the study, thus emphasizing the importance of the environment in determining the degree of postzygotic isolation and potential for introgression across natural hybrid zones.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "This article explores competing discourses and understandings of proper Muslim practice as they are reflected in controversies among female supporters of Islamic moral renewal, and between them and Muslims who do not consider themselves part of the movement. Supporters of Islamic moral renewal highlight the primacy of deeds, such as proper behavior and correct ritual performance, as ways to validate their newly adopted religious identity. Their emphasis on proper action, and their dismissal of talking about religiosity, stand in tension with their own tendency to construct elaborate narratives about their decision to embrace what they consider a more authentic form of Islam. The importance they attribute to the embodied performance of virtue leaves many supporters of Islamic renewal in a double bind: despite their claim to unity, their conception of the relationship between individual ethics and the common good, combined with the tendency among supporters of Islamic moral renewal to set themselves apart from \"other Muslims,\" reinforces trends of differentiation among Muslims who aspire to a new moral community.\n      </p>", "We used genetic analysis to examine the mating strategies of male and female Eastern Screech-Owls (Otus asio) in central Kentucky. DNA fingerprinting revealed no evidence of extra-pair fertilizations in 23 broods (80 nestlings). Such results suggest that pursuit of extra-pair copulations by male and female screech-owls may be costly. One possible cost for females is the risk of losing the nest site. Alternatively, pursuit of extra-pair matings by females might be energetically expensive, thereby conflicting with egg production. Male screech-owls provide food for their mate (and young) during much of the breeding season and such feeding probably affects reproductive success. Males pursuing EPCs might have less time for foraging and, as a result, reduced reproductive success.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "This paper discusses a sample of eleven extensive works of tafs\u012br \u2014 in the narrow sense of the word, i.e. tafs\u012br musalsal \u2014 written by Sunn\u012b authors from Egypt, Syria, Indonesia and Turkey between 1967 and 2004. For the purpose of analysis, it proposes a basic typology based on the author(s) and style of the respective commentaries, differentiating between 'scholars' commentaries', 'institutional commentaries' and 'popularising commentaries'. It goes on to examine the way in which they make use of exegetical authorities and traditions in their discussion of two particular exegetical problems found in Q 9:111\u201312. The results allow for the introduction of additional analytic categories based on the authors' aims and underlying attitudes. Building on these, the paper points to regional tendencies within contemporary Qur'anic exegesis and argues that regional differences can, to a large extent, be explained by differences in the structure and curricula of academic theology within the Islamic World. In general, it concludes that the genre of tafs\u012br tends to be a domain of male academic theologians and a relatively conservative field; boldly innovative approaches to the interpretation of the Qur'an are more frequently found in other exegetical genres. \ufef3\ufee8\ufe8e\ufed7\ufeb6 \ufeeb\ufeac\ufe8d \ufe8d\ufedf\ufe92\ufea4\ufe9a \ufecb\ufef4\ufee8\ufe94 \ufee3\ufee6 11 \ufe97\ufed4\ufeb4\ufef4\ufeae\ufe8d \ufee3\ufeee\ufeb3\ufecc\ufe8e \ufe91\ufe8e\ufedf\ufee4\ufecc\ufee8\ufef0 \ufe8d\ufedf\ufec0\ufef4\ufed6 \ufedf\ufee0\ufedc\ufee0\ufee4\ufe94 -

It is well established that such organizations favor in-group members, but under what conditions do they serve out-group communities? To address this question, the authors compare the welfare programs of the predominantly Sunni Muslim Future Movement and the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah in Lebanon. Although they operate under the same institutional rules and economic contexts and boast the largest welfare programs in their respective communities, the Future Movement aims to serve a broader array of beneficiaries, including non-Sunnis, whereas Hezbollah focuses more exclusively on Shiite communities. Based on analyses of an original data set of the spatial locations of welfare agencies, qualitative data from interviews with providers and beneficiaries, and case studies of areas where the two parties established and did not establish welfare agencies, the authors argue that distinct political mobilization strategies\u2014whether electoral or nonelectoral\u2014explain different patterns of service delivery across the two organizations.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Even though Sh\u012b\u02bf\u012b inheritance law is strikingly different from Sunn\u012b law, the Sunni interpretation of the Qur\u02beanic texts has rarely been questioned. In this essay I propose a new interpretation of the relevant texts and examine the system of inheritance that this interpretation seems to imply. The system proposed is closer to Sh\u012b\u02bf\u012b than to Sunn\u012b law, but even Sh\u012b\u02bf\u012b law shows the influence of characteristically Sunn\u012b interpretations of the Qur\u02be\u0101n.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Cilardo, who deploys J. Schacht's \u1e25ad\u012bth-analytical criteria to date the kal\u0101la traditions, points to the first half of the 2 nd century AH and, occasionally, to the end of the 1 st century AH as the period in which most of these traditions were circulated. Powers, who combines the literary evidence with the documentary evidence of BNF 328a, concludes that kal\u0101la traditions evolved during the second half of the first and the first quarter of the second century AH. In the present essay I employ the isn\u0101d-cum-matn methodology to date several kal\u0101la traditions discussed by Powers and Cilardo.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Floral visitors of the homoploid hybrid species, Iris nelsonii (Abbeville Red Iris), were observed and identified in order to determine whether Abbeville Red Iris flowers are visited by similar floral visitors as its progenitor Iris species. The most common floral visitors to Abbeville Red Iris flowers were Archilochus colubris (Ruby-throated Hummingbird), which were also largely successful in transferring a pollen dye-analogue between Abbeville Red Iris flowers. Other floral visitors included butterflies, wasps, and bee species. The pollinators of the Abbeville Red Iris have not been previously documented. These results suggest that pollinator isolation may be important in preventing hybridization between the Abbeville Red Iris and its geographically closest progenitor species, /. hexagona (Dixie Iris).\n      </p>", "It is common practice in perinatal epidemiology to calculate gestational-age-specific or birth-weight-specific associations between an exposure and a perinatal outcome. Gestational age or birth weight, for example, might lie on a pathway from the exposure to the outcome. This practice of conditioning on a potential intermediate has come under critique for various reasons. First, if one is interested in assessing the overall effect of an exposure on an outcome, it is not necessary to stratify, and indeed, it is important not to stratify, on an intermediate. Second, if one does condition on an intermediate, to try to obtain what might conceived of as a \"direct effect\" of the exposure on the outcome, then various biases and paradoxical results can arise. It is now well documented theoretically and empirically that, when there is an unmeasured common cause of the intermediate and the outcome, associations adjusted for the intermediate are subject to bias. In this paper, we propose 3 approaches to facilitate valid inference when effects conditional on an intermediate are in view. These 3 approaches correspond to (i) conditioning on the predicted risk of the intermediate, (ii) conditioning on the intermediate itself in conjunction with sensitivity analysis, and (iii) conditioning on the subgroup of individuals for whom the intermediate would occur irrespective of the exposure received. The second and third approaches both require sensitivity analysis, and they result in a range of estimates. Each of the 3 approaches can be used to resolve the \"birth-weight paradox\" that exposures such as maternal smoking seem to have a protective effect among low-birth-weight infants. The various methodologic approaches described in this paper are applicable to a number of similar settings in perinatal epidemiology.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
