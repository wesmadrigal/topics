We monitored boater compliance with the VWAA program in 1993 and 1997. Of 1,664 \"boating events\" observed on Lake Onalaska, boats intruded into the VWAA on 127 occasions. Boating events have increased from 1.82 boating events/h in 1986-88 to 1.97 in 1993 and 2.58 in 1997. Despite a 60% increase in boating traffic, the lake-wide disturbance rates in 1997 were comparable to that in 1981. We attribute this to a significant reduction in the proportion of lake-wide boating events that resulted in disturbance, a direct consequence of the VWAA program. Rate of intrusion into the VWAA was 0.11 per boating event in 1997 compared to 0.18 per boating event in 1986-88. Boating disturbances to waterfowl within the VWAA occurred at about half the rate (0.24 to 0.28 disturbances\u00b7 hr-1) observed prior to establishment of the program (0.48 disturbances\u00b7 hr-1). We also identified access points used by boaters and boating activities that were most likely to result in intrusion into the VWAA and associated disturbance to waterfowl. Results of these analyses have provided useful information to resource managers for targeting public education efforts. The VWAA program has contributed to the value of Lake Onalaska as a waterfowl refuge and demonstrates an effective collaboration among government agencies and non-governmental organizations.\n      </p>", "Predictions of the geographic spread of introduced species are often limited by a lack of data on their mechanisms of dispersal. We interviewed boaters and inspected boating equipment at public boat launches on Lake St. Clair (Michigan, USA) to assess the potential for the zebra mussel, an invasive bivalve, to be dispersed overland to inland waters by transient recreational boating activities. Several mechanisms associated with recreational boating were found to be capable of transporting either larval or adult life stages. Larvae were found in all forms of water carried by boats (i.e., in live wells, bilges, bait buckets, and engines) but were estimated to be 40-100x more abundant in live wells than other locations. Dilution in receiving waters should, however, greatly reduce the risk of establishing new populations by the introduction of larvae. Contrary to common belief, mussel dispersal from these boat launches did not occur by direct attachment to transient boats. Rather, adult and juvenile mussels were transported primarily on macrophytes entangled on boat trailers and, less frequently, on anchors (5.3% and 0.9% of departing boats, respectively). Combining these data with estimates of survival in air and reported boater destinations, we predict that a maximum of 0.12% of the trailered boats departing these access sites delivered live adult mussels to inland waters solely by transport on entangled macrophytes. While this is a small probability, high levels of vector activity resulted in a prediction of a total of 170 dispersal events to inland waters within the summer season from the primary boat launch studied. Many other potential vectors remain to be assessed, but the dispersal of zebra mussels by trailered boats, particularly by \"piggybacking\" on macrophytes entangled on the trailers, must be controlled in order to limit further range expansion of the zebra mussel within North America.\n      </p>", "Thirty million Americans are participating in recreational boating as a major form of leisure activity. They will spend $1,500,000,000 on a total of 6,500,000 pleasure craft this year. How did boating reach these fantastic proportions and what are the reasons for its growth, particularly in those years following World War II? Reasons are given for the rise of recreational boating as the nation's number one family sport.\n      </p>", "The concentration of lead in fish muscle tissue from lakes where boating is heavy and where it is prohibited was measured. The lead levels ranged from less than 0.05 to 1.35 ppm but did not differ significantly between those in the controlled and noncontrolled boating lakes. Lead levels apparently pose no public health hazard.\n      </p>", "L'Amour Fou and Celine and Julie Go Boating show that radical form and viewer enjoyment are not mutually exclusive.\n      </p>", "Objectives: Public policy has treated drinking and boating as though it were analogous to drinking and driving. Accordingly, recent Federal and state laws to prevent drinking and boating have focused solely on alcohol use by the boat operator. This study was designed to determine boaters' knowledge about the epidemiology of boating fatalities and how boaters perceive the risks of drinking and boating. Methods: In the summer of 1995, the authors conducted a survey by mail of a random sample of 600 owners of boats registered in Massachusetts. Results: Survey results indicated that boaters believe passengers can safely drink more than operators. Respondents also thought that people on boats at rest can safely drink more than people on boats underway. Conclusions: The results of this study could be helpful in designing future boating safety campaigns by identifying gaps in knowledge about about the risks of drinking and boating for both operators and passengers.\n      </p>", "To identify risk factors predicting the involvement of boat operators in incidents resulting in at least one fatality, the authors obtained data from a mail survey of registered boat owners in the State of Ohio and from the Boating Accident Report (BAR) files for 1983-86 compiled by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. Additionally, they reviewed Ohio death certificates for those years to identify cases missed by the BAR system. Forty percent of the fatal incidents would have been missed by a search of death certificates alone. During the period studied, 107 boating incidents resulted in 124 deaths. There were 0.9 fatal incidents per million boat-operator hours. Factors found to be associated with an increased risk of a fatal boating incident were the operator being younger than 30 years, having fewer than 20 hours of boat operating experience, and lacking formal boat safety training. Canoes, kayaks, rowboats, and inflatables were associated with a higher rate of fatal incidents per million hours of use than were motorboats. Young age and lack of experience were associated independently with increased risk, explaining some of the effects associated with types of boats and with lack of training. The findings suggest that supervised experience, safety training programs aimed at young operators, and interventions specific to certain types of boats are likely to reduce boating fatalities.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Much has been written about the designed landscape in the eighteenth century in terms of aesthetics, designers, literature and iconography, but little has been said about the way these landscapes and the buildings within them were actually used. This paper is part of an on-going study for a PhD thesis that addresses this question. Here it concentrates on the element of water in the landscape. The origins of water in parks and gardens are functional. With the rise of the landscape movement in the eighteenth century many former stew ponds and mill ponds were adapted to undertake an ornamental role. As the century progressed, fish-farming decreased, though angling, which is both in a sense productive as well as recreational, continued to be enjoyed. But the use of lakes for boating is far more closely associated with pleasure than with pragmatism. Its popularity and the wealth of evidence of that popularity that comes down to us proves that the direct role of water in the experience of the pleasure ground was as important as its indirect aesthetic contribution.\n      </p>", "Thermal refuges are important for the endangered Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris) during winter cold periods in temperate latitudes. However, little research has examined impacts on manatees from human disturbance during these critical periods. We studied the effect of recreational boating activity on manatee use of established sanctuaries in the natural thermal refuge created by warm-water springs in Kings Bay, Crystal River, Florida. We examined the relationship among manatee use of the study area and sanctuaries, temperature, and level of boating activity. Manatees continued to use the Bay regardless of the number of boats present; however, their use of sanctuaries in the southern portion of the Bay increased (P&lt;0.001) as number of boats increased. Temperature, as expected, was inversely related to manatee use of the study area. Human activity patterns were variable, with significantly greater numbers of boats in the study area on weekends (x\u0304=32.7, SE=2.71) than on weekdays (x\u0304=10.7, SE=1.23). We concluded that recreational boating influenced manatee distribution, sanctuaries are important to manatees in Kings Bay, and sanctuaries are an effective management tool to reduce the impact of boating activities on manatees.\n      </p>", "We studied the effects of boating and navigation activities on the recruitment of coastal fish in the Stockholm archipelago in the NW Baltic proper. The impacts were quantified by sampling metamorphosed young-of-the-year (Y-O-Y) fish in inlets adjacent to i) routes for medium-sized passenger ferries; ii) berths (small marinas) with small boats; and iii) references. Species with high preference for vegetation were negatively influenced by boating and navigation activities and species with low preference positively influenced. Pike (Esox lucius) Y-O-Y were significantly more abundant in reference areas, while bleak (Alburnus alburnus) were more abundant in dredged marinas. No statistically significant patterns were identified for perch (Perca fluviatilis) although there was a trend of low abundance along ferry routes. Many species of nearshore fishes are dependent on submerged vegetation as spawning and larval substrate, structural refuge and feeding habitat. Our results suggest that the negative effects from boating and navigation activities on the coverage and height of vegetation, especially on species of Chara and Potamogeton spp., may contribute to changes in the Y-O-Y fish community.\n      </p>", "A survey was conducted primarily to determine the number of boats requiring launching facilities at a lake and to determine answers to other boating questions. A BIBD as a subset of another BIBD gave usable information on the primary topic while obtaining supplementary information with a minimum cost and number of interviewers. The launching information contained in the BIBD was analysed to estimate the total number of boats launched in a day and the proportion of launchings in each of seven time periods during a day. Estimates were obtained from the usual BIBD analysis and also from an initial procedure, a fixed margins procedure, and an iterative least squares procedure where a multiplicative Poisson model was assumed. The fixed margins estimation procedure seems best and can effectively be obtained from the BMDP log linear model package.\n      </p>", "One of the experimental acting techniques currently popular in contemporary cinema, improvisation achieves its greatest potential when it is brought into a dynamic relationship with more conventional modes of aesthetic discourse. \"Celine and Julie Go Boating\" and \"Nashville\" present contrasting examples of films that use improvisation in a self-conscious way with varying success.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Hull fouling communities have been recognized to harbour non-indigenous species (NIS), but presence should not be equated with transport. In this study, we characterize the presence of NIS in hull fouling communities, determine if host vessels transport these species and evaluate the importance of recreational boating as a vector for introduction and spread. Location Coastal British Columbia (BC), Canada. Methods Dive surveys in BC marinas were conducted to record the presence of NIS and to estimate their per cent cover. In addition, a boater questionnaire survey was used to determine common travel and maintenance practices. These results were combined to investigate the potential for recreational boats to transport NIS. Results Nine NIS, including the highly invasive ascidians Styela clava and Botrylloides violaceus y and the macroalga Sargassum muticum y were found in hull fouling communities on recreational boats. Overall, per cent cover was generally low; however, niche areas were commonly fouled, even on active and otherwise clean boats. Fouling of niche areas was not related to either antifouling paint age or travel frequency, and fouling levels were highly variable among individual boats both within marinas and across regions. Main conclusions Recreational boating is a major vector contributing to the spread of marine invasive species. Our results indicate that recreational boats represent a high-risk vector both for primary introduction and secondary spread of marine NIS and should be subject to vector management regulations.\n      </p>", "Zoning is a method to mitigate conflict between recreational and commercial vessels on water surfaces.

We chose sites with no damage (reference sites) to compare to those with propeller scarring within each of the two geographic locations. Thirty 141-m2 sites in both Charlotte Harbor and Tampa Bay, representing a gradient of scarring from 6% to 31% of the total area, were sampled in spring and winter 1996 along with reference sites to evaluate effects of propeller damage on abundance of the pinfish, Lagodon rhomboides, and the pipefish, Syngnathus scovelli. Additionally, 60 sites in both Charlotte Harbor and Tampa Bay representing areas with up to 50% scarring and comparison reference sites were sampled in spring 1997 to investigate whether propeller scar damage impacted epibenthic shrimp abundance and community structure in seagrass. Our results indicated no significant difference in pinfish density in scarred vs. reference areas; fish abundances were remarkably similar between sites regardless of the differing amount of vegetation removal. Patterns of pinfish abundance between damaged and reference sites were consistent over seasons (spring vs. winter) and between geographic locations (Charlotte Harbor vs. Tampa Bay). Pipefish abundance was significantly higher in scarred vs. reference seagrass beds in Charlotte Harbor in spring. Moreover, total shrimp densities were not significantly different between propeller-damaged and reference sites at either geographic location. Hippolyte zostericola was the most abundant of the eight most dominant shrimp species in both scarred and reference sites at both locations but comprised a higher relative proportion of the shrimp community in scarred sites in Tampa Bay. While our study targeted some of the highest reported levels of scarring within Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor, negative impacts on fish and shrimp abundance were not detected.

Burrow diameter, distance of each burrow from the high water mark, mean sediment compactness, and mean particle sizes of the sediment were compared among nine sites (two island and seven mainland) with different levels of human impact. Lower burrow densities, smaller mean particle size, and more compact sediment were recorded at the more disturbed beaches. Mean burrow densities at the sites without boating activity were higher, regardless of high or low disturbance. Burrow distribution was random at all beaches although more burrows were observed near the low water level on shores with more human activity. Pulau Hantu and East Coast Park had only 0.1% and 7.3% of juvenile burrows, respectively, indicating a low recruitment rate of juvenile ghost crabs.

Navigable locations in the bay are about 1.8 m deep (tidal range 0.5 m). Sediments are primarily fine sand or coarser. This study examined particulate resuspension and PAR (light) extinction caused by the secondary wake of motorboats (disturbance generated beneath and immediately behind a boat by a moving hull and propeller). When boats traveled in the navigation channel (depths 1.5\u20132.2 m), sediment resuspension in boat wakes was highly variable (up to 400 mg/l). While some slow-moving displacement-hull vessels did not measurably disturb surface particulates, disturbance was generally related directly to engine horsepower. Light extinction in boat wakes was severe with &lt; 10% of surface PAR reaching the bottom, although heavy sediment loads (e.g., visible brown water) from propeller wash were short-term phenomena. Light extinction sufficient to stress eelgrass (&lt; 40% surface PAR) lasted &lt; 0.5 h. If boat traffic averaged 3 vessels per hour\u2014a common occurrence in summer\u2014repeated disturbance maintained sufficient sediment load in the water column to sustain elevated light extinction in the navigation channel. However, the coarse nature of Cape Cod's glacially-derived sediments promoted relatively rapid sediment settling times (order 2 hours), limiting widespread impact except when tides were low (i.e., when sediment resuspension is maximum). Turbidity and light reduction caused by storm winds were more widespread and longer lasting than effects caused by boating. Where sediments are coarse, physical damage from propeller turbulence (which causes long lasting scarring of the bottom) was judged to be a more serious result of boat operation than was light reduction.\n      </p>", "We studied how recreational activity affected wintering bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) on the Skagit River Bald Eagle Natural Area (SRBENA) in northwest Washington in 1985-86, 1986-87, and 1987-88. Winter use of the SRBENA was high for both eagles (peak of 264 birds/day) and recreationists (peak of 115 events/day), and human-eagle interactions were common. Our study assessed how recreationists affected eagle numbers, distribution, activity, and feeding on chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta). The number of eagles in our study area was negatively correlated with the daily number of recreational events (n = 163 days, R = -0.679, P &lt; 0.01), and feeding activity declined exponentially with increased recreational activity (r = -0.445, P &lt; 0.001). On weekends when recreational use was high, fewer eagles used the river and they fed less than on weekdays; feeding was high following weekend disturbances. Disruption of feeding activity was most pronounced between 0800 and 1100 hours. An empirically-derived model predicted that feeding was reduced 35% in the SRBENA because of recreational use. Based on flushing responses and flushing distances, foot traffic was most disturbing to eagles, fishing boats were intermediate in effect, and eagle-viewing boats were least disturbing (P &lt; 0.001). However, boat traffic, especially motorboats, disturbed a greater portion of the eagle population than foot traffic. Boats that were early in the daily sequence of events and in early-morning hours were most disruptive to eagle behavior (P &lt; 0.01). Eagles feeding on the ground were less tolerant (P &lt; 0.001) of recreationists than eagles perching in trees. Flushing responses were lower and flushing distances were shorter (P &lt; 0.05) on weekends than on weekdays. Eagles resumed feeding relatively rapidly after the initial disturbances of the day, but, after 20 recreational events, eagles were slow to resume eating and, after 40 events, feeding was uncommon (P &lt; 0.05). Feeding resumed rapidly after disturbance by fishing boats (P &lt; 0.05) and slowly after eagle-viewing boats (P &lt; 0.05), because fishing boats were earlier in the daily sequence of events. Eagles required nearly 4 hours to resume feeding after disturbance by foot traffic compared to 36 minutes after boat traffic. Experimental boat disturbances (n = 156) indicated that eagle numbers were lower on weekends and in afternoons because of recreational activity (P &lt; 0.01) subadults were less tolerant of disturbance than adults (P &lt; 0.05), and boating was more disturbing on narrow than on wide river channels. Our evidence indicated that some eagles were displaced to secluded areas during disturbances. Flushing responses declined over the winter season (P &lt; 0.001), but flushing distances were unchanged (P &gt; 0.05). We recommend prohibiting recreational activity in the SRBENA during the first 5 hours of daylight within 400 m of eagles to minimize disturbance of feeding behavior, restricting foot traffic and the use of motorboats, enhancing chum salmon runs in secluded river reaches, and providing public education to increase support for management actions.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Although previous studies proved that boats can have a negative impact on seagrasses when their anchors and/or rotating props are in direct contact with the plants, very little is known about the indirect impacts (e.g., hydrocarbon emissions, oil leaks, and waves) that boats can have on seagrasses. This study quantified the impact of boat-generated waves on a Ruppia maritima habitat in Chesapeake Bay. During a calm and clear day, a V-hulled boat was driven at two speeds through a study site in the bay at high and low tide. Waves, suspended solids, nutrients and light levels were monitored before, during, and after the boat runs. The possible negative impacts (increased sediment resuspension, release of sediment nutrients, and reduced light levels) were much smaller than expected, being minimal when compared to natural fluctuations in this habitat (conditions to which the plants have acclimated). The strongest impact was observed at low tide when boat-generated waves resuspended a small amount of sediment, which was redeposited within minutes. Boat-generated waves apparently also caused porewater pumping, which increased the concentration of ammonia in the water column. This has the potential to contribute to eutrophication and, over long periods of time, to have a negative impact on seagrass beds. High boat speeds at high tide seem to minimize detrimental conditions in seagrass habitats. In contrast, stormy and cloudy days as well as dusk and dawn, when light availability is reduced, are the most vulnerable conditions for seagrasses. Fortunately, recreational boating activity is usually reduced under these conditions.\n      </p>", "Schinus terebinthifolius (Brazilian pepper), a native of South America, is currently naturalized in 20 countries worldwide and can alter native systems by displacing flora and forming monotypic stands. The primary described mechanism of seed dispersal is through consumption of fruits by birds and mammals. We evaluated an alternative dispersal method by evaluating the potential for S. terebinthifolius growing in freshwater and estuarine environments to disperse via water currents. Specifically, we: (1) determined the duration fruits remained buoyant in three salinities, (2) estimated the viability of seeds after 7 days in water, (3) estimated the dispersal rate of floating solitary fruits, and (4) examined the role of boat wakes in moving seeds above mean high water at the shoreline. The length of time fruits floated in 0 ppt water (4.9 days) was significantly less than 15 ppt saltwater (6.2 days), and 30 ppt saltwater (6.9 days). After 7 days, over 13% of seeds remained viable in 0 ppt, 15 ppt, and 30 ppt water. By combining mean dispersal rates and the mean number of days fruits floated, we calculated individual fruits could be transported 16.9 km in 0 ppt and over 22 km in 15 and 30 ppt water. To increase germination, seeds must be stranded above the intertidal zone. Wind wakes alone never achieved this result; however, boat wakes plus wind wakes significantly increased the movement of fruits above the intertidal region into drier soils. The use of both vertebrate dispersal vectors and water dispersal may potentially increase the rate of invasion, establishment, and survival of S. terebinthifolius in freshwater and estuarine environments.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       \n                \n                        \n                            <div class=\"wall\">Moving Wall: 3 years&nbsp;<a class=\"popUp\" href=\"/page/info/help/popUps/movingwall.jsp\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"vrtM\"  src=\"/templates/jsp/_jstor/images/info.gif\" alt=\"What is the moving wall?\" /></a>", "       \n                \n                        \n                            <div class=\"wall\">Moving Wall: 3 years&nbsp;<a class=\"popUp\" href=\"/page/info/help/popUps/movingwall.jsp\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"vrtM\"  src=\"/templates/jsp/_jstor/images/info.gif\" alt=\"What is the moving wall?\" /></a>", "", "Boat collisions with manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris) account for about one-quarter of manatee deaths annually in Florida. This emphasizes the need to influence boaters' behavior through an understanding of their knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and behavioral intentions toward manatees and their conservation. We conducted a telephone survey of a random sample of boat users whose boats were observed in Tampa Bay, Florida. Five hundred and four boaters completed the survey, a cooperation rate of 55%. Respondents had a mean score of 6.2 on a 10-question knowledge scale, and supported manatee conservation efforts with a mean score of 3.84 on a 5-point support scale based on seven statements. Boaters indicated more support for increased public education than for stringent regulations such as speed and wake limits in sea grass areas, no-entry areas, or increased patrols. Greater knowledge about manatees was positively correlated with support for manatee conservation. To understand boating behaviors, we used the sociopsychological theory of reasoned action to analyze boaters' disregard for speed zones. Results indicate a strong normative influence on boaters' behavioral intention to follow speed zones, with respondents highly motivated to comply with law enforcement. The survey results provide a basis for recommendations about public communication interventions.\n      </p>", "Human activities have had profound effects on bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) populations. Few experimental studies exist that address the effects of human activities on foraging eagles during the breeding season. Information from these types of studies is needed so that resource managers can allow humans and eagles to coexist. We investigated the response of breeding bald eagles to human activities in foraging areas on the Columbia River estuary, Washington-Oregon, during spring and summer, 1985 and 1986. We distinguished between 2 forms of interaction. In the first, a moving human approached a stationary eagle and induced a disturbance. This type of interaction was rare on the Columbia River estuary and accounted for a minor proportion of an eagle's time-energy budget. Only 20% of all moving human activities observed during this study resulted in human-eagle encounters within 500 m, and &lt;6% of all encounters resulted in a visible disturbance to an eagle. In the second form of interaction, an eagle had a choice of alternative foraging sites, some of which may have had human activities occurring nearby. In this situation, the eagle had the freedom to choose a destination, given the pattern of human activities. This type of interaction represented the major form of human-eagle interaction on the Columbia River estuary. To investigate this, we studied 6 pairs of eagles in each of 2 years; each pair was sampled 3 times during the breeding season, corresponding to incubation, nestling, and postfledging stages of the nesting cycle. Each sample consisted of a 3-day control period, during which we monitored \"normal\" eagle activity patterns, and a 3-day influence period, during which we \"disturbed\" (i.e., stationary boat with observer) a high-use foraging area. We compared eagle activity patterns within 1,200 m of the experimental disturbance between sampling periods. Eagles typically avoided an area within 400 m of the experimental stationary boat, although avoidance areas ranged between 200-900 m among pairs. In most cases, eagles spent less time and made fewer foraging attempts in the sample area during the influence period. Responses were consistent among nesting stages, although foraging activity increased dramatically and was more concentrated in the high-use areas during the later nesting stages. Although we cannot decisively conclude that human activities were directly responsible for current eagle spatial use patterns, the results of the experimental disturbances confirmed that boating activities have the potential to significantly affect eagle spatial use patterns. Based on these results, we developed a model of human-eagle interactions in foraging areas. We used this model and the results of this study to develop several alternative management strategies involving temporal and spatial restrictions of human activity. We recommend buffer zones 400-800 m wide around high-use foraging areas of bald eagles as the most appropriate management strategy for the Columbia River estuary.\n      </p>", "Boating is a popular form of recreation in the United States. Unfortunately, many people drown due to boating-related accidents each year. Since many such drowning deaths are preventable through the use of personal floatation devices (PFDs), an observational study was conducted to quantify and evaluate the number and demographics of the individuals who choose to wear life jackets in King County, Washington. Further efforts were then directed toward evaluating the effectiveness of educational campaigns focused on increasing PFD usage and general boating safety. Highly significant increases were found in the use of life preservers overall and within various subgroups of the population. Total PFD use increased from 19.8% in 1992 to 31.3% in 1994.

Exotic species can be conspicuous, and their spread is often correlated with human activity. The rapidity of the Dreissena invasion in North America and its economic impacts provide a unique opportunity to study the invasion process. Trailered boating traffic may be the most important vector for the transport of zebra mussels among unconnected bodies of water. Therefore, knowing the activity patterns of boaters should allow us to predict the explicit regional-scale pattern of geographic spread. We used the results of a large boating survey conducted by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to estimate the volume of boating traffic between waters known to contain zebra mussels (Great Lakes) and inland Wisconsin waterbodies. We found, (1) the most probable source of zebra mussels entering Wisconsin is Lake Michigan, (2) the most probable destinations are in eastern Wisconsin, and (3) geographic proximity to a source population and overall boater use are poor predictors of probability of invasion. Attention to human activity patterns may help predict the spread of other invading taxa.\n      </p>", "This article develops a modeling approach for a count dataset for recreational boating trips that shows a frequency of zero counts significantly higher than that expected for Poisson-distributed data.

During the same time period, proposals for hydro electric power development on the Kawarau threatened to eliminate white water rafting and severely modify jet boating; during the last five years a revival of the region's gold mining industry, which was founded in the 1860s, has threatened rafting on the Shotover River.

The proper choice or origin zones is unclear, but a semilog form is more appropriate than a double log form.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The usual policy prescription to this type of problem is to step up monitoring efforts to deter excessive drinking. However, this may be too expensive. This paper examines an alternative strategy--substituting lower blood alcohol limits for monitoring blood alcohol levels. Statutes that lower blood alcohol limits would be especially useful in areas such as recreational boating where monitoring would be very costly. This same policy could be used to curtail socially excessive blood alcohol levels in air, bus and rail transportation and recreational activities such as snowmobiling and skiing.\n      </p>", "Objective: To describe environmental and personal risk factors associated with watercraft-related drownings. This information may be useful in developing boating safety programs, regulations, and enforcement priorities. Methods: A companion article in this issue (Unintentional Drownings Among New York State Residents, page 448) summarizes an investigation of 883 nonbathtub drownings among New York State residents for the years 1988 to 1994 using medical examiner, coroner, police, and hospital records in addition to death certificate data. This report details the environmental and personal risk factors associated with 216 watercraft-related drownings. Results: Ninety-three percent of watercraft-related drowning victims were male, with the highest rate of drowning observed among males ages 15-44 years. Most commonly, the victim entered the water when the watercraft capsized (36%), the victim fell overboard (24%), or the victim intended to swim (11%). Personal flotation devices (PFDs) were known to be worn by only 9% of drowning victims, and in these cases other risks overwhelmed the effectiveness of the PFD. Of 73 individuals 15 years of age or older for whom adequate blood alcohol concentration analyses were provided, 44% were positive for blood alcohol. Conclusions: Based on this study, increased use of PFDs, avoidance of dangerous currents, and less alcohol use by operators and passengers of all types of watercraft would result in a reduction in watercraft-related drownings. In addition to continued education efforts, boating safety measures that deserve consideration include enforcement of current PFD and boating while intoxicated (BWI) regulations and expansion of BWI laws to apply to all boaters.\n      </p>", "The investigators considered the relationship between participation in aquatic activities and the consumption of alcohol, with their implications for the risk of drowning. In a telephone survey with random-digit dialing, interviewers asked Massachusetts residents ages 20 years and older how often they engaged in various aquatic activities, in what settings, and how often they drank alcohol in connection with participation in aquatic activities. Of 294 respondents, 79 percent of the men and 72 percent of the women reported participating in aquatic activities during August 1988, the month prior to the interview. Respondents were asked to identify their most recent aquatic activity. The mean number of days of participation in the month was 13. The most frequently reported aquatic activities were swimming (76 percent), followed by sunbathing (74 percent), power boating (25 percent), and fishing from shore (15 percent). Among those persons reporting participation in aquatic activities, 55 percent had been at the ocean on the most recent occasion, 26 percent at lakes or ponds, 17 percent at pools, and 2 percent at rivers. Among those persons reporting aquatic activities, 36 percent of the men and 11 percent of the women reported having drunk alcohol on the most recent occasion. Those who reported drinking in aquatic settings were more likely to report driving after drinking than those who did not drive. Implementation of new Federal regulations and State laws concerning drinking and boating should be accompanied by public education on the risks of drowning if aquatic activities and alcohol consumption are combined.\n      </p>", "In this article, a seemingly unrelated Poisson regression model (SUPREME) is presented as an alternative to using Zellner's seemingly unrelated regression model for estimating a system of recreation demand functions. SUPREME provides estimates that are asymptotically more efficient than equation-by-equation Poisson estimates and circumvents the bias and inconsistency problems that result when using Zellner's seemingly unrelated regression model. Additionally, SUPREME is applied to an empirical problem dealing with the value of recreational boating and the findings indicate that the SUR consumer surplus estimates are substantially different from those of SUPREME.\n      </p>", "We studied flushing responses of wintering bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) to military firing activity, helicopter overflights, and boating on the Nisqually River and Muck Creek on the Fort Lewis Army Reservation, Washington, during 1991-94. Eight percent of 1,452 eagles monitored near Muck Creek flushed during 373 firing events; 45% from ordnance explosions, 9% from automatic weapons fire, 6% from artillery impacts, 4% from mortar impacts, and 3% from small arms fire. Flushing by eagles decreased with increasing distance from firing events (16% flushed at 0.5-1.0 km, 9% at 1-2 km, 4% at 2-4 km, and &lt;1% at 4-6 km). Forty-seven percent of 919 eagles flushed in response to 48 helicopter overflights, 37% on the Nisqually River and 53% on Muck Creek. Sixty-one percent of 1,825 eagles flushed in response to 52 experimental boat disturbances on the Nisqually River. Subadults flushed more often than adults, and eagles feeding or standing on the ground flushed more often than those perching in trees. Our data suggest that ordnance explosions, low-level helicopter overflights, and boating should be restricted near eagle foraging areas.\n      </p>", "The Santee County Water District in southern California operates a system of recreational lakes for which treated wastewater is the principal supply. After activated sludge treatment and detention in an oxidation pond, effluent percolated through a shallow natural aquifer is chlorinated before discharge into the lake system. Bacteriological and virological quality of the lakes has been satisfactory. Recreational uses of the reclaimed water include boating, fishing, and swimming. The lakes have developed a reasonably well-balanced ecological system, although eutrophication has become a problem. The area appears to have great aesthetic appeal.\n      </p>", "Random Utility Models are widely applied in studies of recreation demand. The model is particularly useful when the number of recreation sites from which individuals may choose is large. Yet, when the number gets too large, say in the hundreds, estimation becomes burdensome. We present an analysis suggested by McFadden (1978) for dealing with large numbers of sites. We estimate a model using randomly drawn opportunity sets. We use each person's chosen site plus a random draw of as few as eleven other sites (when hundreds are available) to estimate a plausible behavioral model.\n      </p>", "Researchers are just beginning to discover the importance of seagrasses, such as Halodule wrightii, to coastal ecosystems, but unfortunately seagrasses are being eliminated because of human manipulations. In the current study three locations of seagrass beds in Tampa Bay were studied: seagrass beds next to Tampa Bayside Marina, outside the marina, and a control group from Ft. DeSoto. The marina sites are disturbed by boating activities, which do not occur at Ft. DeSoto. It is hypothesized that the seagrasses next to the marina will have lower chlorophyll a, b, and carotenoid pigment concentrations as well as lower seagrass densities than at Ft. DeSoto because of boating disturbance and possible gasoline in the water. Although water analysis did not detect the presence of gasoline compounds in the water, seagrass density was significantly greater at Ft. DeSoto than the other two sites. Seagrass samples from each site were dissolved in Dimethylformamide to determine their photosynthetic qualities. From spectrophotometer readings at 480, 510, 646, and 664 nm the total chlorophyll a, b, and carotenoid concentrations were determined. All tests supported the hypothesis that the seagrass beds had greater amounts of chlorophyll a, b, and seagrass density, but carotenoids did not have significant difference among the three sites. This research is the first step to a project monitoring the health of H. wrightii at Tampa Bayside Marina that is being transplanted.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Population viability analysis using these data projects a slightly negative growth rate (-0.003) and an unacceptably low probability of persistence (0.44) over 1000 years. The main factors affecting population projections were adult survival and fecundity. A 10% increase in adult mortality would drive the population to extinction over a 1000-year time scale, whereas a 10% decrease in adult mortality would allow slow population growth. A 10% decrease in reproduction would also result in extinction. We conclude that management must focus on retaining and improving the conditions under which manatee demography operates. The major identified agent of mortality is boat-manatee collisions, and rapidly increasing numbers of humans and registered boats portend an increase in manatee mortality. Zoning of manatee-occupied waters for reductions in boating activity and speed is essential to safeguard the manatee population. If boating regulations being implemented by the state of Florida in each of 13 key coastal counties are completed, enforced, and effective, manatees and human recreation could coexist indefinitely. If regulation is unsuccessful, the Florida manatee population is likely to decline slowly toward extinction.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

These craft plus transients represent a sizable mobile pollution force. Past practice has been overboard discharge of wastewater without treatment. The Water Resources Commission has promulgated rules and regulations to control this problem.

(4) The model was used to predict water turbidities from typical boat movement patterns.
