{"total_words": 129, "documents": ["This article outlines a consumer\u2010focused approach for the study of consumer behavior. I argue that much of the existing literature, by developing knowledge that focuses on the determinants of consumer purchasing, is implicitly biased toward a marketing perspective of consumer behavior. In contrast, I propose the need for a consumer\u2010focused approach that would advance knowledge aimed at helping consumers make wiser purchases. This approach should address the most important and challenging consumer decisions, describe consumer behavior in a manner that leads to prescriptions, consider the actions of other parties in the marketplace, and identify biases unique to or exacerbated by the consumer context. This article then illustrates what such a consumer\u2010focused approach would imply for consumer research in three areas: negotiations, financial services, and auctions.\n      </p>", "In May of 1997, the genesis of the SEC Internet Enforcement Program was synthesized and elaborated upon in this publication in an article entitled SEC Enforcement and the Internet: Meeting the Challenge of the Next Millennium. A Program for the Eagle and the Internet. Back then, Internet Enforcement strategies remained the subject of intense debate\u2014 and \"Enforcenet\" was, for the most part, just a theory. Now, more than four years later, the same author revisits the SEC's Internet Program, this time using a litany of empirical evidence from which to draw conclusions. In this Article, the author: (i) provides some general background on the Internet and how it has transformed (and empowered) today's investment community; (ii) analyzes the history of Internet-related securities fraud, tracing its evolution to date; (iii) explains the SEC's significant and expansive efforts to combat securitiesrelated Internet fraud; and (iv) offers some conclusions about the overall efficacy of the SEC's Internet program. Given its now hefty track record of close to 300 Internet related enforcement actions charging close to 950 entities and individuals, the SEC's enforcement efforts appear to have succeeded even better than expected, keeping Internet users safe from online con artists\u2014 all while actually enhancing or even bolstering (rather than, as some theorized four years ago, constricting or even hindering) the rapidly growing flow of legitimate Internet commerce.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "The behavior of stock traders and lottery buyers can teach us about our common aspirations, thoughts, and emotions and help answer many questions of finance.\n      </p>", "We used two distinct methodologies to examine the profitability of a sample of U.S. day traders. The results show that about twice as many day traders lose money as make money. Approximately 20 percent of sample day traders were more than marginally profitable.

This makes it important to identify the sources of differentiation advantage that can result in higher market share. Insights from the resource-based view are utilized to identify on-line brokerage services that may create value for consumers and result in higher market share for on-line brokerage firms. Ownership of process patents for on-line brokerage activities is positively correlated with differentiation advantage. Direct access to the trading floor, unlimited free real-time quotes, and 24/7 live customer service are also correlated with differentiation advantages. The identification of specific services associated with higher market share sheds light on how on-line firms differentiate themselves from their competitors.\n      </p>", "In two landmark decisions in 1987 and 1989, respectively, Shearson/American Express, Inc. v. McMahon and Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., the U.S. Supreme Court in effect mandated that disputes in the securities industry that are the subject of predispute arbitration agreements be resolved by arbitration panels rather than by the courts. At the time these two decisions were issued, most knowledgeable people shared the belief that the securities industry had worked diligently to achieve this result and looked forward to the protections and benefits that the new litigation forum would provide. Indeed, it was widely accepted that the businesspeople, lawyers, and securities industry representatives who comprise the majority oi the pools from which arbitrators are drawn would be conservative in their decisions and, in general, would favor the industry's positions. There was also widespread concern that these securities arbitration panels might begin to erode or effectively limit certain legal positions in favor of public investors adopted by the courts. Interestingly, these anticipated results did not come to pass. Indeed, after fourteen years of experience with securities arbitrations, it is possible to reach certain tentative conclusions that are not at all consistent with the anticipated results. In a number of important areas, instead of favoring defendant brokerage firms and their personnel, securities arbitration panels appear to have stretched or reached beyond existing legal authorities in order to expand the rights and the protections accorded to members of the investing public.\n      </p>", "This Article describes a variety of factors that encourage both command and control regulation and regulatory incrementalism. The author warns that \"incremental regulation fails when the underlying economics or competitive context, or the technology itself, move other than in slow incremental steps.\" With the accelerating changes in technology, markets, and competition as well as significantly greater globalization of the financial industry, the author asserts that \"a broader, bolder approach is not only desirable, but absolutely necessary.\" He argues for \"goal-oriented\" regulation, in which regulators articulate broad standards and allow market participants\u2014driven by competition\u2014to determine how best to satisfy them.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Regardless of what business model a broker-dealer ultimately selects for itself, developing or enhancing an on-line capability will be a necessity. Federal and state laws and regulations, as well as self-regulatory organizations rules require broker-dealers to supervise their on-line trading systems and marketing activities. Scrutiny by state and federal securities regulatory authorities of on-line broker-dealers has increasingly focused on systems capacity issues and the disclosures made, or not made, by management with regard to the benefits and drawbacks of on-line trading. Broker-dealers that provide on-line trading capabilities to their customers should focus their attention on matters involving systems capacity, advertising and investor education, suitability, best execution, pricing of market data, relationships with internet portals, on-line discussion forums, customer privacy, electronic books and records, and day trading. In these circumstances, more on-line broker-dealers have conducted compliance reviews of their supervisory procedures and on-line trading systems to take into account new rules and other guidance provided by securities regulators. This Article examines issues broker-dealers should consider in developing and reviewing supervisory procedures and controls for market conduct and sales practices in an on-line environment.\n      </p>", "From 1997 to March 2000, as technology stocks rose more than five-fold, institutions bought more new technology supply than individuals. Among institutions, hedge funds were the most aggressive investors, but independent investment advisors and mutual funds (net of flows) actively invested the most capital in the technology sector. The technology stock reversal in March 2000 was accompanied by a broad sell-off from institutional investors but accelerated buying by individuals, particularly discount brokerage clients. Overall, our evidence supports the bubble model of Abreu and Brunnermeier (2003), in which rational arbitrageurs fail to trade against bubbles until a coordinated selling effort occurs.\n      </p>", "Hedge funds have become critical players in both corporate governance and corporate control. In this Article, Professors Kahan and Rock document and examine the nature of hedge fund activism, how and why it differs from activism by traditional institutional investors, and its implications for corporate governance and regulatory reform. The authors argue that hedge fund activism differs from activism by traditional institutions in several ways: it is directed at significant changes in individual companies (rather than small, systemic changes), it entails higher costs, and it is strategic and ex ante (rather than incidental and ex post). The reasons for these differences may lie in the incentive structures of hedge fund managers as well as in the fact that traditional institutions face regulatory barriers, political constraints, or conflicts of interest that make activism less profitable than it is for hedge funds. But the differences may also be due to the fact that traditional institutions pursue a diversification strategy that is difficult to combine with strategic activism. Although hedge funds hold great promise as active shareholders, their intense involvement in corporate governance and control raises two potential problems: the interests of hedge funds sometimes diverge from those of their fellow shareholders, and the intensity of hedge fund activism imposes substantial stress that the regulatory system may not be able to withstand. The resulting concerns, however, are relatively isolated and narrow, do not undermine the value of hedge fund activism as a whole, and do not warrant major additional regulatory interventions. The sharpest accusation leveled against activist funds is that activism is designed to achieve a short-term payoff at the expense of long-term profitability. Although the authors consider this a potentially serious problem that arguably pervades hedge fund activism, they conclude that a sufficient case for legal intervention has not been made. This conclusion results from the uncertainties about whether short-termism is, in fact, a real problem and how much hedge fund activism is driven by excessive short-termism. But most importantly, it stems from the authors' view that market forces and adaptive devices adopted by companies individually are better designed than regulation to deal with the potential negative effects of hedge fund short-termism, while preserving the positive effects of hedge-fund activism.\n      </p>", "Institutions often have access to corporate inside information through their connections, but relatively little is known about the extent to which they exploit their informational advantage through short-term trading. We employ broker-level trading data to systematically examine possible cases of connected trading. Despite examining the issue from multiple angles, we are unable to find much evidence to support that investment bank clients take advantage of connections through takeover advising, IPO and SEO underwriting, or lending relationships. In contrast to recent academic literature and popular press, our findings suggest that institutional investors are reluctant to use inside information in traceable manners.\n      </p>", "ith <a
