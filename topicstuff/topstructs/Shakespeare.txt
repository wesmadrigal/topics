{"total_words": 84, "documents": ["The Shakespeare Clinic has developed 51 computer tests of Shakespeare play authorship and 14 of poem authorship, and applied them to 37 claimed \"true Shakespeares,\" to 27 plays of the Shakespeare Apocrypha, and to several poems of unknown or disputed authorship. No claimant, and none of the apocryphal plays or poems, matched Shakespeare. Two plays and one poem from the Shakespeare Canon, Titus Andronicus, Henry VI, Part 3, and \"A Lover's Complaint,\" do not match the others.\n      </p>", "Machine-readable texts in the humanities are in a period of rapid growth, as are programs for analyzing them, with concomitant problems of finding and choosing the most suitable of each. No one text-base, and no one search program, proves to be wholly suitable for all projects. Three of the currently available electronic editions of Shakespeare are discussed and compared, along with three commercial programs for text analysis on microcomputers.\n      </p>", "ABSTRACT Lingering controversy about anti-Semitism has kept The Merchant of Venice off the screen. Michael Radford's 2004 film adaptation creates a critique of anti-Semitic violence revealingly at odds with the play's comic form. This review considers the challenge Shakespeare's art poses to the ethical imperatives of contemporary filmmaking.\n      </p>", "This essay traces the evolution of T.S. Eliot's poetic allusions to Shakespeare's Cleopatra and the ways in which the Egyptian queen-as a racial and colonial Other-may be related to Eliot's own shifting sense of national identity. Rather than follow other scholars and read Eliot's use of the imperial splendor of Shakespeare's Cleopatra as an ironic counterpoint to the shabby and degraded life of modern London, my research suggests that, for Eliot, Cleopatra is no wielder of imperial power. Rather, Eliot casts Cleopatra in a subject position within an early-twentieth-century Orientalist discourse. In such a system, Cleopatra possesses a devouring sexuality that must be contained through a discourse that \"knows\" her and thus diminishes her power. Such a colonizing move links Eliot's Cleopatra references-in both his poems and essays-to contemporary English political discourses surrounding the \"problem\" of Egypt and allows the expatriate American to position himself more securely in the center of a literary and cultural tradition at a time when he often viewed himself as a foreigner or \"mette.\"\n      </p>", "This article contributes to the study of Shakespeare's appropriation in Germany during the twentieth century, with a particular focus on its two authoritarian regimes: the Third Reich and the German Democratic Republic. Germans have had their very own 'German' Shakespeare since the eighteenth century. Goethe and Schiller, among others, claimed the playwright for their projects of literary (and national) self-assertion. Ideologues in the Third Reich and the GDR conscripted this already 'naturalized' Shakespeare for the purposes of ideological education, and even hailed a new era in the appreciation of his work. Under the swastika, teachers were encouraged to study Shakespeare's F\u00fchrerfiguren, as well as his anticipation of the racial concerns of National Socialism. In classrooms of the GDR, the emphasis shifted to Shakespeare's humanism and realism, from which, students learned, contemporary socialist literature had evolved. The plays were now read as critical and optimistic responses to a social and political reality defined by class struggle.\n      </p>", "In \"Response to Elliott and Valenza, 'And Then There Were None' \", (1996) Donald Foster has taken strenuous issue with our Shakespeare Clinic's final report, which concluded that none of the testable Shakespeare claimants, and none of the Shakespeare Apocrypha poems and plays including Funeral Elegy by W.S. - match Shakespeare. Though he seems to accept most of our exclusions - notably excepting those of the Elegy and A Lover's Complaint - he believes that our methodology is nonetheless fatally flawed by \"worthless figures ... wrong more often than right\", \"rigorous cherry-picking\", \"playing with a stacked deck\", and \"conveniently exil[ing] ...inconvenient data.\" He describes our tests as \"foul vapor\" and \"methodological madness.\" We believe that this criticism is seriously overdrawn, and that our tests and conclusions have emerged essentially intact. By our count, he claims to have found 21 errors of consequence in our report. Only five of these claims, all trivial, have any validity at all. If fully proved, they might call for some cautions and slight refinements for five of our 54 tests, but in no case would they come close to invalidating the questioned test. The remaining 49 tests are wholly intact. Total erosion of our findings from the Foster critique could amount, at most, to half of one percent. None of his accusations of cherry-picking, deck-stacking, and evidence-ignoring are substantiated.\n      </p>", "The consistency of the word usage in a previously unknown nine-stanza poem attributed to Shakespeare with that of the Shakespearean canon is examined using a nonparametric empirical Bayes model. We consider also poems by Jonson, Marlowe and Donne, as well as four poems definitely attributed to Shakespeare. On balance, the poem is found to fit previous Shakespearean usage reasonably well.\n      </p>", "Starting from the accepted premise that Marlowe influenced the young Shakespeare, a selection of strongly contextual words characteristic of Tamburlaine are shown to be reflected in Shakespeare's early history plays. Principal components analysis confirms this. A very similar configuration, however, results when the selected Marlowe-preferred words are non-contextual common words. This feature can not be explained by influence in its conventional sense, particularly when the Shakespeare plays closest to Marlowe are those that share with Marlowe a dearth of selected Shakespeare-preferred common words. Greene, Kyd and Peele are tested to see if they attract to themselves the same plays as those drawn by Marlowe. Marlowe is seen to be the overriding magnet in all cases. Both conventional and non-contextual words link ten Marlowe works, even though seven are plays, and two of the ten are translations from Latin. Eight Shakespeare plays can be distinguished as somewhat separate from the other 28 Shakespeare plays and having an affinity with the Marlowe works.\n      </p>", "In Part I a procedure is devised to identify which first words of speeches discriminate between pairs of dramatists. By treating the plays The Alchemist and The Duchess of Malfi as anonymous but possibly by Chapman, Jonson, Middleton, Shakespeare or Webster, a simulation of the method determines the correct author in each case. In Part II tests confirm general acceptance of Acts III, IV and V of Pericles as Shakespearean and thereby offer additional evidence for the applicability of the method. However, literary scholars are reluctant to ascribe the first two Acts to Shakespeare, many instead preferring Wilkins. Comparisons based on occurrences of first words of speeches support the view that Wilkins is a much better candidate for their authorship than the mature Shakespeare.\n      </p>"], "words": {"essay": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "strongly": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "selection": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "words": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "previously": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "developed": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "abstract": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "reflected": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "identify": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "are": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "in": {"number": 4, "prob": 3.312505952159133e-05}, "influenced": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "shown": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "from": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "starting": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "unknown": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "young": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "machine": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "to": {"number": 3, "prob": 2.4843794641193497e-05}, "shakespeare": {"number": 3, "prob": 2.4843794641193497e-05}, "which": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "between": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "usage": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "contributes": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "is": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "be": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "that": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "devised": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "of": {"number": 7, "prob": 5.7968854162784825e-05}, "pairs": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "part": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "premise": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "article": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "accepted": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "the": {"number": 7, "prob": 5.7968854162784825e-05}, "contextual": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "a": {"number": 3, "prob": 2.4843794641193497e-05}, "speeches": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "has": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "word": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "evolution": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "this": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "characteristic": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "study": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "controversy": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "i": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "nine": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "t": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "consistency": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "anti": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "about": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "discriminate": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "traces": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "procedure": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "first": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}}}
