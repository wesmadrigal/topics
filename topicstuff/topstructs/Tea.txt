Methods In order to study the effect of jasmine tea in upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancers, we evaluated 600 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), 598 gastric cardia cancer (GCA), and 316 gastric non-cardia cancer (GNCA) cases and 1,514 age-, gender-, and neighborhood-matched controls. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated from logistic regression adjusted for matching factors and potential confounders. Results Among controls, 35% of males and 8% of females reported consumption of jasmine tea; other tea consumption was rare. Consumption of jasmine tea (ever vs. never) was not associated with risk of ESCC (OR = 1.15, 95% CI 0.92-1.44), GCA (OR = 1.14, 95% CI 0.88-1.37), or GNCA (OR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.64-1.15) in males and females combined. Among males, cumulative lifetime consumption showed a significant positive dose\u2014response relation with ESCC risk, but not for GCA and GNCA. In exploratory analyses, occupation affected the relation between tea and ESCC such that consumption in males was associated with increased risk only in non-office workers. Conclusion Overall, we found no evidence for a protective effect of tea in esophageal or gastric cancer. Further studies of the potential effects of thermal damage, tea quality, and water quality on UGI cancers are suggested.\n      </p>", "This paper examines problems and prospects on two tea estates in Transkei, one of South Africa's former homelands. It firstly focuses on outgrower and wage labour issues in the context of current debates about contract farming in Africa. Additionally, the research considers the specific national and international context of Transkeian tea production and highlights issues which are emerging in the new South Africa. The tea enterprise displays, in microcosm, many of the tensions which must inevitably arise as disparate groups attempt to restructure, or resist restructuring, and at the same time, external forces begin to interpose their own trajectories on a previously separate, protected market.\n      </p>", "Objectives To investigate the association between green tea consumption and liver cancer incidence. Methods We prospectively followed 41,761 Japanese adults aged 40-79 years, without a history of cancer at the baseline or any missing data for green tea consumption frequency. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusted for age, alcohol drinking, smoking, the consumption of coffee, vegetables, dairy products, fruit, fish, and soybean. Results Over 9 years of follow-up, among 325,947 accrued person-years, the total incidence of liver cancer was 247 cases. We found that green tea consumption was inversely associated with the incidence of liver cancer. In men, the multivariate-adjusted HRs (95% CIs) for liver cancer incidence with different green tea consumption categories were 1.00 (reference) for &lt;1 cup/day, 0.83 (0.53-1.30) for 1-2 cups/day, 1.11 (0.73-1.68) for 3-4 cups/day, and 0.63 (0.41-0.98) for \u22655 cups/day (p for trend = 0.11). The corresponding data among women were 1.00 (reference), 0.68 (0.35-1.31), 0.79 (0.44-1.44), 0.50 (0.27-0.90) (p for trend = 0.04). Conclusions Green tea consumption is associated with a reduced risk of liver cancer incidence.\n      </p>", "Objective This study investigated the association between green tea consumption and leukemia. Methods A total of 252 cases (90.3% response) and 637 controls (53.4% response) were enrolled. Controls were matched for cases on age and gender. Information was collected on participants' living habits, including tea consumption. Green tea was used as a standard to estimate the total amount of individual catechin consumption. We stratified individual consumption of catechins into four levels. Conditional logistic regression models were fit to subjects aged 0\u201315 and 16\u201329 years to evaluate separate associations between leukemia and catechin consumption. Results A significant inverse association between green tea consumption and leukemia risk was found in individuals aged 16\u201329 years, whereas no significant association was found in the younger age groups. For the older group with higher amounts of tea consumption (&gt;55O units of catechins), the adjusted odds ratio (OR) compared with the group without tea consumption was 0.47 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.23\u20130.97]. After we adjusted for smoking status and medical irradiation exposure, the overall OR for all participants was 0.49 (95% CI = 0.27\u20130.91), indicating an inverse relation between large amounts of catechins and leukemia. Conclusion Drinking sufficient amounts of tea, especially green tea, which contains more catechins than oolong tea and black tea, may reduce the risk of leukemia.\n      </p>", "Geographical indications are legal signs which identify a good as originating in a specific country or region, where the reputation of the product is attributable to its geographical roots. South Korea has operated with a geographical indication system since 1999. This research analyses the regional impacts of geographical indications using the case study of ' Boseong' green tea. The results show that geographical indication has enhanced the image of the product, leading to increased production and the stimulation of tea-related industries. We argue that geographical indication can be used as an effective policy to cope with trade liberalisation.\n      </p>", "Background Coffee and tea consumption has been inconsistently associated with the risk of breast cancer. We examined the associations of caffeinated coffee and black tea consumption with the incidence of breast cancer, overall and by estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status of the tumor, in the Swedish Mamography Cohort. Methods We prospectively followed up 61,433 women who were cancer free at baseline in 1987-1990. Coffee and tea consumption was assessed with a food-frequency questionnaire administered at baseline and in 1997. Incident invasive breast cancer cases were ascertained by linkage with Swedish Cancer registers. Results Over a mean follow-up of 17.4 years, through December 2007, there were 2,952 incident cases of invasive breast cancer identified. Coffee consumption was not associated with risk of overall breast cancer (multivariate relative risk (RR) for \u22654 cups/day versus &lt;1 cup/day = 1.02; 95% CI, 0.87-1.20) or with any subtype defined by ER and PR status. Black tea consumption was significantly positively associated with risk of overall breast cancer and ER+/PR+ tumors. The multivariate RRs comparing \u22652 cups/day of tea with no consumption were 1.22 (95% CI, 1.05-1.42) for overall breast cancer and 1.36 (95% CI, 1.09-1.69) for ER+/PR+ tumors. Conclusion Findings from this prospective study do not support a role of coffee consumption in the development of breast cancer but suggest that black tea consumption may be positively associated with risk of ER+/PR+ tumors.\n      </p>", "Engaging students in ethnobotanical concepts can be a challenge if you present the topic as a straight lecture.

The leading provinces in respect of tea industry in India are Assam and West Bengal. Dwring the first half of the nineteenth century, the nature of tea plantation employment was mostly coercive because of labour scarcity. The local peoples were reluctant to work on tea industries, and as such labourers belonging to various ethnic, linguistic, and cultural hentages were recruited from other provinces. In the beginning, a good number of people suffered from maladjustment, some of them died, others went back home after or still fled away before the expiry of the contracted period. A major group, however, survived that stage and had gradually settled in the new habitat, in a new economy, and far remote from their onginal home. Over the years, there has been a shift in the scene. Since around 1960, recruitment is made under condition of labour surplus and freely contracted wage labour. \u2013 In the present paper, an attempt has been made to have an appraisal of the prevailing pattern of labour composition and also the degree of absenteeism among the tea phntation workers in Assam. Data have been collected dunng 1981-1982 from the tea estates, namely, Ranjan (relatively small in size) and Manasi in Dibrugarh and Darran distncts respectively. The percentages of woman workers, of child Ubour, and of seasonal labour are more in the smaller and relatively less organized plantation. Possible reasons for this may be the lesser participation of women in union activities and that a smaller plantation involves lesser amount of cash outlay for labour. Minimization of cash outlays, however, seems to be a pnme concern of plantation management. \u2013 Absenteeism is more with men, resident labourers, on the following day of payment of wages, and dunng agriculture season. Alcoholism and habitual laziness seem to be the main reasons for this. Rationalized incentive schemes and social education help minimizing the high degree of absenteeism.\n      </p>", "The effect of drinking Chinese green tea on the risk of stomach cancer was evaluated in a population-based case-control study conducted in Shanghai, China, from October 1991 to December 1993. Eligible cases were incident cases of primary stomach cancer diagnosed during the study period among residents of Hongkou district and Nanhui county aged under 80 years. Controls were selected from the same street or commune where the case resided and were matched to the cases on age (within three years) and gender. A total of 711 cases and 711 matched controls, more than 90 percent of the eligible subjects, completed the interview. Information was obtained on the types of tea used, age when habitual tea drinking started, frequency of new batches of tea leaves used per day, number of cups brewed from each batch, total duration of drinking for each batch, strength and temperature of the tea consumed. Statistical analysis was based on modelling through conditional logistic regression. After adjusting for age, gender, place of residence, education, birthplace, alcohol consumption, and cigarette smoking, the odds ratio (OR) comparing drinkers of green tea with nondrinkers was 0.71 (95 percent confidence interval = 0.54-0.93). The adjusted OR decreased with increasing number of new batches of the green tea consumed each day (P value trend = 0.006). With the largest series of stomach cancer cases to date, this study found green-tea consumption associated with lower risk of stomach cancer. Among drinkers of green tea, the risk of stomach cancer did not depend on the age when habitual green-tea drinking started. Green tea may disrupt gastric carcinogenesis at both the intermediate and the late stages.\n      </p>", "Objectives: Tea polyphenols have been shown to exhibit anti-cancer activity, but the epidemiological findings are inconsistent. We examined the association between tea consumption and colon cancer in a population-based study in North Carolina. Methods: The analysis included 630 cases and 1040 controls frequency matched to cases by age, gender, and race. The odds ratios (OR) for tea consumption, adjusted for age and gender, were calculated for African-Americans and Whites and effect modification by race was explored. Results: No association was found between tea consumption and colon cancer overall. Compared to non-consumers, those who consumed &lt;2 servings/day or \u22652 servings/day had OR=0.9 (95% CI: 0.7-1.2) and OR = 1.3 (95% CI: 0.9-1.8) respectively. Other risk factors for colorectal cancer (family history of colorectal cancer, exposure to non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, meat cooking practices, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, intake of red meat, fruits, vegetables, and alcoholic beverages) did not influence these associations. We did not find any evidence of effect modification by race on either on the multiplicative or additive scale. Conclusion: We conclude that, contrary to expectation, tea drinking did not decrease the risk of colon cancer in this study population.\n      </p>", "Objective: Studies evaluating the relationships between coffee, tea and caffeine and ovarian cancer risk have given inconsistent results. We have examined these associations using data from an Australian population-based case-control study. Methods: Women with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) (n = 696) and control women selected from the Electoral Roll (n = 786) provided comprehensive reproductive and lifestyle data and completed a food frequency questionnaire. Results: Increasing coffee consumption was associated with a decreased risk of invasive EOC (p trend = 0.009) with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.51 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32-0.80) for consumption of \u22654 cups of coffee per day compared to non-drinkers. The association was significant only for serous and endometrioid/clear cell histological subtypes. There was no association with borderline tumours (OR: 1.20, 95% CI: 0.58-2.47). An inverse relationship was also seen between caffeine intake and EOC but tea consumption was not related to EOC (OR: 1.10 95% CI: 0.76-1.61 for \u22654 cups/day versus none). Conclusions: As tea contributed significantly to caffeine intake in this population we conclude that the association we observed with coffee is not due to caffeine, but to other components within coffee. We suggest future studies consider the type as well as the amount of each beverage consumed.\n      </p>", "Wild-caught starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) were fed an iron-enriched diet, with or without supplemental black tea leaves, to determine whether tea-derived tannins would prevent intestinal iron absorption. Hepatic biopsies were obtained to determine hepatic iron concentrations by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Hepatic iron concentrations increased significantly (P = 0.04) in 21 birds that consumed only the iron-enriched diet for 6 mo but not in the 20 birds that consumed the iron-enriched diet with tea leaf supplementation for the same time period.\n      </p>", "The level of toxigenic moulds and mycotoxins were analyzed in 62 samples of medicinal plant material and 11 herbal tea samples. The most predominant fungi detected were: Aspergillus, Penicillium, Mucor, Rhizopus, Absidia, Alternatia, Cladosporium and Trichoderma. Aspergillus flavus, a known producer of the aflatoxin mycotoxin, was present in 11 or 18% of the 62 medicinal plant samples and in 1 or 9% of the herbal tea samples. The medicinal plant samples, contaminated with A. flavus were also analyzed for the mycotoxins aflatoxin, ochratoxin and zearale-none; ochratoxin was found in one of the 7 samples analyzed. This study suggests that medicinal plant material and possibly herbal teas, if stored improperly allowing for mould growth, should be analyzed for mould and mycotoxin prior to use.\n      </p>", "In this article, I explore the 20th-century history of Samburu pastoralists through the lens of a particular beverage, tea. In classic anthropological analyses, \"drug foods\" such as tea have been taken as emblematic of the spread of global capitalism. Tea, however, is a rare example of a commodity that Samburu have adopted as a central component of a self-defined \"traditional\" culture specifically counterposed to change. Tracing historical transformations in practices and meanings associated with tea use, I consider both the processes underlying its acceptance and their import in explicating broader processes through which Samburu agents have negotiated contexts of change.\n      </p>", "Objective: To investigate the relationship between green tea consumption and subsequent risk of gastric cancer at different anatomical subsites in a population-based prospective study. Methods: The Japan Public Health Center-based prospective study (JPHC Study) was established in 1990 for Cohort I and in 1993 for Cohort II. Among 72,943 subjects (34,832 men and 38,111 women), 892 gastric cancer cases (665 men and 227 women) were identified from 1990 to 2001. Results: While no association between green tea consumption and gastric cancer was observed among men, a decreased risk of gastric cancer was observed among women after adjustment for potential confounding factors. This result was more remarkable when only the tumors in the distal portion were analyzed; for that subsite, the relative risk was 0.51 (95% confidence interval 0.30-0.86) in the highest category of green tea consumption (5 or more cups per day versus less than 1 cup per day) (p for trend = 0.01). The null association for upper-third gastric cancer was consistent for both sexes. Conclusions: An inverse association between green tea consumption and distal gastric cancer was observed among women. More prospective studies with detailed information are needed to confirm the role of green tea in the occurrence of gastric cancer.\n      </p>", "Tea drinking has been suggested to be beneficial in neurodegenerative diseases where depressive mood is a common symptom. Nevertheless, it is not known whether there are any associations between tea drinking and depression in general populations. In this study we investigated these associations in a sample of the Finnish general population (n = 2011) using a postal questionnaire and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Those who reported drinking tea daily were less depressed than the others. They had a lower mean BDI score and also a lower prevalence of depression. None of those whose daily tea intake was five cups or more had depression. Several potential confounding factors were included in the final sex- and age-adjusted multivariate logistic regression model which suggested that those who drink tea daily may have a significantly reduced risk of being depressed (adjusted odds ratio 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.27-0.83). In conclusion, an inverse relationship between daily tea drinking and the risk of being depressed was found in a relatively large general population sample. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms are unresolved and further studies are needed.\n      </p>", "Brick tea-drinking fluorosis is an unusual environmental problem. As a result of an investigation of tea-drinking habits, total fluoride intakes, dental fluorosis, and skeletal fluorosis, this disease has been found in the Sichuan Province of China in Tibetans with a long history of drinking brick tea. The dental fluorosis investigation of 375 Tibetan children (213 males, 162 females) and 161 Han children (86 males, 75 females), 8-15 years of age, was carried out in Daofu County, Sichuan Province. According to the standard of the Chinese Health Ministry, a skeletal fluorosis survey of 658 Tibetans (264 males, 394 females) and 41 Hans (20 males, 11 females), all over 16 years old, was performed. The total fluoride intake and fluorosis were determined from a question-calculation method in all participants. The morbidities of dental fluorosis in Tibetan and Han children are 51.2% and 11.05%, respectively, and the indexes of dental fluorosis are 1.33 and 0.17 (\u03c7 &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=75.7, p&lt;0.01) respectively. The morbidity of skeletal fluorosis is 32.83% for Tibetan children and zero for the Han children. The fluoride intakes of Tibetan children and adults were 5.49 mg/person/day and 10.43 mg/person/day, respectively, in this area. Of total everyday fluoride intake 94.2% by children and 94.4% by adults was from brick tea and zanba (r = 0.99).\n      </p>", "Background To provide information about the association of coffee, black tea with gastric cancer risk. Methods Between 1985 and 2007, we conducted two case-control studies in northern Italy. Overall, cases were 999 subjects with incident, histologically confirmed gastric cancer and controls were 2,628 patients admitted to the same network of hospitals for acute non-neoplastic diseases. Odds ratios (OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for coffee (mostly espresso and mocha) and black tea consumption were estimated after allowance for socio-demographic data, smoking, and other major covariates of interest. Results When compared with non-coffee drinkers, the OR was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.73-1.22) for drinkers of one cup of coffee per day, 1.03 (95% CI: 0.80-1.32) for two, 1.07 (95% CI: 0.82-1.40) for three, and 1.24 (95% CI: 0.94-1.65) for four or more cups per day. No association was found with reference to duration of coffee consumption, or consumption of decaffeinated coffee. When compared with non-black-tea drinkers, the OR was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.56-1.42) for drinkers of two or more cups of black tea per day. Conclusions Our investigation, based on a uniquely large dataset, provides convincing evidence that coffee and black tea consumption is unlikely to be strongly associated with gastric cancer risk.\n      </p>", "This article uses California\u2019s long history of migration to question efforts by local Tea Party activists to push for an anti-immigration law modeled after Arizona\u2019s notorious S.B. 1070.

This prospective study in Japan examined the association between green tea consumption and cancer incidence. Methods: Subjects were 38,540 people (14,873 men, mean age 52.8 years; 23,667 women, mean age 56.8 years) who responded to a mail survey carried out between 1979 and 1981. A self-administered questionnaire ascertained consumption frequency of green tea using precoded answers (never, once per day, twice to four times per day, and five or more times per day). Follow-up continued until 31 December 1994. The study analyzed solid cancers (n = 3881); hematopoietic cancers (188); cancers of all sites combined (4069); and cancer of specific sites with more than 100 cases, i.e. stomach (901), colon (432), rectum (193), liver (418), gallbladder (122), pancreas (122), lung (436), breast (281), and bladder (122). Poisson regression was used to allow for city, gender, age, radiation exposure, smoking status, alcohol drinking, body-mass index, education level, and calendar time. Results: Green tea consumption was virtually unrelated to incidence of cancers under study. The relative risks of all cancers for those consuming green tea twice to four times per day and five or more times per day were 1.0 (95% confidence interval 0.91-1.1) and 0.98 (0.88-1.1), respectively, as compared with those consuming green tea once per day or less. Conclusion: Our findings do not provide evidence that regular green tea consumption is related to reduced cancer risks.\n      </p>", "The literature from 1990 to 2003 on the relation between coffee, decaffeinated coffee, tea and colorectal cancer risk has been reviewed. For the relation with coffee, three cohort (517 total cases) and nine case-control studies (7555 cases) analysed colon cancer; three cohort (307 cases) and four case-control studies (2704 cases) rectal cancer; six case-control studies (854 cases) colorectal cancer. For colon cancer most case-control studies found risk estimates below unity; the results are less clear for cohort studies. No relation emerged for rectal cancer. A meta-analysis, including five cohort and twelve case-control studies, reported a pooled relative risk of 0.76 (significant). Any methodological artefact is unlikely to account for the consistent inverse association in different countries and settings. Plausible biological explanations include coffee-related reductions of cholesterol, bile acids and neutral sterol secretion in the colon; antimutagenic properties of selected coffee components; increased colonic motility. Decaffeinated coffee was not related to either colon or rectal cancer in three case-control studies. No overall association between tea and either colon or rectal cancer risk emerged in seven cohort (1756 total cases of colon, 759 of rectal and 60 of colorectal cancer) and 12 case-control studies (8058 cases of colon, 4865 of rectal, 604 of colorectal cancer).\n      </p>", "Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine the hypothesis that tea and coffee consumption have a protective effect against development of digestive tract cancers. Methods: A comparative case-referent study was conducted using Hospital-based Epidemiologic Research Program at Aichi Cancer Center (HERPACC) data from 1990 to 1995 in Nagoya, Japan. This study comprised 1,706 histologically diagnosed cases of digestive tract cancers (185 esophagus, 893 stomach, 362 colon, 266 rectum) and a total of 21,128 non-cancer outpatients aged 40 years and over. Logistic regression was used to analyze the data, adjusting for gender; age; year and season at hospital-visit; habitual smoking and alcohol drinking; regular physical exercise; fruit, rice, and beef intake; and beverage intake. Results: The odds ratio (OR) of stomach cancer decreased to 0.69 (95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 0.48-1.00) with high intake of green tea (seven cups or more per day). A decreased risk was also observed for rectal cancer with three cups or more daily intake of coffee (OR = 0.46, CI = 0.26-0.81). Conclusions: The results suggest the potential for protective effect against site-specific digestive tract cancer by consumption of green tea and coffee, although most associations are limited only to the upper category of intake and have no clear explanation for site-specificity.\n      </p>", "Objective To investigate the association between green tea consumption and the risk of endometrial cancer restricted to endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EEA) using a case\u2013control design in Japan. Methods The cases were 152 patients with histopathologically diagnosed EEA, and the controls were 285 healthy women who were matched for age and area of residence with individual cases. The subjects completed a questionnaire regarding health-related lifestyle and reproductive history, and a food frequency questionnaire. Odds ratios (ORs) of EEA for frequency of green tea consumption were calculated by conditional logistic regression analysis. Results We observed a significant inverse association between green tea consumption and the risk of EEA with a dose-response relationship. The multivariate-adjusted OR of EEA was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.37-1.58) for those in the second quartile of green tea consumption (5\u20136 cups/week-1 cup/day), 0.61 (0.30\u20131.23) in the third quartile (2\u20133 cups/day), and 0.33 (0.15\u20130.75) in the highest quartile (\u2265 4 cups/day), as referenced with those in the lowest quartile (\u2264 4 cups/week; p for trend = 0.007). This inverse association was consistently observed regardless of the presence or absence of factors such as obesity and menopause.

Among wild roses, phenolic methyl ether (PME) biosynthesis is restricted to Chinese rose species, but the progenitors of modern roses included both European and Chinese species (e.g., Rosa chinensis cv Old Blush), so this trait was transmitted to their hybrid progeny. The last steps of the biosynthetic pathways leading to DMT involve two methylation reactions catalyzed by the highly similar orcinol O-methyltransferases (OOMT) 1 and 2. OOMT1 and OOMT2 enzymes exhibit different substrate specificities that are consistent with their operating sequentially in DMT biosynthesis. Here, we show that these different substrate specificities are mostly due to a single amino acid polymorphism in the phenolic substrate binding site of OOMTs. An analysis of the OOMT gene family in 18 species representing the diversity of the genus Rosa indicated that only Chinese roses possess both the OOMT2 and the OOMT1 genes. In addition, we provide evidence that the Chinese-rose-specific OOMT1 genes most probably evolved from an OOMT2-like gene that has homologues in the genomes of all extant roses. We propose that the emergence of the OOMT1 gene may have been a critical step in the evolution of scent production in Chinese roses.\n      </p>", "Background: Green tea, a popular beverage in Japan, contains many polyphenolic antioxidants, which might prevent cardiovascular disease. This study is designed to determine whether the consumption of green tea is associated with a reduced risk for subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) using a case-control study. Methods: Incident SAH cases (n = 201) were identified and individually matched by age (\u00b1 2 years) and gender to hospital (n = 201) and community controls (n = 201) from April 1992 to March 1997. Habitual regular tea consumption was assessed with a structured questionnaire. Conditional logistic regression models were used to compute odds ratios adjusted for smoking, history of hypertension, and educational levels. Results: The proportion of the consumption of one time or more of tea per day was higher in controls (70.9%) than in SAH patients (60.3%). Multivariate analyses showed that green tea consumption was inversely associated with SAH risk. Subjects consuming &amp;lt;1, and \u22651 time per day had adjusted ORs of 0.74 (CI: 0.34-1.58), and 0.56 (CI: 0.32-0.98) in comparison with non daily green tea drinkers, respectively (p-trend &amp;lt;0.001). Conclusion: In a case-control study in Japan, we found that habitual green tea consumption may be strongly associated with a reduced risk for SAH. Our findings will be useful in targeting individuals and populations for the primary prevention of SAH.\n      </p>", "Objectives: Coffee, tea, and fluid consumption have been thought to influence bladder cancer incidence. In a large prospective study, these associations were investigated. Methods: In 1986, cohort members (55-69 years) completed a questionnaire on cancer risk factors. Follow-up was established by linkage to cancer registries until 1992. The multivariable case-cohort analysis was based on 569 bladder cancer cases and 3123 subcohort members. Results: The incidence rate ratios (RR) for men consuming &lt; 2 cups of coffee/day was 0.89 (95% CI 0.51-1.5) using the median consumption category (4- &lt; 5 cups/day) as reference. This RR increased to 1.3 (95% CI 0.94-1.9) for men consuming \u22657 cups/day, although no clear dose-response association was found. The RRs decreased from 1.2 (95% CI 0.56-2.7) for women consuming &lt; 2 cups of coffee/day to 0.36 (95% CI 0.18-0.72) for women consuming \u22655 cups/day compared to the median consumption category (3- &lt; 4 cups/day). Men and women who abstained from drinking tea had a RR of 1.3 (95% CI 0.97-1.8) compared to those consuming 2- &lt; 3 cups of tea per day (median consumption category). The RR for men and women comparing highest to lowest quintile of total fluid consumption was 0.87 (95% CI 0.63-1.2). Conclusion: The data suggest a possible positive association between coffee consumption and bladder cancer risk in men and a probable inverse association in women. Tea consumption was inversely associated with bladder cancer. Total fluid consumption did not appear to be associated with bladder cancer.\n      </p>", "The mountain ecosystems of Sri Lanka are now in crisis, with rapid degradation of the productive resource base and the environment. There are unmistakable symptoms of unsustainability in current production practices and patterns of resource use in tea agroecosystems. The present study was undertaken with the overall objective of examining the sustainability of resource use, with special reference to the land management practices on tea plantations on the Uva highlands of Sri Lanka. Eight different tea plantation units were randomly selected for detailed study, representing a total area of 4548 ha. The information related to the management of the plantations was mainly collected from plantation records. The findings of the study confirmed that the ecological capital of the plantations is in a critical state. Private management companies have been exercising a strategy aimed at short-term profits by extracting higher yields with the aid of inorganic fertilizers and other agrochemicals. Hence activities such as replanting, infilling and bush management have been neglected. Shortage of skilled labor is a major threat to the future of the tea estates. An inter-estate analysis of the quality of the management of tea plantations indicated that most of the tea estates had become marginal. Long-term management plans need to be formulated and implemented in order to make the tea plantations ecologically and economically sustainable.\n      </p>", "A possible protective effect of coffee or caffeine intake in the formation of gallstones has been suggested in some epidemiological studies. We examined the relation of coffee, green tea, and caffeine intake to gallstone disease in middle-aged Japanese men, distinguishing known gallstones from unknown diagnosed gallstones. Study subjects were 174 cases of gallstones as determined by ultrasonography, 104 cases of postcholecystectomy, and 6889 controls of normal gallbladder in the total of 7637 men who received a health examination at four hospitals of the Self-Defense Forces (SDF). Of the 174 cases of prevalent gallstones, 50 had been aware of having gallstones. Previously diagnosed gallstones and postcholecystectomy were combined as known gallstone disease. The consumption of coffee and green tea was ascertained by a self-administered questionnaire, and caffeine intake was estimated. Statistical adjustment was done for body mass index, smoking, alcohol use, rank in the SDF, and hospital. Coffee and caffeine intake were associated each with a statistically significant increase in the prevalence odds of known gallstone disease, but unrelated to newly diagnosed gallstones. Adjusted odds ratios of known gallstone disease were 1.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-2.8) for coffee consumption of five cups or more per day vs. no consumption and 2.2 (95% CI: 1.3-3.7) for caffeine intake of 300 mg/day or more vs. less than 100 mg/day. The consumption of green-tea showed no material association with either unknown gallstones or known gallstone disease. The findings do not support a hypothesis that coffee drinking may be protective against gallstone formation.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

In this population-based case-control study, we examined the association between past consumption of green tea and the risk of lung cancer. We identified 649 incident cases of primary lung cancer among women diagnosed from February 1992 through January 1994 using the population-based Shanghai Cancer Registry. We randomly selected a control group of 675 women from the Shanghai Residential Registry, frequency-matched to the expected age distribution of the cases. Green tea consumption was ascertained through face-to-face interviews. We estimated adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) using unconditional logistic regression. Among nonsmoking women, consumption of green tea was associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer (OR = 0.65; 95% CI = 0.45-0.93), and the risks decreased with increasing consumption. We found little association, however, among women who smoked (OR = 0.94; 95% CI = 0.40-2.22). The inconsistency in the association between drinking tea and the risk of lung cancer reported in previous studies may in part be due to inadequate control of confounding of active smoking.\n      </p>", "Data from a population-based study of newly diagnosed cases of prostate cancer (n = 362) and age-matched controls (n = 685) conducted in Utah (United States) between 1983 and 1986 were used to determine if cigarette smoking, alcohol, coffee, tea, caffeine, and theobromine were associated with prostate cancer risk. These factors were examined since their use differs in the Utah population, which is comprised predominantly of members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS or Mormon), from most other populations. Pack-years of cigarettes smoked, alcohol intake, and consumption of alcohol, coffee, tea, and caffeine were not associated with prostate cancer risk. Compared with men with very low levels of theobromine intake, older men consuming 11 to 20 and over 20 mg of theobromine per day were at increased risk of prostate cancer (odds ratio [OR] for all tumors = 2.06, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 1.33-3.20, and OR = 1.47, CI = 0.99-2.19, respectively; OR for aggressive tumors = 1.90, CI = 0.90-3.97, and OR = 1.74, CI = 0.91-3.32, respectively). We present biological mechanisms for a possible association between prostate cancer and theobromine. This finding needs further exploration in studies with a wider range of theobromine exposures and more men with aggressive tumors.\n      </p>", "Consumption of mat\u00e9, a tea-like infusion of the herb Ilex paraguariensis, is common in South America. Drinkers have high risks of upper aerodigestive tract cancers, but it is conceivable that this high risk may be attributable to confounding by smoking, alcohol, and other exposures. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the data from a case-control study of upper aerodigestive tract cancers conducted in Southern Brazil. We matched noncancer controls (N = 756) to cases (N = 378) on the basis of age, sex, and period of admission. We estimated the effect of mat\u00e9 consumption by conditional logistic regression with adjustment for smoking, alcohol, sociodemographics, and several dietary items, considered as confounders. The unadjusted relative risk (RR) for all upper aerodigestive tract cancers was 2.1 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.6-2.7]. Some excess risk persisted after adjustment for potential confounders (RR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.2-2.2). Most of the excess risk for mat\u00e9 drinkers was for oral (RR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.1-3.3) and laryngeal (RR = 2.2; 95% CI = 1.1-4.5) cancers. There was no evidence of associations with coffee and tea drinking. We conclude that the association of mat\u00e9 consumption with upper aerodigestive tract cancer risk is unlikely to result from insufficient control of confounding by critical exposures. Owing to its high prevalence in Southern South America, mat\u00e9 drinking may be linked to as many as 20% of all cases occurring in this region.\n      </p>", "Coffee and tea are both drunk in most countries, but typically one predominates. Coffee is the preferred drink in Europe and the Americas, tea elsewhere. Until the early eighteenth century coffee production and consumption was confined to the Islamic world, tea production to East Asia. European traders altered this pattern dramatically. The present pattern of coffee consumption is influenced by income per capita, that of tea is not. Religious influences played some part in the early development of both tea and coffee but have little relevance at the present. National factors have influenced wider patterns. British preference for tea was taken to all their colonies. In recent years fears about health have had some influence on coffee consumption.\n      </p>", "Tetraethylammonium TEA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is widely used for reversible blockade of K channels in many preparations. We noticed that intracellular perfusion of voltage-clamped squid giant axons with a solution containing K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and TEA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; irreversibly decreased the potassium current when there was no K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; outside. Five minutes of perfusion with 20 mM TEA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, followed by removal of TEA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, reduced potassium current to &lt;5% of its initial value. The irreversible disappearance of K channels with TEA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; could be prevented by addition of \u2265 10 mM K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to the extracellular solution. The rate of disappearance of K channels followed first-order kinetics and was slowed by reducing the concentration of TEA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Killing is much less evident when an axon is held at -110 mV to tightly close all of the channels. The longer-chain TEA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; derivative decyltriethylammonium (C10&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) had irreversible effects similar to TEA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. External K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; also protected K channels against the irreversible action of C10&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. It has been reported that removal of all K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; internally and externally (dekalification) can result in the disappearance of K channels, suggesting that binding of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; within the pore is required to maintain function. Our evidence further suggests that the crucial location for K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; binding is external to the (internal) TEA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; site and that TEA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; prevents refilling of this location by intracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus in the absence of extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, application of TEA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (or C10&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) has effects resembling dekalification and kills the K channels.\n      </p>", "The effect of tea polyphenols on the release of chemical mediators, histamine and leukotriene B\u2084 (LTB\u2084), from rat peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) was studied. Among polyphenols, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) most strongly inhibited the histamine release from the cells stimulated with a calcium ionophore, A23187 or compound 48/80. Though (+)-catechin (C) and (-)-epicatechin (EC) had no effect, (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) and (-)-epicatechin gallate (ECG) moderately inhibited the histamine release. Similarly, EGCG, ECG, and EGC inhibited LTB\u2084 release from PEC, whereas C and EC were not effective. The magnitude of the inhibitory effect on the release of these mediators of tea polyphenols was in the order of EGCG &amp;gt; ECG &amp;gt; EGC. These results indicated an important role of the triphenol structure in the inhibitory activity. Therefore, the possible antiallergic effect of tea polyphenols can be expected.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Its beverage use by the Hottentots was first reported by the botanist Carl Thunberg in 1772. About 1900, it began to be marketed and then domesticated on a small scale. Seed selection and improved cultivation and processing started in the 1920s. Important advances were made in 1930. Demand for the product jumped during World War II because of the shortage of Oriental tea, then declined. The industry was stabilized in 1954 and continued to expand, with exports to Australia, New Zealand, Europe, the United Kingdom, Canada and, to a very limited extent, the United States. A fungus disease, then drought, followed by floods temporarily reduced the supply in 1980. The tea is gaining recognition for its freedom from caffeine, low tannin and high ascorbic acid content. It contains the antispasmodic principle, quercetin, and is said to have enough fluoride to inhibit caries. Consumer tests indicate that rooibos tea may be an acceptable alternative to tea, coffee, cocoa and high-caffeine soft drinks.\n      </p>", "Beginning in the second half of the 19th century, large areas of West Java's mountainous rainforests were transformed into tea gardens. The volcanic soils, high rainfall, and cool climate of this region proved the perfect environment for such plantations (Figure 1). During this period, many tea factories were powered by small hydropower plants (SHPs). The location of the factories on tea estates was often determined by the availability of a suitable site for the SHPs. This renewable form of energy was the perfect match for the moderate power requirements of tea factories. However, after the peak in tea production at the beginning of the 20th century, a gradual decline in production took place in West Java. Unfortunately, this period also saw the degradation of the many SHPs that formerly powered the factories. Today most of the plants in the old factories have been destroyed, dismantled, or replaced by Diesel gensets. Rising fuel costs and increased consumer awareness are now providing the right environment for a revival of indigenous hydraulic resources.\n      </p>", "Objective Although the growth inhibitory effects of tea, particularly green tea, and tea polyphenols have been demonstrated in animal models of ovarian cancer, the results of epidemiological studies have been inconclusive. Methods We investigated this issue using data from an Australian population-based, case-control study (1,368 cases; 1,416 controls). We also systemically reviewed all the available evidence regarding the potential association between green tea and risk of ovarian cancer, given the abundance of bioavailable polyphenols and higher antioxidant capacity of green tea than black tea, to provide the best summary estimate of the association. Results In our case-control study, while we found uniformly inverse odds ratios (OR) for tea drinkers compared to non-tea drinkers [4 + cups/day any tea OR 0.71 (95% CI 0.52-0.97); green tea OR 0.82 (95% CI 0.38-1.79); herbal tea OR 0.77 (95% CI 0.28-2.14): black tea OR 0.88 (95% CI 0.66-1.18)], we saw no dose-response trends. Our meta-analysis provided some evidence that women who drink green tea have a lower risk of ovarian cancer, although the summary estimate did not reach statistical significance (0.58, 95% CI 0.33-1.01 for \u2265 1 cup/green tea day). This result is consistent with two recent meta-analyses that evaluated the association of tea (all types combined) and ovarian cancer risk. Conclusion Overall, our findings provide some support for the hypothesis that tea consumption reduces the risk of ovarian cancer.\n      </p>", "Physiological and biochemical responses of micropropagated tea plants grown under field conditions were investigated in comparison to vegetatively propagated (VP) plants. No significant variation was observed between tissue culture raised (TC) and VP plants in terms of photosynthetic carbon assimilation rate. However, clones showed significant variation among themselves. Carbon assimilation studies carried out with a radiotracer technique revealed that 'Assam' cultivar UPASI-27 assimilated a higher amount of labeled carbon dioxide followed by UPASI-3. However, UPASI-27 was marginally better than UPASI-3 in terms of mobilization of assimilates to the growing sinks. Both, UPASI-3 and UPASI-27 reassimilated higher quantities of photosynthates followed by BSB-1 and UPASI-26. Though there was a marginal variation in photosynthetic pigments of TC and VP plants, it was not statistically significant. Similarly, no significant variations were observed in certain substrates (polyphenols, catechins and amino acids) and enzymes (polyphenol oxidase, peroxidase and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase) except protease involved in the formation of quality constituents of made tea. However, clonal variation was evident with respect to photosynthetic pigments, substrates/enzymes. Under soil moisture stress, no significant variation was observed between VP and TC plants in terms of proline accumulation.\n      </p>", "In a case study of Taiwan's tea industry during the Japanese colonial period, we identify an important function of middlemen: sorting. The transaction cost saved by the intermediary due to sorting is shown to be empirically significant. We also study other services provided by tea middlemen, including financing and transportation. These are shown to be by-products of an intermediary's job, rather than his essential contribution to trading.\n      </p>", "In the summer of 2010,52 Republican members of the US House of Representatives joined the newly formed Tea Party Caucus, bringing the first institutional voice to the Tea Party movement. To understand both the policy orientations of the organized Tea Party (in its caucus manifestation) and the institutional strength of the caucus's membership, we assess the extent to which caucus members are distinctive from their fellow Republicans in the US House of Representatives. Our results suggest that membership in the caucus is primarily driven by ideology and economics. Specifically, we find that Tea Party Caucus members are Republicans who are ideologically oriented toward limited government and lower taxes and who hail from particularly prosperous congressional districts. We find no evidence that Tea Party Caucus members serve safer districts or have greater seniority or institutional stature than their Republican colleagues who are not members of the caucus. These findings, we believe, speak not only to the nature and orientations of the Tea Party Caucus, but to the wider Tea Party movement itself.\n      </p>", "Cape Natural Tea Products was a young herbal products company based in South Africa. Rooibos tea was the strongest component of their product portfolio. In South Africa, rooibos was a commodity product and a direct competitor of coffee and tea. Antioxidants and other nutrients made rooibos a functional food. The American market developed interest in functional foods; however, the diverse opinions and knowledge of American consumers of functional foods made marketing difficult. Could the company benefit from the American market? With strong competition at home and marketing challenges abroad, what would be the best path of success for the company?\n      </p>", "We investigated the relation between caffeine beverage consumption and spontaneous abortion in 2,967 pregnant women planning to deliver at Yale-New Haven Hospital in 1988-1992. We evaluated coffee, tea, and soda drinking in the first month of pregnancy in interviews before the end of the sixteenth week of gestation. We obtained information on 98.2% of the pregnancies (including 2,714 singleton livebirths and 135 spontaneous abortions). As compared with abstention from caffeine beverages (coffee, tea, and soda), the adjusted odds ratios for spontaneous abortion associated with consumption of 1-150, 151-300, and &gt; 300 mg caffeine daily were 0.81 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.54-1.20], 0.89 (95% CI = 0.48-1.64), and 1.75 (95% CI = 0.88-3.47), respectively. Drinking \u22653 cups of tea or coffee was associated with elevated risks of spontaneous abortion (adjusted odds ratio = 2.33, 95% CI = 0.92-5.85; and adjusted odds ratio = 2.63, 95% CI = 1.29-5.34, respectively). These results, if replicated, suggest that some ingredient (or correlate) of tea or coffee may account for some of the observed association of caffeine with spontaneous abortion. In this study, caffeine consumption is more strongly related to spontaneous abortion than alcohol or cigarette use in early pregnancy.\n      </p>", "Many polyphenolic compounds have demonstrated anticarcinogenic activities in animal models. These compounds include flavanone, flavonols, isoflavone, and catechins. In this article, tea catechins will be used as an example to illustrate current research in this area. Many laboratory studies have demonstrated the inhibition of tumorigenesis in animal models by different tea preparations. The animal models include tumorigenesis in the mouse lung, rat and mouse esophagi, mouse forestomach, mouse skin, mouse duodenum, rat small intestine, rat and mouse livers, and rat colon. In most of the studies, the inhibitory activity of tea could be demonstrated when tea preparations were given either during or after the carcinogen treatment period. Black tea was also effective, although the activity was weaker than green tea in some experiments. Decaffeinated tea preparations were also active in many model systems. The molecular mechanisms for these broad inhibitory actions are not fully understood. They are most likely related to the biochemical actions of the tea polyphenols, which include antioxidative activities and inhibition of cell proliferation and of tumor promotion-related activities. The effect of tea consumption on human cancers is not clear in spite of numerous investigations. The bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of tea polyphenols are being studied in animals and humans to provide a basis for more quantitative analyses on the effect of tea on carcinogenesis. More mechanistic and dose-response studies will help us to understand the effects of tea consumption on human carcinogenesis.\n      </p>", "This article explains the role of the IGR lobby in the passage of TEA-21 and the nature of the coalitions and partnerships formed by groups within the IGR lobby to accomplish their policy goals. The data for the study are divided into three realms. The first identifies the priorities of groups within the IGR lobby and the types of coalitions that groups entered into. These data were gathered through examinations of IGR lobby testimony before congressional committees, interviews with organizational and congressional staff members, and from secondary sources such as the official publications and websites of IGR lobby organizations. The second part seeks to gain a more precise understanding of how state and local officials use non-PIG coalitions and groups to press for their policy objectives by surveying selected state and local government officials. Finally, the survey assesses the impact that IGR lobbying had on TEA-21.\n      </p>", "A \u03b2-primeverosidase from tea (Camellia sinensis) plants is a unique disaccharide-specific glycosidase, which hydrolyzes aroma precursors of \u03b2-primeverosides (6-O-\u03b2-D-xylopyranosyl-\u03b2-D-glucopyranosides) to liberate various aroma compounds, and the enzyme is deeply concerned with the floral aroma formation in oolong tea and black tea during the manufacturing process. The \u03b2-primeverosidase was purified from fresh leaves of a cultivar for green tea (C. sinensis var sinensis cv Yabukita), and its partial amino acid sequences were determined. The \u03b2-primeverosidase cDNA has been isolated from a cDNA library of cv Yabukita using degenerate oligonucleotide primers. The cDNA insert encodes a polypeptide consisting of an N-terminal signal peptide of 28 amino acid residues and a 479-amino acid mature protein. The \u03b2-primeverosidase protein sequence was 50% to 60% identical to \u03b2-glucosidases from various plants and was classified in a family 1 glycosyl hydrolase. The mature form of the \u03b2-primeverosidase expressed in Escherichia coli was able to hydrolyze \u03b2-primeverosides to liberate a primeverose unit and aglycons, but did not act on 2-phenylethyl \u03b2-D-glucopyranoside. These results indicate that the \u03b2-primeverosidase selectively recognizes the \u03b2-primeverosides as substrates and specifically hydrolyzes the \u03b2-glycosidic bond between the disaccharide and the aglycons. The stereochemistry for enzymatic hydrolysis of 2-phenylethyl \u03b2-primeveroside by the \u03b2-primeverosidase was followed by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, revealing that the enzyme hydrolyzes the \u03b2-primeveroside by a retaining mechanism.

The fluxes include incoming short-wave radiation, terrestrial radiation, latent heat flux and the sensible heat fluxes between the canopy and the air and that into and out of the soil. The pertinent data were simultaneously collected by use of 21X microloggers. Global radiation varied from 40 Wm\u207b\u00b2 to 1160 Wm\u207b\u00b2 depending on sky conditions. High a values were observed early in the morning and late in the afternoon. Net radiation varied between - 100 Wm\u207b\u00b2 at night and 600 Wm\u207b\u00b2 during the daytime. The largest proportion of net radiation was consumed by the latent heat flux. Advection was found to be minimal.\n      </p>", "In the aftermath of a potentially demoralizing 2008 electoral defeat, when the Republican Party seemed widely discredited, the emergence of the Tea Party provided conservative activists with a new identity funded by Republican business elites and reinforced by a network of conservative media sources. Untethered from recent GOP baggage and policy specifics, the Tea Party energized disgruntled white middle-class conservatives and garnered widespread attention, despite stagnant or declining favorability ratings among the general public. As participant observation and interviews with Massachusetts activists reveal, Tea Partiers are not monolithically hostile toward government; they distinguish between programs perceived as going to hard-working contributors to US society like themselves and \"handouts\" perceived as going to unworthy or freeloading people. During 2010, Tea Party activism reshaped many GOP primaries and enhanced voter turnout, but achieved a mixed record in the November general election. Activism may well continue to influence dynamics in Congress and GOP presidential primaries. Even if the Tea Party eventually subsides, it has undercut Obama's presidency, revitalized conservatism, and pulled the national Republican Party toward the far right.\n      </p>", "In the West, pottery is usually deemed \u201ccraft\u201d rather than \u201cart\u201d and has long existed near the bottom of the aesthetic hierarchy. In Japan, to the contrary, pottery is among the most highly regarded forms of art, in great part due to its role in the Zen-inspired Tea ceremony. Because the Tea ceremony effectively creates a link between several art forms (landscape, architecture, poetry, calligraphy, pottery, cuisine), a profound and highly codified symbolic system has developed that articulates all art forms, all the while celebrating the chance effects of the heat of the kiln and the cycles of nature. This complex aesthetic system has a radical impact on formal Japanese cuisine, which is of startling complexity and symbolic profundity.\n      </p>", "This paper measures the effect of currency rate changes on the competitiveness of India's main export industries, Tea and Cotton Textiles. In contrast to the conventional approach that uses data from commodity markets, the present study is based on data from stock markets. The analysis is done in two parts. The first part reports estimates of somewhat significant currency rate exposure of the major Tea and Cotton Textiles exporting firms in India and other countries. The second part reports the movements of the average excess returns of the exposed Indian firms, based on an event-study of the devaluation of the Rupee in 1991. The theory behind the econometric models invokes only the efficiency property of financial markets and seems less controversial than its counterpart in the conventional approach.\n      </p>", "\u201cOn the Trail of Tilleul\u201d is my personal story of a trip I made to France's Dr\u00f4me region to research the history and culture of one of its most renowned agricultural products, lindenflower tisane (herbal tea or infusion). A familiar element of the French landscape, linden trees produce fragrant blossoms which are hand-harvested, dried and consumed as a tea, both for its pleasing, delicate bouquet and for the mild digestive and sleep benefits it offers. Recently, both the production and consumption of lindenflower tisane in the Dr\u00f4me region have declined, threatened by cheap, poor quality imports from China and Eastern Europe, as well as changing tastes and dining habits. Interviews with lindenflower producers in the Dr\u00f4me region provide background on its cultivation, harvest and post-harvest handling.\n      </p>", "In the wake of the 2008 election, disgruntled conservatives organized opposition to President Obama's policies under a new movement dubbed the Tea Party. As an emerging force in American politics, we seek to understand who supports the Tea Party and the political attitudes these individuals hold. Using a nationally representative survey of respondents during the 2010 midterm elections, we examine whether the emerging narrative surrounding the Tea Party is accurate. The survey included a novel embedded experiment designed to investigate claims that animosity toward racial minorities drives Tea Party opposition to welfare. We find support for the contention that the Tea Party is predominately white, male, conservative, and strongly opposed to tax increases. Tea Party supporters, however, are not simply libertarians. In spite of appeals to freedom and liberty common in Tea Party rhetoric, a strong authoritarian pulse exists among its most ardent supporters. Furthermore, although we find evidence that racial resentment colors Tea Party members' judgments about government aid to the poor, racial animus does not appear to be the primary force behind their opposition to government aid. Lastly, we uncover some evidence of heterogeneity within the movement, with a small minority of Tea Party supporters voicing less-extreme political attitudes and evincing a rejection of negative racial stereotypes.\n      </p>", "We examined the relations between spontaneous abortion and the consumption of caffeine, individual caffeine-containing beverages (coffee, tea, and soda), and decaffeinated coffee in a prospective study of 5,144 pregnant women. We collected information about potential risk factors for spontaneous abortion, including consumption of caffeinated beverages and decaffeinated coffee before and during pregnancy, by interview in the first trimester. Neither total estimated caffeine nor individual caffeinated beverage consumption during the first trimester was associated with an appreciable increase in risk for spontaneous abortion. The adjusted odds ratio for consumption of greater than 300 mg per day of caffeine was 1.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.8-2.1] after adjustment for maternal age, pregnancy history, cigarette and alcohol consumption, employment, race, gestational age at interview, and marital and socioeconomic status. The adjusted odds ratio for spontaneous abortion related to consumption of three or more cups of decaffeinated coffee during the first trimester was 2.4 (95% CI = 1.3-4.7) in the same model. Although we could not demonstrate this with available data, we suspect that this association was due to bias resulting from the relations among fetal viability, symptoms of pregnancy such as nausea, and consumption patterns during pregnancy.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

There was a moderate inverse association with coffee consumption, with an adjusted OR of 0.65 (95% CI: 0.36-1.17) for women who reported more than two cups/day of coffee compared to none. Tea consumption appeared to increase risk (OR: 1.93; 95% CI: 1.08-3.45), but after including the variables sugar/honey and cream/milk added to tea in the model, the risk estimate was attenuated and no longer statistically significant (OR: 1.77; 95% CI: 0.96-3.28 for those consuming more than one cup/day of tea compared to nonusers).

To date, observational data from prospective cohort studies investigating the relationship between green and black tea intake and prostate cancer risk are sparse and equivocal. In a population-based, prospective cohort study of Chinese men in Singapore, we investigated the relationship between green and black tea intake and prostate cancer risk. Methods: Tea consumption data for 27,293 men were collected at baseline (between 1993 and 1998) using a validated food frequency questionnaire. After an average of 11.2 years of follow-up, 298 men had developed prostate cancer. Proportional hazards regression methods were used to assess the associations between tea intake and prostate cancer risk. Results: There was no association between daily green tea intake and prostate cancer risk, compared with no green tea intake [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.08; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.79, 1.47]. For black tea, a statistically significant positive association and trend were observed for daily intake compared with no black tea intake (HR = 1.41, 95 % CI 1.03, 1.92; p for trend &lt;0.01) Conclusions: Few prospective data are available from populations that have both a high level and wide range of black and green tea intake; this study represents a unique opportunity to evaluate their individual effects on prostate cancer risk. Our findings support the notion that green tea intake does not protect against prostate cancer and that black tea intake may increase prostate cancer risk.\n      </p>", "El profesor Alexander, de la Universidad de Virginia (EE.UU.), explica las claves para entender el fen\u00f3meno \"Tea Party\", que ha revolucionado la pol\u00edtica norteamericana e influido en la victoria de los republicanos en las \u00faltimas elecciones de noviembre.

These habitats are subject to a variety of stressors, including the conversion of adjacent terrestrial habitats from forest to agriculture, but the impacts of these anthropogenic effects are largely unknown because of the paucity of studies in these systems. In montane habitats in the wet tropics, large-scale cultivation of tea is common and can represent an important source of income at local and national scales. However, little is known about how tea cultivation impacts adjacent stream ecosystems. In this study, we examine stream macroinvertebrate assemblages in a biodiversity hotspot the East Usambara Mountains, Tanzania. Specifically, we compare diversity of macroinvertebrate assemblages found on cobbles in stream riffles in watersheds dominated by forest with those surrounded by tea cultivation. We found that streams surrounded by tea were characterized by significantly lower dissolved oxygen and had lower total estimated species richness and number of families. Furthermore, the richness of invertebrate taxa known to be sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance were substantially reduced in tea streams and general assemblage-level analysis shows significant differences in the composition of macroinvertebrate assemblages between tea and forested streams. Our results suggest that tea cultivation may reduce stream habitat quality and biodiversity in the East Usambaras. Further research is needed to evaluate the effects of tea cultivation on streams over longer times scales and to address methods for minimizing negative effects of agriculture on montane stream communities.\n      </p>", "A population-based case-control study of stomach cancer was conducted among the teachers and staff of primary and middle schools in Shanghai.

Recent studies have indicated that many glycosides that are not mutagenic in tests such as the Salmonella test become mutagenic upon hydrolysis of the glycosidic linkages.

We describe a stable cell-free extract of human feces, fecalase, which is shown to contain various glycosidases that allow the in vitro activation of many natural glycosides to mutagens in the Salmonella/liver homogenate test. Many beverages, such as red wine (but apparently not white wine) and tea, contain glycosides of the mutagen quercetin.

The prevalence of almost all chronic respiratory symptoms was significantly higher in workers processing dog-rose, sage, and gruzyan tea than in control workers. During the Monday workshift there was a significant mean acute decrease in maximum expiratory flow rates at 50% vital capacity (range: 4\u00b7\u20138\u00b78%) and at 25% VC (range: 7\u00b78\u201321\u00b78%) expect in those exposed to camomile. Acute reductions in forced expiratory volume in one second were considerably smaller and mostly not significant. Mean acute reductions on Wednesday were similar to those on Monday with no significant differences between preshift Monday and Wednesday data. Acute decreases in flow rates at low lung volumes suggest that the bronchoconstrictor effect of the dust acts mostly on smaller airways. Preshift administration of disodium cromoglycate significantly diminshed acute reduction in flow rates except in workers processing Indian tea. A comparison of Monday preshift values of ventilatory capacity in tea workers with those in controls indicates the exposure to tea dust may, in some workers, lead to chronic respiratory impairment.\n      </p>", "The active site of voltage-activated potassium channels is a transmembrane aqueous pore that permits ions to permeate the cell membrane in a rapid yet highly selective manner. A useful probe for the pore of potassium-selective channels is the organic ion tetraethylammonium (TEA), which binds with millimolar affinity to the intracellular opening of the pore and blocks potassium current. In the potassium channel encoded by the Drosophila Shaker gene, an amino acid residue that specifically affects the affinity for intracellular TEA has now been identified by site-directed mutagenesis. This residue is in the middle of a conserved stretch of 18 amino acids that separates two locations that are both near the external opening of the pore. These findings suggest that this conserved region is intimately involved in the formation of the ion conduction pore of voltage-activated potassium channels. Further, a stretch of only eight amino acid residues must traverse 80 percent of the transmembrane electric potential difference.\n      </p>", "Unless drastic measures are introduced the tea industry is heading for a crisis.

Design-Cohort study. Setting-Nationwide random population study. Participants-Over 11 000 men and women aged 40-59 who took part in the Scottish Heart Health Study lifestyle and risk factor survey in 1984-87. Participants were followed up to the end of 1993, an average of 7.7 years, for all cause mortality, coronary death, or any major coronary event (death, non-fatal infarction or coronary artery surgery). Cox's proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate the hazard in consumers of tea and coffee relative to the zero consumption group, both before and after correction for other factors. Main results-Coffee and tea consumption showed a strong inverse relation. For many conventional risk factors, coffee showed a weak, but beneficial, gradient with increasing consumption, whereas increasing tea consumption showed the reverse. Increasing coffee consumption was associated with beneficial effects for mortality and coronary morbidity, whereas tea showed the opposite. Adjusting for age and social class had some effect in reducing associations. Multiple adjustment for other risk factors removed the associations for tea and most of those for coffee although there was a residual benefit of coffee consumption in avoiding heart disease among men. Conclusions-The epidemiological differences shown in this study occurred despite the pharmacological similarities between tea and coffee. Either they differ more than is realised, or they identify contrasting associated lifestyle and health risks, for which this multiple adjustment was inadequate.\n      </p>", "The objective of this article is to examine the different ways that smallholders are brought into Fairtrade certification schemes in the Tanzanian tea industry. We examine the different ownership relations of processing factories and the perceived benefits of these different arrangements. We use descriptive qualitative analysis based on qualitative interviews and focus groups conducted between 2008 and 2010 to identify the significance between factory ownership organization and Fairtrade certification. We find that there is a movement toward innovation in the organizational strategies, which includes new ownership arrangements of processing factories and outgrower contracts that have been associated with certified Fairtrade production. We also suggest that organizational innovation is significant for obtaining scheme success yet perceived benefits of and increased information about Fairtrade production is independent from ownership shares in processing.\n      </p>", "Green tea polyphenol, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) differentially regulates the cellular growth of cancer cells in a p53-dependent manner through apoptosis and/or cell cycle arrest. In an effort to further elucidate the mechanism of differential growth regulation by EGCG, we have investigated the role of the tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-2. Comparing the responses of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), expressing either WT or functionally inactive/truncated SHP-2, we find that inactivation of SHP-2 remarkably sensitizes cells to EGCG-mediated killing. MEFs lacking functional SHP-2 undergo massive apoptosis upon treatment with EGCG. By comparing gene expression profiles, we have identified a set of transcriptional targets of p53 that are differentially modulated in cells undergoing apoptosis. Western blot and real-time PCR analyses of a select group of genes further confirm that the expression is SHP-2-dependent. Similar observations were made in MEFs lacking p53, confirming that the expression of these \"p53 target genes\" is p53-independent. In addition, EGCG treatment induced the expression of p73 mRNA and protein in both cell types, but not p63. Inactivation of p73 in cells expressing nonfunctional SHP-2 markedly inhibited apoptosis and p53 target gene expression. Although phosphorylation of JNK is differentially regulated by SHP2, it was found to be dispensable for EGCG-induced apoptosis and p53 target gene expression. Our results have identified SHP-2 as a negative regulator of EGCG-inducedapoptosis and have identified a subset of p53 target genes whose expression is paradoxically not mediated by p53 but by one of its family members, p73.\n      </p>", "The Tea Industry in the Cholo and Mlanje districts of southern Nyasaland emerged during the 1930s under the shelter of the International Tea Regulation Scheme of 1933 which restricted exports by the world's leading producers. In contrast to its East African neighbours, Nyasaland's Tea Industry was well organized locally by the Nyasaland Tea Association and was effectively represented in Britain by its London Committee. Though having to accept restrictions on the planting of new tea, which occasioned some local controversy, the industry, in common with other tea-producing countries, benefited from the rising prices of the 1930s for which the Tea Regulations were largely responsible. By 1938 tea had become one of Nyasaland's few profitable industries. A seeming further advantage was the bulk buying scheme, at guaranteed prices, organized by the British Ministry of Food which lasted throughout the 1940s, but the industry's wartime performance was sluggish as a consequence of poor growing seasons combined with serious shortages of manpower and fertilizer. As a poor quality, low price producer facing chronic labour shortages, which prevented millions of pounds of tea from being picked, Nyasaland greeted with hostility Imperial decisions to withdraw eastern Africa from the International Tea Scheme in 1948, to end bulk buying in 1950, and generally to encourage the free expansion of production. Nyasaland's tea planters were told that henceforth they must face open competition.\n      </p>", "Background: Tea catechins inhibit the activity of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which catalyzes the inactive form of folate 7,8-dihydrofolate to the active form of folate 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate. This inhibition leads to disturbance of the folate metabolic pathway and to lower bioavailability of folate to cells; therefore, it may increase the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs) in a developing embryo. We examined the association between tea drinking during the periconceptional period and the risk of NTDs. Methods: Cases were fetuses or neonates with an NTD as ascertained through a population-based surveillance system in 4 rural counties of Shanxi Province in northern China during 2002 through 2007. Controls were term infants without congenital malformations. Demographic, reproductive, and exposure data were obtained through a face-to-face interview. Results: A total of 631 NTD cases and 857 controls were included in the analysis. Compared with women who did not drink tea during the periconceptional period (487 cases and 688 controls), women who drank tea daily (20 cases and 9 controls) had a 3-fold increased risk (odds ratio = 3.1 [95% confidence interval = 1.4\u20147.0]) of having an NTD-affected pregnancy. The elevated risk associated with daily tea drinking remained after adjusting for maternal age, educational level, occupation, and periconceptional folic acid supplementation (3.4 [1.4\u20148.3]). The association was present for all 3 major subtypes of NTDs (ie, anencephaly, spina bifida, and encephalocele). Conclusions: Daily tea drinking during the periconceptional period was associated with an elevated risk of NTDs in this Chinese population.\n      </p>", "Soluble organic nitrogen (SON) plays a vital role in ecosystem N cycling processes and is controlled by a number of biotic and abiotic factors. We compared soil SON availability, microbial biomass, protease and asparaginase activities and phospholipids fatty acid (PLFA) profiles at the 0-15 and 15-30 cm layers in 10 year old tea plantations of two genotypes\u2014Oolong tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze cv. Huangjingui) (designated as 'OT') and Green tea (C. sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze cv. Fuyun 6) (designated as 'GT')\u2014 established at different slope positions. Concentrations of soil SON measured by the 2 M KC1 extraction under the plantation were greater than under the GT plantation, while concentrations of soil SON were greater in the middle slope (MS) and lower slope (LS) positions than in the upper slope (US) position. Trends in soil microbial biomass C and N and protease and asparaginase activities between the two genotypes and across the slope positions were similar to the SON pools. The fungalto-bacterial ratios were higher in the US position than in the MS and LS positions and higher under the GT plantation than under the plantation. Results from this study support that the genotype and the slope position are key factors controlling the availability of soil SON in tea plantations and also imply the importance of plant traits (e.g. litter quantity and chemistry) and soil texture in determining overall soil N availability and transformation processes and microbial community composition at the landscape level.\n      </p>", "Objective: Reporting categorical relative risk estimates for a series of exposure levels versus a common reference category is a widespread practice. In meta-analysis, categorical regression estimates a dose--response trend from such results. This method requires the assignment of a single score to each exposure category. We examined how closely meta-analytical categorical regression approximates the results of analysis based on the individual-level continuous exposure. Methods: The analysis included five studies on tea intake and outcomes related to colorectal cancer. In addition, we derived categorical mean and median values from published distributions of tea consumption in similar populations to assign scores to the categories of tea intake when possible. We examined whether these derived mean and median values well approximate the individual-level results. Results: In meta-analytical categorical regression, using the midrange scores approximated the individual-level continuous analyses reasonably well, if the value assigned to the uppermost, open-ended category was at least as high as the lower bound plus the width of the second-highest category. Categorical mean values derived from the published distributions of regular tea (in the US) and green tea (in Japan) well approximated the slope obtained from individual-level analysis. Conclusion: Publication of both the categorical and the continuous estimates of effect in primary studies, with their standard errors, can enhance the quality of meta-analysis, as well as providing intrinsically valuable information on dose--response.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Trade union leaders from the tea industry have unequivocally condemned the incident. But they have also drawn attention to the fact that tea garden managements in Assam have been systematically ignoring the demands of the workers, especially for welfare measures. Successive governments in Assam have failed to force managements to implement the Plantations Labour Act of 1951. Managements now claim that the industry is passing through a recession, but during the tea boom of the 1990s the same managements did not share even a minuscule part of their prosperity with the workers.\n      </p>", "Caffeine synthase (CS), the S-adenosylmethionine-dependent N-methyltransferase involved in the last two steps of caffeine biosynthesis, was extracted from young tea (Camellia sinensis) leaves; the CS was purified 520-fold to apparent homogeneity and a final specific activity of 5.7 nkat mg-1 protein by ammonium sulfate fractionation and hydroxyapatite, anion-exchange, adenosine-agarose, and gel-filtration chromatography. The native enzyme was monomeric with an apparent molecular mass of 61 kD as estimated by gel-filtration chromatography and 41 kD as analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme displayed a sharp pH optimum of 8.5. The final preparation exhibited 3-and 1-N-methyltransferase activity with a broad substrate specificity, showing high activity toward paraxanthine, 7-methylxanthine, and theobromine and low activity with 3-methylxanthine and 1-methylxanthine. However, the enzyme had no 7-N-methyltransferase activity toward xanthosine and xanthosine 5\u2032-monophosphate. The Km values of CS for paraxanthine, theobromine, 7-methylxanthine, and S-adenosylmethionine were 24, 186, 344, and 21 \u03bcM, respectively. The possible role and regulation of CS in purine alkaloid biosynthesis in tea leaves are discussed.

Methods: At baseline in 1995-1996, dietary intake, including coffee, tea, and soda, was assessed with a food frequency questionnaire. We used Cox proportional hazards models to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for glioma risk in relation to beverage intake. Results: During follow-up of 545,771 participants through 2006, 904 participants were diagnosed with glioma. We found no trends of decreasing glioma risk with increasing intake of specific beverages or total caffeine. HR patterns for consumption of the caffeinated versus decaffeinated form of each beverage were inconsistent with a specific caffeine effect. HR patterns of reduced glioma risk for most categories of beverage intake greater than \"none\" prompted a post hoc analysis that revealed borderline-significant inverse associations for any versus no intake of tea (HR = 0.84; 95 % CI, 0.69-1.03), total coffee plus tea (HR = 0.70; 95 % CI, 0.48-1.03), and soda (HR = 0.82; 95 % CI, 0.67-1.01). Conclusions: The borderline-significant inverse associations could be explained by a threshold effect in which any beverage intake above a low level confers a beneficial effect, most likely due to beverage constituents other than caffeine. They could also be explained by non-drinkers of these beverages sharing unknown extraneous characteristics associated with increased glioma risk, or by chance.\n      </p>", "While there have been several studies of various aspects of the tea industry, there has been little effort to seriously study labour relations in the tea plantations of West Bengal. Despite various laws, the intervention of the trade unions, and measures by government relations between labour and management in the tea estates of this state have been deteriorating over the years. This paper is an attempt to describe and analyse the present condition of labour relations in the tea gardens of North Bengal, with special reference to the gardens in Jalpaiguri district which is the larger of the two main tea-growing districts in the state.\n      </p>", "Human \u03b3\u03b4 T cells mediate innate immunity to microbes via T cell receptor-dependent recognition of unprocessed antigens with conserved molecular patterns. These nonpeptide alkylamine antigens are shared by tumor cells, bacteria, parasites, and fungi but also by edible plant products such as tea, apples, mushrooms, and wine. Here we show that priming of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells with alkylamine antigens in vitro results in a memory response to these antigens. Such priming results also in a nonmemory response to whole bacteria and to lipopolysaccharide, characterized by IL-12-dependent secretion of IFN-\u03b3 by \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and by \u03b3\u03b4 T cell proliferation. Drinking tea, which contains L-theanine, a precursor of the non-peptide antigen ethylamine, primed peripheral blood \u03b3\u03b4 T cells to mediate a memory response on reexposure to ethylamine and to secrete IFN-\u03b3 in response to bacteria. This unique combination of innate immune response and immunologic memory shows that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells can function as a bridge between innate and acquired immunity. In addition, these data provide an explanation for the health benefits of tea.\n      </p>"], "words": {"limited": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "all": {"number": 1, "prob":
