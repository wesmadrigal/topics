{"total_words": 1506, "documents": ["The model implicit in most research on the politics of education assumes that political factors such as interest group support and opposition shape policy. However, because this perspective yields incomplete information about the educational enterprise, researchers should not just ask what kinds of policies politics creates but also reverse the causal arrow to examine what kinds of politics result from different policies. In addressing this question, the concept of policy feedback focuses analytical attention on the institutional structures and rules policies establish, the elite and public interpretations of those policies, the interests that are mobilized, and how these factors interact to shape future policies.\n      </p>", "Organizational researchers during the past few decades have increasingly focused on the role of subjective work issues and their impact on important worker-related outcomes. One of the most prominently studied factors, perceptions of organizational politics, has received much recent conceptual and empirical attention. In an effort to better understand the relationship between perceptions of organizational politics and key outcomes, we apply meta-analysis on 79 independent samples from 59 published and unpublished studies involving 25,059 individual participants. Results indicate strong negative relationships between POP and job satisfaction and between POP and organizational commitment, moderately positive relationships between POP and the outcomes of job stress and turnover intentions, and a non-significant relationship between POP and in-role job performance. Moderator tests show that age, work setting (i.e., public sector or private sector), and cultural differences (i.e., domestic sample or international sample), have contingent effects on certain POP relationships.\n      </p>", "This article discusses the active role of children in everyday politics. Distinct from empowerment, it is suggested that children can be political on their own terms. The article focuses on revealing the social production of childhood, which takes place in the confrontation between child policy and children's own politics. Children's bodies are found to be both the main focus of policy practices and a central avenue of children's own agency. Hence, children are understood to be not only objects of policy, but also embodied political subjects. Using the example of Finnish child evacuees' experiences during the Second World War, it is shown that, despite their positions in policy fields, children do act as political selves. Using the ideas of Michel de Certeau and Carl Schmitt, it is argued that there is an autonomous politics to children which can be recognized as a significant means of coping in their everyday lives. On these grounds, the article sets out to use Pierre Bourdieu's concept of political struggle in considering childhood spatialities in more detail. Overall, children's politics are understood as a wider geographical concept which requires further examination.\n      </p>", "This piece confronts a serious deficiency in the literature on racial politics. The defining works of White racial attitudes fail to grapple with the complexities of African American political thought and life. In these studies, Black people are a static object about which White people form opinions. This article offers a critique of the field of race politics by outlining the consequences of a failure to seriously include African Americans in theoretical and empirical analyses of American race.\n      </p>", "This paper attempts to take the politics of affect as not just incidental but central to the life of cities, given that cities are thought of as inhuman or transhuman entities and that politics is understood as a process of community without unity. It is in three main parts. The first part sets out the main approaches to affect that conform with this approach. The second part considers the ways in which the systematic engineering of affect has become central to the political life of Euro-American cities, and why. The third part then sets out the different kinds of progressive politics that might become possible once affect is taken into account. There are some brief conclusions.\n      </p>", "Land ownership has long been a source and outcome of political power in the Philippines. This article shows how in the 1990s land and politics continued to be closely entwined, but the disposal of agricultural land for urban uses, rather than its ownership, was sought by the powerful. By examining the process of land use conversion in Manila's extended metropolitan region, two dimensions of the politics of land are examined: policy choices relating to the uses of land that reflect a particular set of developmental priorities and the facilitation of conversion through the use of political power relations to circumvent regulations. These points are made at three interconnected scales: the national scale of policy formulation, the local scale of policy implementation and regulation, and the personal scale of everyday power relations in rural areas. The article draws on fieldwork in the rapidly urbanizing province of Cavite, south of Manila.\n      </p>", "Politics and geography are inter-twined because geographical images and relationships enter into political language. A nation's geography affects its view of itself and its view of the world. Politicians and political decisions must take account not only of people, but also technology and natural resources. Consequently, there needs to be a greater interplay between geographers and politicians.\n      </p>", "American society, in the course of its earlier history, was shaped by the competing visions of nativism and cosmopolitan liberalism. The first defined the American identity in restrictive fashion, and sought to curtail naturalization and immigration. The second, taking an expansive view of American identity, pressed opposing policies. In the period following World War II, new visions of American society have developed in the course of the struggles of people of color to overcome their historical exclusion from the American cultural identity. The latest of these visions are expressed in the movements of multiculturalism and political correctness, which are seen here as facets of a new, and morally assertive, view of American society, revolving around the efforts of previously excluded groups to construct new identities. All of these forms of consciousness -- nativism, cosmopolitan liberalism, and multiculturalism -- now compete on the American scene in the politics of identity.\n      </p>", "In this paper using reflections on a dramatic moment in the life of the author's ethnographic study of theater in Poland as a starting point, the relationship between art and politics is analyzed. The relationship between two central propositions is explored, leading to a conclusion: (1) Cultural freedom is a definitive characteristic of modern social life and (2) the freedom constituted by culture as the arts and sciences opens up public space for alternative social and political practices, and thus: cultural freedom is a base for political freedom. Applying these propositions to a study of theater in Poland, it is shown that art constitutes cultural freedom through its relative autonomy, and the politics of small things results. Societies are transformed.\n      </p>", "Globalization is often indexed by the rise of a consumerist ethos and the expansion of the market economy at the expense of state-centric formulations of politics and citizenship. This article explores the politics and practices of gendered democratic citizenship in an educational setting when that setting is newly reconfigured as a commodity under neoliberal privatization efforts. This entails an attention to discourses of consumption as they intersect postcolonial cultural-ideological political fields. Focusing on the contemporary trajectory among politicized male college students of a historically important masculinist \"political public\" in Kerala, India, the article tracks an explicit discourse of \"politics\" (rashtriyam). This enables an exploration of a struggle over the meaning of democratic citizenship that opposes a political public rooted in a tradition of anticolonial struggle and postcolonial nationalist politics to that of a \"civic public\" rooted in ideas about the freedom to consume through the logic of privatization.\n      </p>", "Political philosophers have doubted the compatibility of various major values, such as equality and freedom. Ethnographic and historical evidence has indicated the presence of (1) economic equality and individual freedom in the absence of civil peace in segmentary societies based on self-help; (2) economic equality and civil peace in the absence of individual freedom in corporate societies; and (3) individual freedom and civil peace in the absence of economic equality in mercantile and capitalist societies. However, little if any evidence has documented all three -- economic equality, individual freedom, civil peace -- in stable coexistence. By way of delineating the relations between and among the values in question, I offer \"The Iron Law of Politics,\" which asserts that economic equality, individual freedom, and civil peace cannot all exist simultaneously in any society, although any two of the three can.\n      </p>", "To elucidate the tensions in the relation between ethics and politics, I construct a dialogue between Kant, who argues that they can be made compatible, and Derrida, who claims to go beyond Kant and his idea of duty. For Derrida, ethics makes unconditional demands and politics guides our responses to possible effects of our decisions. Derrida argues that in politics there must be a negotiation of the non-negotiable call of ethical responsibility. I argue that Derrida's unconditional ethics cannot be read in precisely Kantian terms because his 'impossible reals' can be destructive. Moreover, Derrida expands the reach of ethics beyond Kant by making all ethical demands unconditional or perfect, yet he does not articulate a politics that would enable us to respond to these demands. We need to take account of these difficulties in theorizing how ethics should constrain politics and how politics can provide the conditions for ethics.\n      </p>", "The phrase \"identity politics\" has come to encapsulate a wide diversity of oppositional movements in contemporary Latin America, marking a transition away from the previous moment of unified, \"national-popular\" projects. This review takes a dual approach to the literature emerging from that transition, focusing on changes in both the objects of study and the analysts' lens. Four questions drive this inquiry: When did the moment of identity politics arise? What accounts for the shift? How to characterize its contents? What consequences follow for the people involved? Past answers to such questions often have tended to fall into polarized materialist and discursive theoretical camps. In contrast, this review emphasizes emergent scholarship that takes insights from both while refusing the dichotomy, and assigning renewed importance to empirically grounded and politically engaged research.\n      </p>", "This study investigates the complexities in the relationship between perceptions of organizational politics and performance ratings by examining the moderating effect of impression management on that relationship. Expectancy theory was employed to better understand the moderating effect. We proposed that two kinds of impression management tactics occurred: supervisor-focused and job-focused, respectively. It was hypothesized that increased exercise of impression management would mitigate the negative effects of perceptions of organizational politics and performance ratings. Data were collected from 290 full-time employees of ten state-owned enterprises in Taiwan. Hierarchical moderated regression analysis of data revealed that the job-focused tactics exerted a significant moderating effect on the relationship between perceptions of organizational politics and performance ratings. When perceptions of organizational politics are low, employees who engage in high levels of job-focused impression management tactics are more likely to gain better ratings than those who employ low-level tactics.\n      </p>", "This essay attempts to sharpen significantly the critical debate around Levinas's work by focussing on the question of politics, which is, it is argued, Levinas's Achilles'heel. Five problems in Levinas's treatment of politics are identified and discussed: fraternity, monotheism, androcentrism, the family, and Israel. It is argued that Levinas 's ethics is terribly compromised by his conception of politics. In order to save Levinasian ethics from this compromise, two possibilities are explored: first, to follow Derrida 's separation of ethical form from political content in his recent reading of Levinas, which allows for a notion of political invention linked to ethical responsibility, and second, to link Levinas's conception of ethics to what is called in the essay the anarchistic disturbance of politics. In conclusion, this anarchistic experience of ethics in linked to a quite different understanding of politics as the dissensual space of democracy.\n      </p>", "From the complex literatures on \"institutionalisms\" in political science and sociology, various components of institutional change are identified: mutability, contradiction, multiplicity, containment and diffusion, learning and innovation, and mediation. This exercise results in a number of clear prescriptions for the analysis of politics and institutional change: disaggregate institutions into schemas and resources; decompose institutional durability into processes of reproduction, disruption, and response to disruption; and, above all, appreciate the multiplicity and heterogeneity of the institutions that make up the social world. Recent empirical work on identities, interests, alternatives, and political innovation illustrates how political scientists and sociologists have begun to document the consequences of institutional contradiction and multiplicity and to trace the workings of institutional containment, diffusion, and mediation.\n      </p>", "The politics of innovation involves displacements between various interrelated settings ranging from the context of design to the context of use. This variety of settings and their particular qualities raise questions about the democratic implications of displacements, which have been addressed within science and technology studies for decades from different perspectives and along various theoretical strands. This article distinguishes five different traditions of conceptualizing the relation between technological innovation and democracy: an intentionalist, a proceduralist, an actor-network, an interpretivist, and a performative perspective. They differ in their concepts of \"technology,\" \"politics,\" and \"democracy\"; they imply different roles for the analyst and they suggest or urge other political means. It is suggested that spelling out the differences and similarities between the five perspectives creates the possibility to overcome the limitations of any particular perspective of technology and democracy.\n      </p>", "Several discourses about theology, church, and politics are occurring among Christian theologians in the United States. One influential strand centers on the communitarian theology of Stanley Hauerwas, who calls on Christians to witness faithfully against liberalism in general and war in particular. Jeffrey Stout, in his widely discussed \"Democracy and Tradition\" (2004), responds that religious people ought precisely to endorse those democratic and liberal American traditions that join religious and secular counterparts to battle injustice. Hauerwas, Stout, and many of their interlocutors envision liberal U.S. culture as the context of Christian social ethics. The ensuing debate rarely incorporates Catholic scholars, feminist scholars, scholars of color, or international and liberationist voices. Their inclusion could enhance an understanding of the role of the church in society, and support a common morality in the face of global pluralism. More importantly, it could broaden the scope of discourse on religion and politics to envision global Christian social ethics.\n      </p>", "Racial politics may be expected to involve a commons dilemma in which voters perceive the choice of political candidates of different races as a zero-sum game. To test this expectation, regression models were constructed based on survey data collected during the 1988 New York City mayoral primary between David Dinkins and Edward Koch. Both the perception of racial outgroup threat and dissatisfaction with public resources predicted candidate support in registered Democrats. Thus, communal interests supplemented racial group power interests as motives for candidate support, despite apparent power conflict and resource competition between racial and class groups. Group power concerns appeared to reflect symbolic concerns with procedural justice rather than concern with personal or collective resource distributions. Symbolic racial politics may reflect social competition aimed at enhancing self-esteem through group identification. Political appeals to public resource concerns are concluded to be more effective and less destructive campaign strategies than appeals to either social competition for symbolic empowerment or realistic group competition for resource distributions.\n      </p>", "Taking as its starting point the response of indigenous organizations to the Zapatistas' so-called Otra Campa\u00f1a (Other Campaign), this article reflects on the cultural politics of Mexico's indigenous movement and the tensions between local forms of resistance and the national strategies proposed by the Ej\u00e9rcito Zapatista de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional.\n      </p>", "Confucians emphasizes and values morality, hence observers tended to regard moralities as politics so that the independent politics in the Confucian tradition has become implicit. Through a perusal of the Analects of Confucius, we can find that ethics and politics were separated from and independent of each other to Confucius, the primitive Confucian: he did not substitute ethics for politics.\n      </p>", "Police research in the United States has been heavily influenced by external politics. This influence is agenda-setting rather than truth-suppressing. Agenda-setting influence occurs where external political influence causes researchers to undertake research on a subject or subjects they had previously neglected. The influence of politics on research has, in some very important respects, greatly enriched social science research on the police, forcing scholars to confront subjects and methodological issues they had previously neglected. The relationship between police research and the external political environment is extremely complex and is by no means simple or one-directional. There are also some important examples, notably, community policing, of where research findings have influenced the political agenda.\n      </p>", "Sexual politics provokes many questions about sex differences in psychological stance and political behavior, highlighting the need for empirical research if present knowledge is to extend beyond ideological inference. Developing answers to such questions demands a biosociopsychological approach, combining theory and data from the biological with those from the social sciences, thereby transcending the equally although diametrically opposed sterilities of cultural and of biological determinism. Discussed here are problems posed by the present understanding of political psychology concerning: (1) primate continuities in sex and politics; (2) matriarchy as an empirical construct; (3) traditional versus modern societal sexual egalitarianism; (4) kibbutzim egalitarian theory, and trends in behavioral sex differences in practice; (5) biosocial unisexuality; and (6) adult human developmental androgyny.\n      </p>", "This article investigates the role of medicine as a category of politics. Starting from two different concepts of efficacy of medicine among the Wimbum in the northeast of the Cameroon grassfields, we show the political and ideological nature of health and healing in this society. We argue that within a centralized political system as the one of the Wimbum, popular healing is closely bound up with basic political and economic processes. Changes of these processes illuminate, therefore, the importance of control over medicines and control over healing, as the two crucial issues we focus on in this paper.\n      </p>", "Complex social systems require knowledge specialists who provide information that political actors rely on to solve policy challenges. Successful advice is unproblematic; more significant is assigning institutional blame in the aftermath of advice considered wrong or harmful, undercutting state security. How do experts, operating within epistemic communities, preserve their reputation in the face of charges of incompetence or malice? Attacks on experts and their sponsors can be an effective form of contentious politics, a wedge to denounce other institutional players. To examine the politics of expertise we analyze the debate in the early 1950s over \u201cWho Lost China?,\u201d the congressional attempt to assign responsibility for the fall of the Nationalist regime to the Communists. Using a \u201cstrong case,\u201d we examine political battles over the motives of Professor Owen Lattimore. For epistemic authority an expert must be defined as qualified (having appropriate credentials), influential (providing consequential information), and innocent (demonstrating epistemic neutrality). We focus on two forms of attack: smears (an oppositional presentation of a set of linked claims) and degradation ceremonies (the institutional awarding of stigma). We differentiate these by the critic's links to systems of power. Smears appear when reputational rivals lack power to make their claims stick, while degradation ceremonies operate through dominance within an institutional setting. Policy experts are awarded provisional credibility, but this access to an autonomous realm of knowledge can be countered by opponents with alternate sources of power. Ultimately expertise involves not only knowledge, but also the presentation of a validated self.\n      </p>", "This article interprets the symbolism and politics of Iatmul time (Sepik River, Papua New Guinea). Social life is structured by different forms of time (e.g., totemism, myth, Omaha terminologies, ritual). Furthermore, mythic history is a mode of ritual politics. Finally, Iatmul time symbolizes paradoxes of gender. The article concludes by comparing the temporality and gender of Melanesian cosmology with the Aboriginal dreamtime.\n      </p>", "The end of the Cold War offered unprecedented opportunities for human rights diplomacy, but was also the triumphant moment of neoliberal globalism. For four decades the realist suppression of idealism had been justified in terms of Cold War exigencies. Now, once again, liberal \"basics\" were expelled in the name of a specious realism. Less doctrinaire realists, however, are starting to integrate human rights and power politics in accord with Joseph Nye's concept of \"soft power.\" To sacrifice this moral realism on the altar of neoliberalism would be, in soft power terms, to lose the world by conquering it.\n      </p>", "This review presents an overview of research on identity politics. First, I distinguish between various approaches to defining identity politics and the challenges presented by each approach. In the process, I show that these approaches reflect competing theoretical understandings of the relationship between experience, culture, identity, politics, and power. These debates raise theoretical issues that I address in the second section, including (a) how to understand the relationship between personal experience and political stance, (b) why status identities are understood and/or portrayed as essentialist or socially constructed, (c) the strategic dilemmas activists face when the identities around which a movement is organized are also the basis for oppression, (d) when to attribute certain movement outcomes to status identities, and (e) how to link collective action to specific notions of power to help explain the cultural and political goals at which identity politics is aimed. I conclude by recommending some promising avenues for future research.\n      </p>", "This article attempts to use three case studies of labor organizations to explain the uncertainty of informal politics in China. Because informal rules are naturally vague and uncertain, the tactical interactions between government agencies and civic groups become unbalanced. Uncertainty in informal politics in China is almost inevitable.\n      </p>", "The rise of bloggers raises the vexing question of why blogs have any influence at all, given their relatively low readership and lack of central organization. We argue that to answer this question we need to focus on two key factors\u2014the unequal distribution of readers across weblogs, and the relatively high readership of blogs among journalists and other political elites. The unequal distribution of readership, combined with internal norms and linking practices allows interesting news and opinions to rise to the \"top\" of the blogosphere, and thus to the attention of elite actors, whose understanding of politics may be changed by frames adopted from the blogosphere.\n      </p>", "Despite recent and growing interest in organizational politics, conceptual thought in this area tends to be dominated by a single theoretical perspective. In this paper we describe and contrast three views of organizational politics (functionalist, interpretive and radical) according to their differing structures, processes and outcomes. Each view, or lens, directs attention to some aspects of politics and away from others, and each has strengths and weaknesses embedded in it. In order to assess whether multiple perspectives on politics can be fruitfully applied simultaneously, we describe and analyze a case of a hospital administration engaged in budgeting games and illusion making. The data for the case were collected using naturalistic inquiry and multiple methods including structured and unstructured interviews, review of documents, observation of meetings and casual interaction facilitated by frequent visits over a ten-month period. The case revolves around the hospital administrators' attempts to deal with what they termed a \"disastrous deficit\" and the most serious financial situation in the hospital's history. Strategies for dealing with the funding agency and board of directors included the management of meaning and communications about the term \"deficit.\" The three perspectives on organizational politics highlight different dynamics in the case. The interpretive perspective on politics assumes that parties exert influence by constructing the meaning of what others experience. Focusing on a deeper structure of power, the elements of politics which become highlighted are the use of language, information, metaphor, symbols, myths and humor. In the hospital case the administration managed meaning so that others believed that the hospital faced a significant deficit. The creation of illusions of financial crisis through use of linguistic games was supported by symbolic gestures, jokes, hit lists and other reality construction strategies. The functionalist perspective on politics is broken into two subsets, the rational and the pluralist. In this case the rationalist perspective was not operating to any great extent. Every effort was made to avoid both data-based debate or resolution of differences through the use of appeal to authority. The functionalist perspective does highlight the possible reasons for the extensive use of information manipulation by identifying the key players in the game and the bases of power they utilize. The radical perspective directs attention to the larger context of the case and asks at a deeper level why the Ministry of Health, Board of Directors and top administration are engaged in such game playing. Analysis of the political policy context of health care is suggested through this perspective. The analysis of the case using multiple perspectives reveals that a unidimensional critique is almost always going to be flawed. A richer understanding comes from the simultaneous use of all the perspectives. The question of a possible integration of perspectives is raised, and five possible approaches are briefly explored. The value for managers in the use of multiple perspectives lies in increasing their ability to understand and diagnose organizational events. Explicit use of more than one lens on politics heightens understanding of the dynamics and context of the situation and provides more options for action.\n      </p>", "How does globalization affect the politics of conflict and security? This treatment concentrates on three themes: technology, geopolitics of globalization and asymmetric conflict. Focusing on technology serves to shift the attention from globalization events to the infrastructure of globalization, which is shaped by parallel changes in technologies of work, war and politics. Considering violence means zeroing in on the dark side of globalization: how is it that the era of accelerated globalization is so deeply mired in politics of containment? Focusing on conflict and security shows the Janus faces of globalization. A point where key dimensions - technologies, the political economy of violence, geopolitics of globalization - intersect is asymmetric conflict, or conflict and security across development and technology gaps. East-West politics of containment have turned North-South and ideological justifications and strategies of conflict management have changed accordingly. The closing section considers counterpoints in conflict management.\n      </p>", "Performance can represent politics in a way that empowers the audience, transforming the context from one only marginally political into one in which relevant political decisions may be taken.

These political alternatives are rarely considered simultaneously nor are they modeled explicitly. In this paper we make use of survey data from a representative sample of the United States population. We employ multinomial logistic regression to determine what differentiates those who protest from those who engage only in institutionalized politics and from those who engage in no political action. We find that those who engage in social protest are similar in many respects to those who engage actively in institutionalized politics, yet education on social and political issues, participation in community organizations, and frequent church attendance increases the likelihood that individuals will engage in protest relative to institutionalized politics.\n      </p>", "There is good reason to believe that blogs are changing politics, but we don't know exactly how. Nor do we know whether the normative consequences of blogs for politics are likely to be good or bad. In this special issue, we and our co-authors undertake the first sustained effort to map the empirical and normative consequences of blogs for politics. We begin by setting out basic information about blogs, and some anecdotal evidence suggesting that they are indeed politically important. We go on to identify the key empirical and normative questions that blogs raise, and discuss the dearth of relevant data in the existing literature. We conclude by summarizing how the authors of the articles gathered in this special issue help fill this gap.\n      </p>", "The end of the twentieth century witnessed a resurgence of demands for reparations for slavery and segregation in the United States. At the same time, a chorus of prominent political theorists warned against the threat \"identity politics\" poses for democratic politics. This essay considers whether it is possible to construct an argument for reparations that responds to these concerns, particularly as they are articulated by Wendy Brown. To do so, I explore how Brown's analysis of the dangers of political organizing around \"wounded identities\" and of appealing to the state for redress might inform and be informed by arguments for black reparations.\n      </p>", "This paper reconceptualises the politics of landscape as the precarious art of managing the unexpected. By telling the story of a campaign to stop the construction of a road through the Giza plateau in Egypt, the paper elucidates how political power is characterised not only by triumphal coalitions but also by insecurity, blindly grasped chances and pure luck. The paper elaborates on this story by presenting a conception of power not predicated on forces, consequences or effects but rather on the fundamental problem of temporal uncertainty. Through an engagement with Nietzsche, Deleuze and Derrida, the paper conceptualises time as the origin of uncertainty and, thus, the advent of politics itself.\n      </p>", "This paper proposes a non-territorial reading of a politics of place.

While such discourses demand to be contextualized, deconstructed and resisted, they also necessitate creating a link between political praxis and gender politics. My argument centres on the indispensable role critical discourse can play in locating these instances of 'epistemic' violence and revealing the manner in which the themes of constructed gender knowledge have been subjugated to the political praxis of each context. Interventions by donors and NGOs have more often than not been emasculated by the political considerations of governments and establishments. The result has been 'disciplined' gender politics in education, perpetuating traditional discursive practices, roles and stereotypes instead of acting as an emancipatory power. Human development reports and traditional literature on gender bias in education have failed to account for such discursive/power practices. In this paper, I shed light on the national, the international and the textual 'knowledge' that surrounds gender bias in education in a context like Jordan. I conclude by demonstrating the importance of the national and its discursive practices in reformulating approaches based on the international (human development reports) and the textual (literature on gender bias and stereotypes in education).\n      </p>", "James Callaghan's 1976 Ruskin Speech is often presented as denoting the end of consensual policy-making in education and a profigurement of Thatcherite educational policies.

It examines the extent to which patriarchal gender relations lead to the oppression of some (gay and heterosexual) men as well as being inherently exploitative of women. Notwithstanding the powerful fit between 'dominant' (or hegemonic) masculinity and 'compliant' (subordinate) femininity, the paper recognizes a plurality of masculinities and femininities, accessed through a selection of representations of gender difference. While new forms of masculinity may have emerged from the challenge of feminism and gay political activism, the weight of evidence points to the resilience of patriarchal structures rather than to any dramatic shift in the balance of power between men and women. The paper provides new evidence from current research in Bradford. It concludes with an agenda for future research on the spatial structures that underpin dominant forms of masculinity and indicate the lines of possible resistance.\n      </p>", "This article examines the influence of race/ethnicity and gender identity on the politics of American Indian and Hispanic women leaders. The data are drawn from personal interviews with 50 public officials and grassroots leaders active in state, local, or tribal politics in New Mexico. Borrowing from Tolleson Rinehart's model of \"gender consciousness,\" the author creates a classification scheme for assessing the role that race/ethnicity and gender play in the political ideology and motives of the leaders. The findings reveal that racial/ethnic identity is generally more important to Native leaders and grassroots activists, while gender identity is somewhat more salient for Hispanic leaders and public officials. Her classification system for measuring racial/ethnic and gender identity is useful for analyzing qualitative data and may be helpful to other researchers.\n      </p>", "This article examines the nature of Jewish identity in British politics through a case study of the first Jewish Members of Parliament. The 1858 achievement of the right to sit in Parliament marked the culmination of the struggle for Jewish emancipation in Britain. Consequently, the first Jewish MPs were at the forefront of debates concerning Anglo-Jewry's place in British society and were confronted, in particular, with the dichotomy that equality presented European Jews: existing as a minority subculture in a modern nation-state. Between 1858 and 1887, Jewish MPs grew in number and successfully combined Jewish and general interests with little antisemitic reproach, demonstrating a remarkable confluence between the community's and the nation's concerns. However, certain issues raised tensions that forced Anglo-Jewry to defend their specificity within British politics against the perceived terms of their inclusion. This article reveals the ambiguous nature of nineteenth-century Anglo-Jewish identity, highlighting its integration but also continuing particularity and precariousness.\n      </p>", "In Nicaragua, the convergence of two regional trends\u2014the resurgence of the electoral left and the emergence of significant antifeminist movements\u2014has important implications for our understanding of left-wing parties and gender politics. An alliance between the Frente Sandinista de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional (Sandinista Front for National Liberation\u2014FSLN) in the days before the 2006 election banned abortion even to save the woman's life. This can only be explained though the relationship of four long-term processes: (1) the FSLN's becoming a less ideological party, advocating reconciliation rather than revolution, (2) nearly a decade of pact making with the right, (3) the alienation of the feminist movement from the FSLN and divisions within it, and (4) the increasing sophistication of the antifeminist movement. The events of this period demonstrate the importance of examining gender politics in terms of the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable relationship between state, party, and civil society.\n      </p>", "Responses from 150 employees revealed that procedural justice reduced the negative effects of perceptions of covert, self-serving political behaviors (e.g., going along with others), but not overt political behaviors (e.g., tearing others down to build up self) on turnover intentions.

The author argues that community cultural expectations\u2014of environmental leadership and the preservation of local character\u2014had an important impact on project proposals and the political campaigns that followed, including the ability of an unlikely corporate developer to win public approval from this town with a vocal and usually powerful anti-corporate character. While on the surface the local growth coalition came together as expected in the literature, this study demonstrates that development organizations operate within cultural contexts that are more complex than the existing discourse has accounted for. Factors that the author calls \u201ccultural sensitivity\u201d and \u201ccultural sincerity\u201d both play a role. As concerns with environmental sustainability and preservation of local character gain prominence in development politics, the insights drawn from these cases are of particular value.\n      </p>", "This article is based on a case study of a long-term public controversy over the construction of a highway bypass (around Plzen\u0306, Czech Republic). Two principal variants of the bypass were proposed. One of them began gradually to appear preferable, increasingly attractive for experts, but remaining only on paper. In the meantime, however, the other variant became more realistic, pushed through mainly by local politicians and actually constructed. This article shows how purification of science from politics (and vice versa) played a key role in the development and ending of the case. Initial expertization of the case switched to its sharp politicization, when people got frustrated from protraction and indecisive evidence of accumulated expertise. This turned to be fatal for those who consistently staked everything on \"pure facts.\" This article concludes by outlining some general consequences of such a development for both democratic decision making and the political relevance of expertise.\n      </p>", "This article investigates the effects of a Portuguese municipal assembly's decision to adopt Robert's Rules of Order. Originally chosen to organize discussion fairly and guarantee methodically reached decisions, Robert's Rules has had the unintended consequence of silencing many elected members. This disturbs residents because restraining free political debate reproduces prerevolutionary social structures and denies the revolution's promise that average citizens would have a voice in public politics. Thus, many residents hold Robert's Rules to be counterrevolutionary. Others argue, however, that without Robert's Rules their new assembly would become mired in endless debate and consequently be as powerless as it was before the revolution. Such a consequence would deny another revolutionary promise that the new municipal assemblies would be politically effective. This dilemma challenges residents' hopes for radical social change.\n      </p>", "This study tried to understand how the members of an organization interpreted, in their enacted cognitive schema, the events and processes they enacted during their formation of a new strategy. Participant observation, qualitative interviewing, and cognitive mapping identified many important organizational processes. Among these were pervasive coercive organizational politics, which was retained as an interesting element of the organization's rich cognitive schema. Organization members interpreted politics as being deleterious to morale, as indirectly related to inferior organizational performance outcomes, and as a source of organizational control in the form of negative feedback loops. They also interpreted politics in a paradoxical way-greater levels of political activity led to lower levels of political activity.\n      </p>", "Recent contributions by Collins, Evans, Jasanoff and Wynne to the discussion of how science and technology studies (STS) might contribute to understanding 'subpolitics' - the complex, expert knowledge-intensive and distributed political issues technological societies have to deal with - and involvement of STS scholars in experiments to extend public participation in decision-making about science and technology are shown to be based on an un-reflexive use of an off-the-shelf conception of politics. This conception, grafted on the old model of the sovereign, frames political actors as 'mini-kings': as subjects with preferences, interests, aims and plans that they want to be executed. To reveal the limitations of this conception of politics, I confront it with Aristotle's conception of politics. The conception of politics that has guided work in STS is shown to be based on too narrow a conception of political action that fails to properly account for the object of politics. I argue that Aristotle invites us to analyse the object of politics in ways that closely resemble the way in which STS has learned to analyse the object of experimental science. Although Latour comes close to the tasks that an Aristotelian conception of politics suggest, his Politics of Nature shares some of the limitations that trouble other work of STS in the political domain. Despite 25 centuries separating us from his conception of politics, Aristotle may help STS to understand the politics implied in subpolitics.\n      </p>", "Faction-ridden Japanese politics seems to give way to a new politics. The 1994 revision of the electoral law generated an enormous change in the power relationship between faction leaders and the prime minister. Koizumi Jun'ichiro's strategy exemplified the potentiality of the new politics.\n      </p>", "This paper explores the changing role of science in public discourse on 'race' and racism, examining the contention that new biological accounts of human life ('biologism') are transforming how differences are lived and understood. The paper argues that recent developments must be interpreted in the context of two earlier periods during which science was integral to, first racism and then anti-racism. The growing ascendancy of biologism has prompted both utopian and dystopian accounts of the future: one in which scientific racism is revived, the other in which science finally abolishes race thinking. These futures resonate socially and politically, but lack plausibility when held up against either the historical experience of racism or detailed examination of the apparent direction of biologism. The paper argues, however, that there are significant changes taking place. The new biology challenges existing notions of relatedness, personhood and the nature/culture distinction, and is altering the terrain over which race is discussed. The paper highlights some the features of this new setting by exploring the emergence of novel expressions of racialized politics that both utilize biology in the construction of identity and see biology itself as a site of struggle.\n      </p>", "In this essay, we confront the \"conventional wisdoms\" promoted throughout this long presidential campaign. By conventional wisdoms, we mean the common knowledge of politics--the things that commentators and analysts forward as taken-for-granted assertions and beliefs. We will revisit just a few of the campaign season's conventional wisdoms and review them with a sociological eye. In so doing, we find that in politics, as in most other areas, conventional wisdom can be a risky source of knowledge.\n      </p>", "This article connects slavery politics with the curtailment of antebellum infrastructure policy and the limits placed on the development of the early American state. Because many Southerners feared that a unified Northern majority could hinder slavery's expansion or continued existence, they successfully worked to curtail federal power, even in areas seemingly unconnected to slavery. They helped to undermine a national improvement system, the federal government's ability to build improvements within state borders, and Congress's power to levy tolls to fund road repairs. In addition, Southerners' efforts to curb certain improvement projects curtailed the federal government's overall administrative capacity.\n      </p>", "Founded in 1966 by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale as a grassroots organization, the Black Panther Party achieved national and international prominence through their local activities and global ideas. By employing the concepts of spaces of dependency and spaces of engagement, I detail the spatial transformations associated with the evolving political thought of the Black Panther Party. I chart how the four \"moments\" of the Black Panther Party's doctrine (black nationalism, revolutionary nationalism, revolutionary internationalism, and intercommunalism) are geographically contingent, and argue that these four moments demonstrate, both ideologically and materially, how space matters within the political thought of black radical intellectuals. Despite considerable work within geography in articulating alternative conceptions of race and racism, serious lacunae remain. The concepts associated with black separatism, black radical thought, and, crucially, the Black Power Movement have received minimal attention in the geographic literature. And yet fundamental geographic concepts, including territoriality and scalar politics, are key components of black separatism and black power. I argue that a case study of the Black Panther Party provides insights into the fundamental questions of social justice and public space.\n      </p>", "This article revisits the issue of Yeats's politics in the 1930s, especially his attitude to fascism. It takes a sceptical look at the critical consensus on this issue, alleging that Yeats has been exonerated from the fascist charge on too flimsy evidence. For instance, it questions the reliabilty of the putative letter from Yeats mentioned in Pablo Neruda's memoirs in which Yeats lends his support to the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil War. McCormack argues that the evidence in Yeats's own published work, and in some of his other activities, presents a more troubling image of Yeats's right-wing allegiances than his critics have allowed.\n      </p>", "The paper introduces Alain Badiou's philosophy as a powerful resource for social science in rethinking the link between philosophy and politics. It argues the political imperative to unthink the subject as the key conceptual debate from which to array and define an alternative political agenda around which social science can effect and judge other potential points of transformative application upon the world. It highlights the spatiality of the event and the materialisation of counting politics in what Badiou calls the 'situation', situating these within geography's recent concerns over the ethics of anti-foundational thought and the manifesto of thinking politics aside from structural normatives.\n      </p>", "Forecasting the future of world politics requires both some acquaintance with possible alternatives, and a definite theoretical foundation. We first consider five other sets of arguments (associated with Waltz, Huntington, Kennedy, Fukuyama, and Wallerstein), and use them, collectively and individually, as contrasts with our own positions. Based on an evolutionary perspective that emphasizes the mechanisms of variation, selection, cooperation, and amplification, a model of global politics in the past millennium is employed for making a projection of institutional developments into the twenty-first century. These changes are expected to coevolve with developments in the world economy, democratization, and public opinion. Over the next two to three phases of global politics, the possibilities for expanded global organization evolving around a United States-European Union nucleus are considerable but yet tempered by some likelihood of the repetition, in the coming century, of earlier patterns of intensive global conflict over leadership selection.\n      </p>", "Indonesia's relations with China began to improve in 1998. This paper argues that recent improvements in bilateral relations have been primarily the function of changes in Indonesia's domestic politics and China's policy toward Southeast Asia, which contributed to the creation of an atmosphere of trust and comfort in Jakarta's re-engagement with China.\n      </p>", "This essay explores the political theory of the so-called early Walter Benjamin in light of James Martel\u2019s two recent books on the subject. The essay asks whether Max Weber would qualify as a \u201cplotter\u201d in the \u201cBenjaminian conspiracy\u201d that, for Martel, is at the heart of his anarchist politics. It does so by close reading Benjamin\u2019s posthumously published fragment \u201cCapitalism as Religion\u201d from 1921 that specifically draws on Weber. A theoretical kinship is identified between Benjamin\u2019s idea of pure means, which Agamben also considers as a key element in the redefinition of politics, and Weber\u2019s notion of capital and violence as \u201cends in themselves\u201d in economic and political action, respectively. Violence as the \u201cend in itself\u201d or the Selbstzweck of politics represents the Nietzschean undercurrent of Weber\u2019s politics, to which Benjamin may well have felt an affinity.\n      </p>", "This paper analyzes governance and politics in Massachusetts in the 1980s and 1990s. Using a regulationist analysis of the \"mode of social regulation\" as well as urban regime theory's emphasis on governing coalitions, we show how spatial restructuring has transformed governing coalitions, governance structures, and local politics. Empirically, we note the importance of the Greater Boston area to the Commonwealth's recent economic recovery but point to the lack of regional governance capacity. Political fragmentation and territorial conflict continue to frustrate the development of more coherent governing coalitions and governance structures at the state, regional, and local levels. Theoretically, we stress how conditions internal to local economies contribute to their structural incoherence. This contrasts with the regulationist emphasis on external conditions, including globalization and the failure of national states to manage uneven development.\n      </p>", "This analysis of one Xavante group's innovative projects to represent Xavante culture to nonindigenous audiences reveals multiple and complex perceptions of instrumentalities as well as political goals. Unlike many contemporary Native (Amazonian and other) groups that use aspects of their culture to attract support and achieve concrete political goals, local objectives are relatively abstract and future oriented, having to do with public \"image\" and \"existential recognition.\" Analysis illustrates that local ideas about indigenous cultural displays aimed primarily at nonindigenous audiences, including \"identity politics\" and apparently straightforward cultural commodification, may not neatly correspond with anthropologists' or other outsiders' expectations. Overly narrow interpretive foci may cause anthropologists to overlook the potential for multiple and complex objectives and a diversity of locally significant dimensions.\n      </p>", "Bureaucratic politics-for example, the \"political\" interaction between individuals and organizations in the executive branch of government-is a potentially significant force affecting the course and outcomes of governmental policymaking processes. In this article, an empirical and normative model and operationalization of bureaucratic politics is developed, treating it as a variable rather than as an immutable (and by definition problematic) property of policy decision-making. A conceptual model, linking the nature and intensity of bureaucratic politics in advisory systems to the characteristics of the political leaders served by them, is also developed. On the basis of earlier studies of presidential leadership (e.g., Preston, 1996), the leader's need for power, cognitive complexity, and prior policy experience/expertise are hypothesized to affect the organization and operation of the advisory system in terms of bureaucratic politics. Using Hermann's (1983) Personality Assessment-at-a-Distance (PAD) coding technique, theoretical assertions are illustrated in a detailed case study of two critical episodes in U.S. decision-making in the conduct of the Vietnam war in 1965 and 1968.\n      </p>", "As consumer culture pervades the social life of citizens in America and Europe, it becomes increasingly important to clarify the relationship between consumption and citizenship. With this in mind, faculty and students at the University of Wisconsin organized a conference titled \"The Politics of Consumption/The Consumption of Politics.\" Held in October 2006, the meeting provided a forum for leading scholars to discuss the interplay of markets, media, politics, and the citizen-consumer. Revised and expanded versions of the papers they presented are collected in this volume with the goal of advancing this emerging area of inquiry. It is our hope that the essays and research papers we have collected here help define the next wave of theory building and research inquiry on the intersections of consumer culture, civic culture, and mass culture.\n      </p>", "This article integrates theory and data culled from two largely unrelated subdisciplines--biopolitics and constitutional politics--to provide a \"bioconstitutional\" overview of power relationships among Homo sapiens. That overview features three aspects of constitutional configuration: (1) the biopsychological, evidence of which is drawn chiefly from neuroscience, primatology, biochemistry, and championship chess play; (2) the biosocial, evidence of which is drawn chiefly from gene-culture coevolutionary analysis, anthropology, social psychology, jurisprudence, and political science; (3) the biopolicy aspect, evidence of which is drawn exclusively from the American scene, most particularly Supreme Court decision making involving reproductive choice and governmental constraints on gene-cloning. Constitutionalism is conceived as a thought-action field theory, whose values are not only dynamic and functional, but also both politically influential and subject to political influence. Bioconstitutionalism supplies the requisite life science context for these patterns, and itself presents notable feedback features as humans acquire greater capacity to order their adaptive strategies through biological intervention programs.\n      </p>", "Many recent studies on network technologies and cities share an alarmist view of the impact of technological or regulatory change in utility sectors on the social and spatial fabric of cities, pointing to growing discrimination and inequalities, alienation, enhanced social exclusion and urban \"splintering\" on a universal scale. A science and technology study (STS) perspective on these matters is helpful in moving beyond this \"universal alarmism\" by emphasizing the ambivalence inherent to all technologies, the significant potential of contestation of, and resistance, to technology-supported forms of discrimination, and the deeply contingent nature of the process of appropriation of new technologies and, as a consequence, of the social \"effects\" of technologies. Adopting this perspective would mean actively searching for and exploring these context-dependent and often conflictive appropriation processes. For it is in these spaces that we might begin to identify urban technological politics that break free from an intellectually and politically disabling technological pessimism.\n      </p>", "Although sociological research has examined how state symbolism binds citizens together and creates allegiance, little attention has been paid to how such symbols are selected. We investigate the adoption of state flowers in the United States. Seemingly unproblematic processes surrounding the selection of floral emblems can, under certain circumstances, involve heated symbolic politics. The default option of selecting a native flower, naturalizing the state, can be overcome by materialist or cultural interests that invest cultivated flowers with symbolic potency. In-depth case studies of three states where battles were waged over the state flower reveal that the battle lines were material and symbolic, demonstrating that apparently \"authentic\" representations of nature can be trumped by factional and subcultural interests.\n      </p>", "The \"cultural turn\" that swept across the social sciences a generation ago ushered in renewed attention to the cultural analysis of politics. Yet despite this growing area of research, there remains a lack of integration between cultural and noncultural studies of political phenomena. Should this state of affairs be a source of concern for cultural sociologists? I believe it should be. In this essay, I outline reasons why this is the case and what might be done to address this issue. Drawing loosely on Basil Bernstein's distinction between \"restricted\" and \"elaborated\" codes, I suggest that cultural analyses of politics need to be more \"elaborated\" in nature and I offer three guidelines that can orient this type of research program.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Current debates over identity politics hinge on the question of whether status-based social movements encourage parochialism and self-interest or create possibilities for mutual recognition across lines of difference. Our article explores this question through comparative, ethnographic study of two racially progressive social movements, \"pro-black\" abolitionism and \"conscious\" hip hop. We argue that status-based social movements not only enable collective identity, but also the personal identities or selves of their participants. Beliefs about the self create openings and obstacles to mutual recognition and progressive social action. Our analysis centers on the challenges that an influx of progressive, anti-racist whites posed to each movement. We examine first how each movement configured movement participation and racial identity and then how whites crafted strategic narratives of the self to account for their participation in a status-based movement they were not directly implicated in. We conclude with an analysis of the implications of these narratives for a critical politics of recognition.\n      </p>", "The movement toward the rationalization of the world, as conceived by Max Weber, has culminated in the 20th century with the rationalization and the professionalization of politics. It is a process by which human beings attempt to transform decision-making into a public service, independent of class and other interests, and based upon a systematic body of knowledge about man. The development of professionalized politics becomes possible when the practitioners themselves set out to manipulate charismatic symbols and create a social order compatible with professionalized decision-making, as exemplified by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. The major social problems of such a new social order can be traced to the structural tensions which come about as a result of political professionalization. The paper contains an outline of the major tensions existing in Soviet society, which require further study by sociologists: 1) intraprofessional tensions; 2) practitionerclient tensions; and 3) interprofessional tensions. Proposals are made as to the sources of these tensions and the ways in which they are resolved. It is suggested that the survival of professionalized politics is based on the Party's capacity to manage these tensions.\n      </p>", "Each year, over 100,000 children are apprehended entering the United States unaccompanied by parents or legal guardians, and without valid immigration documents. As many as 8,000 of these children are placed in an elaborate system of border patrol detention centers, shelter facilities, and courts. While the Department of Health and Human Services (through the Office of Refugee Resettlement) funds programs that care for the undocumented immigrants, the Department of Justice, (through the Department of Homeland Security) sweeps up and deports the very same children (or their parents). Apprehended children therefore bring to light the competing agendas of security and humanitarianism. Based on interviews with policy makers and program officers, visits to the shelters, and interviews with the children, this article explores the politics of compassion surrounding these migrants. In order to provide more humane and egalitarian response to the migration, the tensions and contradictions inherent in current practices need to be made more conscious. Considering migration from Mexico, Central America, China, and India, the paper challenges the racially and ethnically-coded system that protects some children more than others. Rather than dismantling the politics of compassion, what is needed is a clearer understanding of the children's paths to the United States, and a system without the racial and ethic hierarchies that are currently in place. Otherwise, children will be confined to the space between the war on terror that treats immigrants, even below the age of 18, as security threats, and politics of compassion that emerged from early 21st century immigration reform.\n      </p>", "Within Marxism, class is commonly understood as a social grouping that is constituted by consciousness or solidary practices upon the foundation of (capitalist) relations of production. In our view, this structural conception of class has contributed to images of the decline of class politics that are frequently found in the geographic literature on industrial restructuring. We argue that an alternative understanding of class as a social process of exploitation renders visible a wide variety of capitalist and noncapitalist class processes in industrialized social formations. This conception allows us to see individuals as participating in multiple class processes at a single moment and over time. Understanding both the individual and society as having a decentered, complex, and changing relationship to class also enables us to see a previously invisible politics of class transformation. We examine some recent narratives of industrial change, interpreting them as stories of class struggle and class politics in unexpected social locations. In the process, we introduce a new connection between women and class.\n      </p>", "In this article I note that one important result of the last several decades of social upheaval in Nicaragua has been the emergence of active feminist and antifeminist movements. Since there has been significant analysis of feminist organizing, and very little on antifeminist organizing, the focus of this paper is antifeminism. I argue that the emergence of this backlash movement can be explained in terms of both domestic and global politics. From a domestic perspective, the movement can be seen as a reaction against the Sandinista revolution and its aftermath. From a global perspective, it is a response to what antifeminists see as the challenges of globalization such as feminist successes in international development agencies and the loss of sovereignty due to neoliberalism. It is also a response to the opportunities provided by globalization such as the emergence of a global antifeminist movement with strong links to like-minded organizations in other countries. This article analyzes the historical roots of the movement and then considers the worldviews of the participants in the movement.\n      </p>", "This article examines economy and politics in Sweden from a network theoretical perspective. In Sweden, economic and political elites make up two distinct catnets that are largely separated from each other, although there are bridges between them. The article contributes to an understanding of what brokerage roles are at work within the institutional arrangements of corporatism and pluralism. For several decades Sweden was considered one of the prototypical examples of corporatism. Representative brokerage was common, and promoted a relatively high degree of system integration. However, Swedish corporatism has declined dramatically since the early 1990s. This article discusses the consequences for contacts between the economic and political catnets in Sweden, and how corporatism has affected the level of system integration and the creation of social capital. The article shows that the more pluralistic institutional settings that replaced corporatism have resulted in two simultaneous processes: one of fragmentation of the economic catnet, caused by a shift from interest organizations to singular corporations as the locus of contact with political decision-makers, and one of increased importance of professional lobbyists as brokers (of the liaison type).\n      </p>", "These comments point out certain problems with both the cultural difference and castelike minority theories concerning instances of school failure among minority children.

Now, French-born or -raised youth, stigmatized by those origins, self-identify as French, although they are not so perceived in French society. Drawing on a multi-year ethnographic study of African-origin Muslim girls, this article explores how social structures, in particular national education, simultaneously assimilate and exclude these youth. This study provides insights into the mechanisms of cultural transmission and racialization through statist institutions.\n      </p>", "This article advocates a discursive approach for examining political rhetoric. Such an approach is particularly useful for studying contemporary political ideology. The current political climate, especially in Britain, has been described as exemplifying a \"Third Way,\" which is said to have replaced the old ideological division between \"left\" and \"right\" by a consensual, non-ideological politics. The discursive approach allows the analyst to look at the continuing dilemmas of an ideology that denies its ideological character. In discursive analyses of interviews with 20 elected local officials in the Midlands of England, the respondents (regardless of party affiliation) tended to give accounts that celebrated the development of consensual, less ideologically divisive politics. These accounts, however, were dilemmatic: As the speakers told of social change, they also stressed their own personal stability, as if they themselves existed outside the previous political climate. They also explicitly distanced themselves from the language of \"left\" and \"right,\" but in this distancing a further ideological dilemma was detectable. All the local politicians were officially affiliated to a political party. In discursively subtle ways, the speakers used the left/right continuum as they distinguished between the parties, thereby showing the sort of variability that discursive theorists have noted in other contexts. The implications of such findings and of the discursive approach to studying ideology are discussed in relation to the possibilities for developing a critical political psychology.\n      </p>", "This paper comprises a critical examination of foundationalist conceptions of comprehensive doctrines in the religion in politics-debate. I argue that John Rawls, the towering figure of this debate, operates with a foundationalist conception of comprehensive doctrines that has shaped the debate's view of relevant alternatives (often referred to as exclusivism and inclusivism). However, there are several problems with foundationalist conceptions, and the most serious is that they are empirically inadequate in relation to modern Western societies. I conclude that participants of the exclusivist/inclusivist debate ought to look closer at alternative, non-foundationalist conceptions, and I supply a brief sketch of one such approach, inspired by American pragmatism.\n      </p>", "This article examines the political allegiances of the organic food and farming movement, asking whether the widespread media assumption that organic agriculture is a leftist cause is correct. Despite the enthusiasm with which organic food advocates welcomed the election of President Obama in 2008\u2014and despite the fact that the geographical distribution of certified organic farms in the United States maps closely against states and counties voting Democratic in the 2008 Presidential elections\u2014a wide range of historical and contemporary evidence suggests that political and social conservatives have long formed an important element within the organic movement's ranks. A distinction is drawn between the politics of organic consumers and the politics of organic farmers, although both groups are shown to include vocal supporters from both ends of the political spectrum. Ultimately, organic farming's political shape-shifting is linked to its mobilization of agrarian ideology, which can be seen as both a strength and a weakness for the movement. On the one hand, organic agriculture shows signs of capturing a political authority and authenticity long associated with America's heartland; on the other hand, a hard-line conservative approach to food and farm policy leaves major social and environmental issues associated with agriculture unaddressed.\n      </p>", "Many social scientists contend that the nation-state is experiencing a loss of power and autonomy in the era of economic globalization. In contrast, this article argues that as advanced capitalist nation-states actively promote economic globalization and its associated political institutions, they gain increased power and autonomy in this contemporary phase of their ongoing historical development. Economic globalization is theorized, first, as a 'soft' geo-politics, with which states use economic means to acquire international geo-political hegemony. More importantly, globalization represents a strategy with which advanced capitalist states - along with members of their capitalist classes - shift the politics of accumulation away from domestic citizenries to gain increased control over their political-economies and greater insulation from intra-national contestation. It is states' increased autonomy that provides them leverage to dissolve relationships of reciprocity, obligation, and shared determination that have embedded accumulation within the territorially rooted nation and that partly constitute the foundations of nation-hood and participatory citizenship. Individual states' ability to use globalization toward these ends depends upon their relative power within the inter-state system and their indigenous subaltern groups' capacity to retain partial control over economic decision-making, through collective action.\n      </p>", "The \"new-politics\" perspective derives welfare state retrenchment from postindustrial changes generating budget deficits and government attempts to benefit cuts, attempts largely resisted by powerful new groups of welfare-state clients. Comparative studies based on social expenditures show little or no role of class-based parties in the retrenchment process. In the power-resources perspective, focusing on the role of distributive conflicts between major interest groups, the post-war European welfare state included full employment in the \"Keynesian welfare state,\" based on a social contract markedly differing from the one in the United States. The return of mass unemployment in Europe constitutes a major welfare state regress and generates government budget deficits. Analyses based on social citizenship rights indicate major retrenchment in some countries, with political parties and welfare state institutions playing significant roles. The return of mass unemployment and cuts in social rights appear as a reworking of the European postwar social contract.\n      </p>", "One problem faced by teachers of citizenship is that 'politics' is negatively valued. The concept is actually ambiguous in value. The paper sets out a neutral, a negative, and a positive meaning of the term. It then goes on to explore the way that even on the positive construction there can seem to be ethical problems with politics. This explains both aspects of numerous projects to 'depoliticise' society and government, and to depoliticise citizenship education. But, the alternatives mean that we lose important political values.\n      </p>", "From the early 1980s onward, popular religion has enjoyed a momentous revival in Shaanbei (northern Shaanxi province), as in many other parts of rural China. But despite its immense popularity, popular religion still carries with it an aura of illegality and illegitimacy. Not properly Daoism or Buddhism, which are among the officially recognized religions, popular religion in theory constitutes illegal, superstitious activities. This article addresses questions of the legality and legitimacy of popular religion by analyzing the case of the Black Dragon King Temple in Shaanbei and its temple boss. It examines how not just popular religiosity but the actions of local elites and local state agents have enabled the revival of popular religious activities, focusing particularly on the legitimation politics engaged in by temples and their leaders.\n      </p>", "This essay offers a conceptualization of a comparative politics of gender (CPG) and some explanations for why CPG work is marginalized in the comparative politics subfield. I delineate CPG as a field of study in which gendered dependent or independent variables are the defining feature and present illustrative examples of four different types of CPG research. I contend that institutional and historical factors account for much of the marginalization of CPG research, and I propose some courses of actions through which CPG scholars can lessen this marginalization. The failure of comparative politics scholars to engage with gendered work is also a serious problem. The essay concludes by offering some suggestions for better integrating CPG scholarship into the subfield.\n      </p>", "In recent years, an increasing number of geographers have been concerned to develop what might be called a cultural politics of place. They have argued that the representation of places is both constituted by, and legitimates, social power relations. Although it is often acknowledged that the process of representation is thus the focus of struggle, there have been very few studies of particular examples of resistance. The paper suggests that the main reason for this neglect may be the bipolar model of culture with which most cultural geographers appear to work. This model establishes a hegemonic ideology which becomes the focus of critique and a counter-hegemonic opposition about which it is ethically difficult to speak. This model has its strengths, but a weakness is its disturbing erasure of oppositional cultural practices from geographical studies. This paper therefore prefers to draw on the notion of cultural hybridity in order to be able to discuss two films made in the early 1970s by local groups in the East End of London. The paper argues that in order to understand how these films can be described as oppositional, their complex engagement with dominant discourses must be explored. Discussion of the films centres on contemporary definitions of and on their realist aesthetic in order strategically to specifiy their oppositionality.\n      </p>", "The Nigerian police discovered dozens of corpses at a shrine in Anambra State, in southeastern Nigeria, in 2004. There were suggestions in the many newspapers covering the story that these were evidence of what Nigerians call 'ritual murders'. In fact, the corpses almost certainly were of people who had died elsewhere and been removed to the shrine only subsequently. However, the revelation that senior political figures had attended the Okija shrine and sworn oaths there drew attention to an informal politics in which traditional shrines credited with powers of life and death may play an important role, of interest even to national politicians. Discerning why this is so entails considering the long-term effects of the colonial policy of Indirect Rule and the subsequent development of a clandestine political system in which local religious institutions sometimes play an important role.\n      </p>", "How do politics affect the strategic decision processes of top executives in the \"high-velocity\" microcomputer industry? We induced a midrange theory linking power, politics, and performance from a study of eight firms in the microcomputer industry. We found that politics--the observable, but often covert, actions by which executives enhance their power to influence decisions--arise from power centralization. Autocratic CEOs engage in politics and generate political behavior among subordinates. We also found that politics are not organized into shifting and temporary alliances based on issues. Rather, they are organized into stable coalitions based on demographic characteristics such as age and office location. Finally, politics within top management teams are associated with poor firm performance.\n      </p>", "In the Vietnam and Iraq conflicts, British Prime Ministers were asked to contribute forces to an American-led war that was deeply unpopular in the United Kingdom. This presented Harold Wilson and Tony Blair with conflicting incentives and constraints: to support their senior ally or to make policy based upon domestic considerations. Why did Harold Wilson decline to commit British forces while Tony Blair agreed to do so? With situational factors generating conflicting predictions, I argue that investigation of individual-level variables is necessary. In particular, I suggest that leaders vary systematically in their willingness to subordinate the concerns of constituents to strategic imperatives, and that introducing the leadership style categories of \"constraint challenger\" and \"constraint respecter\" can make more determinate the linkage between domestic politics and strategic concerns.\n      </p>", "The question of how space matters to the mobilisation, practices and trajectories of contentious politics has frequently been represented as a politics of scale. Others have focused on place and networks as key spatialities of contentious politics. Yet there are multiple spatialities - scale, place, networks, positionality and mobility - that are implicated in and shape contentious politics. No one of these should be privileged: in practice, participants in contentious politics frequently draw on several at once. It is thus important to consider all of them and the complex ways in which they are co-implicated with one another, with unexpected consequences for contentious politics. This co-implication in practice, and its impact on social movements, is illustrated with the Immigrant Workers' Freedom Ride in the United States.\n      </p>", "This article describes various local-level political strategies employed in rural Portugal since the 1974 revolution, and details some of the complexities consequent to introducing representative government to populations with little experience in public politics. The article also demonstrates how quantitative analysis, done while the researcher is still in the field, can produce distinct advantages for a qualitative study, by helping to establish rapport with field residents and revealing new directions for qualitative research.\n      </p>", "Recent years have witnessed the progressive envelopment of environmental politics within institutions for local, national, and global environmental governance. Such institutions inscribe particular forms of discourse, simultaneously creating certain possibilities and precluding others, privileging certain actors and marginalizing others. Apparently designed to ameliorate environmental destruction, these institutions may in fact obstruct meaningful change through endless negotiation, legalistic evasion, and compromise among \"stakeholders.\" More importantly, however, they insinuate and naturalize a discourse that excludes moral or political imperatives in favor of indifferent bureaucratic and technoscientific forms of institutionally created and validated intervention. Drawing on Rappaport's insights about \"the subordination of the fundamental to the contingent and instrumental\" (in \"The Anthropology of Trouble\"), I examine this process of institutional development with reference to an international rain forest campaign that focused on Sarawak, East Malaysia, from the late-1980s to the mid-1990s.\n      </p>", "Claims regarding a unitary, coherent \"Celtic\" culture and its westward spread over centuries have proliferated rapidly over the past 10 to 15 years. We examine both this general phenomenon, and one specific instance of it in detail: the claims of Celtic identity by Wise Use activists in New Mexico in the 1990s. Our primary concern is to examine their significance and utility in contemporary cultural politics. We argue that they have provided a powerful way for many white people in Western Europe and the United States to claim for themselves an ethnic identity strongly associated with oppression and resistance to the state, a position that affords them symbolic resources in negotiating the challenges of both multiculturalism and neoliberalism.\n      </p>", "The changing world scene is marked by innumerable developments for which extant paradigms have, at best, strained and insufficient explanations. Here the analysis undertakes a fresh approach to the emergent patterns of global life by tracing a bifurcation in which the state-centric world coexists and interacts with a diffuse multi-centric world consisting of diverse \"sovereignty-free\" actors who endlessly confront an \"autonomy\" dilemma that differs significantly from the \"security\" dilemma of states. An outline of the basic structures and processes of this two-world universe of world politics suggests that its equilibrium may derive from cyclical patterns in which orientations at the micro-level toward authority and legitimacy vary systematically to redress the balance of systems and subsystems at the macro level. /// L'\u00e9volution du monde actuel montre que nos paradigmes explicatifs ne sont plus capables d'en expliquer les multiples changements. L'article offre une approche nouvelle \u00e0 l'explication de ces changements et des rapports inter- et intra-nationaux. Cette approche tient compte de la distinction entre un monde centr\u00e9 sur l'Etat, et un autre monde diffus, aux centres multiples, dont les agents \"libre de souverainet\u00e9\" font sans cesse face au probl\u00e8me de la sauvegarde de leur autonomie, probl\u00e8me qui differe sensiblement des probl\u00e8mes de s\u00e9curite\u00e9 auxquels font face les Etats. L'esquisse des structures et des processus de base d'un monde \u00e0 deux univers imbriqu\u00e9s sugg\u00e8re l'existence de mouvements cycliques. Au niveau de l'individu et des micro-structures, les rapports d'autorit\u00e9 et de l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 semblent varier syst\u00e9matiquement, de telle fa\u00e7on que se maintienne ou se r\u00e9tablisse l'\u00e9quilibre des syst\u00e8mes et sous-syst\u00e8mes de l'autre niveau, celui des macro-structures.\n      </p>", "The bureaucratic politics model and the poliheuristic theory are used to examine how political advice presented in various contexts influences choice. Organizational advisers who offer endogenous political advice are compared with situations in which the decision maker is offered advice by a separate, or exogenous, political adviser. Results show that decision makers are influenced by political evaluations in a noncompensatory manner, even when this advice is endogenously presented, and that political evaluations (and foreign policy choices) can be affected by the presence of multiple bureaucratic advisers. These findings have significant implications for how information is presented in advisory group settings.\n      </p>", "This study focuses on the consequences at the local level of decentralisation and state disengagement policies in Chile. We proceed in two stages. First, we analyse whether the nature of urban collective goods and services has changed from political to economic. Next, we study the effect of these policies on community/authority relations, and more broadly, on local politics. A case study of the city of Concepci\u00f3n serves to explore our questions. We conclude that the local community has adapted to the economic nature of collective goods and has developed the necessary organisation, technical and leadership skills. Power politics however have not disappeared but are now in higher institutional levels. Politicians do not seem to have followed the trend and thus have still to open to democratic participation and legitimate representation as expressed by the citizens' aggregated interests.\n      </p>", "The destruction of Japan's cyclotrons by Occupation Forces after the Pacific War resulted in a major setback for experimental physics in that country. Key figures such as Yoshio Nishina, Sin-itir\u00f4 Tomonaga, and Ry\u00f4kichi Sagane strived to help Japan rebuild its scientific infrastructure and regain some of its former eminence in the field, but in the wake of the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the atom had new meaning. Local residents objected to the establishment of the Institute for Nuclear Study in Tanashi, Tokyo. Despite their protests, construction went ahead and the Institute of Nuclear Study (INS) opened in 1955. Within a few years, physicists sought to establish a second major accelerator facility. Sectionalism among physicists and shortage of funds plagued attempts to establish the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics (KEK) which eventually came into being in 1970. This paper reveals some of the problems that physicists faced and how they sought to overcome them within the context of a defeated Japan, wary of military research, and desperately seeking to rebuild its economy. Physicists sought to influence the direction of science policy and to deal with the concerns of citizens in a newly democratic Japan.\n      </p>", "Writing slightly over fifty years ago, the author describes the background to the construction of a literary language, argues against the policy, procedures, and results of the Soviet authorities and their collaborators, and damns the new artificial language on scientific grounds. An introduction by Inoue, who discovered the article, and a bibliography of Shirokogoroff's works accompany this trenchant criticism of the use of language for ideological ends.\n      </p>", "This article explores a significant puzzle: the persistence of modern representative democracy in post-independent India. It demonstrates how a politics of recognition, based on identities of caste, language, and religion, is crucial for understanding the origins, character, and trajectory of modern Indian democracy. These politics suffer various infirmities. Yet liberal, Marxist, and republican critiques of the politics of recognition in India, while offering valid theoretical alternatives and powerful moral visions, also suffer their own limitations. Perhaps more importantly, they evade questions of historical possibility, political efficacy, and practical reason that confront every political theory. The relative historical predominance of the politics of recognition in post-independent India, in contrast, reflects its capacity to engage powerful social imaginaries that enabled the realization of democratic norms, institutions, and practices. The general argument put forward develops several key themes that distinguish Charles Taylor's philosophical vision of alternative modernities--the power of social imaginaries, nature of explanation in the human sciences, and vicissitudes of culture, politics, and history--to explain the trajectory of modern Indian democracy.\n      </p>", "In the late 1970s, children of Holocaust survivors utilized feminist and therapeutic ideas to develop a collective identity as the \u201csecond generation.\u201d Emphasizing self-disclosure and storytelling designed to break the silence around the Holocaust, this cohort devised an identity linked to their parents but possessing separate needs and interests. The second-generation movement has been criticized for being overly introspective. This article, which draws on ethnographic fieldwork and interviews, takes a more sympathetic approach. By forming a collective identity and speaking openly about their experiences, children of survivors engaged in a therapeutic politics that contributed to the growing public consciousness of the Holocaust in the United States.\n      </p>"], "words": {"essay": {"number": 3, "prob": 2.4843794641193497e-05}, "represent": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "concept": {"number": 1,
