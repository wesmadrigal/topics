Only 50 useable replies were received. The questionnaire therefore did not serve the purpose of identifying teachers of pre-college anthropology which might serve as a point of contact for the Committee on Materials and Methods for the Teaching of Anthropology of the Council on Anthropology and Education. Replies of respondents indicate that anthropology is perceived primarily as an upper grade secondary subject, taught as a one-semester cultural or survey course with regional concentration in the Pacific coast, upper mid-west, northeast, and Florida. A great variety of materials are used, the most frequently reported materials being those developed by the Anthropology Curriculum Study Project. All teachers responding except one indicated some previous course work in anthropology. Thus the teaching of anthropology appears to be related to teacher preparation in anthropology. The inclusion of anthropology in the preparation program of teachers is recommended.\n      </p>", "The historical development of educational anthropology is examined within the context of the growth of professionalism and specialization in the discipline as a whole. It is argued that the 1954 Stanford Conference and the formal organization of the Council on Anthropology and Education in 1970 culminated previous developments in the field of educational anthropology and inaugurated new ones. However, these events also reflected changes in economic support for anthropology, modifications in anthropologists' relationships to applied problems, and redefinitions of the meaning of professionalism in the discipline.\n      </p>", "Considerable tension among the subfields has existed within the discipline of anthropology. As a result, some anthropology departments have splintered, and the hallmark \"holistic approach\" of anthropology has been considered more myth than reality.

This article provides an introduction to this special issue of the \"American Anthropologist\", which focuses on the subfield of biological anthropology. Hopefully, as a result, increased connections among the subfields will be fostered, for the betterment of both biological anthropology and anthropology in general.

As the field matures, it will become increasingly judicious in its borrowing from other intellectual traditions, and both educational and research objectives will be profoundly affected. The current interest of anthropologists in business activity is one source of synergy that can be effectively harnessed. Applied anthropology has begun to achieve parity with the four traditional sub-disciplines of anthropology, and business has become a critical area of application. As this field is legitimated, the contributions of anthropology will be recognized by business academics and practitioners.

Each phase has its own particular context, actors, and transactions and is characterized by different sets of values and ideas. The anthropology of pharmaceuticals is relevant to medical anthropology and health policy. It also touches the heart of general anthropology with its long-time interest in the concepts of culture vs nature, symbolization and social transformation, and its more recent concerns with the cultural construction of the body and processes of globalization and localization. The study of transactions and meanings of pharmaceuticals in diverse social settings provides a particularly appropriate empirical base for addressing these new theoretical issues.\n      </p>", "A unique introductory anthropology course at Texas Tech University introduces students to cultural diversity in the United States. Students read ethnographies\u2014fieldwork-based descriptions of Hispanic, African American, and other communities\u2014and then do ethnographic research of their own in the local community. This popular course encourages students to develop intersubjectivity: understanding others by entering into different cultural worlds, if only briefly.\n      </p>", "In France as elsewhere, anthropology developed as an autonomous discipline concerned with the study of faraway primitive or \"exotic\" societies, but it has shifted its purview, especially over the past several decades, to also include societies closer to home in both time and space. Consideration of the substantial literature produced over the past 30 years by French anthropologists conducting research in France illustrates the specificities of national disciplinary traditions in perceiving and meeting this challenge. Anthropology's position within the institutional framework of contemporary French academic and scholarly life, as well as the intellectual traditions that have been brought to bear on the ethnological study of France (especially the legacies of Durkheimian social thought and folklore studies) are shown to have helped shape both the production of anthropological knowledge of and in France and debates about its pertinence to the discipline's future.\n      </p>", "The author describes a method of teaching large sections of introductory anthropology by members of the anthropology faculty giving their best lectures.

What actually changed? What elements of the race concept have been rejected, and what elements have persisted, influencing physical anthropology today? In this article, I examine both the scientific and social influences on physical anthropology that caused changes in the race concept, in particular the influence of the American Anthropological Association. The race concept is complicated but entails three attributes: essentialism, cladistic thinking, and biological determinism. These attributes have not all been discarded; while biological determinism and its social implications have been questioned since the inception of the field, essentialism and the concomitant rendering of populations as clades persists as a legacy of the race concept.\n      </p>", "I am the first editor of \"AEQ\" to serve the two three-year terms allowed by the bylaws of the Council on Anthropology and Education.

At the end I offer some thoughts on the issue of public policy.\n      </p>", "The employment of women and men during the years 1967-68 through 1975-76 is examined for a group of 22 leading departments of anthropology.

The first part of the article raises the question: Is anthropology of education, through an emphasis on such themes as school ethnography, observational methodology, curricular development, and the schooling of native peoples, moving towards narrowness and specialization? Or to turn the question around: To what extent is the field still based in an anthropology that is general, pan-human, and evolutionary in scope? The main thesis of the paper is that an anthropology of the young might be a useful move in the latter direction. In the second part of the paper, a conceptual framework for an anthropology of the young is sketched out, in terms of four points: Defining the young, describing their cultural patterns, understanding their cultural dependence, and coping ethnographically with the problems of development. The article closes with a brief attempt to argue the advantages of such an approach to professional educators and anthropologists of education.\n      </p>", "During the past two decades the relevance of various academic disciplines to college students has changed dramatically. In part, this is related to changing sociopolitical and economic attitudes among students about what a college education means in today's world. Also at issue, however, are fundamental changes in the way particular disciplines have met the needs of students during the past twenty years. Anthropology is one discipline that has experienced declining enrollments due to students' perceptions about the relevance of the field in the marketplace. In this article, we consider how such problems of relevance can be overcome by incorporating programs of academic and applied research directly into undergraduate anthropology curricula.\n      </p>", "The author describes three uses of folklore in teaching anthropology: collecting folklore through interviewing; analyzing folklore themes; and using folklore in puppetry and plays.\n      </p>", "Critiques of anthropology from within the discipline and from without have been a major feature of our intellectual life since the late 1960s. The theoretical and empirical bases of cultural and social anthropology have been under attack since the Marxist and New Left critiques of the 1960s to those coming more recently from poststructuralism, postmodernist and literary theory, and postcolonial and cultural studies. As a result, several academic generations have been educated by reading the attacks on the field but rarely dealing with the actual theoretical works and ethnographies of earlier anthropologists. This article deals with several of the most common charges leveled at anthropology, notably that it has regularly and necessarily exoticized \"Others,\" has been ahistorical, and has treated each culture as if it were an isolate, unconnected to any other. It demonstrates how inaccurate and easily falsifiable such claims are and recommends a critical reevaluation of these unexamined and destructive cliches.\n      </p>", "This article is about the influence of the work of the German sociologist Max Weber (1864-1920) on English-speaking anthropologists. Although Weber does not figure prominently in the history of anthropology, his work has, nonetheless, had a profound influence on anthropological methodology and theoretical thinking on the relationship between religion and political economy. The \"interpretive anthropology\" first developed by Geertz has roots in Weber's \"interpretive sociology.\" Bourdieu's \"theory of practice\" is also strongly Weberian in character. The anthropological study of religion, and particularly the debate over the foundations of this field between Geertz and Asad, is reconsidered in light of Weber's sociology of religion. His comparative study of the ethics of the world's religions and particularly the \"Weber thesis\" about the relationship between religion and the development of bourgeois capitalism are shown to have been the foundation for a large body of anthropological research on religion and political economy in societies in which the major world religions have been long established. The essay ends with a suggestion that Weber's work on politics and meaning merits reexamination in light of contemporary anthropological interest, derived from Foucault, in power and knowledge.\n      </p>", "This article reviews the history of British social anthropology, concentrating on the expansion of the discipline in the British university sector since the 1960s. Particular emphasis is placed on the relationship between social anthropology and the main source of its funding, the British government, in particular the Economic and Social Research Council. After a particularly difficult time in the 1980s, social anthropology in the 1990s has grown swiftly. In this period of growth, formerly crucial boundaries-between academic anthropology and practical policy-related research, between \"social\" and \"cultural\" anthropology-appear to have withered away. Yet British social anthropology retains much of its distinctive identity, not least because of the peculiar institutional structures, such as the research seminar, in which the social anthropological habitus is reproduced in new generations of researchers.\n      </p>", "An \"external,\" nomothetic perspective that has been formulated by some historians of science (e.g., Kuhn 1968) is used to examine the history of anthropology in the United States. Regularities that characterize the growth of the physical sciences and the production and use of literature associated with them are shown to be characteristic of anthropology as well. Implications for the way anthropology will be done in the future are discussed.\n      </p>", "The author describes computer-aided learning that can be used in introductory anthropology courses as well as in courses designed for majors. This experience is used to identify design and evaluation concepts that will help in developing computer-aided learning so anthropology students can use cultural variables and make cultural decisions.\n      </p>", "Recent assessments of the future of visual anthropology have suggested that with the increasing availability of low cost digital technology the subdiscipline is on the edge of a great leap forward. However, by analyzing another era, that of the interwar years, when the arrival of low cost photographic equipment was also held to herald a new era for visual anthropology, this article suggests exactly the opposite. Rather accessibility led to a decrease in use of visuals. This article analyses some of the factors involved and suggests that current assessments might be overly optimistic.\n      </p>", "Recent developments in psychology are bringing about a rapprochement between behaviorists, trait psychologists, and psychodynamically oriented theorists. The incipient perspective, which has been labeled \"interactional psychology,\" focuses on persons-insituations and raises some penetrating questions for psychological anthropology. Attempts by interactionists to reconcile traditional concepts of \"personality\" with evidence demonstrating the power of situations to pattern behavior are discussed. It is proposed that the interactionist framework fits well with recent trends in anthropology that emphasize the contextualization of behavior and an interest in intracultural diversity.\n      </p>", "The author discusses the forces that operated before World War II in the United States to limit the number of black anthropologists and the factors that ultimately led to increased participation of black students and professors in the discipline. As one of the less than a dozen \"pioneers,\" the author uses his own career as an atypical case study to illuminate certain significant facets of the history of anthropology. He discusses the image that anthropology had among Afro-Americans as well as its role in the early development of race relations theory and multicultural practice. Mainstream anthropology is viewed as an institutional subsystem of an educational subsystem within a political-economic system that conditions its approach to race and ethnicity.\n      </p>", "In this article, we introduce the inaugural issue of the \"Public Anthropology Reviews\" section. We suggest that the new section reflects significant changes underway in the discipline, including an expansion in the kind of work valued among anthropologists, new ways in which anthropological knowledge is being produced and disseminated, and an acknowledgment that anthropologists have a responsibility to dedicate their skills to issues of broad public import. The section will, thus, expose AA readers to some of the new anthropological work appearing in a wide variety of media and nontraditional academic formats that aims both to communicate primarily with nonanthropological audiences and to have an impact on critical issues of wide social significance. We here present the reviews in this issue, identify additional contemporary issues likely to be addressed in future reviews, and welcome submissions and critical feedback for the section.\n      </p>", "This essay deals with aspects of the historic and contemporary linkages between the discipline of anthropology and the domain of education. An historic contextualization of the development of educational anthropology provides the frame from within which extant theoretical and methodological issues are critically delimited. Possibilities for future areas of activity and concern are explored, and specific recommendations for future directions are presented.\n      </p>", "This essay analyzes one of Germany's former premier research institutions for biomedical research, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology, Human Heredity and Eugenics (KWIA) as a test case for the way in which politics and human heredity served as resources for each other during the Third Reich. Examining the KWIA from this perspective brings us a step closer to answering the questions at the heart of most recent scholarship concerning the biomedical community under the swastika: (1) How do we explain why the vast majority of German human geneticists and eugenicists were willing to work for the National Socialist state and, at the very least, legitimized its exterminationist racial policy; and (2) what accounts for at least some of Germany's most renowned medically trained professionals' involvement in forms of morally compromised science that wholly transcend the bounds of normal scientific practice? Although a complete answer to this question must await an examination of other German biological research centers, the present study suggests that during the Nazi period the symbiotic relationship between human genetics and politics served to radicalize both. The dynamic between the science of human heredity and Nazi politics changed the research practice of some of the biomedical sciences housed at the KWIA. It also simultaneously made it easier for the Nazi state to carry out its barbaric racial program leading, finally, to the extermination of millions of so-called racial undesirables.\n      </p>", "This article explores the relationship between feminism and postmodernism in anthropology through a reading of the Derek Freeman / Margaret Mead controversy. It argues that the tensions between feminism and \"experimental\" ethnography can be captured by attending to writing practices in book reviews of Freeman's refutation of Mead. It compares reviews by George Marcus, Bonnie Nardi, and Albert Wendt, a Samoan writer. What follows is a discussion of feminist ethnography as an emergent response to the masculine bias of experimentalism. Lila Abu-Lughod's \"Can There be a Feminist Ethnography?\" redraws lines between feminist anthropology, experimental ethnography, and \"halfie\" or bicultural identity.\n      </p>", "For the past 30 years, anthropology's critics have repeatedly questioned the notion of \"cultural boundaries,\" arguing that concepts of culture inappropriately posit stable and bounded \"islands\" of cultural distinctiveness in an ever-changing world of transnational cultural \"flows.\" This issue remains an Achilles' heel--or at least a recurring inflamed tendon--of anthropology. However, in the conception of boundaries, we still have much to learn from Boasian anthropologists, who conceived of boundaries not as barriers to outside influence or to historical change, but as cultural distinctions that were irreducibly plural, perspectival, and permeable. In this article, I retheorize and extend the Boasians' open concept of cultural boundaries, emphasizing how people's own ideas of \"the foreign\"--and the \"own\" versus the \"other\" distinction--give us a way out of the old conundrum in which the boundedness of culture, as conceived in spatial terms, seems to contradict the open-ended nature of cultural experience.\n      </p>", "A \"new\" anthropology of knowledge transmission must expand its focus beyond traditional concerns with child development, schooling, and cultural continuity. Equally, it should probe the relationship between cultural knowledge-as artifact and event, as analytic concept, and as empirical phenomenon-and scientific knowledge and inquiry, moving us toward an anthropology of knowledge. Included in analysis should be processes of knowledge construction and transmission, structural variables, cultural values and assumptions, biophysiological variables, diachronic and synchronic contexts, and learning outcomes.\n      </p>", "I describe a strategy for designing an introductory course in cultural anthropology for \"nonelite\" students. The course is organized around basic themes. Emphasis is placed on the importance of using the culture concept as an analytical tool in order to understand better culturally different behaviors.\n      </p>", "We present an approach to teaching cultural anthropology that combines an inductive method and ethnographic case studies. From introductory courses to graduate-level seminars, the inductive case study approach combines written materials, films, and other aids to allow students to discover culture.\n      </p>", "Recent changes within social and cultural anthropology have made history a key issue, but in this essay I argue that the field has yet to develop the resources that are required to deal with temporality. This point is made through an extended examination of Jean and John Comaroff's work on Christianity and colonialism in southern Africa. Arguably, the Comaroffs read history backward and then present its unfolding as a kind of inexorable logic. In doing so, they homogenize missionary and Tswana \"cultures\" and attribute agency to abstractions rather than to people acting in particular material contexts. In contrast, I argue for a narrative approach to historical anthropological explanation. The emergent qualities of events - and the variable ways in which capitalism, hegemony, Protestantism, and vernacular modernisms relate - require narrative for explanation, narrative that encompasses within itself the narratives of social actors themselves.\n      </p>", "This paper is an introduction into recent trends in cognitive anthropology. Examples of well-established models and methods (Part 2) are contrasted with current developments, particularly with contributions of neighboring fields like artificial intelligence and cognitive psychology (Part 3). The year 1979 is seen as marking the turn to process-oriented, interdisciplinary approaches. In the last section (Part 4), a list of \"open question\" is presented to suggest directions for further research.\n      </p>", "This article reviews the growth of knowledge in the four fields of anthropology. It is not an intellectual history but, rather, focuses on what I consider to have been the important developments in substantive knowledge.\n      </p>", "My main efforts in anthropology have sought to unite ethnographic and theoretical work by using empirical findings as provocations to critique received theory and raise unasked questions. I have used generative modeling to identify the empirical processes that, in their aggregate, shape social and cultural forms. Much of my time has been spent in ethnographic field studies in the Middle East, New Guinea, Indonesia, and the Himalayas, as well as Norway. This review traces the reflections and opportunities that connect these activities.\n      </p>", "Initially given as the Presidential Address at the 100th Meeting of the AAA, this article examines the contributions of women and minority anthropologists who have struggled to gain a place at the center of the discipline. Despite 25 years of scholarship on women and minorities, anthropology needs to go further in terms of paying attention to their pioneering efforts and the breadth of their scholarship. The article explores four currently important areas of creativity: (1) the transformation of field research through problem-oriented participant observation and \"native anthropology,\" as exemplified by George Hunt, the young Margaret Mead, and Delmos Jones; (2) the evolution of more dialogical forms of ethnographic writing, as pursued by Elsie Clews Parsons, Gladys Reichard, Ella Deloria, and Zora Neale Hurston; (3) sources of critique, as embodied in the work of Ruth Benedict and Michelle Rosaldo; and (4) forms of activism, engaged in by Anita McGee, Benedict, Mead, and Alfonzo Ortiz.\n      </p>", "Many attempts to understand the cultural impact of the forces of modernism, capitalism, and globalization have come to highlight contemporary cultural diversity at the expense of reifying a homogenized past of traditional, static societies. The \"savage slot\" still provides a convenient myth for characterizing small-scale communities before the advent of modernism--communities that experienced dramatic change only as they were pulled into the world system. Archaeological evidence from the southeastern United States challenges this stereotype, as Native American groups routinely migrated and continually redefined notions of \"place\" and \"locality\"--processes often treated as distinctly (post)modern. Such case studies emphasize the importance of working toward a deep historical anthropology that will continue to undermine stereotypes about the Other in the past as well as the present.\n      </p>", "The history of a specialization like \"urban anthropology\" can be studied from diverse perspectives. This analysis concerns the content of the journal Urban Anthropology during the first twenty years of its existence, a period during which the specialization came into being and developed into a maturing sub-field within American anthropology. This analysis considers major methodological, geographical, and subject trends in urban anthropology and also examines the characteristics of its practitioners.\n      </p>", "For a long time anthropology was defined by the exoticism of its subject matter and by the distance, conceived as both cultural and geographic, that separated the researcher from the researched group. This situation has changed. In a few years we may assess the twentieth century as characterized by a long and complex movement, with theoretical and political implications, that replaced the ideal of the radical encounter with alterity with research at home. But \"home\" will, as always, incorporate many meanings, and anthropology will maintain, in its paradigmatic assumption, a socio-genetic aim toward an appreciation for, and an understanding of, difference. In some cases, difference will be the route to theoretical universalism via comparison; in others, it will surface as a denunciation of exoticism or a denial of its appeal. This review examines different moments and contexts in which an attempt at developing anthropology \"at home\" became an appropriate quest.\n      </p>", "The proposal is made that an anticipatory dimension to anthropology should be developed for the purposes of increasing anthropology's capacity to: (1) explain sociocultural change, and (2) contribute to the making of effective proactive public policy. Anticipatory anthropology is needed particularly for the study of rapid change processes, often technology-driven, such as the Telemicroelectronic Revolution. Steps in the ongoing development of anticipatory anthropology are illustrated by a quasi-ethnographic study of the introduction of microcomputers into schools near Silicon Valley, California.\n      </p>", "In the advertising discourse of human genetic database projects, of genetic ancestry tracing companies, and in popular books on anthropological genetics, what I refer to as the anthropological gene and genome appear as documents of human history, by far surpassing the written record and oral history in scope and accuracy as archives of our past. How did macromolecules become \"documents of human evolutionary history\"? Historically, molecular anthropology, a term introduced by Emile Zuckerkandl in 1962 to characterize the study of primate phylogeny and human evolution on the molecular level, asserted its claim to the privilege of interpretation regarding hominoid, hominid, and human phylogeny and evolution vis-\u00e0-vis other historical sciences such as evolutionary biology, physical anthropology, and paleoanthropology. This process will be discussed on the basis of three key conferences on primate classification and evolution that brought together exponents of the respective fields and that were held in approximately ten-years intervals between the early 1960s and the 1980s. I show how the anthropological gene and genome gained their status as the most fundamental, clean, and direct records of historical information, and how the prioritizing of these epistemic objects was part of a complex involving the objectivity of numbers, logic, and mathematics, the objectivity of machines and instruments, and the objectivity seen to reside in the epistemic objects themselves.\n      </p>", "The study of colonialism erases the boundaries between anthropology and history or literary studies, and between the postcolonial present and the colonial past. From the standpoint of anthropology, it is also reflexive, addressing the colonial use and formation of ethnography and its supporting practices of travel. Since the 1960s, the study of colonialism has increasingly presented a view of colonialism as struggle and negotiation, analyzing how the dichotomous representations that Westerners use for colonial rule are the outcome of much more murky and complex practical interactions. By thus treating Western governmentality as emergent and particular, it is rewriting our histories of the present.\n      </p>", "This paper questions the popular anthropological assumption that all purpose money rules in the West today. Contrary to the followers of Karl Polanyi in anthropology, modern as well as primitive money is special purpose money. It is argued further that serious difficulties and confusions arise from indiscriminate use of the term money to refer both to (1) media of exchange and means of payment and (2) units of account. Lastly, the scholarship and perspicacity of the Polanyist verdicts about economists' views in the area of money is disputed.\n      </p>", "This issue's Visual Anthropology Section is a tribute to anthropologist and ethnographic filmmaker Jean Rouch (1917-2004). In nine brief articles, authors discuss the impact of Rouch's pathbreaking career on ethnographic and documentary filmmaking and his contributions to our knowledge of postcolonial Africa. The authors demonstrate the significance of his work for the larger discipline of anthropology, and commemorate Rouch with personal reflections of their time working with and learning from him.\n      </p>", "This review considers the following questions: Why is the city undertheorized in anthropology? Why is an anthropological voice rarely heard in the urban studies and urban policy discourse? Anthropological literature published since 1989 is reviewed, with an emphasis on contributions to urban theory and the locating of anthropological studies within the broader context of urban studies. The city is found not to be absent in anthropological theory, but it has had no major theoretical impact. The images of the ethnic city, divided city, deindustrialized city, and global city have been most influential, as has research in the areas of racism, migration, poststructural studies of conflict and resistance, and critiques of architecture and urban planning. The literature continues to focus on the links between the experience of individuals and sociopolitical and economic processes as well as on the cultural meaning of the urban environment. The newest areas of inquiry include the study of urban space and time, metropolitan knowledge, and ethnoaesthetics.\n      </p>", "In this study the author examines the utility of social anthropological theory for the analysis of education. The framework is equilibrium and processual analysis as developed by the British \"school\" of social anthropology. After discussing the most relevant literature, the author proceeds to apply this structural approach to the case of Chiapas and analyzes schools in two ecological zones within this state: the piedmont region of the Pacific Coast known as the Soconusco, and the highland Altos zone. This analysis is based on extensive fieldwork in the area over a two-year period. The study also discusses the manner in which educational policy is shaped by the national and political structure by using concepts from political anthropology. The author concludes that the national educational system has failed to introduce major sociocultural change in the Altos region because it is not congruent with Indian allocation of time and resources and because the Indian mode of production must be transformed in order to produce sociocultural change. This stands in clear contrast with the Soconusco region where schools are valued as a resource and regarded as effective political institutions. The conservatism of the Indians in the Altos region and the openness to change in the Soconusco are outcomes of different systems of adaptation within different ecological settings. The Mexican case is often considered as an example of a revolutionary mode of education. In the case of the Soconusco, education did in fact for a period of time promote and secure the restructuring of society, albeit as part of a more general process of transformation. Patterns of stratification, ethnic identity and cultural patterns did change as a result of agrarian reform; education as an institution reflected and promoted the process of change. In the case of the Altos de Chiapas, education has not been revolutionary in nature but reflects and helps to perpetuate the existing ethnic differentiation and economic stratification of the region. The educational system has had little impact on the majority of Indian children and manages to siphon off the few students who do become acculturated.\n      </p>", "This article about medical anthropology was inspired by the work of Pierre Bourdieu, specifically, his efforts to reconcile the antinomy of a \"social structuralist\" and a \"cultural constructivist\" perspective. These perspectives are often opposed in the literature, but, in Bourdieu's view, human life cannot be studied without taking into account both how individuals are situated within and constrained by social structures and how those individuals construct an understanding of and impose meaning on the world around them. I argue that the special subject matter of medical anthropology--human health--demands that a synthetic approach be taken in our theory and research. I illustrate this argument with examples from my own research on social and cultural factors associated with blood pressure, and I point to other examples of this synthesis in medical anthropology. The results of this research hold promise for the continuing refinement of culture theory.\n      </p>", "Growing concerns about anthropology's impact in both academia and the broader social arena have led to calls for more \"public\" and more relevant anthropology. In this article, we expand on these exhortations, by calling for systematic joining of critical social theory with application and pragmatic engagement with contemporary problems. We argue for the repositioning of applied anthropology as a vital component of the broader discipline and suggest that it should serve as a framework for constructing a more engaged anthropology. In revisiting disciplinary history and critiques of applied anthropology, we demonstrate the central role that application has played throughout anthropology's evolution, address common misconceptions that serve as barriers to disciplinary integration, examine the role of advocacy in relation to greater engagement as well as the relationship of theory to practice, and conclude with an assessment of the diverse work that is subsumed under the inclusive rubric of \"anthropology in use.\"\n      </p>", "Since the beginning of China's Reform and Opening policy in 1978, the anthropological study of China has revived, and anthropology as a discipline has revived in China. Chinese anthropologists have become part of the world community of anthropologists. Anthropology in and about China has described a society occupied both with recovery from the cultural devastation of High Socialism and with progress toward an uncertain modernity. These narratives of recovery and progress can be followed through the anthropological study of communities-rural, urban, and in between-of individuals' lives, including gender and sexuality, family and marriage, childhood and education, consumption and leisure, and of the nation and its constituent ethnic and regional parts.\n      </p>", "The author describes three exercises that can be used to encourage active participation in cultural anthropology classes: use of a puzzle to demonstrate focal issues about culture; discussion of a specific piece of fieldwork to demonstrate the relationships among fieldwork, ethics, and cultural relativity; and use of study questions in ethnographic films to allow students actively to discuss issues.\n      </p>", "This article engages current debates about concepts of culture in U.S. anthropology by examining how assumptions about language shape them. Characterizing linguistic patterns as particularly inaccessible to conscious introspection, Franz Boas suggested that culture is similarly automatic and unconscious - except for anthropologists. He used this notion in attempting to position the discipline as the obligatory passage point for academic and public debate about difference. Unfortunately, this mode of inserting linguistics in the discipline, which has long outlived Boas, reifies language ideologies by promoting simplistic models that belie the cultural complexity of human communication. By pointing to the way that recent work in linguistic anthropology has questioned key assumptions that shaped Boas's concept of culture, the article urges other anthropologists to stop asking their linguistic colleagues for magic bullets and to appreciate the critical role that examining linguistic ideologies and practices can play in discussions of the politics of culture.\n      </p>", "With no \"authentic voice\" to adjudicate dispute, feminism's own identity is mutable and contestable. There are now many feminisms. However, within anthropology there has been a conspicuous absence of what could loosely be glossed as \"French feminisms\" or \"feminisms of difference.\" Consequently, important debates around the construction of sexual and cultural difference have been effectively censored. We need to ask what might be at stake in this exclusion of a whole range of contemporary intellectual inquiry.\n      </p>", "The author describes a hands-on project where students play the role of professional physical anthropologists in collecting and analyzing data on a small group of contemporary humans. Use of simulated data to represent ancestral populations results in an analysis of microevolution.\n      </p>", "Ant\u00e9nor Firmin published De l'\u00c9galit\u00e9 des Races Humaines in 1885 in Paris as a response both to Arthur de Gobineau's racist tome L'In\u00e9galit\u00e9 des Races (1853-55) and to the racialist anthropology of the nineteenth century. This pioneering work of anthropology has been translated for the first time into English by Asselin Charles as The Equality of the Human Races (Firmin [1885]2000). In 662 pages of the original text, Firmin systematically critiqued the anthropometry and craniometry that dominated the anthropology of his day, while he envisioned a broad, synthetic discipline that would follow once this narrow approach to the study of man was abandoned. He challenged virtually every extant racial myth and laid a basis for the understanding of human variation as adaptation to climate and environment. Contrary to the polygenist doctrines of the infertility of interracial matings, Firmin extolled the value of racial mixture, especially in the vigorous New World hybrid populations. He developed a critical view of racial classifications and of race that foreshadowed much later social constructions of race. In the book he also articulated early Pan-Africanist ideas as well as an analytical framework for what would become postcolonial studies. The Equality of the Human Races is a text that lies historically at the foundations of the birth of the discipline of anthropology, yet it is unknown to the field. It is a pioneering work in critical anthropology that awaits recognition 115 years after it was first published.\n      </p>", "This article proposes the possibility of a neo-Boasian anthropology conceived at the intersection of Foucauldian genealogy, Boasian historicism, and the epistemic rethinking of the discipline's Self/Other binary. Shifting from a perspective of posing the ethnographic object as Other toward a Boasian conception of the past as the principal site of inquiry, the piece thus advocates an anthropological project grounded in the history of the present. This conception, it is argued, can overcome several of the dilemmas currently facing the discipline, the awkward status of \"native anthropology\" foremost among them.\n      </p>", "Anthropology at Beloit enjoys a strong institutional history (from 1893) and maintains a healthy institutional position (in course enrollments, numbers of majors, and admissions) in a liberal arts college of 1,000 students. The five-member staff, however, must constantly balance a program of in-depth study in the four subfields with substantial contributions to the College's general educational program. The paper explores effective mechanisms which support this balance, including multiple sections of interdisciplinary courses, judicious use of pro-requisites, cross-listed courses, and contributions to academic minor programs and interdisciplinary studies.\n      </p>", "Anchored in insights from my evolving research in Mexico and the United States, this article engages the literature on democratic citizenship education and proposes a potentially unifying research program for the anthropology of education. I urge anthropologists of education to address questions of political order and to bring democracy and citizenship toward the center of our concerns. Just as anthropology has much to contribute to the challenges of citizenship education around the world, a reinvigorated cross-cultural comparison can enrich our working theories of democracy and enliven our contributions to the democratization of education in the United States.\n      </p>", "This article argues for a more comprehensive analytical approach in medical anthropology than is currently followed, one that combines attention to structural factors (political, economic, medical/psychiatric), experiential/symbolic expressions and meanings, and biological/bodily features of disorders. We show how subject matter that may be defined as \"adolescent psychopathology\" would be better understood by a comprehensive approach than by partial views. Three areas within adolescent psychopathology are chosen as illustrative: anorexia nervosa, dissociation, and social aggression. Each of these, like adolescence itself, is powerfully shaped by historical and contemporary cultural influences, and each implicates important theories in medical anthropology.\n      </p>", "The author describes a simulation game in which students learn through experience that a social issue is viewed differently by different segments of any population and, as a result, issues are more complex than simply \"right\" or \"wrong.\" The case of development is used with groups of students playing the roles of indigenous peoples, big business, individual entrepreneurs, and government.\n      </p>", "Anthropological literature on AIDS in the international arena from the 1990s shows researchers' increasing attention to linkages between local sociocultural processes that create risk of infection and the lifeworlds of sufferers to the global political economy. Focus on Africa, where the heterosexual epidemic has attained catastrophic proportions, reveals some cultural particularisms but many more regularities in the social production of disease. Global inequalities of class, gender, and ethnicity are revealed, as poverty, powerlessness, and stigma propel the spread of HIV. Anthropologists' witness to suffering, their concern and engagement, are potent elements in the research process and in advocacy in national and international arenas. The combined strength of theory and practice in the field of international research on AIDS is a significant contribution to anthropology in the twenty-first century.\n      </p>", "This paper explores some of the processes that shape the development of an anthropology of sport. It situates the anthropology of sport in relation to a broad and eclectic field of sport studies. It then identifies the anthropology of sport as embedded in the particular sorts of ethnographic projects undertaken and the sites where they are undertaken. Finally, it explores the significance of teaching and researching as activities that contribute to the shaping of an anthropology of sport. The paper argues for a disciplinary commitment to anthropology coupled with an acknowledgement that we should be extending our reach beyond the current boundaries of our discipline. Rather than writing only for a narrowly defined anthropology of sport we should be actively engaging broader and more inclusive audiences interested in sporting activities. /// Cet article explore certains processus qui fa\u00e7onnent le d\u00e9veloppement d'une anthropologie du sport.

From this viewpoint, the locus, unity, and continuity of the self will be found in the systems of signs that constitute the dialogues between utterers and interpreters of the signs. Personal identity, in this theory, is also a social and cultural identity and is not confined to the individual organism. Peirce's anti-Cartesianism, which denies intuitive and introspective knowledge of the self, derived that knowledge from the fallible inferences we all make from the observations of external facts, including the signs of the self. This laid the foundation for a semiotic psychology as well as for a semiotic anthropology\n      </p>", "Since its inception as a subdiscipline, the anthropology of education literature has been characterized by the volume and richness of descriptive ethnographies. Periodic review papers have commented on the lack of conceptual clarity in the key areas of cultural transmission and acquisition, but the theoretical challenges of such papers have been addressed infrequently. This paper attempts to clearly focus on the conceptual dilemmas that are inherent in the theories most widely adopted in the subdiscipline. By an analysis of the intrapsychic and interpsychic models of cultural transmission that underlie the influential work of Spindler and Gearing, it is shown that there is a mismatch between the culture theory of mainstream contemporary anthropology and the subdiscipline. The continuity of certain forms of instrumentalism in particular is shown to have unfortunate consequences for the anthropology of education insofar as the theoretical nexus between personal identity, culture, and institutionalized meanings is inadequately formulated\n      </p>", "In this review essay, the academic merits of three anthropological blogs (\"Savage Minds,\" \"Zero Anthropology\" [formerly \"Open Anthropology\"], and the official blog of the American Anthropological Association) are considered. The review examines differences between group-blog projects (such \"Savage Minds\"), single-voiced blogs (such as \"Zero Anthropology\"), and official blogs representing central anthropological institutions (the AAA's blog) and identifies roles and strengths of each of these blog forms.\n      </p>", "Ward H. Goodenough's optimistic summary of anthropological knowledge during the 20th century leaves missing links around the inevitable political and processual nature of the discipline. Conflict within the discipline and response to public events also are part of the story. Effects of the Cold War highlight the relations of knowledge and power in anthropological practice. Common humanity remains the focal point of anthropology.\n      </p>", "In this essay, I suggest that American sociocultural anthropology has been a \"color blind\" profession for nearly a half century and that, as a discipline, we need to restore and refine our color perceptions in order to fight the supposedly fixed opposition in American society between \"black\" and \"white\" and deal with the racist consequences of this folk opposition. In the first section, \"How Anthropology Became 'Color Blind,'\" I delineate the circumstances under which anthropology became the \"color blind\" profession. In the second section, \"Teaching Color Blindness,\" I discuss the tendency, in teaching sociocultural anthropology, to ignore racism and its effects. In the final section, \"Restoring Color Vision,\" I take up the questions of what the profession needs to do next to cope with racism and its consequences, emphasizing especially the issue of group identities, how they are formulated, inculcated, and overcome, and proposing a Foucauldian model - following Foucault's lead in analyzing relations of biopower and race - for formulating new ways of responding to and resisting the inevitable recastings of racist ideas.\n      </p>", "As the rational choice model of \"policy\" proliferates in \"policy studies,\" the social sciences, modern governments, organizations, and everyday life, a number of anthropologists are beginning to develop a body of work in the anthropology of public policy that critiques the assumptions of \"policy\" as a legal-rational way of getting things done. While de-masking the framing of public policy questions, an anthropological approach attempts to uncover the constellations of actors, activities, and influences that shape policy decisions, their implementation, and their results. In a rapidly changing world, anthropologists' empirical and ethnographic methods can show how policies actively create new categories of individuals to be governed. They also suggest that the long-established frameworks of \"state\" and \"private,\" \"local\" or \"national\" and \"global,\" \"macro\" and \"macro,\" \"top down\" and \"bottom up,\" and \"centralized\" and \"decentralized\" not only fail to capture current dynamics in the world but actually obfuscate the understanding of many policy processes.\n      </p>", "The contributions of a number of First and Third World scholars to the development of the anthropology of the African diaspora in Latin America and the Caribbean have been elided from the core of the discipline as practiced in North America and Europe. As such, the anthropology of the African diaspora in the Americas can be traced to the paradigmatic debate on the origins of New World black cultures between Euro-American anthropologist Melville J. Herskovits and African American sociologist E. Franklin Frazier. The former argued for the existence of African cultural continuities, the latter for New World culture creations in the context of discrimination and deprivation characteristic of the experiences of peoples of African descent, in light of slavery, colonialism, and postcolonial contexts. As a result, subsequent positions have been defined by oppositions in every subdisciplinary specialization and area of interest. Creolization models try to obviate this bifurcation, and newer dialogical theoretical perspectives build upon such models by attempting to combine revisionist historiography with social/cultural constructionist approaches to identity, especially around the concept of blackness understood in the context of cultural identity politics.\n      </p>", "This article develops an anthropology of the body in its material and social environment among the Cashinahua (Huni Kuin) from Brazilian and Peruvian Amazonia. The Cashinahua body, it shows, is thought of as produced by others, not as growing naturally. Growth can be defined as the corporeal accumulation of knowledge in the form of \"soul.\" The article describes the verbal, medical, and other techniques used to transform it into \"a body that knows.\" In the Cashinahua understanding, a healthy body is one that constantly learns through the senses and expresses the accumulated knowledge in social action and speech. An ill body is one that no longer knows. Curing, therefore, acts to restore a person's capacity to know. The whole article defends the proposition, then, that a prior condition for any medical anthropology in the Cashinahua case is a thorough examination of Cashinahua epistemology. Finally, through comparative discussion of other peoples in lowland South America, it seeks to show that this is also the case more widely in the ethnographic region. Ultimately, it suggests that ethnography in lowland South America undermines the possibility of a \"medical anthropology\" per se.\n      </p>", "This essay comments on the extent to which British social anthropology in the interwar years served the interests of colonial policies. The efforts are directed at a step-by-step analysis of the committments involved in the applied anthropology of S. F. Nadel. Lately his activities among the Nuba have been put in a highly unfavourable light by James C. Faris. Our findings as to Nadel's applied anthropology will be less disquieting. We hope to demonstrate that Nadel's loyalty went to anthropology as an independent discipline, rather than to a field of knowledge which served colonial interests.\n      </p>", "Human health is at growing risk due to the multiple climatic effects of global warming. More importantly, it is becoming evident that individual ecocrises are not independent phenomenon but are entwined with and contribute to the intensification of other environmental predicaments. In light of a range of imagined futures that share a narrative about global warming that posits the existence of global \"winners and losers\" (regions that will benefit from and those that will suffer from global warming), this paper examines two specific cases\u2014Midwestern flooding during the summer of 2008 and the accelerating degradation of the Sacramento Delta. These examples, expressions of convergent ecocrises, here termed pluralea interactions, suggest that going beyond global warming reveals the folly of \"winner and loser\" thinking. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the health impacts of intersecting ecocrises for directions in medical anthropology.\n      </p>", "This article retrieves and articulates key elements in Marcus Garvey's philosophy that point toward a moral anthropology. The author discusses these in the context of ancient and modern concerns for issues of human dignity and human rights and the right and responsibility of the struggle for freedom as a particular African and universal human project. This article is also part of the author's ongoing effort to expand ethical discourse and discussion in Africana studies by critically engaging new subjects and sources of ethical thought beyond the Judeo-Christian tradition, especially the classical African ethics of ancient Egypt (the Maatian tradition) and ancient Yorubaland (the Ifa tradition). Finally, the article is conceived as a way of putting the author's Kawaida philosophy in renewed conversation with Garvey's philosophy, from which it borrows and on which it builds, in search of new links and lessons to expand and enrich the Kawaida philosophical and practical initiative.\n      </p>", "Philippine Negrito groups and Malay and Thai aboriginal black populations are well-documented examples of hunting and collecting societies in the anthropological literature. These groups get considerable emphasis in three Southeast Asian area courses taught in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

Substantial sex differences are found and are interpreted in terms of Maasai culture and social organization. These findings are integrated with a theory of cognitive variability based on notions of markedness.\n      </p>", "In this essay I argue that Tamilnet.com, an Internet news agency put together by a group of Sri Lankan Tamils to address the Tamil diaspora and influence English-speaking elites, subverted international news coverage during Sri Lanka's civil war by making \"ironic\" use of the discursive styles of journalism and anthropology. I also claim that this constituted a particular form of autoethnographic popular anthropology that challenged professional anthropology, and in some ways sought to replace it. In the first two sections of this essay, I dismantle the concept of \"the popular\" by showing that when anthropologists and social theorists use the term they are often referring to connected but distinct aspects of popularity which should be distinguished: Baudrillardian market popularity on the one hand, and Habermasian identity-resistance popularity on the other. I then show how the Internet, given its technology and software, is best seen as market popular in form but identity-resistance popular in content. In the remaining four sections I illustrate, ethnographically, how the creators of Tamilnet.com, while deeply embedded in civil war and a world-wide diaspora, recognized this aspect of the Internet and used it-again, \"ironically\"-to construct a site that advances their own nationalist interests.\n      </p>", "The themes, trends, and significant events of 2008 demonstrate that anthropology has established a new foothold in the public sphere\u2014one that makes the most of novel forms of communication to reach far beyond the ivory tower to disseminate knowledge widely and freely.

This article is an examination of this reorganization of social/cultural anthropology, which has left the center of the discipline intellectually weak relative to the vitality of its diverse interdisciplinary and even nonacademic engagements. It asks whether this post-1980s reorganized social/cultural anthropology might rediscover and reunite with some of its historic core associations (four-field as well as topical) in the new terrains of research and partnerships on the peripheries of its old disciplinary center.\n      </p>", "To understand kuru and solve the problems of its cause and transmission required the integration of knowledge from both anthropological and medical research. Anthropological studies elucidated the origin and spread of kuru, the local mortuary practices of endocannibalism, the social effects of kuru, the life of women and child-rearing practices, the kinship system of the Fore and their willingness to incorporate outsiders into it, the myths, folklore and history of the Fore and their neighbours, sorcery as a powerful social phenomenon and way of explaining the causation of disease, and concepts of the treatment of disease. Many scientists from different disciplines, government officers and others have contributed to this chapter of medical history but it is the Fore people who have contributed the most, through their suffering, their cooperative and reliable witness to kuru, and their participation, in various ways, in the research process itself.\n      </p>", "In this \"In Focus\" introduction, I begin by offering an overview of anthropology's engagements with human rights following the American Anthropological Association's (AAA) 1947 \"Statement on Human Rights.\" After offering a rereading of the Statement, I describe the two major anthropological orientations to human rights that emerged in the 1980s and 1990s, following several decades of relative disengagement. Finally, I locate the articles in relation to this history and indicate how, when taken as a whole, they express a new key or register within which human rights can be studied, critiqued, and advanced through anthropological forms of knowledge. This \"In Focus\" is in part an argument for an essentially ecumenical anthropology of human rights, one that can tolerate, and indeed encourage, approaches that are both fundamentally critical of contemporary human rights regimes and politically or ethically committed to these same regimes.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
