Methods\u2014Comprehensive surveillance of deaths in commercial fishing was established by our office during 1991 and 1992 for Alaska. Demographic data and data on risk factors and incidents were compiled and analysed for trend. Results\u2014During 1991\u20138, there was a significant (p&lt;0.001) decrease in deaths in Alaska related to commercial fishing. Although drownings from fishermen falling overboard and events related to crab fishing vessels (often conducted far offshore and in winter) have continued to occur, marked progress (significant downward trend, p&lt;0.001) has been made in saving the lives of people involved in vessels capsising and sinking. Conclusions\u2014Specific measures tailored to prevent drowning associated with vessels capsising and sinking in Alaska's commercial fishing industry have been successful. However, these events continue to occur, and place fishermen and rescue personnel at substantial risk. Additional strategies must be identified to reduce the frequency of vessels capsising and sinking, to enable parallel improvements in the mortality among crab fishermen, and to prevent fishermen falling overboard and drownings associated with them.\n      </p>", "While economic literature inspired by the \"tragedy of the commons\" has emphasised people's tendency to increase fishing effort beyond desirable levels, sociologists and anthropologists who have studied the social aspects of fishing have often emphasised the capacity of these factors to restrict fishing effort. The article addresses the influence of social norms and communication on fishing effort in an empirical study of the Atlantic blue whiting fishery. The data were generated at a time when this fishery had yet to see efficient quota regulations, and had been subject to a rapid growth in fishing effort, making it the largest fishery in the Atlantic. The article argues that social norms and communication patterns in the fishing fleet create a synergic effect of co-operation and competition on fishing effort. The article questions the view that social norms and communication necessarily represent a solution to the tragedy of the commons.\n      </p>", "A fishing cat (Felis viverrina) died overnight, within 12 hr of peracute onset of depression, slight tremors, pallor, and icterus. Necropsy showed widespread hemorrhage and hematomata in the heart, stomach, and kidneys. The lungs were hyperemic and edematous. The liver was swollen and yellowish green. The spleen was very large and hyperemic. Histologic changes consisted of pneumonia, hepatic necrosis, and renal hemorrhage with glomerular fibrin clots. Chlamydia antigen was detected in liver and kidney using a direct immunofluorescence assay, and Chlamydia were cultured.\n      </p>", "Information is presented on fishing effort, efficiency, techniques, and catch composition for Pum\u00e9 men, women, and children along with a conceptual model of fishing as a food procurement strategy. The Pum\u00e9 are a native lowland South American group living in the topical savanna region of southwestern Venezuela characterized by seasonal flooding. Results are discussed in relation to the Pum\u00e9 environmental and social situation, and briefly compared with results from other lowland South American groups.\n      </p>", "Two fishing castes, Ambiga and Harikantra, of Karnataka employ different techniques for throwing cast nets in the same habitat. Ambigas throw the net from above the head, as opposed to the far easier Harikantra method of throwing at the waist level. These different techniques are described here as memes, transmitted through learning. A logico-deductive hypothesis is developed here to explain the origin and maintenance of the memetic difference between the castes, with the help of circumstantial semiotic and anthropological evidence.\n      </p>", "Throughout the world \"fishing the line\" is a frequent harvesting tactic in communities where no-take marine reserves are designated. This practice of concentrating fishing effort at the boundary of a marine reserve is predicated upon the principle of spillover, the net export of stock from the marine reserve to the surrounding unprotected waters. We explore the consequences and optimality of fishing the line using a spatially explicit theoretical model. We show that fishing the line: (1) is part of the optimal effort distribution near no-take marine reserves with mobile species regardless of the cooperation level among harvesters; (2) has a significant impact on the spatial patterns of catch per unit effort (CPUE) and fish density both within and outside of the reserve; and (3) can enhance total population size and catch simultaneously under a limited set of conditions for overexploited populations. Additionally, we explore the consequences of basing the spatial distribution of fishing effort for a multispecies fishery upon the optimality of the most mobile species that exhibits the greatest spillover. Our results show that the intensity of effort allocated to fishing the line should instead be based upon more intermediate rates of mobility within the targeted community. We conclude with a comparison between model predictions and empirical findings from a density gradient study of two important game fish in the vicinity of a no-take marine-life refuge on Santa Catalina Island, California (USA). These results reveal the need for empirical studies to account for harvester behavior and suggest that the implications of spatial discontinuities such as fishing the line should be incorporated into marine-reserve design.\n      </p>", "The community of Gamboa is located on Itacuru\u00e7\u00e1 Island, Sepetiba Bay (State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) and includes 26 families, mostly of artisanal fishermen who use paddled or motor canoes, and encircling nets for fishing. In this study, predictions from optimal foraging theory (patch model), in particular of patch residence time, are compared to the observed behavior of fishermen on fishing trips. Fishermen's strategies differ depending on their intended prey. They spend more time in patches and use fewer patches for shrimp than for fish. Gamboa's fishermen tend to leave a patch later than predicted by the model. The difficulty in evaluating stock availability, the comparatively few patches available for shrimp, and the competitive aspects of fishing contribute to the explanation of this behavior.\n      </p>", "Epidemiological studies on occupational injuries describe the incidence ratios related to the main strata in the industries, while the injury incidence ratios for the specific work processes within the work places have not yet been studied. The aim was to estimate the injury rate-ratios for the main work processes in commercial fishing. A case-referent design with samples of person-time was used. The reported injuries to the National Maritime Authorities for a 5-year period for four types of commercial fishing defined the cases. The odds for the referents were calculated from samples of person-times for the specific working processes. Odds Ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated for the specific working processes. A total of 560 cases were included and the samples of referent working periods were 63110 min in total. The largest part of the injuries (n = 318 injuries) 56.8% were related to three main working processes 5-7 (WP 5-7): preparing, shooting and hauling of the fishing gear and nets. The OR's for the specific working processes varied highly. The OR for WP 5-7 in total was 2.4 (2.10-2.77) with variations from of the OR s from 1.10 to 3.5 in different types of fishing. The OR's for traffic on board was 15.3 (12.0-19.4). The variations in the odds ratios indicate that the fishermen continuously shift between low and high-risk areas pointing out areas for prevention. The case-referent design with samples of person-time is useful for other areas of prevention.\n      </p>"], "words": {"and": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "work": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "karnataka": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "habitat": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "is": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "within": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "community": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "catch": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "economic": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "fishing": {"number": 3, "prob": 2.4843794641193497e-05}, "have": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "in": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "throughout": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "injuries": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "techniques": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "information": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "different": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "epidemiological": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "for": {"number": 3, "prob": 2.4843794641193497e-05}, "located": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "not": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "objectives": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "two": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "been": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "yet": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "to": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "occupational": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "main": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "composition": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "describe": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "incidence": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "related": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "ratios": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "same": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "techniques,": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "world": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "industries,": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "by": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "a": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "on": {"number": 3, "prob": 2.4843794641193497e-05}, "processes": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "injury": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "places": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "presented": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "of": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "inspired": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "studied": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "cat": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "employ": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "while": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "literature": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "efficiency,": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "specific": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "the": {"number": 10, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-05}, "studies": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}}}
