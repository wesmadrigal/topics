{"total_words": 822, "documents": ["This paper explores definitions of luxury foods and considers the role of luxuries in marking social distinction. It is proposed that luxury foods are those foods that offer a refinement in texture, taste, fat content or other quality (such as stimulant or inebriant) and offer distinction, because of either their quantity or quality. Ethnographic research has revealed that an emphasis on quantity of food and elaboration of common staples is found mostly in societies without strong social stratification, while an emphasis on quality and style is characteristic of societies with institutionalized forms of social ranking. In the former context the consumption of luxury foods is used primarily to create or enhance social bonds, in the latter to create or enhance exclusivity and distance. The archaeological recognition of luxury foods is reviewed to demonstrate how archaeology is well placed to add regional breadth and chronological depth to the study of the changing role and meaning of luxury foods.\n      </p>", "The discussion of luxury food in medieval Islamic societies is based on data drawn from culinary and dietetic texts produced during the period from the tenth to fourteenth centuries. The sources reflect more specifically the food concerns of an urban leisure class rather than those of the ruler's court circles. Characteristics of the urban high cuisine are described as well as the parallel interest in other forms of nourishment, such as 'home remedies' described in both types of source material and reflecting the relatively self-contained nature of the urban bourgeois household.\n      </p>", "As they settled the islands of the eastern Pacific, Polynesians encountered declining biodiversity. This was counteracted by the transfer of tropical crops and a few domestic animals. But on small isolated islands, or islands beyond the tropics, not all domesticates survived. Despite these losses and sometimes poor resources, Polynesians maintained strong traditions of hospitality and status display through feasting. On well-endowed high islands, flesh foods ranked highly, while cultigens gained in status on poorer islands. Like European luxury foods, Polynesian feast items might be rare, from a remote source, reserved for the elite or presented in elaborate forms. But, unlike most luxuries, they could also be a staple food elevated in status through labour-intensive processing, the diversity of forms in which it was served or through sheer abundance of display. As well, many prestige foods were proscribed to women on religious grounds. Polynesian feast foods were, therefore, much more than luxuries in a Western sense.\n      </p>", "This research demonstrates that consumers' desire for counterfeit luxury brands hinges on the social motivations (i.e., to express themselves and/or to fit in) underlying their luxury brand preferences. In particular, the authors show that both consumers' preferences for a counterfeit brand and the subsequent negative change in their preferences for the real brand are greater when their luxury brand attitudes serve a social-adjustive rather than a value-expressive function. In addition, consumers' moral beliefs about counterfeit consumption affect their counterfeit brand preferences only when their luxury brand attitudes serve a value-expressive function. Finally, the authors demonstrate that the social functions served by consumers' luxury brand attitudes can be influenced by elements of the marketing mix (e.g., product design, advertising), thus enabling marketers to curb the demand for counterfeit brands through specific marketing-mix actions.\n      </p>", "Accumulation of P above levels that promote growth, a common plant response called \"luxury consumption\", can be considered as a form of reserve to support future growth when the nutrient can subsequently be mobilized. However, the effect of P reserves on regrowth following defoliation has not been demonstrated. We tested the hypothesis that P luxury consumption increases plant tolerance to defoliation. We performed two experiments with four grass species from a continuously grazed temperate grassland in the Flooding Pampa (Argentina). The first experiment, aimed at generating P luxury consumption by fertilization, resulted in one species (Sporobolus indicu\u0153) showing luxury consumption. In this way, we were able to obtain plants of S. indicus with similar biomass but contrasting amounts of P reserves. The second experiment evaluated the subsequent regrowth following defoliation on a P-free medium of these plants differing in P reserves. Regrowth was larger for plants that had shown P luxury consumption during a previous period than for plants with lower levels of P reserves. During regrowth these plants showed a clear pattern of P remobilization from the stubble, crown, and root compartments to the regrowing tissue, in addition to a likely reutilization of P present in leaf-growth zones. This work is the first showing that high levels of P reserves can confer tolerance to defoliation by promoting compensatory growth under P deficiency.\n      </p>", "This paper evaluates the equity premium using novel data on the consumption of luxury goods. Specifying utility as a nonhomothetic function of both luxury and basic consumption goods, we derive pricing equations and evaluate the risk of holding equity. Household survey and national accounts data mostly reflect basic consumption, and therefore overstate the risk aversion necessary to match the observed equity premium. The risk aversion implied by the consumption of luxury goods is more than an order of magnitude less than that implied by national accounts data. For the very rich, the equity premium is much less of a puzzle.\n      </p>", "Archaeobotanical investigations show that during the Roman occupation a large number of foods was introduced into Central Europe, though these did not replace any of the traditional foods. Many of these new additions were incorporated into the local food-producing system and became part of the local menu, offering a wider variety of foods and tastes than before. While they represented luxuries at the very start of the Roman occupation, they lost this status later on. Other foods, however, could not be grown locally, or only with considerable effort, and these remained true luxuries. They comprise rice, chickpea, gourd, black pepper, pistachio, almond, pine kernel, date, pomegranate, olive, melon and, to some extent, peach. Remarkably, figs were quite common.\n      </p>", "The patterns of luxury uptake and storage of nitrogen were studied in the rhizomatous alpine herb, Bistorta bistortoides (Pursh.). Nitrogen pools in the rhizome and shoot were measured in fertilized and nonfertilized plants over two growing seasons (3-4 growing seasons after fertilization began). Fertilized plants stored more N in the rhizome throughout both seasons than did nonfertilized plants. Inflorescence, foliar, and preformed bud N concentrations and biomass production rate did not increase in response to fertilization. The increased storage of N without a concomitant influence on biomass production demonstrates that luxury uptake occurs in this species. Increased N storage in fertilized plants was accomodated byan increase in the amino acids arginine, the nonprotein amino acid, \u03b4-acetylornithine, glutamine, and glutamate. Luxury uptake was accommodated entirely through filling of existing rhizome cells; no increased cell proliferation was found. Sucrose concentration was significantly lower in the recently produced rhizome tissue of fertilized plants, possibly reflecting the carbon costs of storing the additional N. During the first half of the season, fertilized plants relied more on stored N to drive growth, with translocation from reserves accounting for 56% and 100% of the aboveground N requirement in nonfertilized plants, respectively. In fertilized plants, the complete reliance on stored N indicates a decrease in current-season uptake of N during the period normally associated with net N uptake in this species. This is interpreted as either (1) a seasonal shift in N uptake, or (2) a negative feedback between stored N and uptake that would constrain the continued accumulation of excess N and eliminate any long-term benefits of luxury N uptake in this species.\n      </p>", "This article offers an interpretation of luxury consumption in the seventeenth-century Dutch Republic. The traditional concept of luxury emphasized its moral and social dangers. This remained influential in the Dutch Republic, but economic development brought with it new forms of consumption: a \"New Luxury\" emerged to stand beside the traditional \"Old Luxury.\" Practice changed in advance of theory, and a new, more positive, understanding of the role of luxury consumption emerged only later. The article closes by considering the limits to the Dutch development of a consumer society, and to the special role played by the city of Utrecht in this development.\n      </p>", "The authors present certain characteristics shared by luxury and art products that have given rise to a renewal of approaches in consumer behaviour.

A quasi-luxury is defined as a good whose marginal rate of substitution is increasing in a utility index. Under certain conditions, it is indeed a luxury good. When current wealth holding falls short of (exceeds) long-run needs, luxury consumption is postponed more (less) easily than necessity consumption, due to a lower (higher) time preference for luxury and/or a higher intertemporal elasticity of substitution thereof. Preferences for quasi-luxuries lead to a higher steady-state value of wealth or capital.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

In particular, it explores whether there is a significant difference between consumers' propensity to consider ethics in luxury versus commodity purchase and whether consumers are ready to purchase ethical-luxury. Prior research in ethical consumption focuses on low value, commoditized product categories such as food, cosmetics and high street apparel. It is debatable if consumers follow similar ethical consumption patterns in luxury purchases. Findings indicate that consumers' propensity to consider ethics is significantly lower in luxury purchases when compared to commoditized purchases and explores some of the potential reasons for this reduced propensity to identify or act upon ethical issues in luxury consumption.\n      </p>", "The recovery of botanical remains from the late fourteenth-century BCE Uluburun shipwreck near Ka\u0219, Turkey, provides a unique opportunity to examine the consumable components of an eliteoriented cargo, which included numerous pomegranate seeds, skin fragments and flower parts. Examination of pomegranate-shaped objects and botanical remains permits investigation of the establishment and development of the pomegranate as part of the 'package' of elite and luxury items exchanged by Bronze Age eastern Mediterranean cultures.\n      </p>", "Several environmental factors influence the distribution of plants in coastal salt marshes. Substrate salinity is among the major factors preventing several species from establishing near the water line. However, interspecific competition for light and nutrients is often significant in determining the upper limit of plants along the salt marsh gradient. In this study, we tested the effects of substrate salinity and light and nutrient availability on the performance of the annual Aster laurentianus (Asteraceae), an endangered species of eastern Canadian salt marshes. This species is typically found in a narrow band along the shores of shallow lagoons, cornered between the high water line and the dense, herbaceous community of the upper marsh. Low light availability was the most significant factor limiting plant performance. Salinity had little effect on A. laurentianus as, unexpectedly, did nutrient availability. Yet plants were able to absorb nutrients when these were made more available. Luxury consumption, the uptake of excess nutrients, may make sense for this annual plant because the habitat in which it grows is subject to frequent disturbances (e.g., sand accretion and salinity pulses) that may kill canopy species and release suppressed A. laurentianus individuals. These results suggest that interspecific competition for light may play a significant role in restraining A. laurentianus from the upper part of salt marshes. Luxury consumption may help the species to opportunistically take advantage of release from taller species, particularly towards the upper edge of the salt marsh gradient.\n      </p>", "This paper analyses child labour participation and its key determinants using data sets from Peru and Pakistan. The results include tests of the 'Luxury' and 'Substitution' hypotheses that play key roles in recent studies on child labour and child schooling. The results reject both hypotheses in the context of child labour in Pakistan and suggest that income and related variables do not have the expected negative effect on children's work input. Rising wages of adult female labour in Pakistan, and falling adult male wage in Peru lead to increased participation of children in the labour market. The results on the combined country data formally establish the presence of strong individual country effects in the estimated regressions. For example, ceteris paribus, a Peruvian child is more likely to experience schooling than a Pakistani child. However, both countries agree on the positive role that adult female education and infrastructure investment in basic amenities can play in discouraging child labour and encouraging child schooling.\n      </p>", "Reference groups influence product and brand evaluations, especially when the product is a publicly consumed luxury good. Marketers of such luxury goods need to carefully balance two important social forces: (1) the desire of leaders to distinguish themselves from followers and (2) the countervailing desire of followers to assimilate with leaders. In this paper, we examine the theoretical implications of these social forces for firm prices, product design, and target consumer selection. We show that the presence of reference group effects can motivate firms to add costly features, which provide limited or no functional benefit to consumers. Furthermore, reference group effects can induce product proliferation on one hand and motivate firms to offer limited editions on the other hand. We find that offering a limited edition can increase sales and profits. In some cases, reference group effects can even lead to a buying frenzy.\n      </p>", "While luxury brands are one of the most profitable and fastest growing segments of the brand pantheon, they are the least understood. There is no established definition as to what a luxury brand is; no clear understanding of the value dimensionality of luxury brands; and no rigorous conceptualization of the different types of luxury brands. They are generally treated as homogenous. Little wonder that the management of these brands is shrouded in mystery. This article explores the value dimensionality of luxury brands, differentiates among luxury brands, and proposes a typology to help firms understand the managerial implications and challenges of each type. All luxury brands are not the same\u2014they can mean different things to different people or even different things to the same people, which makes target marketing of luxury brands both difficult and important. This also means that they react differently to each other both in times of economic prosperity and in downturns. This article also explores strategies for migrating mass-market brands into luxury brand markets.\n      </p>", "The statement, by the eighteenth-century economist Adam Smith, that luxuries are all things that are not necessities is too simplistic an approach to be useful within the context of zooarchaeology. To start with, all animal products could be regarded as unnecessary within the human diet. Therefore, a four-part subdivision is proposed, distinguishing between foodstuffs that fulfil basic physiological needs, those that fulfil imagined needs, those that render a diet affluent and, finally, luxury foods. Optimal foraging theory further develops this subdivision by also taking into account the costs involved in obtaining the ingredients. The distinction between the affluent and the luxurious diet in particular allows us to define criteria through which luxury foods can be recognized within a zooarchaeological assemblage. At the same time, however, the constraints of such an exercise become apparent. This theoretical approach is illustrated by case studies from Roman to post-medieval Europe.\n      </p>", "A series of experiments were performed to determine the mechanism of luxury uptake of phosphate by activated sludge. Solubility calculations and calcium ion analyses indicated that removal does not occur by chemical precipitation. Poisoning experiments using 2,4-dinitrophenol, biomass extraction experiments, and experiments using radioactive tracers with cation supplements indicated that the phosphate removal occurred by a biological mechanism causing the phosphate to be transported across the cell membrane. The mechanism seemed to involve active transport because the biomass was able to concentrate phosphate in the cell. Certain monovalent cations seemed to control the transport. Carbon and phosphorus seemed to be transported independently.\n      </p>", "In the 1880s the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm was developed with opulent apartments for Berlin's Grossb\u00fcrgertum, or haute bourgeoisie. It was designed to be the counterpart to the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. Luxury Apartments with a Tenement Heart: The Kurf\u00fcrstendamm and the Berliner Zimmer analyses the plans of these apartments, whose dining rooms\u2014called Berliner Zimmer\u2014retained a planning peculiarity from Berlin's infamous tenements, or Mietskaserne. Through careful comparison, Douglas Mark Klahr shows that the Berliner Zimmer interrupted the circulation pattern for visitors and residents in a manner and to a degree not seen in comparable Parisian residences of the same period. Although building ordinances and economics shaped important aspects of Berlin's domestic architecture, this humble plan feature endured in the architecture of the wealthy because of the rootedness of Grossb\u00fcrgertum identity in the values and architecture of the lower middle and working classes.\n      </p>", "In this research, the authors investigate the phenomenon of \"art infusion,\" in which the presence of visual art has a favorable influence on the evaluation of consumer products through a content-independent spillover of luxury perceptions. In three studies, the authors demonstrate the art infusion phenomenon in both real-world and controlled environments using a variety of stimuli in the contexts of packaging, advertising, and product design.\n      </p>", "Since the rise of players' unions helped equalize the bargaining power between players and team owners in professional sports, sports leagues have struggled to find economic regulatory systems that satisfy both sides. Many mechanisms have been employed; the most recent such device is the \"luxury tax.\" Current versions of the luxury tax-utilized by Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association (NBA)-require that teams with aggregate player salary expenditures above a specified level are assessed a tax. This Note focuses primarily on the robust taxation system employed by the NBA because it is likely to be used as a viable model for other leagues. When examining the NBA taxation model, however, it becomes apparent that it has serious imperfections and, in fact, works against its stated goals. This Note uncovers the various consequences of the NBA luxury tax and offers some solutions to its structural flaws.\n      </p>", "The effect of luxury uptake of orthophosphate on the sensitivity of algal growth bioassays was determined. Short-term bioassays consisted of gravimetrically determined harvested dry weights; long-term bioassays consisted of manometrically determined photosynthetic rates. Phosphorus metabolism was studied by measurement of stored phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase activity, and phosphate concentration in the nutrient medium. Anabaena flos-aquae, Microcystic aeruginosa, and Selenatrum capricornutum exhibited luxury uptake of phosphorus. However, M. aeruginosa and S. capricornutum did not exhibit alkaline phosphatase activity. It was concluded that short-term bioassays are less sensitive to phosphorus concentration than long-term bioassays. The influence of luxury uptake is a function of the phosphorus concentration in the original growth medium and of the length of the starvation period.\n      </p>", "For the last twenty years, the perception of hedonic attributes has been a problematic matter in consumer research. We argue that the perception of a hedonic product attribute should not be considered as an irreducible holistic experience, but rather as a complex set of sensory experiences, the components of which are identifiable and quantifiable. We provide evidence for this position by proposing a reliable method Unking the features of productrelated sound stimuli to consumer perception of hedonic attributes. To our knowledge, this study is the first of its kind offering a detailed investigation of consumer perception of everyday sounds (as opposed to music).

In some competition models, however, competitive interactions may result in nonequilibrium dynamics, allowing the coexistence of many species on few resources. The relevance of these findings is still unclear, since some assumptions of the underlying models are unrealistic. Most importantly, these models assume that individual growth directly reflects the availability of external resources, whereas real organisms can store resources, thereby decoupling their growth from external fluctuations. Here we study the effects of resource storage by extending the well-known Droop model to the context of multiple species and multiple resources. We demonstrate that the extended Droop model shows virtually the same complex dynamics as models without storage. Depending on the model parameters, one may obtain competitive exclusion, stable equilibrium coexistence, periodic and non-periodic oscillations, and chaos. Again, nonequilibrium dynamics allows for the coexistence of many species on few resources. We discuss our findings in the light of earlier work on resource competition, highlighting the role of luxury consumption, trade-offs in competitive abilities, and ecological stoichiometry.\n      </p>", "Luxury would appear to be both difficult to define and difficult to identify archaeologically.

We propose that luxury products also have important signaling functions in relationships. Whereas men use conspicuous luxury products to attract mates, women use such products to deter female rivals. Drawing on both evolutionary and cultural perspectives, five experiments investigated how women\u2019s luxury products function as a signaling system directed at other women who pose threats to their romantic relationships. Findings showed that activating a motive to guard one\u2019s mate triggered women to seek and display lavish possessions. Additional studies revealed that women use pricey possessions to signal that their romantic partner is especially devoted to them. In turn, flaunting designer handbags and shoes was effective at deterring other women from poaching a relationship partner. This research identifies a novel function of conspicuous consumption, revealing that luxury products and brands play important roles in relationships.\n      </p>", "Through the issue of luxury, this article explores the contemporary response to the development of consumer culture in Wilhelmine Germany. Luxury was particularly the concern of the German middle class. The article argues that while the bourgeoisie endorsed the \"modernity\" represented by new wealth and consumer behaviour, it was also deeply ambivalent about the consequences of industrial society. Giving vivid expression to this ambivalence, the Wilhelmine \"discouse on luxury\" reveals how the middle-class sought to discipline its own desires and those of all people touched by its success, thereby attempting to contain the threat of disorder posed by the new consumer culture.\n      </p>", "There are important reasons for considering the first domesticated plants and animals as luxury foods primarily used in feasting. Using Southeast Asian tribal society as a case study, it is demon-strated that all the domesticated animals and the most important of the domesticated plants constitute forms of wealth that are primarily or exclusively used in feasting contexts. In addition, numerous studies have demonstrated that feasting generates powerful forces that intensify and increase resource production of luxury foods as well as staples. Such forces ultimately can lead to the domestication of wild species and the transformation of luxury foods into staple foods.\n      </p>", "This article proposes an international segmentation of consumers based on their attitudes toward luxury. We perform a two-stage empirical study with a data set that combines samples from 20 countries. We provide a substantive interpretation of the results to show that three attitude segments dominate in a Western cultural context. We discuss several directions for future research based on the findings.\n      </p>", "           ", "This study examined the growth responses of exotic annuals and native shrubs to elevated N levels to test the hypothesis that increased N availability favors nitrophilous annuals over the slower-growing shrubs. The vegetation structure of the coastal sage scrub ecosystems in southern California is shifting from shrubland to annual grasslands. Over the last 30 years large tracts of wildlands, particularly those adjacent to urban centers, have lost significant native shrub cover, which has been replaced by exotic annuals native to the Mediterranean Basin. During this same time, air pollution has led to increased terrestrial eutrophication by atmospheric deposition. Changes in vegetation are often the result of changes in resource availability. The results of our experiments showed the three native shrubs tested to be more nitrophilous than the three annuals tested, which contrasts with most models of perennial species' adaptation to stressful environments. Under greenhouse conditions the annual grasses exhibited yield depression at the highest N treatments of 80 $\\mu \\text{g}\\text{g}^{-1}$ in soil. The three shrub species evaluated continued to increase shoot biomass at 80 $\\mu \\text{g}\\text{g}^{-1}$ N in soil. The grasses also exhibited increased tissue N concentrations with increased soil N in contrast with the shrubs where there was little difference in tissue N concentrations with increasing availability. Although the differential yield responses to elevated N do not explain the success of the annual vegetation in replacing shrubs, the inability of the shrubs to regulate growth under elevated N levels may explain the poor survival of mature individuals.\n      </p>", "Mary Robinson's poetical and prose output conjures up a variety of images of commercialized and culturally thriving urban settings, among which emerge those of London and her native Bristol. These representations are particularly significant in the context of contemporary depictions of the author as the figurehead of a culture dominated by spectacle, commerce, and luxury. Returning to this intersection of consumption and identity, rich both in personal intimations and public resonance, this essay recovers and assesses the relevance of luxury in Robinson's acts of discursive self-presentation and self-construction, particularly her \"Memoirs\" (1801). In this fashion, it seeks to highlight how Robinson rescues luxury from hostile images of herself to harness it to a revisionary narrative of identity grounded in the opulent lifestyle of her Bristol childhood.\n      </p>", "Simone Martini developed two elaborate layering techniques--sgraffito and glazing over metal leaf--to represent contemporary luxury textiles imported from the East. In this article, painted textiles in his Annunciation and St. Louis Altarpiece are compared with surviving late medieval Mongolian and Middle-Eastern silks to demonstrate how closely Simone imitated originals. Attention is drawn to the way Simone transformed traditional painting techniques in order to simulate the patterns and textures of exotic silks more accurately. Simone's interest in luxury textiles is also set within the context of the great value placed on these fabrics by fourteenth-century Italian society, and it is within this societal framework that Simone's representation of textiles in his altarpieces is finally evaluated.\n      </p>", "", "", "", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The conventional wisdom is that it affects branded goods negatively. In this paper, however, we suggest that counterfeiting may actually benefit certain luxury brands. By means of two studies, we show how the market presence of luxury counterfeit items can increase consumers' willingness to pay for original brands. In Study 1, we show that the presence of luxury counterfeits can increase consumers' willingness to pay for well-known original brands, but not for lesser-known ones. Brand awareness plays a moderating role in the positive relationship between counterfeiting and willingness to pay (WTP). In Study 2, we address the psychological mechanisms that explain this increased willingness to pay. The results show that consumers' (a) pleasure at being envied, (b) pleasure in distinguishing themselves, and (c) perception of the quality of the original goods fully mediate the relation between the presence of counterfeit in the market and consumers' WTP for originals. We subsequently discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of the two study results.\n      </p>", "This article argues for a reconsideration of the relationship between economic transforming during the final decades of the Old Regime and the origins of the French Revolution. Changes in consumption during the eighteenth century, compounded by a sensationalist philosophy that problematized issues of representation, destabilized the practice of using pomp to constitute social status. The ensuing crisis transformed the category luxury. Long used to denounce the usurping consumption of the lowborn, the term came to be employed in the decades after 1750 to denounce all uses of pomp to constitute political authority and social rank. While the older language of luxury defended a traditional conception of the social order, the luxury critique that developed in the second half of the eighteenth century articulated a radically different vision of society and directed a corrosive attack at the \"aristocratic\" social order of the Old Regime. This new social critique became a staple of radical discourse in the 1780s.\n      </p>", "This essay argues that Ernst Kirchner's street scenes from 1913-14 participated in a discourse about luxury and immorality, implicating art, advertising, and fashion and focusing on the display window that arose in Berlin at the time. Political conservatives attempted to pass laws they claimed would protect youth and check immorality. The debate called attention both to a new relationship between sexuality and public space that was developing in the city and to art's transformation through new commercial practices. Issues of censorship contributed to the imaginary in Kirchner's street scenes and the identification drawn between himself, the prostitute, and the metropolis.\n      </p>", "With recourse to two main sources, trading almanacs and ledgers, this article is intended to establish the crucial role played by eighteenth-century Parisian shopkeepers in accelerating new modes of consuming. The uniqueness of Paris as a market rested on the strong influence of the court. Craftsmen and shopkeepers knowingly exploited the rule of distinction borne by their clients and invented novelties and launched fashions capable of enticing them. Their advertising thus focused on a multi-faceted notion of quality: quality as it related to the shopkeeper, to the consumer, to the shop and to the products. Always on the lookout for novelty, aristocrats were the great suppliers of quality goods. Invariably short of cash, they used such goods as a means of payment to tradesmen, who stood at the centre of a triple market, made up of new and second-hand goods and those sold on credit. High quality and imitation, new and old: shopkeepers used a wide qualitative vocabulary to attract customers. This is how the semi-luxury market developed also among the less affluent. Thus, apparently archaic practices such as barter were in fact used to promote a new market, a semi-luxury market, and are essential to understanding the eighteenth-century consumer explosion.\n      </p>", "Pirenne held that the wool textiles exports from Flanders and north-west France during the thirteenth century were \"luxury products\", which, although recently questioned, remains the standard view. This article tests the standard view in two basic ways. Firstly, it examines the structure of the trade in terms of prices, bringing together for the first time evidence dispersed in often obscure publications in a variety of languages. Secondly, it examines the technique of manufacture on the basis of guild regulations. The outcome is to show that there was a very wide range of prices, corresponding to variations in technique and quality of raw wool; and that the standard view is seriously misleading.\n      </p>", "In 1806 Bernardin de Saint-Pierre published what is now called the 'luxury' edition of his novel \"Paul et Virginie.\" In 2005 Sotheby's in Paris auctioned a series of letters sent by Bernardin to the painter Girodet. These letters, studied here for the first time, offer a fascinating insight into the way that a major novelist planned and discussed the illustrations for his text. A rich picture of the author emerges: a writer who was well briefed in the process of producing engravings from paintings and was far more aware of the contemporary artistic scene than we have hitherto imagined.\n      </p>", "Four common fallow tree species were tested for a response to nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization. Seedlings or cuttings of Melicope glabra (Rutaceae), Macaranga gigantea (Euphobiaceae), Persea romosa (Laureaceae), Peronema canescens (Verbenaceae) were grown in pots of a 50:50 mix of native soil and sand under 18% full sun for 18 weeks. Every 2 weeks, plants received either added N, added P, added N+P, or no added nutrients (control). Persea, a shade-tolerant species, and Macaranga, a light-demanding pioneer, improved relative growth rate with the addition of both N and P. Neither responded to N or P alone. Peronema and Melicope demonstrated luxury consumption of both N and P but did not show enhanced growth. Two of the four species tested (Persea and Melicope) were more limited by P than N. Macaranga was equally limited by both and Peronema was more limited by N. Along with previous studies, evidence for positive growth response and luxury consumption among light-demanding species suggests that P, rather than N, should limit seedling performance and may ultimately influence tree diversity in young secondary tropical forests.\n      </p>", "N is often cited as a limiting factor for sapling growth in northeastern USA forests. However, under conditions of elevated soil N, seedlings and saplings of some tree species exhibit luxury consumption of N, leading to elevated tissue N concentration. While this pool of plant N may have benefits for saplings if light levels change, it may also increase the risk of herbivory by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus L.). We conducted a field fertilization experiment to test the hypothesis that saplings increase stem tissue N when soil N availability is elevated. We fertilized saplings of nine tree species under closed and open canopies. Two of the nine species, yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis) and black cherry (Prunus serotina), had significant increases in radial growth when fertilized under high light. Six of the nine species showed increased stem N concentration under either low light or high light conditions. Under low light conditions, black cherry and sugar maple (Acer saccharum) had significantly higher concentrations of stem N when fertilized. Regardless of fertilization treatment, yellow birch had significantly greater stem N in saplings under low light conditions when compared with saplings found in high light conditions. Under high light conditions, fertilization resulted in increased stem N in saplings of white ash (Fraxinus americana) and eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis). There was a trend for saplings of red maple (Acer rubrum) and white ash to show elevated stem N concentration when fertilized under low light. Red oak (Quercus rubra), American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and white pine (Pinus strobus) did not show any evidence of luxury consumption. We compared browse frequency of fertilized and unfertilized saplings within similar forest types. Browse frequency was consistently higher on fertilized saplings. When averaged across all species, however, the difference between treatments was not significant. In contrast, we found significantly higher browse rates for fertilized saplings that had been previously identified as luxury N consumers. Our results indicate that increased soil N availability has positive effects on at least some of the species under high light, but, has potentially negative indirect effects on a larger group of species under both high and low light due to a higher risk of herbivory.\n      </p>", "The understandable tendency of curators and private collectors to classify their collections in national terms can understate the international context within which many types of luxury goods were manufactured and traded in the eighteenth century. This is particularly true for low-volume, high-value goods such as jewellery and watches, which could be readily transported over long distances. The extensive international trade in both finished articles and component parts, combined with the easy transmission of designs, meant that, even for interested contemporaries, the attribution of specific national origins to such objects could be problematic. This international trade was facilitated by a surprising mobility among both merchants and craftsmen. The role that such economic migration could play in the diffusion of objects, designs and techniques across eighteenth-century Europe is illustrated by examining some of the international networks established by merchants and craftsmen from the watch- and jewellery-making centres of Geneva and other parts of western Switzerland.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The paper tests the luxury good hypothesis (namely that income elasticity exceeds 1) by using meta-regression analysis, taking into consideration publication selection and aggregation bias. The findings suggest that publication bias exists, which is a result that is robust to the meta-regression model employed. Publication selection and aggregation bias also appear to play a role in the generation of estimates. The corrected estimates of income elasticity range from 0.4 to 0.8, which cast serious doubt on the validity of the luxury good hypothesis.\n      </p>", "The chemical content of living algal food is an important determinant of zooplankton herbivore fitness. Previous studies have restricted diets to a single food type presented over multiple body mass turnover times; these have established that phosphorus content is one factor closely associated with growth of some zooplankton. In nature, however, algal P content and other potentially important dimensions to food quality vary in space and time. It would be unlikely for a grazing animal to experience a single constant food type over a major portion of its life. Many grazers likely experience diel variation in food quality associated with their vertical migration through nutritional gradients. It is not known how long-term growth under fluctuating food relates to growth rates expected for single, constant food types. We tested whether grazers could integrate over daily variation in their food and thus realize body growth rates higher than would be expected from growth determined on single constant food types alone. We found that Daphnia magna grow near maximal rates when exposed to high-quality food for half or less of the day. These results suggest that nutritional gradients associated with vertical migration bear close examination. They also strongly suggest that some form of diel P storage in zooplankton, a form of luxury consumption, occurs, and allows for integration over temporal variation in supply of this essential dietary ingredient.\n      </p>", "This research introduces \"brand prominence,\" a construct reflecting the conspicuousness of a brand's mark or logo on a product. The authors propose a taxonomy that assigns consumers to one of four groups according to their wealth and need for status, and they demonstrate how each group's preference for conspicuously or inconspicuously branded luxury goods corresponds predictably with their desire to associate or dissociate with members of their own and other groups. Wealthy consumers low in need for status want to associate with their own kind and pay a premium for quiet goods only they can recognize. Wealthy consumers high in need for status use loud luxury goods to signal to the less affluent that they are not one of them. Those who are high in need for status but cannot afford true luxury use loud counterfeits to emulate those they recognize to be wealthy. Field experiments along with analysis of market data (including counterfeits) support the proposed model of status signaling using brand prominence.\n      </p>", "The production of perfumery articles became an industry in the nineteenth century, and their broader social diffusion invites questions about the accuracy of perfume's identification at that time as a luxury product. The innovations generated or adopted by perfumers, whether they involved new extraction methods or the use of synthetic compounds, not only introduced new creative possibilities but also allowed wider margins on sales. The shift from artisanal fabrication to industrial manufacturing accompanied relatively steep increases in the price of perfumes. Nineteenth-century perfumers developed marketing strategies to build the value of their products and to position them as luxury goods.\n      </p>", "Through an analysis of the suppliers of the luxury goods used in royal coronations and funerals, Ian Archer seeks to establish in this article an important aspect of the interconnections between City and Court in early modern London.

A maximum phosphorus removal rate of 0.026 lb of phosphorus removed/lb of COD removed was obtained. High influent phosphorus concentrations reruced the plant's probable performance to less than 50 percent phosphorus removal at optimum conditions. Phosphorus removal apparently occurs through a combination of metabolic and physical-chemical mechanisms. The specialized plant design has caused several operating problems, and capital and operating expenditures are significantly greater than those reported for conventional activated sludge treatment.\n      </p>", "           ", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
