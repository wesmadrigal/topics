This article explores the role of the patrons responsible for funding the windows, the fund-raising operations and the part played by the designers and glass-making firms. It argues that the diverse character of the windows results from the choice of particular workshops engaged to manufacture them.\n      </p>", "In this paper, we compare different exchange heuristics for vehicle routeing problems with time windows. We also introduce a new 2-opt* exchange heuristic, and show that a hybrid approach, based on Or-opt and 2-opt* exchanges, is particularly powerful for problems with time windows. Computational results are reported for randomly generated problems and for a standard test set.\n      </p>", "Long before it became a subject of controversy among modern architects, the symbolism of windows was a favourite subject for poets like Baudelaire, Mallarm\u00e9, and later Appolinaire, who had all chosen 'Fen\u00eatres' as the title for one of their poems. In these poems, Baudelaire and Mallarm\u00e9 tend to stress verticality, framing, interiority as conditions of a genuine poetic experience; whereas Appolinaire, through the concept of simultaneity, leans toward the themes of freedom, simultaneity, openness, panorama and exteriority. The nature of these poetic differences calls to mind Perret's apology of the strip window, symbol of exclusion, verticality and contemplation, and Le Corbusier's defence of the bay window as a sign of participation, horizontality and directness.\n      </p>", "In vehicle routing problems with time windows, a fixed fleet of vehicles of limited capacity is available at a depot to serve a set of clients with given demands. Each client must be visited within a given time window. We describe a branch-and-bound method that minimizes the total route length, and present some computational results.\n      </p>", "This paper proposes a three-stage method for the vehicle-routing problem with time window constraints (VRPTW). Using the Hungarian method the optimal customer matching for an assignment approximation of the VRPTW, which is a travel time-based relaxation that partially respects the time windows, is obtained. The assignment matching is transformed into feasible routes of the VRPTW via a simple decoupling heuristic. The best of these routes, in terms of travelling and vehicle waiting times, form part of the final solution, which is completed by the routes provided by heuristic methods applied to the remainder of the customers. The proposed approach is tested on a set of standard literature problems, and improves the results of the heuristic methods with respect to total travel time. Furthermore, it provides useful insights into the effect of employing optimal travel time solutions resulting from the assignment relaxation to derive partial route sets of the VRPTW.\n      </p>", "In the Fleet Size and Mix Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (FSMVRPTW) customers need to be serviced in their time windows at minimal costs by a heterogeneous fleet. In this paper new heuristics for the FSMVRPTW are developed. The performance of the heuristics is shown to be significantly higher than that of any previous heuristic approach and therefore likely to achieve better solutions to practical routing problems.\n      </p>", "One of the basic assumptions of the classical dynamic lot-sizing model is that the aggregate demand of a given period must be satisfied in that period. Under this assumption, if backlogging is not allowed, then the demand of a given period cannot be delivered earlier or later than the period. If backlogging is allowed, the demand of a given period cannot be delivered earlier than the period, but it can be delivered later at the expense of a backordering cost. Like most mathematical models, the classical dynamic lot-sizing model is a simplified paraphrase of what might actually happen in real life. In most real-life applications, the customer offers a grace period-we call it a demand time window-during which a particular demand can be satisfied with no penalty. That is, in association with each demand, the customer specifies an acceptable earliest and a latest delivery time. The time interval characterized by the earliest and latest delivery dates of a demand represents the corresponding time window. This paper studies the dynamic lot-sizing problem with demand time windows and provides polynomial time algorithms for computing its solution. If backlogging is not allowed, the complexity of the proposed algorithm is O(T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) where T is the length of the planning horizon. When backlogging is allowed, the complexity of the proposed algorithm is O(T&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).\n      </p>", "We describe three simple heuristics for the vehicle routeing problem with customer time windows that can be violated by paying appropriate penalties. The customer demands are known, and a homogeneous fleet of vehicles stationed at a single depot is considered. The penalty payable to a customer is assumed to be a linear function of the amount of time window violation. Upper limits are imposed on both the penalty payable and the waiting time allowed at any customer. At each customer in a route, the PC-based heuristics simultaneously determine the actual time to begin service, and the next customer to serve. To achieve this, each heuristic uses different measures to compare the cost of waiting and penalty payable, with the benefit obtained by leaving immediately for the next customer. Computational results on a set of benchmark problems show that the procedure is efficient and enables significant reduction in the number of vehicles required and/or the total route distances while controlling both customer penalties and waiting times.\n      </p>", "Several authors have considered the importance of exposure timing and how this affects the outcomes observed, but no one has systematically compiled preconceptional, prenatal, and postnatal developmental exposures and subsequent outcomes. Efforts were undertaken to examine the information available and to evaluate implications for risk assessment for several areas: a) respiratory and immune systems, b) reproductive system, c) nervous system, d) cardiovascular system, endocrine system, and general growth, and e) cancer. Major conclusions from a workshop on \"Critical Windows of Exposure for Children's Health\" included a) broad windows of sensitivity can be identified for many systems but detailed information is limited; b) cross-species comparisons of dose to target tissue and better data on the exposure-dose-outcome continuum are needed; c) increased interaction among scientific disciplines can further understanding by using laboratory animal results in designing epidemiological studies and human data to suggest specific laboratory studies on mechanisms and agent-target interactions; and d) thus far, only limited attention has been given to peripubertal/adolescent exposures, adult consequences of developmental exposures, and genome-environment interactions. More specific information on developmental windows will improve risk assessment by identifying the most sensitive window(s) for evaluation of dose-response relationships and exposure, evaluation of biological plausibility of research findings in humans, and comparison of data across species. In public health and risk management, information on critical windows may help identify especially susceptible subgroups for specific interventions.\n      </p>", "The different ways of allowing time window violations lead to different types of the vehicle routing problems with soft time windows (VRPSTW). In this paper, different types of VRPSTW are analysed. A unified penalty function and a unified tabu search algorithm for the main types of VRPSTW are presented, with which different types of VRPSTW can be solved by simply changing the values of corresponding parameters in the penalty function. Computational results on benchmark problems are provided and compared with other methods in the literature. Some best known solutions for the benchmark problems in the literature have been improved with the proposed algorithm.\n      </p>", "This article describes a generalized insertion heuristic for the Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows in which the objective is the minimization of travel times. The algorithm gradually builds a route by inserting at each step a vertex in its neighbourhood on the current route, and performing a local reoptimization. This is done while checking the feasibility of the remaining part of the route. Backtracking is sometimes necessary. Once a feasible route has been determined, an attempt is made to improve it by applying a post-optimization phase based on the successive removal and reinsertion of all vertices. Tests performed on 375 instances indicate that the proposed heuristic compares very well with alternative methods and very often produces optimal or near-optimal solutions.\n      </p>", "This paper presents a unified tabu search heuristic for the vehicle routing problem with time windows and for two important generalizations: the periodic and the multi-depot vehicle routing problems with time windows. The major benefits of the approach are its speed, simplicity and flexibility. The performance of the heuristic is assessed by comparing it to alternative methods on benchmark instances of the vehicle routing problem with time windows. Computational experiments are also reported on new randomly generated instances for each of the two generalizations.\n      </p>", "This note introduces a refinement to a previously proposed tabu search algorithm for vehicle routing problems with time windows. This refinement yields new best known solutions on a set of benchmark instances of the multi-depot, the periodic and the site-dependent vehicle routing problems with time windows.\n      </p>", "Fetuses, infants, and juveniles (preadults) should not be considered simply \"small adults\" when it comes to toxicological risk. We present specific examples of developmental toxicants that are more toxic to children than to adults, focusing on effects on the immune and respiratory systems. We describe differences in both the pharmacokinetics of the developing immune and respiratory systems as well as changes in target organ sensitivities to toxicants. Differential windows of vulnerability during development are identified in the context of available animal models. We provide specific approaches to directly investigate differential windows of vulnerability. These approaches are based on fundamental developmental biology and the existence of discrete developmental processes within the immune and respiratory systems. The processes are likely to influence differential developmental susceptibility to toxicants, resulting in lifelong toxicological changes. We also provide a template for comparative research. Finally, we discuss the application of these data to risk assessment.\n      </p>", "Inducible defenses allow prey to modulate their phenotypic responses to the level of predation risk in the environment and reduce the cost of constitutive defenses. Inherent in this statement is that prey must alter their phenotypes during development in order to form these defenses. This has lead many ecologists and evolutionary biologists to call for studies that examine developmental plasticity to provide insights into the importance of development in controlling the trajectories of trait formation, the integration of phenotypes over ontogeny, and the establishment of developmental windows for trait formation and reversal. By moving away from studies that focus on a single point in development, we can obtain a more complete understanding of the phenotypic decisions and limitations of prey. We exposed freshwater snails (Helisoma trivolvis) to environments in which predatory water bugs (Belostoma flumineum) were always absent, always present, or added and removed at different points in development. We discovered that snails formed morphological defenses against water bugs. Importantly, after the initial induction of defenses, snails showed similar developmental trajectories as snails reared without predators. Further, the snails possessed wide developmental windows for inducible defenses that extended past sexual maturity. However, being induced later in development appeared to have an associated cost (i.e., decreased shell thickness) that was not found when water bugs were always present. This epiphenotype (i.e., new shell formation as an extension of the current shell) suggests that resource limitation plays an important role in responses to temporal variation in predation risk and may have critical ecological costs that limit the benefits of the inducible defense. Lastly, the ability of snails to completely reverse their defenses was limited to early in ontogeny due to the constraints associated with modular growth of shell material. In sum, we demonstrate that taking a developmental perspective is extremely valuable for understanding the ecology of inducible defenses.\n      </p>", "Background: Few data are available on polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations over critical windows of human reproduction and development inclusive of the periconception window. Objectives: Our goal was to measure changes in PCB concentrations from preconception to pregnancy, through pregnancy, or after a year without becoming pregnant. Methods: Seventy-nine women planning pregnancies were prospectively enrolled and followed for up to 12 menstrual cycles of attempting pregnancy. Blood specimens were obtained from participating women preconceptionally (n = 79), after a positive pregnancy test leading to a live birth (n = 54) or pregnancy loss (n = 10), at approximately 6 weeks postpartum (n = 53), and after 12 unsuccessful cycles (n = 9) for toxicologic analysis of 76 PCB congeners. We estimated overall and daily rate of change in PCB concentration (nanograms per gram serum) adjusting for relevant covariates, serum lipids, and baseline PCB concentration. Results: Significant (p &lt; 0.0001) decreases in the mean overall and daily rate of change in PCB concentrations were observed between the preconception and first pregnancy samples for total (-1.012 and -0.034, respectively), estrogenic (-0.444 and -0.016, respectively), and antiestrogenic (-0.106 and -0.004, respectively) PCBs among women with live births. Similar significant decreases in total (-1.452 and -0.085), estrogenic (-0.647 and -0.040), and antiestrogenic (-0.093 and -0.004) PCB concentrations were seen for women with pregnancy losses. No significant changes were observed for PCB congener 153. Conclusions: These data suggest that PCB concentrations may change during the periconception interval, questioning the stability of persistent compounds during this critical window.\n      </p>", "This paper proposes new proximity measures for assignment algorithms for the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (MDVRPTW). Given the intrinsic difficulty of this problem class, two-step approximation methods of the type 'cluster first, route second' seem to be the most promising for practical size problems. The focus is on the clustering phase, the assignment of customers to depots. Our approach is to extend the existing metrics with time windows. New measures that include time windows and distances are added to two assignment heuristics, that previously only used distance to evaluate proximity between customers and depots. A computational study of their performance is presented, which shows that the inclusion of time windows in the measures of proximity gives better results, in terms of routing, than only using the distance.\n      </p>", "The Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) is one of the most important problems in distribution and transportation. A classical and recently popular technique that has proven effective for solving these problems is based on formulating them as a set covering problem. The method starts by solving its linear programming relaxation, via column generation, and then uses a branch and bound strategy to find an integer solution to the set covering problem: a solution to the VRPTW. An empirically observed property is that the optimal solution value of the set covering problem is very close to its linear programming relaxation which makes the branch and bound step extremely efficient. In this paper we explain this behavior by demonstrating that for any distribution of service times, time windows, customer loads, and locations, the relative gap between fractional and integer solutions of the set covering problem becomes arbitrarily small as the number of customers increases.\n      </p>", "Two well-known methods of spectrum estimation are the classical windowed-periodogram method described by Blackman and Tukey and the maximum entropy method (MEM) proposed by Burg. Comparisons of the two methods are difficult, in part because their motivations are based on differing sets of assumptions. My development, aimed at unification, rests on two new but simple formulas that extend a classical concept, thereby exhibiting an element common to both methods: the spectral window. The first formula expresses the MEM estimate as a convolution of the spectrum with a data-dependent and spectrum-dependent equivalent spectral window. The second formula gives the MEM estimate as a convolution of the periodogram with a data-dependent periodogram window. These formulas provide a new outlook on MEM that may be quite useful for a variety of purposes, including (a) the development of heuristic interpretations of line splitting and peak shifting and (b) the motivation of natural definitions of bandwidth for MEM estimates.\n      </p>", "This paper describes several insertion-based savings heuristics for the fleet size and mix vehicle routing problem with time window constraints. A certain number of candidate fleet compositions are recorded in the construction phase, followed by applying a composite improvement scheme on them to enhance the solution quality. Computational results on 168 sample problems are reported. We found that heuristics with the consideration of a sequential route construction parameter yielded very good results. In addition, results on the 20 benchmarking problems for the fleet and mix vehicle routing problem with no time window constraints also demonstrate the effectiveness of our heuristics.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

A growing literature attests to the Romans' use of solar energy in heating these large buildings. Edwin Thatcher claimed in 1956 that the windows in such baths did not require glazing. In this paper I refute this claim, drawing on modern ideas about solar energy, heat transfer, human comfort, and the effect of glazed windows to analyze one room in the Forum Baths at Ostia. This analysis is compared with that of Thatcher for the same room. In window size and solar orientation, this room is typical of Roman baths in many parts of the empire. The solar science and technology of today is thus compared with that of the Romans and with that of Thatcher's day.\n      </p>", "Mary Hull Webster, \u201cWindows,\u201d The San Francisco Jung Institute Library Journal, 2005, 24:2, 6-15.

This problem can be formulated as a network flow problem with additional time constraints. The paper presents an optimal solution approach using the augmented Lagrangian method. Two Lagrangian relaxations are studied. In the first one, the time constraints are relaxed producing network subproblems which are easy to solve, but the bound obtained is weak. In the second relaxation, constraints requiring that each node be visited are relaxed producing shortest path subproblems with time window constraints and integrality conditions. The bound produced is always excellent. Numerical results for several actual school busing problems with up to 223 nodes are discussed. Comparisons with a set partitioning formulation solved by column generation are given.\n      </p>", "Retailing in Tunis, like other Third World cities, can be divided into traditional and modern sectors.

The power of the heuristic is demonstrated through experimentation using a large, real-life vehicle scheduling problem with tight time-window constraints. Incorporation of the look-ahead feature gave an improvement in performance that was at least as great as, and in addition to, that which had been obtained through use of the well-known `savings' method. Based upon the experimental results, some guidelines are proposed for the application of the heuristic to other problems. One of the conclusions is that designers of heuristics should give greater consideration to the inclusion of a look-ahead element in their algorithms.\n      </p>", "The spatial scan statistic is widely used to search for clusters. This article shows that the usually applied elimination of secondary clusters as implemented in SatScan is sensitive to smooth changes in the shape of the clusters. We present an algorithm for generation of a set of confocal elliptic windows and propose a new way to present the information when a spatial point process is considered. This method gives smooth changes for smooth expansions of the set of clusters. A simulation study is used to show how the elliptic windows outperforms the usual circular windows. The proposed method for graphical representation of the information in a set of clusters contain more information than just presenting nonoverlapping clusters.

In a cohort of autoworkers we characterized exposure to metalworking fluids (MWF) into age windows with homogenous biological risk for prostate cancer, and examined exposure--response relationships using semi-parametric modeling. Methods: Incident cases (n = 872) were identified via Michigan cancer registry from 1985 through 2000. Controls were selected using incidence-density sampling, 5:1 ratio. Using a hormonal-based model, exposure was accumulated in three windows: (1) late puberty, (2) adulthood, and (3) middle age. We used penalized splines to model risk as a smooth function of exposure, and controlled for race and calendar year of diagnosis in a Cox model. Results: Risk of prostate cancer linearly increased with exposure to straight MWF in the first window, with a relative risk of 2.4 per 10 mg/m\u2073-years. Autoworkers exposed to MWF at a young age also had an increased risk associated with MWF exposure incurred later in life. For soluble MWF there was a slightly increased risk in the third window. Conclusions: Exposure characterization based on a hormonal model identified heightened risk with early age of exposure to straight MWF. Results also support a long latency period for exposure related prostate cancer.\n      </p>", "This paper shows how distribution problems with delivery time constraints can be modeled approximately with just a few variables. Its objective is neither to develop a scheduling algorithm nor an exact predictive method; rather, it is to illustrate some trade-offs and principles that can be used for planning and algorithm development. A workday is divided into time periods. Time windows are modeled by specifying the period in which a vehicle should visit each customer. (The companion paper explores scenarios where many customers do not specify a time window, and thus, it is advantageous not to allocate all the customers to periods.) Travel distance expressions are provided for a \"cluster-first, route-second\" strategy, similar to some routing methods currently in use. Travel distance expressions are also provided for refinements of the strategy, including one in which tours are systematically staggered, overlapping. The consequent reductions in travel distance can be quite significant. We suggest here that more attention should be paid to the clustering part of algorithm construction, and point to ways in which the customers served by one vehicle should be selected.\n      </p>", "The wafer probing scheduling problem (WPSP) is a variation of the parallel-machine scheduling problem, which has many real-world applications, particularly, in the integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing industry. In the wafer probing factories, the jobs are clustered by their product types, which must be processed on groups of identical parallel machines and be completed before the due dates. Further, the job processing time depends on the product type, and the machine setup time is sequence dependent on the orders of jobs processed. Since the wafer probing scheduling problem involves constraints on job clusters, job-cluster dependent processing time, due dates, machine capacity, and sequence dependent setup time, it is more difficult to solve than the classical parallel-machine scheduling problem. In this paper, we formulate the WPSP as an integer programming problem. We also transform the WPSP into the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW), a well-known network routing problem which has been investigated extensively. An illustrative example is given to demonstrate the proposed transformation. Based on the provided transformation, we present three efficient algorithms to solve the WPSP near-optimally.\n      </p>", "In this paper, a greedy randomised heuristic is applied to a complex vehicle-scheduling problem with tight time windows and additional constraints. Two forms of adaptive search are identified, which are referred to as local and global adaptation. In both cases, the calculation of the greedy function is modified by an amount which measures heuristically the quality of the partial solution that is obtained when a decision is made. One use of global adaptation is an approach which is referred to as a learning strategy since it involves an attempt to learn from previous mistakes by an appropriate updating of the greedy function from one run of the heuristic to the next. Such a learning strategy forms the main focus of this paper. Experimental results show that it is potentially a powerful heuristic device, since it greatly enhanced the effectiveness of those methods that had previously been applied to this problem; that is, a greedy randomized heuristic which also incorporated a look-ahead strategy and a version of the well-known savings method.

This article investigates the current condition and possible future of Internet gambling in Canada. We apply Howlet's (1998) refinement of Kingdon's \"policy windows\" theory to examine four windows of opportunity through which Internet gambling might be placed on the Canadian policy agenda. We conclude that Internet gambling is unlikely to reach the agenda through a routine means; instead, the issue might be recognized by policy-makers through alternative routes such as connection to another Internet-related issue or to a crisis that would intensify the political or economic problems related to the current murky status of online gambling.\n      </p>", "This paper investigates the effect of economic conditions (carrots) and sanctions (sticks) on murder, assault, robbery, burglary, motor vehicle theft, grand larceny, and rape in New York City, using monthly time\u2010series data spanning 1974\u201399. Carrots are measured by the unemployment rate and the real minimum wage; sticks are measured by the number of felony arrests, size of the police force, and number of New York City residents in prison. In addition, the paper tests the validity of the \u201cbroken windows\u201d hypothesis. Consistent with its implementation by the New York Police Department, we use misdemeanor arrests as a measure of broken\u2010windows policing. The broken\u2010windows hypothesis has validity in the case of robbery, motor vehicle theft, and grand larceny. While both economic and deterrence variables are important in explaining the decline in crime, the contribution of deterrence measures is larger than those of economic variables.\n      </p>", "In the one-machine scheduling problems analysed in this paper, the processing time of a job depends on the time at which the job is started. More precisely, the horizon is divided into time windows and with each one a coefficient is associated that is used to determine the actual processing time of a job starting in it. Two models are introduced, and one of them has direct connections with models considered in previous papers on scheduling problems with time-dependent processing times. Various computational complexity results are presented for the makespan criterion, which show that the problem is NP-hard, even with two time windows. Solving procedures are also proposed for some special cases.\n      </p>", "The problem studied in this article arises from the distribution of soft drinks and collection of recyclable containers in a Quebec-based company. It can be modelled as a variant of the vehicle routing problem with a heterogeneous vehicle fleet, time windows, capacity and volume constraints, and an objective function combining routing costs and the revenue resulting from the sale of recyclable material. Three construction heuristics and an improvement procedure are developed for the problem. Comparative tests are performed on a real-life instance and on 10 randomly generated instances.\n      </p>", "We consider a single depot and a set of customers with known demands, each of which must be picked up and delivered at specified locations and within given time windows. We seek a route and a schedule for a single vehicle with known capacity, which minimizes the route duration, i.e., the difference between the arrival time and the departure time at the depot. We develop a local search method for this problem based on a variable-depth search, similar to the Lin-Kernighan algorithm for the traveling salesman problem. The method consists of two phases. In the first phase, a feasible route is constructed; in the second phase, it is iteratively improved. In both phases, we use a variable-depth search built up out of seven basic types of arc-exchange procedures. When tested on real-life problems, the method is shown to produce near-optimal solutions in a reasonable amount of computation time. In spite of this, there is the theoretical possibility that the method may end up with a poor or even infeasible solution. As a safeguard against such an emergency, we have developed an alternative algorithm based on simulated annealing. As a rule, it finds high quality solutions in a relatively large computation time.\n      </p>", "Background: Exposure to metalworking fluids has been previously associated with prostate cancer mortality in a cohort of autoworkers. Our objective was to further explore this finding in a study of prostate cancer incidence in the same cohort, with reduced misclassification of outcome. Methods: We conducted a nested case-control study in the General Motors cohort of autoworkers. Incident cases of prostate cancer (n = 872) were identified via the Michigan Cancer Registry from 1985 through 2000. Controls were selected using incidence-density sampling with 5:1 ratio. Using cumulative exposure (mg/m\u00b3-years) as the dose metric, we first examined varying lengths of lags (0-25 years). Then, we evaluated consecutive windows of exposure: 25 or more years before risk age, and fewer than 25 years. We used penalized splines to model the relative risk as a smooth function of exposure, and adjusted for race and calendar year of diagnosis in a Cox model. Results: Risk of prostate cancer increased with exposure to soluble and straight fluids 25 years or more before risk age but not with exposure in the last 25 years. The relationship with soluble fluids was piecewise linear, with a small increase in risk at lower exposures followed by a steeper rise. By contrast, the relationship with straight fluids was linear, with a relative risk of 1.12 per 10 mg/m\u00b3--years of exposure (95% confidence interval = 1.04-1.20). Conclusions: Exposure to oil-based fluids, soluble and straight, is modestly associated with prostate cancer risk among autoworkers, with a latency period of at least 25 years.\n      </p>", "Objectives\u2014Exposure to the radioactive daughters of radon is associated with increased risk of lung cancer in mining populations. An investigation of incidence of lung cancer following a clinical survey of Ontario uranium miners was undertaken to explore whether risk associated with radon is modified by factors including smoking, radiographic silicosis, clinical symptoms, the results of lung function testing, and the temporal pattern of radon exposure. Methods\u2014Miners were examined in 1974 by a respiratory questionnaire, tests of lung function, and chest radiography. A random selection of 733 (75%) of the original 973 participants was followed up by linkage to the Ontario Mortality and Cancer Registries. Results\u2014Incidence of lung cancer was increased threefold. Risk of lung cancer among miners who had stopped smoking was half that of men who continued to smoke. There was no interaction between smoking and radon exposure. Men with lung function test results consistent with airways obstruction had an increased risk of lung cancer, even after adjustment for cigarette smoking. There was no association between radiographic silicosis and risk of lung cancer. Lung cancer was associated with exposures to radon daughters accumulated in a time window four to 14 years before diagnosis, but there was little association with exposures incurred earlier than 14 years before diagnosis. Among the men diagnosed with lung cancer, the mean and median dose rates were 2\u00b76 working level months (WLM) a year and 1\u00b78 WLM/year in the four to 14 year exposure window. Conclusions\u2014Risk of lung cancer associated with radon is modified by dose and time from exposure. Risk can be substantially decreased by stopping smoking.\n      </p>", "Little is known about impacts to birds from collisions with windows at commercial buildings. We monitored bird mortality from striking windows at five commercial buildings on two college campuses in northwestern and southwestern Illinois. Bird mortality at Augustana College (northwestern), which was evaluated from 2002 to 2006, totaled 215 individuals in 48 species for an average rate of 55 birds/building/year. We calculated a mortality rate of 24 birds/building/year for 2004-2005 from 142 individuals within 37 species at Principia College (southwestern). Mortality of North American migrant (NAM) and neotropical migrant (NTM) birds was higher during migration than during summer or winter. We tested the hypothesis at Augustana that density of birds at a given location will be positively correlated with numbers of birds that die due to strikes with windows. Bird density only partially explained strikes with windows since mortality was also a function of landscaped habitat that attracted birds. Annual bird mortality at commercial buildings may be about five times higher than previous estimates. These buildings may place bird populations at high risk of strikes at windows.\n      </p>", "The formation and evolution of young low-mass stars are characterized by important processes of mass loss and accretion occurring in the innermost regions of their placentary circumstellar disks. Because of the large obscuration of these disks at optical and infrared wavelengths in the early protostellar stages (class 0 sources), they were previously detected only at radio wavelengths using interferometric techniques. We have detected with the Infrared Space Observatory the mid-infrared (mid-IR) emission associated with the class 0 protostar VLA1 in the HH1-HH2 region located in the Orion nebula. The emission arises in three wavelength windows (at 5.3, 6.6, and 7.5 micrometers) where the absorption due to ices and silicates has a local minimum that exposes the central part of the young protostellar system to mid-IR investigations. The mid-IR emission arises from a central source with a diameter of 4 astronomical units at an averaged temperature of \u223c700 K, deeply embedded in a dense region with a visual extinction of 80 to 100 magnitudes.\n      </p>", "This article describes a tabu search heuristic for the vehicle routing problem with backhauls and time windows. In this problem, the set of customers is partitioned into two subsets: linehaul customers where a given quantity of goods is delivered from a central depot, and backhaul customers where a given quantity of goods is collected and transported to the depot. Mixed routes with both linehaul and backhaul customers are constructed. A variant of this problem is examined where linehausl must precede backhauls on each route. Furthermore, the time of beginning of service at each customer location must occur within a particular time interval. Computational results are reported on a standard set of test problems, and comparisons are made with other heuristic approaches and with optimal solutions.\n      </p>", "The standard Big Bang cosmology requires very special initial conditions: (i) an excess of matter over antimatter, (ii) delicate tuning of the expansion rate at an early time to produce the long-lived Universe we see today, and (iii) a conspiracy among parts of the Universe out of causal contact to produce the currently observed degree of homogeneity. New theories that unify the strong and electroweak interactions may remove the necessity of specifying these conditions as initial data by introducing an inherent matter-antimatter asymmetry in physical laws and changing the early dynamic history of the Universe.\n      </p>", "This paper discusses various spectral windows which can be used to estimate spectra and cross-spectra.

Heraldic and archival evidence is marshalled to investigate Guillaume's life and relationship to the area of Tours. Stylistic analysis of the Tours glass establishes his gift as the hemicycle group, distinguishable as \"western\" by its dynamism and bright color: apostles and angels around the Virgin and Child. The relationship of this stained-glass group to its architectural frame is complicated by the triforium's elaborate frontal stone screen, which creates a dual image shifting with the viewpoint of the observer and dependent upon the simultaneous reading of both planes. The necessary surface light is provided by the two band windows which interrupt the dense coloration of the clerestory glass. Tours is therefore at the watershed of the rayonnant aesthetic.\n      </p>", "This paper describes and solves the operational pilot scheduling problem for one day of operations. The problem consists in simultaneously modifying, as necessary, the existing flight departure schedules and planned individual work days (duties) while keeping planned aircraft itineraries unchanged. It requires the covering of all flights from one day of operations with available pilots while minimizing changes in both the flight schedule and the next day's planned duties. The newly constructed personalized duties must not exceed the maximum duty duration. Flight precedence constraints, coming from existing fixed aircraft itineraries, must be respected as well. The problem is mathematically formulated as an integer nonlinear multicommodity network flow model with time windows and additional constraints. To solve the problem, a Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition combined with a branch-and-bound method has been used. The master problem comprises the flight-covering constraints and a new set of flight precedence constraints. Subproblems consisting of time-constrained shortest-path problems with linear time costs are solved by a specialized dynamic-programming algorithm. The proposed optimization approach has been tested on several input data sets. All of them have been successfully solved in very short computational time.\n      </p>", "This article aims: 1) to review several, key, earlier studies of Josiah Royce's relations to Asian thinkers (mainly Indian); 2) to discover through a survey of Royce's writings how widely and deeply Royce familiarized himself with, and employed Hindu, Buddhist, and other Asian traditions; and, 3) to measure how relevant Royce's most mature philosophy (1912\u20131916) is for the currently needed inter-cultural, inter-religious, and inter-faith dialogues. Parts One and Two supply foundations which reveal Royce's lifelong commitment to open \"windows\" to Eastern thought, in order to dialogue with Asian thinkers and invite other Westerners to do the same. The article climaxes in Part Three by revealing the relevance of the late Royce's \"philosophy of the 'Spirit', his \"philosophical pneumatology.\" I trace ten of its implied positions, significant for contemporary philosophers of religion and theologians. I conclude by showing that Royce's \"philosophy of the 'Spirit'\" and its implied positions are all rooted in Royce's view of a \"middle faith.\" Such a faith supports his view of the \"invisible church,\" his \"Beloved Community of all \"Christians\"\u2014\"Christians\" taken in his wider sense of \"all genuine loyalists who are members of a Beloved Community.\"\n      </p>", "Background: During 1990-1991 a childhood leukemia cluster was observed in the sparsely populated region surrounding two nuclear establishments southeast of Hamburg, Germany. Since then, several new cases have been reported. Recently a possible accidental release of radionuclides in 1986 was hypothesized. Objective: The objective of this study was to analyze the childhood leukemia incidence in this area since 1990. Methods: All incident cases (&lt; 15 years of age) were ascertained during 1990-2005 within a 5-km radius of the Kriimmel nuclear power plant. We derived standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) using county and national leukemia incidence rates as referents. We stratified analyses by calendar period and attained age, and by subdividing the study region into areas north versus south of the Elbe river. Results: Fourteen cases were ascertained in the study area, whereas 4.0 were expected based on national referent rates [1990-2005: SIR = 3.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.9-5.9]. The excess was not confined to the early 1990s; for the more recent time period 1999-2005, the SIR is still elevated (SIR = 2.7; 95% CI, 0.9-6.2). SIRs of greatest magnitude were observed for children 0-4 years of age (SIR = 4.9; 95% CI, 2.4-9.0) and for residents south of the Elbe (SIR = 7.5; 95% CI, 2.8-16.4). Conclusions: The incidence in this region is significantly higher than the childhood leukemia incidence for Germany as a whole. To date, no unique hazards have been identified in this population. The fact that the elevated rates have persisted in this community for &gt; 15 years warrants further investigation.\n      </p>", "We describe two optimization methods for vehicle routing problems with time windows.

This is reflected in \"Epi-Strauss-Ium\", a poem curiously similar to George Herbert's metaphysical \"The Windows\" particularly in the unusual vehicle of imagery used-church-windows and the effect of sunlight shining through them. The connection between the poems is not, however, a simple literary echo in material or style. Rather, \"Epi-Strauss-Ium\" may validly be regarded as Clough's post-Straussian statement in an ancient debate on what constitutes the essence of Christianity. \"The Windows\" springs from the continuing tradition that defined man's religious aspirations and duties as being Christ-like. This tradition is denied to Clough, the Christ of the Gospels having become merely legendary. However, as his choice of imagery underlines, instead of collapsing his religious beliefs, this historical fact ironically made the essential Christianity plainer to discover. The turmoil involved in reaching this conclusion is best observed in the sardonic intensity of tone and in the ironic structure of \"Easter Day. Naples, 1849,\" and its resolution is found in that poem's counterpart \"Easter Day II\" in which Clough propounds his \"true Creed.\"\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

However, there is a paucity of information regarding temporal aspects of this relationship. The objective of this study was to investigate the associations between contiguous windows of endotoxin exposure and risk of lung cancer. Methods: Data were reanalyzed from a case-cohort study (602 cases, 3,038 subcohort) of female textile workers in Shanghai, China. Cumulative endotoxin exposure was partitioned into two windows: \u226520 and &lt;20 years before risk. Exposure-response relations were examined using categorical and non-linear (semi-parametric) models, accounting for confounding by previous exposure windows. Results: There was an inverse trend of decreasing risk of lung cancer associated with increasing levels of endotoxin exposure \u226520 years before risk (p trend = 0.02). Women in the highest two categories of cumulative exposures had hazard ratios of 0.78 (95% CI 0.60-1.03) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.58-1.02) for lung cancer, respectively, in comparison with unexposed textile workers. There was, however, a weaker association and not statistically significant between lung cancer and endotoxin exposure accumulated in the more recent window (&lt; 20 years before risk). Conclusion: Results provide further evidence that endotoxin exposure that occurred 20 years or more before risk confers the strongest protection against lung cancer, indicating a possible early anti-carcinogenic effect. Further studies are needed to better understand the underlying biological mechanisms for this effect.\n      </p>", "In this paper, we propose a manpower allocation model with time windows which is of practical interest. This model originates from a real-life port manpower allocation problem where demand is generated from locations in the yard for servicemen who are dispatched from a central point and where the objectives are to minimize the number of servicemen used, travel distances, travel times and waiting times. We develop a tabu-embedded simulated annealing algorithm and a squeaky wheel optimization with local search algorithm for the problem. Experimental results are reported which show the effectiveness of our approaches.\n      </p>", "The toxicity of pesticides on human reproduction is largely unknown-particularly how mixtures of pesticide products might affect fetal toxicity. The Ontario Farm Family Health Study collected data by questionnaire on the identity and timing of pesticide use on the farm, lifestyle factors, and a complete reproductive history from the farm operator and eligible couples living on the farm. A total of 2,110 women provided information on 3,936 pregnancies, including 395 spontaneous abortions. To explore critical windows of exposure and target sites for toxicity, we examined exposures separately for preconception (3 months before and up to month of conception) and postconception (first trimester) windows and for early (&lt; 12 weeks) and late (12-19 weeks) spontaneous abortions. We observed moderate increases in risk of early abortions for preconception exposures to phenoxy acetic acid herbicides [odds ratio (OR) = 1.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-2.1], triazines (OR = 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-2.0), and any herbicide (OR = 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.9). For late abortions, preconception exposure to glyphosate (OR = 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0-2.9), thiocarbamates (OR = 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-3.0), and the miscellaneous class of pesticides (OR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.0-2.4) was associated with elevated risks. Postconception exposures were generally associated with late spontaneous abortions. Older maternal age (&gt; 34 years of age) was the strongest risk factor for spontaneous abortions, and we observed several interactions between pesticides in the older age group using Classification and Regression Tree analysis. This study shows that timing of exposure and restricting analyses to more homogeneous endpoints are important in characterizing the reproductive toxicity of pesticides.\n      </p>", "Living in a confined environment with minimal external stimuli available, such as a space habitat, is a strain on normal human life and puts great pressure on groups and individuals. Designers working on a space habitat not only must work on its functional role, but also must integrate functionality with mental representation and symbolic meaning. Space-connection interfaces such as doors and windows act as \"sensory organs\" of a building. They allow inside-out communication, but also allow the user to control the flow of light and air, which in a direct or indirect way are communication mediums. In this paper the authors advocate a closer connection among architecture, anthropology and psychology in designing space habitats as part of a new concept of environmental design strategy in space architecture.\n      </p>", "Management of rangelands, and natural resources in general, has become increasingly complex. There is an atmosphere of increasing expectations for conservation efforts associated with a variety of issues from water quality to endangered species. We argue that many current issues are complex by their nature, which influences how we approach them. We define a complex problem as one that varies in time and space. In other words, one answer may not be correct for all sites or during all years. For simple problems a generalized answer may be sufficient, and even for complex problems, general rules provide a good starting point. However, we suggest that it is important to distinguish between simple and complex problems. Several key obstacles emerge when considering complex natural resource problems, namely, 1) no single entity can handle all aspects of the problem and 2) significant knowledge gaps exist and will continue to exist into the future. We suggest that overcoming these obstacles will benefit from 1) a framework for effective partnerships and 2) a mechanism for continuous learning. Managing complex problems will require some combination of the following: 1) a process-based understanding of the problem (i.e., what causes variation in time and space), 2) adaptive management, and 3) effective coordination of research and management. There are many examples of organizations applying portions of these approaches to complex problems; however, it seems that in many cases the process has simply evolved in that direction rather than being a planned strategy. We suggest that as a profession we need to have a discussion about the nature of the problems we are addressing and how researchers and managers can jointly address these problems. /// El manejo de pastizales naturales, y de los recursos naturales en general, se ha tornado cada vez m\u00e1s complejo. Existe un ambiente de expectativas crecientes en cuanto a los esfuerzos de conservaci\u00f3n asociados con una variedad de tem\u00e1ticas que abarcan desde la calidad del agua hasta especies en peligro de extinci\u00f3n. Sostenemos que mucha de la problem\u00e1tica actual es intr\u00ednsecamente compleja, y que dicha complejidad incide en el modo en que abordamos esta problem\u00e1tica. Definimos un problema complejo como aquel que var\u00eda a trav\u00e9s del tiempo y el espacio. Es decir que una respuesta podr\u00eda no ser la soluci\u00f3n correcta para todos los sitios ni para todos los a\u00f1os. Las respuestas generales son casi siempre suficientes para la resoluci\u00f3n de problemas sencillos, y a\u00fan el caso de problemas complejos, las reglas generales constituyen un buen punto de partida. No obstante, sugerimos que es importante distinguir entre problemas sencillos y complejos. Existen varios obst\u00e1culos clave que emergen cuando se consideran problemas complejos asociados con los recursos naturales: 1) ninguna entidad por si sola puede abordar todos los aspectos de un problema y 2) existen vac\u00edos de conocimiento considerables que continuar\u00e1n existiendo en el futuro. Proponemos que sortear estos obst\u00e1culos producir\u00e1 como beneficios: 1) un marco para la generaci\u00f3n de asociaciones efectivas y 2) un mecanismo para el aprendizaje continuo. El manejo de problemas complejos requerir\u00e1 una combinaci\u00f3n de los siguientes factores: 1) una comprensi\u00f3n del problema basado en procesos (es decir, qu\u00e9 es lo que genera la variaci\u00f3n en el tiempo y el espacio), 2) manejo adaptativo, y 3) coordinaci\u00f3n efectiva entre actividades de investigaci\u00f3n y manejo. Existen muchos ejemplos de organizaciones que aplican porciones de estos enfoques para la resoluci\u00f3n de problemas complejos, sin embargo, en muchos casos parecer\u00eda que el proceso ha evolucionado en esta direcci\u00f3n sin mediar una estrategia planificada. Proponemos que como profesi\u00f3n debemos tener una discusi\u00f3n sobre la naturaleza de los problemas que estamos abordando y sobre el modo en que los sectores de investigaci\u00f3n y manejo pueden abordar dichos problemas conjuntamente.\n      </p>", "The pickup and delivery problem with time windows (PDPTW) is a generalization of the vehicle routing problem with time windows. In the PDPTW, a set of identical vehicles located at a central depot must be optimally routed to service a set of transportation requests subject to capacity, time window, pairing, and precedence constraints. In this paper, we present a new exact algorithm for the PDPTW based on a set-partitioning\u2014like integer formulation, and we describe a bounding procedure that finds a near-optimal dual solution of the LP-relaxation of the formulation by combining two dual ascent heuristics and a cut-and-column generation procedure. The final dual solution is used to generate a reduced problem containing only the routes whose reduced costs are smaller than the gap between a known upper bound and the lower bound achieved. If the resulting problem has moderate size, it is solved by an integer programming solver; otherwise, a branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm is used to close the integrality gap. Extensive computational results over the main instances from the literature show the effectiveness of the proposed exact method.\n      </p>", "In this paper we examine the traveling saleman problem with time windows for various degrees of dynamism. In contrast to the static problem, where the dispatcher can plan ahead, in the dynamic version, part or all of the necessary information becomes available only during the day of operation. We seek to minimize lateness and examine the impact of this criterion choice on the distance traveled. Our focus on lateness is motivated by the problem faced by overnight mail service providers. We propose a real-time solution method that requires the vehicle, when idle, to wait at the current customer location until it can service another customer without being early. In addition, we develop several enhanced versions of this method that may reposition the vehicle at a location different from that of the current customer based on a priori information on future requests. The results we obtained on both randomly generated data and on a real-world case study indicate that all policies proved capable of significantly reducing lateness. Our results also show that this can be accomplished with only small distance increases. The basic policy outperformed the other methods primarily when lateness and distance were equally minimized and proved very robust in all environments studied. When only lateness was considered, the policy to reposition the vehicle at a location near the current customer generally provided the largest reductions in average lateness and the number of late customers. It also produced the least extra distance to be traveled among the relocation policies.\n      </p>", "Four clerestory windows on the north transept at Chartres contain a singular cycle of only eight apostles, three of whom are duplicated. Their mediocre style has been explained by assigning them to a later 13th-century workshop which completed the glazing after the main workshops had moved on to other projects. However, discrepancies between the present windows and a watercolor of 1696 raises the possibility of a subsequent alteration. The apostles wear the royal mantle and each raise one hand to the strap of the mantle in a gesture which is frequently seen in the 13th century but as one reserved almost exclusively for kings and queens. No corroborating example of apostles wearing the strapped mantle exist and this heretofore unnoticed iconographic feature argues for a postmedieval date. Other windows by the same workshop betray this same iconographic anomaly. It is hoped that this article will spur a long-needed technical examination of the transept glass.\n      </p>", "In this paper, we consider the wafer probing scheduling problem (WPSP) to sequence families of jobs on identical parallel machines with due date restrictions. The machine set-up time is sequentially dependent on the product types of the jobs processed on the machine. The objective is to minimize the total machine workload without violating the machine capacity and job due date restrictions. The WPSP is a variation of the classical parallel-machine scheduling problem, that can be transformed into the vehicle-routing problem with time windows (VRPTW). One can therefore solve the WPSP efficiently using existing VRPTW algorithms. We apply four existing savings algorithms presented in the literature including sequential, parallel, generalized, and matching based savings, and develop three modifications called the modified sequential, the compound matching based, and the modified compound matching-based savings algorithms, to solve the WPSP. Based on the characteristics of the wafer probing process, a set of test problems is generated for testing purposes. Computational results show that the three proposed modified algorithms perform remarkably well.\n      </p>", "In this paper, we consider the open vehicle routing problem with time windows (OVRPTW). The OVRPTW seeks to find a set of non-depot returning vehicle routes, for a fleet of capacitated vehicles, to satisfy customers' requirements, within fixed time intervals that represent the earliest and latest times during the day that customers' service can take place. We formulate a comprehensive mathematical model to capture all aspects of the problem, and incorporate in the model all critical practical concerns. The model is solved using a greedy look-ahead route construction heuristic algorithm, which utilizes time windows related information via composite customer selection and route-insertion criteria. These criteria exploit the interrelationships between customers, introduced by time windows, that dictate the sequence in which vehicles must visit customers. Computational results on a set of benchmark problems from the literature provide very good results and indicate the applicability of the methodology in real-life routing applications.\n      </p>", "The recent introduction of SPSS for Windows allows for data analysis to be employed in substantive courses as well as methods courses. Data analysis using SPSS for Windows complements the otherwise typical activities (paper writing, class presentations) of a substantive course. This article focuses on its use in upper-division sociology classes where substantive themes are developed in some depth. Specifically, I will discuss how a few SPSS exercises can help organize students' ideas by testing them, and how presentation of numerical results and graphs can greatly enhance an undergraduate term paper.\n      </p>", "Microbial cells, and ultimately the Earth's biosphere, function within a narrow range of physicochemical conditions. For the majority of ecosystems, productivity is cold-limited, and it is microbes that represent the failure point. This study was carried out to determine if naturally occurring solutes can extend the temperature windows for activity of microorganisms. We found that substances known to disorder cellular macromolecules (chaotropes) did expand microbial growth windows, fungi preferentially accumulated chaotropic metabolites at low temperature, and chemical activities of solutes determined microbial survival at extremes of temperature as well as pressure. This information can enhance the precision of models used to predict if extraterrestrial and other hostile environments are able to support life; furthermore, chaotropes may be used to extend the growth windows for key microbes, such as saprotrophs, in cold ecosystems and manmade biomes.\n      </p>", "We take a model-selection approach to the question of whether forward-interest rates are useful in predicting future spot rates, using a variety of out-of-sample forecast-based model-selection criteria--forecast mean squared error, forecast direction accuracy, and forecast-based trading-system profitability. We also examine the usefulness of a class of novel prediction models called \"artificial neural networks\" and investigate the issue of appropriate window sizes for rolling-window-based prediction methods. Results indicate that the premium of the forward rate over the spot rate helps to predict the sign of future changes in the interest rate. Furthermore, model selection based on an in-sample Schwarz information criterion (SIC) does not appear to be a reliable guide to out-of-sample performance in the case of short-term interest rates. Thus, the in-sample SIC apparently fails to offer a convenient shortcut to true out-of-sample performance measures.\n      </p>", "This paper presents a new integer programming model for optimal shift scheduling with multiple rest and lunch breaks, and break windows. A set-covering approach for this problem was originally developed by Dantzig (1954). Since then, a number of set-covering-based formulations have been proposed in the literature. These formulations require an integer variable for every shift type, shift start time, and rest/lunch break placement combination. Unfortunately, the number of integer variables required is rather large, making them impractical to solve for an optimal solution in most applications. We present a new approach in which a set of break variables is introduced for every shift-break type combination to determine the break placements. This approach leads to a significantly improved integer programming model requiring substantially smaller number of variables and computer memory. We tested the proposed approach with 40 test problems involving between 1,728 and 8,640 shift variations, and five demand patterns. Our results showed that the proposed formulation is very useful in solving large shift scheduling problems optimally.\n      </p>", "This article discusses some controversial aspects of the theory of broken windows and its application to the strategy of zero tolerance in the policing of urban crimes.

An understanding of the institutional setting is key to explaining the speed and the magnitude of policy dynamics. In both food safety and pharmaceutical policy in Spain, a redefinition of policy image has involved a transformation of the policy subsystem. In the case of food safety such a paradigm shift has represented a dramatic change, in the case of pharmaceuticals it has meant a gradual process that has developed over a decade. Periods of stability in the pharmaceutical sector reflect the ability of a closed policy community to control problem framing. By contrast, rapid changes in food safety policies are the result of crisis situations governed by a relatively loose policy network. The European Union has been a key policy venue that can transform an institutional framework towards one that is more pluralistic and expert oriented.\n      </p>", "Recognizing that allowing variability in scheduled flight departure times can result in improved flight connection opportunities and a more cost effective fleet assignment, we present a generalized fleet assignment model for simultaneously assigning aircraft types to flights and scheduling flight departures. Our model, a simple variant of basic fleet assignment models, assigns a time window to each flight and then discretizes each window, allowing flight departure times to be optimized. Because problem size can become formidable, much larger than basic fleet assignment models, we develop two algorithmic approaches for solving the model. Our direct solution approach is good for speed and simplicity, whereas our iterative technique minimizes memory usage. Using data from a major U.S. airline, we show that our model can solve real, large-scale problems, and we evaluate the effects of schedule flexibility. In every test scenario, the model produces a fleet assignment with significantly lower costs than the basic model, and, in a separate analysis, the model is used to tighten the schedule, potentially saving aircraft.\n      </p>", "Werden's reply to our comment does nothing to cast doubt on our fundamental conclusion: Microsoft's pricing of Windows is inconsistent with the government's claim that Windows is a monopoly, protected by high entry barriers.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Exposure to high levels of air pollution during the pregnancy is associated with increased probability of preterm birth (PTB), a major cause of infant morbidity and mortality. New statistical methodology is required to specifically determine when a particular pollutant impacts the PTB outcome, to determine the role of different pollutants, and to characterize the spatial variability in these results. We develop a new Bayesian spatial model for PTB which identifies susceptible windows throughout the pregnancy jointly for multiple pollutants (PM\u2082 . \u2085, ozone) while allowing these windows to vary continuously across space and time. We geo-code vital record birth data from Texas (2002-2004) and link them with standard pollution monitoring data and a newly introduced EPA product of calibrated air pollution model output. We apply the fully spatial model to a region of 13 counties in eastern Texas consisting of highly urban as well as rural areas. Our results indicate significant signal in the first two trimesters of pregnancy with different pollutants leading to different critical windows. Introducing the spatial aspect uncovers critical windows previously unidentified when space is ignored.
