A naively reductionist view of this relationship is prevalent in psychology, medicine, and basic and clinical neuroscience. This view undermines the ability of psychology and related sciences to achieve their individual and combined potential. A nondualistic, nonreductionist, noninteractive perspective is recommended, with psychological and biological concepts both having central, distinct roles.\n      </p>", "Modern American culture has seen a proliferation of radio and television personalities associated with talk therapy and advice-giving within the last 20 years (Epstein Psychology Today 34:5 2001). The origin of radio psychology, however, is the late 1920's, when radio began to air many promoters of psychology in the context of \"public service\" programming. Among these individuals were Louis Monash, Arthur Payne, and, perhaps most importantly, Joseph Jastrow. Traditionally-trained psychologists used the new medium of radio in the service of education and adjustment. This article surveys radio psychology, its personalities, and topics in the inter-war period and proposes the significant social support role that radio psychology played during the Great Depression, much as modern talk radio does today (Ricks 1984).\n      </p>", "Gestalt views of psychopathology are almost completely ignored in mainstream psychology and psychiatry. However, a review of available evidence indicates a remarkable consistency between these views and current data from experimental psychopathology and cognitive neuroscience. This consistency is especially pronounced in the area of schizophrenia. In addition, there is a convergence of cognitive and neurobiological evidence regarding the validity of early Gestalt views of both normal brain-behavior relationships and disordered ones, as in schizophrenia. This article reviews some contributions of Gestalt psychology regarding schizophrenia and examines these views in light of more recent findings from cognitive psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and experimental psychopathology. We conclude that Gestalt theory is a viable theoretical framework from which to understand schizophrenia. Specifically, it appears that a breakdown of Gestalt organizational processes may characterize both the cognitive and the brain processes in schizophrenia.\n      </p>", "Vygotsky's investigations on art in the early part of his career prepared the way for his discovery of the semiotic-historical dimension of psychological development. The \"Psychology of Art\" was a pioneer work in the field of art psychology, exploring issues such as the role of emotion in art, the nature of aesthetic experience, the semiotic nature of psychological processes, and the foundations of a Marxist psychology and a Marxist aesthetics. Central to the elaboration of Vygotsky's ideas was his dialogue with, and criticism of, Russian formalism. In this respect, his ideas on art psychology have many points of contact with the criticism of the formal method in literary studies by Bakhtin.\n      </p>", "The importance of the problem of how to integrate psychology and methodology was rediscovered by Oswald K\u00fclpe. He noted that Wundt's psychology was inadequate and that a new methodology was needed to construct an alternative. K\u00fclpe made real progress but his program turned out to be quite difficult: he had no appropriate method for integrating the two fields. August Messer tried to fill the gap but failed. The problem was largely dropped due to poor methods at hand for studying it but remained important due to Popper's methodology and de Groot's psychology at least. We may now more effectively return to it by using a bootstrap method.\n      </p>", "Although a number of political psychologists are active in Canada, there has been relatively little self-conscious development of the field. This article brings together contributions from political science and social psychology in Canada in an attempt to identify aspects of Canadian distinctiveness in the field of political psychology, notably the balance between mainstream and eclectic tendencies.\n      </p>", "Around the 1960s, political psychology was developed as a field of knowledge that attempted to interrelate scientific psychology and political phenomena. However, social and academic conditions are very different today. More and more, political psychology is becoming a protagonist, as much in the internal context of psychology as in the external context of its relations with the social world. Thus, political psychology can now be seen as a resource relating psychological knowledge to social practice, and relating psychological processes to social action. Political psychology is the interface that puts psychology and society in contact. The development of political psychology in Spain provides an example of this alternative view of the field.\n      </p>", "Political psychology may be legitimately developed as a \"social aesthetic.\" Its activities generate social forms, much as in the arts. While logic works within the confines of society's language, aesthetic forms work with its sensibility, in the understanding that significance lies within the unitary wholes. In this sense, political psychology cannot be separated from psychology in general. In both cases we participate in the generation of form. However, because these forms enter society in significant ways, reflexive attention must be given to what it is we create. Mechanical forms, which are common to the field and to society generally, contribute to a condition of social alienation; in contrast, the form of a game is more closely related to the spontaneous creation of community.\n      </p>", "In July and August 1991, the Ohio State University hosted the first annual Summer Institute in Political Psychology. This program brought 57 scholars (including graduate students, faculty, and professionals) to Ohio State University to study theory and methods for examining the psychological processes involved in political phenomena and political influences on psychological processes. Their one-month intensive training included lectures in basic psychology, basic political science, research techniques, and approaches for successful integration of political science and psychology. Lecturers included faculty from OSU and nearby universities, as well as guest specialists from across the country. Formal and informal evaluations indicated that the institute achieved a variety of its goals and that participants considered it to be a stimulating learning experience. Currently, plans are in place to offer the institute for the next several summers.\n      </p>", "Psychological and cognitive schemas when making decisions within the problem-solving process influence participant behavior.

Further, the course concepts associated with instructors' views of social psychology are characteristically modified by influences of the institutional context. Typical course contents answering to various course concepts are described, with particular attention to styles of content coverage within certain distinctively sociological concepts of the course.\n      </p>", "Recent interest and inquiry into constructivism, pedagogical content knowledge, and case study methodology are influencing the content and goals of educational psychology in teacher preparation. The reasons seem clear: The content of educational psychology lends itself to authentic, active, and pragmatic applications of theory to school practices, as well as to investigations of a variety of educational issues, perspectives, and contexts which can be viewed through case study, a constructivist problem-based approach to learning. Widely-used educational psychology texts are including constructivism as a cognitive alternative to behaviorist and information processing views of teaching and learning. Concurrently, case studies are being integrated in educational psychology texts, and a myriad of case texts have appeared with application to educational psychology courses. This article considers the decisions, benefits, and difficulties in teaching educational psychology through a constructivist case study approach.\n      </p>", "The University of Minnesota now offers a Ph.D. minor in Political Psychology.

Courses labeled \"political psychology\" are of relatively recent vintage and are offered most often in political science departments. They generally do not cover the entire field, but focus on one of three major areas: mass political behavior, personality and politics, or the psychology of international relations. Most major political science departments now offer courses in political psychology, though a critical mass of faculty exists in only about 14 universities. Seven formalized doctoral training programs exist with multiple courses and faculty, most quite recent in origin and most are distinctly interdisciplinary. Doctoral studies in political science or psychology can specialize in political psychology, but no free-standing interdisciplinary degree programs currently exist.\n      </p>", "The emerging interface between computer technology and cognitive psychology for performance assessment in science education is explored. Cognitive theories of learning offer promises to transform computer technology from a test administration tool into a process assessment tool, and computer technology offers a medium for studying the cognitive processes of learning. Interface theories and interface technologies are briefly discussed. The technology-psychology interface may be a base for building an alternative assessment technology. Some prototype projects in this line of inquiry are presented. As in any other novel approaches to testing, there are several questions that need to be answered in establishing the role of the technology-psychology interface in performance assessment.\n      </p>", "Psychology occupies a peculiar place among the sciences, suspended between methodological orientations derived from the physical and biological sciences and a subject matter that extends into the social and human sciences. This article traces the history of psychology from the late nineteenth century to the end of the twentieth century. Early in the field's history, psychologists distanced themselves from spiritualists and psychical researchers and embraced empirical methods of natural science. In the twentieth century, schools of thought-psychoanalysis, behaviorism, Gestalt, cognitive, operationalist, and neo-behaviorist-diverged within the field. Government programs during World War II and public visibility helped to shape the field. Academics and practitioners of the various schools agreed on the importance of scientific methods of research and experimentation. Given the century-long struggle for scientific and professional autonomy and authority, psychology today is diffuse and widespread.\n      </p>", "Israeli political psychology has been preoccupied with the particular problems of the Israeli society. The Israeli-Arab conflict, Jewish-Palestinian relations, and intrasocietal conflicts draw special attention. In addition, Israeli researchers contribute to various general areas of political psychology not related to specific problems of Israel.\n      </p>", "This paper assesses the progress of political psychology as a distinct field in U.S. educational institutions as indexed by course offerings for undergraduates in the area. Using a mail questionnaire to faculty with interests in political psychology, we identified 100 courses from 78 different institutions across the United States and Canada which can be broadly defined as political psychology. About half of these courses are given at least yearly. In total, political psychology is taught to approximately 2300 undergraduates each year. About half of these courses are explicitly labeled as \"political psychology\"; in them, the dominant tendency is to cover, at least in some measure, most of the major topics of the field. The majority of courses are being offered by political science departments; a minority are offered by psychology departments. Steady growth in the number of undergraduate courses in political psychology has occurred since the early 1970s and continues today.\n      </p>", "Psychology since World War II has been largely devoted to repairing weakness and understanding suffering. Towards that end, we have made considerable gains. We have a classification of mental illness that allows international collaboration, and through this collaboration we have developed effective psychotherapeutic or pharmacological treatments for 14 major mental disorders. However, while building a strong science and practice of treating mental illness, we largely forgot about everyday well-being. Is the absence of mental illness and suffering sufficient to let individuals and communities flourish? Were all disabling conditions to disappear, what would make life worth living? Those committed to a science of positive psychology can draw on the effective research methods developed to understand and treat mental illness. Results from a new randomized, placebo-controlled study demonstrate that people are happier and less depressed three months after completing exercises targeting positive emotion. The ultimate goal of positive psychology is to make people happier by understanding and building positive emotion, gratification and meaning. Towards this end, we must supplement what we know about treating illness and repairing damage with knowledge about nurturing well-being in individuals and communities.\n      </p>", "Until ca. 2000, information security was seen as a technological discipline, based on computer science but with mathematics helping in the design of ciphers and protocols. That perspective started to change as researchers and practitioners realized the importance of economics. As distributed systems are increasingly composed of machines that belong to principals with divergent interests, incentives are becoming as important to dependability as technical design. A thriving new field of information security economics provides valuable insights not just into ' security' topics such as privacy, bugs, spam and phishing, but into more general areas of system dependability and policy. This research programme has recently started to interact with psychology. One thread is in response to phishing, the most rapidly growing form of online crime, in which fraudsters trick people into giving their credentials to bogus websites; a second is through the increasing importance of security usability; and a third comes through the psychology-and-economics tradition. The promise of this multidisciplinary research programme is a novel framework for analysing information security problems\u2014one that is both principled and effective.\n      </p>", "The human face communicates an impressive number of visual signals. Although adults ratings of facial attractiveness are consistent across studies, even cross-culturally, there has been considerable controversy surrounding attempts to identify the facial features that cause faces to be judged attractive or unattractive. Studies of physical attractiveness have attempted to identify the features that contribute to attractiveness by studying the relationships between attractiveness and (a) symmetry, (b) averageness, and (c) nonaverage sexually dismorphic features (hormone markers). Evolutionary psychology proposes that these characteristics all pertain to health, suggesting that humans have evolved to view certain features as attractive because they were dispayed by healthy individuals. However, the question remains how single features that are considered attractive relate to each other, and if they form a signle ornament that signals mate quality. Moreover, some researchers have recently explained attractiveness preferences in terms of individual differences that are predictable. This article briefly describes what is currently known from attractiveness research, reviews some recent advances, and suggests areas for future researchers' attention.\n      </p>", "This paper asks whether: (1) psychology of religion is doing what it is supposed to do, (2) the contemporary psychological attention to religion and spirituality is perhaps of a transgressive nature, and (3) conceptualizations of spirituality in psychological publications are biased. It makes a plea for phenomenologically well-informed research on real forms of religion and spirituality, from a perspective that is as broad as psychology at present has become, with due regard for both the cultural make-up of the phenomena and the unavoidable limits of psychologists' professional competence.\n      </p>", "Early Muslims wrote extensively about human nature and called it Ilm-al Nafsiat or self-knowledge. In many cases, their works seem to be the original ideas for many modern day psychological theories and practices. What is interesting however is that a lot of what the early scholars wrote was blended with Islamic philosophy and religious ideas. This paper covers major contributions of prominent early Muslim scholars to psychology and outlines the challenges faced by today's Muslims in adapting to the Western theories. It also offers a few recommendations on the indigenization of psychology for Muslim societies interested in seeking the Islamic perspective on human behaviors.\n      </p>", "We report the results of an archival study of group research published in three organizational psychology journals (Journal of Applied Psychology, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, and Academy of Management Journal) from 1975 through 1994. Moreland, Hogg, and Hains (1994), in a review of three social psychology journals (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, and Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin), suggested there is an increasing enthusiasm for the social psychological study of groups. However, their data indicated that enthusiasm for group research in social psychology may be primarily due to the popularity of one category, intergroup relations. We tested the proposal that research traditionally viewed as intragroup (e.g., group performance) has been taken up by organizational psychologists. Our data support this contention, as the publication pattern for intragroup research topics in the three organizational journals was an inverse of that reported by Moreland et al. Results are discussed in terms of historical and interdisciplinary trends within psychology.\n      </p>", "The social psychology of William McDougall (1871-1938) was once widely influential but now is little referenced, his own writings being eclipsed especially by Freud's few pages of commentary in Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego (1922). Indeed, in some respects his work is best forgotten. This applies particularly to his advocacy of \"Nordic\" superiority, but also probably extends to certain less incendiary issues like his Lamarckism and his several attempts to provide an exhaustive listing of human instincts, which now seems little more than an inventive ad hocary. At least one aspect of his work, however, the importance of which was never fully appreciated, deserves to be recalled. McDougall is entitled to be considered a founding theorist of the modern doctrine of democratic elitism. In this distinct regard, McDougall's work cannot be dismissed as antiquated. Rather, it contributes to what is still the dominant view of contemporary democracy.\n      </p>", "The purpose of this study was to integrate constructs from positive psychology with constructs from motivation theories that have received most of the attention in studies of academic motivation. Achievement goals, expectancy beliefs, and value were predictive of the positive psychology variables. Task goals were associated positively with optimism and with invitations, whereas performance-avoid goals were associated negatively with optimism and perceived authenticity. Expectancy and value constructs were associated positively with optimism, perceived authenticity, and invitations. Positive psychology variables were stronger in high-achieving students than in low-achieving students; boys had stronger perceived authenticity than girls did. Findings indicate that constructs drawn from positive psychology can help explain academic motivation and achievement.\n      </p>", "Muchos textos de psicolog\u00eda social consideran que esta disciplina es una rama de la psicolog\u00eda. Sin embargo, un an\u00e1lisis de sus or\u00edgenes y evoluci\u00f3n demuestra que la psicolog\u00eda social se origin\u00f3 tanto en la psicolog\u00eda como en la sociolog\u00eda. Inicialmente, durante las primeras d\u00e9cadas del siglo xx, fueron m\u00e1s los textos de psicolog\u00eda social escritos por soci\u00f3logos que por psic\u00f3logos, si bien con el transcurrir del tiempo la tendencia se ha ido invirtiendo. Este cambio de orientaci\u00f3n tiene una explicaci\u00f3n en la influencia que ejerci\u00f3 en el desarrollo de la disciplina la publicaci\u00f3n, en 1924, del libro de Floyd Allport Social psychology. Asimismo, a partir de los a\u00f1os treinta, el declinar de la Escuela de Chicago dentro de la propia sociolog\u00eda y el auge del funcionalismo fueron otros de los motivos del menor peso de una perspectiva sociol\u00f3gica en el desarrollo de la psicolog\u00eda social. El an\u00e1lisis hist\u00f3rico de esta \u00e1rea de conocimiento revela que tenemos que diferenciar entre una psicolog\u00eda social psicol\u00f3gica y una psicolog\u00eda social sociol\u00f3gica. /// There are many textbooks in which social psychology is considered a branch of psychology. An analysis of the origins and evolution of social psychology shows us that it emerged within psychology and sociology alike. Initially, during the early decades of the 20th century, there were more social psychology texts written by sociologists than by psychologists, but this tendency has gradually inverted throughout the decades that followed up until the present. This change was influenced by Floyd Allport with the publication of his Social psychology in 1924. On the other hand, the decline of the Chicago School during the 1930s within psychology itself and the increasing importance of functionalism within sociology, were also responsible for the decline of a sociological perspective within social psychology. The historical analysis of this field reveals that we have to differentiate at least between a psychological and a sociological social psychology.\n      </p>", "The ideas of cultural-historical psychology have led to a new understanding of the human psyche as developing in the process of the subject acting in social and historical contexts. Such a \"non-classical\" reinterpretation of psychological concepts should be based on a theoretical and philosophical framework in order to explain genetic sources of these concepts. For this purpose, Il'enkov's philosophy is of great significance. This is illustrated by discussing a possible cultural-historical understanding of the concept of intelligence.\n      </p>", "This paper suggests that self-categories provide the basis for political action, that those who wish to organize political activity do so through the ways in which they construct self-categories, and that political domination may be achieved through reifying social categories and therefore denying alternative ways of social being. Hence, the way in which social psychology approaches the matter of self-categorization provides a touchstone for its politics. To the extent that we too take categories for granted, we are in danger of supporting conservative and undemocratic politics. The only way to eschew tendencies toward reification within social psychology is to add a historical dimension to our own analysis of self-categorical processes.\n      </p>", "The social and political implications of abnormal psychology are examined. Four different approaches are conceptualized in terms of the effects attributed to societal factors in the etiology and treatment of psychopathology. The political repercussions of the asocial approach, whose main constituents are the medical, psychodynamic, and cognitive models, would appear to be markedly conservative. Ambiguous political messages can be derived from the microsocial approach, represented here by family therapy and theories of labeling. A clearly progressive, though somewhat contained, statement is made by community psychology, prevention, and the ecological model in the macrosocial approach. Desiderata for a paradigm that would vivify dormant seeds of political activism in community psychology are outlined in the macro-sociopolitical approach. It is argued that if community psychology is to be more effective, a transition from its macrosocial perspective to a macro-sociopolitical world view is to occur.\n      </p>", "This paper is a conceptual analysis of the theory debate in psychology, as carried out by cognitivists and radical behaviorists. The debate has focused on the necessity of theories in psychology. However, the logically primary issue is the nature of theories, or what theories are. This claim stems from the fact that cognitivists and radical behaviorists adopt disparate accounts of the nature of theories. The cognitivists' account is closely akin to the received view from logical positivism, where theories are collections of statements and theoretical terms are restricted to designate unobservable entities. Radical behaviorists also conceive theories as collections of statements, but restrict theoretical terms in psychology to designate observable entities. If each side approaches the necessity issue with its preferred account, both agree that theories are necessary in psychology. Hence, there is no disagreement over the necessity of theories in psychology per se, only over the nature of theories. The received view, however, has been shown to suffer from irreparable difficulties that have led to its total rejection in post-positivistic philosophy of science. Alternative accounts, like the structuralist and semantic views, do not raise the issue of whether theories are necessary in psychology.\n      </p>", "J. F. Brown was one of the first Americans to study under Lewin in Germany. His 1936 textbook in social psychology was an attempt to integrate the ideas of Lewin, Freud, and Marx. Brown's central theme was that psychology was only valid when it was considered within a sociopolitical context. He therefore went beyond Lewin's interactional model to include objective social conditions in the Marxist tradition. Brown's Marxism was also wedded to the Soviet version, and he saw Russia in the 1930s as the ideal sociopolitical system. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate Brown's contributions to political psychology.\n      </p>", "The evolution of behaviorism from its explicit beginning with John B. Watson's declaration in 1913 to the behaviorisms of the present is considered briefly. Contributions of behaviorism to scientific psychology then and now are critically assessed, arriving at the conclusion that regardless of whether or not its opponents and proponents are aware, the essential points of behaviorism have now been absorbed into all of scientific psychology. It will assist the progress of the science of psychology if its focus now shifts away from incessant relivings of outdated argumentation to empirical discovery and theory construction based on those discoveries.\n      </p>", "More than 40 years ago, psychologist\u2013historian Robert Watson argued that the study of history was of particular salience to psychology. In this article we explore the relationship between psychology and history and argue that the psychologist\u2013historian plays a vital role in the discipline of psychology. We provide a brief overview of the emergence of the history of psychology as a professional subdiscipline, describe who psychologist\u2013historians are, explain why they are needed, and detail how to join their ranks. We argue that increasing historical sophistication among psychologists will have beneficial effects on research and teaching, and we invite all psychologists to participate in the making of psychology's history.\n      </p>", "The boundary between psychology and religion is at its murkiest around topics of interest to both forms of discourse. An attempt to clarify some of the boundary issues specifically present in discussions of self-control or self-regulation, this paper begins by examining self-control in healthy psychological functioning. Research on feedback loops, information processing and ego depletion have highlighted key psychological mechanisms involved in self-control. Next this paper explores common themes in religious perspectives regarding the virtue of self-control and self-restraint. A clear preoccupation of major religious traditions is the management of human passion and desire. In conclusion, three boundary concerns relevant to both psychology and religion are discussed: the meaning of virtue, differences in defining the self in self-control, and relational concerns important to understanding self-control.\n      </p>", "Human geographers' research into lay responses to burgeoning environmental issues has highlighted their mediated and contingent constitution. Situated within the discipline's cultural turn, this work has challenged prevailing informational and cognitive approaches to sustainability. In doing so, however, potentially informative concepts and findings from environmental psychology have been sidelined. In this paper I attempt a modest allying of the two sub-disciplines, outlining their differences and similarities, and arguing that environmental psychology can triangulate with human geography, as well as challenge tendencies within human geography literatures to simplify the 'psychological' subject.\n      </p>", "Both Freud's psychoanalysis and the tradition of mass psychology can be traced back to their common roots: in the famous debate on the nature and causes of hypnotic suggestion, which raged between Charcot and Bernheim when Freud visited Paris in 1885/6 and 1889. This paper shows that mass movements were particularly prominent in these years, and that attempts were being made to understand them in terms of hypnosis and/or suggestion. If further shows how the first overall study on this subject was subsequently published in Italy by Sighele, and by what route these ideas returned to France and Le Bon. Freud took the latter's emphasis on the prestige of the leader and the unconscious of the followers as the starting point for his own approach. But he also included some of Trotter's ideas on the herd instinct and some of McDougall's on the group mind. According to Freud, the mass showed a revival of both the oedipal conflict and that of the primal horde. The paper argues that the entire imagery of the hated/beloved father/leader as the key to group cohesion had obvious parallels in the political events of those days. The disintegration of the multinational empires of central and eastern Europe toward the end of the First World War and immediately thereafter was closely linked to the disappearance of the major state leaders. Even the falling apart of Austria-Hungary and the death of Franz Joseph can be seen as a variation on the theme of parricide by a fraternity.\n      </p>", "How do small-brained, highly mobile animals like birds so readily perceive the visual world? Despite the computational complexity of vision, recent behavioral tests have suggested that these evolutionarily distant animals may use visual mechanisms that operate in the same manner as the visual mechanisms of primates. This article reviews new evidence regarding the processes of early vision and object perception in pigeons and considers speculations about the similarities and differences between avian and primate visual cognition.\n      </p>", "I suggest a pluralistic account of folk psychology according to which not all predictions or explanations rely on the attribution of mental states, and not all intentional actions are explained by mental states. This view of folk psychology is supported by research in developmental and social psychology. It is well known that people use personality traits to predict behavior. I argue that trait attribution is not shorthand for mental state attributions, since traits are not identical to beliefs or desires, and an understanding of belief or desire is not necessary for using trait attributions. In addition, we sometimes predict and explain behavior through appeal to personality traits that the target wouldn't endorse, and so could not serve as the target's reasons. I conclude by suggesting that our folk psychology includes the notion that some behavior is explained by personality traits\u2014who the person is\u2014rather than by beliefs and desires\u2014what the person thinks. Consequences of this view for the debate between simulation theory and theory theory, as well as the debate on chimpanzee theory of mind are discussed.\n      </p>", "In this essay we introduce the idea of an epistemic triangle, with factual, theoretical, and conceptual investigations at its vertices, and argue that whereas scientific progress requires a balance among the three types of investigations, psychology's epistemic triangle is stretched disproportionately in the direction of factual investigations. Expressed by a variety of different problems, this unbalance may be created by a main operative theme\u2014the obsession of psychology with a narrow and mechanical view of the scientific method and a misguided aversion to conceptual inquiries. Hence, to redress psychology's epistemic triangle, a broader and more realistic conception of method is needed and, in particular, conceptual investigations must be promoted. Using examples from different research domains, we describe the nature of conceptual investigations, relate them to theoretical investigations, and illustrate their purposes, forms, and limitations.\n      </p>", "Several philosophers have recently claimed to have discovered a new and rather significant problem with virtue ethics. According to them, virtue ethics generates certain expectations about the behavior of human beings which are subject to empirical testing. But when the relevant experimental work is done in social psychology, the results fall remarkably short of meeting those expectations. So, these philosophers think, despite its recent success, virtue ethics has far less to offer to contemporary ethical theory than might have been initially thought. I argue that there are plausible ways in which virtue ethicists can resist arguments based on empirical work in social psychology. In the first three sections of the paper, I reconstruct the line of reasoning being used against virtue ethics by looking at the recent work of Gilbert Harman and John Doris. The remainder of the paper is then devoted both to responding to their challenge as well as to briefly sketching a positive account of character trait possession.\n      </p>", "Although scientific study of psychology at the university level in India began as early as 1920, significant research in industrial psychology started only in the post-Independence period. Notwithstanding this late beginning, of the various possible applications of psychological science to human affairs, industrial psychology research in India has been the most vigorous and fruitful. The author in this paper traces the growth of research in industrial psychology during the years 1920-1967. He bases his analysis on the 156 research publications in the subject in 43 standard psychology journals in India and abroad. The paper relates in detail the history of this development through the pioneering efforts of scholars at a few university and research centres. It also mentions the models on which these scholars based their studies. The author has attempted to give an adequate understanding of the research effort in industrial psychology by tracing the development of teaching of psychology at Indian universities and the total quantum of research effort in psychology which comprises 1,959 publications. In fact, this analysis of the total psychological research effort in the country is useful for its own sake also. Of the three appendices, two give year-wise and area-wise publications in all branches of psychology and in industrial psychology only. The other appendix is a bibliography of the 156 papers in industrial psychology. At the end, the paper analyses the research trends in various sub-areas of industrial psychology and discusses the reasons for these, which lie not only in the training and laboratory facilities available to the Indian psychologist but also in the development of new needs in industry itself. The paper ends with a discussion of the role of industry and of the various research-sponsoring authorities in the development and utilisation of industrial psychology research. The author concludes by commenting on the social climate for industrial psychology research in India which, according to him, shall remain favourable so long as state policy continues to be one of ushering in social change with consent and without coercion.\n      </p>", "Based on the writer's 6 years of participant observation and consultation within a medical corporation, the group psychology of response to the threat of organization dissolution is described and interpreted. The dynamics of catastrophic reaction are explored, and the writer's role as facilitator of verbalization and expression of group anxiety is described. Grief-work at the group or cultural levels is viewed as essential to facilitate change that fosters higher levels of development and integration rather than regression and fixation on the past.\n      </p>", "Research on positive psychology demonstrates that specific individual dispositions are associated with more desirable outcomes. The relationship of positive psychological constructs, however, has not been applied to the areas of business ethics and social responsibility. Using four constructs in two independent studies (hope and gratitude in Study 1, spirituality and generativity in Study 2), the relationship of these constructs to sensitivity to corporate social performance (CSCSP) were assessed. Results indicate that all four constructs significantly predicted CSCSP, though only hope and gratitude interacted to impact CSCSP. Discussion focuses upon these findings, limitations of the study, and future avenues for research.\n      </p>", "In the past two decades, increasing attention has focused on the etiology and clinical manifestations of the narcissistic personality. This article reviews current concepts of the narcissistic personality, drawing special attention to the implications for political psychology. The decision-making of the narcissistic leader, especially crisis decision-making, is often impaired. The narcissistic leader has difficulty accepting criticism or new information, contributing to sycophantic advisory circles. Moreover, he may be overly optimistic concerning his possibility of success and underrate the adversary. The understanding of charismatic leader-follower relationships is enriched by understanding narcissistic transferences. Charismatic leaders often manifest the \"mirror-hungry\" personality, which is attractive to \"ideal-hungry\" personalities. The impact of the life cycle of the narcissistic leader is also explored, drawing especial attention to the heroic myth and frustrated dreams of glory. Malignant narcissism, as exemplified by Saddam Hussein; narcissistic rage; and the cognition and belief systems of the narcissist are also examined.\n      </p>", "Psychology calls itself the science of behavior, and the American Psychological Association's current \"Decade of Behavior\" was intended to increase awareness and appreciation of this aspect of the science. Yet some psychological subdisciplines have never directly studied behavior, and studies on behavior are dwindling rapidly in other subdisciplines. We discuss the eclipse of behavior in personality and social psychology, in which direct observation of behavior has been increasingly supplanted by introspective self-reports, hypothetical scenarios, and questionnaire ratings. We advocate a renewed commitment to including direct observation of behavior whenever possible and in at least a healthy minority of research projects.\n      </p>", "Presuming Rayburn's (2006: Child &amp; Family Behavior Therapy, 28, 86-92) review of (Paloutzian and Park, 2005, Handbook of the psychology of religion and spirituality. New York: The Guilford Press) and sketching an alternative paradigm, this review focuses on the Handbook's virtual conflation of religion and spirituality; relates this conflation to the hegemony of Protestant theology in North American psychology of religion; highlights the Handbook's neglect of spirituality per se, which, if not inseparably linked with theism, is, nevertheless, related to the self-transcending, meaning-making dimension of the human mind, could provide an explanatory breakthrough in the field of the psychology of religion and of the social sciences overall; and sees Handbook's advocacy for a \"multilevel interdisciplinary paradigm\" as a regrettable acceptance of the failed, long-term strategy of the field of psychology in general.\n      </p>", "The effectiveness of an Introductory Psychology course module on racism was assessed using a short questionnaire immediately afterwards and then later at the end of the semester. Students of color were consistently more aware of the prevalence and manifestations of racism in U.S. society today, compared to White students. White students also appeared to exhibit self-serving biases related to ethnicity-based privileges. Reported attitude changes were not correlated with actual attitude changes, as assessed with this questionnaire. Overall, this course module was effective in changing the attitudes about racism in White students, yet its effect was limited. On the other hand, given the permanence of racist attitudes and beliefs, any measurable success in this context should be celebrated.\n      </p>", "Several recent attempts are surveyed in which psychologists have tried to apply their professional insights to the problem of reducing the risk of nuclear war. These include those directed at deep causes (the U.S.-Soviet relationship), intermediate causes (imperfect rationality of decision-makers) and, briefly, precipitating causes (effects of stress). In each case, little or no influence on the nuclear policy-making process can be discerned; U.S. foreign policy-makers charged with managing the risk of nuclear war operate virtually independently of psychology. In order to bring nuclear policy-making and psychological insights together, a phenomenological approach to nuclear crisis management is described, the central task of which is a systematic description of the evolution during crises of beliefs held by decision-makers about risk of nuclear war.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Teacher education students sometimes question the value of educational psychology courses even though educational psychology textbooks are primarily concerned with understanding and improving classroom teaching and learning. A survey of current educational psychology textbooks and instructors reveals that (a) most texts cover a wide variety of topics, (b) instructors rate most of these topics as important, (c) there are large variations in depth of coverage among texts, and (d) all texts contain numerous classroom applications. The questionable reputation of the educational psychology course may stem from its broad coverage. A dozen or more topics in one semester may decrease the probability that most students will achieve a solid grasp of any one topic, leaving students uncertain about the course's meaning and applicability. A proposed solution is to offer the introductory course as a two-semester sequence, with the second course offered as an elective.\n      </p>", "Didactics, meaning the systematic study of the instructional process, has a long tradition in many European countries. In Anglo-American literature, however, didactics is largely absent. Instead, it is often dealt with under the heading of educational psychology, curriculum theory or some other heading.

The practice of Scientology is rooted in the religious writings of its founder, L. Ron Hubbard. This paper will review the religious writings of L Ron Hubbard to understand Scientology's position on mental health. Method: This paper reviews four of the major religious books written by L Ron Hubbard, in addition to a comprehensive overview of Scientology compiled by Scientology staff. Results: Hubbard's theory of mind borrowed heavily from the earlier writings of Freud, until Hubbard's psychological theory extended to include a spiritual existence that goes beyond the material world. The goal of Hubbard's psychology and religion were to optimize the freedom of the individual, and he viewed psychiatry and psychology as inherently anti-spiritual and opposed to personal freedom and self-realization. Ultimately Hubbard presents a world view of potential nuclear world cataclysm, fueled by the geopolitical climate and mental health theories that dominated the mid 20th century. Conclusions: Hubbard's writings mirrored the times in which he lived. His views that mental health practices are inherently anti-religious, freedom-inhibiting, and brain damaging do not reflect the modern-day practices of mental health.\n      </p>", "The central virtue at issue in recent philosophical discussions of the empirical adequacy of virtue ethics has been the virtue of compassion. Opponents of virtue ethics such as Gilbert Harman and John Doris argue that experimental results from social psychology concerning helping behavior are best explained not by appealing to so-called 'global' character traits like compassion, but rather by appealing to external situational forces or, at best, to highly individualized 'local' character traits. In response, a number of philosophers have argued that virtue ethics can accommodate the empirical results in question. My own view is that neither side of this debate is looking in the right direction. For there is an impressive array of evidence from the social psychology literature which suggests that many people do possess one or more robust global character traits pertaining to helping others in need. But at the same time, such traits are noticeably different from a traditional virtue like compassion.\n      </p>", "Many African communities have appropriated the international practice of \u201cTruth and Reconciliation Commissions\u201d (TRCs) as a means to construct a shared sense of collective memory, identity, and purpose in the aftermath of violent conflict. In this paper, we consider alternative forms of collective memory practices that might better suit the task of reconciliation in postconflict West African communities. Drawing upon the theoretical perspective of cultural psychology, we first identify the conceptual foundations of canonical TRC practice in particular Christian traditions that valorize revelation, truth, confession, and forgiveness. We then propose alternative practices of collective memory that have conceptual foundations in local practices or traditions that recommend secrecy (Shaw 2000), directed forgetting (Cole 2001), and other forms of interpretative silence. Drawing upon the theoretical perspective of liberation psychology, we note the ways in which conventional TRC practice, by focusing attention on acts of wrongdoing within communities, can reproduce silence about broader political and economic injustices that produce ripe conditions for conflict. We then propose alternative practices of collective memory to illuminate the role that local elites and citizens of rich nations play in the ongoing reproduction of unjust postcolonial conditions that can lead to conflict situations within communities.\n      </p>", "This article proposes a merger of the systemic and largely cognitive concerns that informed most of Alexander George's contributions to political psychology in the years beginning with the 1970s with George's earlier, more holistic, preoccupation with individual psychology, as manifested in his classic study with Juliette George of Woodrow Wilson and Colonel House.

It could therefore be expected to build on knowledge acquired within the academic discipline of cognitive psychology. Our aim in this paper is to show how some recent developments in cognitive psychology can help interpret empirical results from mathematics education. In particular, we will be looking into the heuristics-and-biases research by Kahneman and Tversky, the alternative views by Gigerenzer et al., and the more recent dual-process theory that has come to play a central role in interpreting this research. We first introduce the relevant background from cognitive psychology and survey its connections to previous work in mathematics education; then we apply this theoretical framework for re-interpreting previously-published empirical data from mathematics education research. We conclude with a discussion of potential theoretical and practical benefits of such synthesis.\n      </p>", "Academic popularizers of the new field of evolutionary psychology make notable appeals to William James to bolster their doctrine. In particular, they cite James' remark that humans have all the \"impulses\" animals do and many more besides to shore up their claim that people's \"instincts\" account for their flexibility. This essay argues that these scholars misinterpret James on the instincts. Consciousness (which they find inscrutable) explains cognitive flexibility for James. The evolutionary psychologists' appeal to James is, therefore, unwarranted and, given the conditions relevant to the public and professional audiences they address, also ineffective as a rhetorical tool for enlisting new recruits.\n      </p>", "Cognitive science, evolutionary psychology, and dynamical systems theory have all been proposed as frameworks for linking the diverse subdisciplines of psychology with one another, and with other scientific disciplines. Traditional cognitive science focused on content-free general processing and deemphasized motivation. An evolutionary perspective emphasizes the centrality of motivational systems and the specificity of mechanisms designed to solve particular recurrent problems. The evolutionary perspective provides a set of broad general principles linking diverse behaviors in humans as well as other species. The dynamic approach seeks even broader principles, searching for emergent patterns in all complex systems, whether animate or inanimate. Natural selection is itself one such broad principle, as is the broader principle of self-organization, which helps explain dynamic equilibria found in groups of humans and in diverse species linked together within ecosystems. Proponents of the major contending interdisciplines will need to build more bridges if the dream of a unifying paradigm is to be realized. This review samples some of the reasons why evolutionary psychologists, dynamical systems theorists, and traditional cognitive scientists need one another.\n      </p>", "Educational psychology as a field of study has encountered a lack of distinction by overlapping with other fields of study or disciplines. Consequently, educational psychology continues to have difficulty claiming jurisdiction over bodies of research knowledge and has been encroached upon by other more crystallized disciplines. The purpose of this study is to examine the research literature published across top-ranked educational psychology journals to identify the common ground and current trends in research content and to identify those areas that can be reclaimed by the discipline as its own. Overall, 758 articles published in six journals from January 2003 through December 2007 were included in this study. A combination of statistics-based and linguistics-based methods were used to determine how frequently terms occur in the data and establishing a semantic network which created a probabilistic analysis of the co-occurrence of terms resulting in a constellation of terms showing the relationship and relative importance of the categories of terms. The results showed a consistency of research categories suggesting that in spite of reports to the contrary, there is a collective agreement among educational psychologists demonstrated by the empirical research in the field.\n      </p>", "Although research teaching literature suggests that social work students may have different research learning attributes than students in other disciplines, minimal data exist to support this view. This study compared the self-reported research anxiety, computer anxiety, and research orientations of 149 full-time graduate social work, psychology, and business students at a research university. Social work students reported more research and computer anxiety and generally believed that research was less important to their profession than students in the comparison groups.

In a mail survey, federal judges were randomly presented with one of four prototypical descriptions of I/O psychology expert witness testimony in civil age discrimination in employment litigation. Judges were found to be relatively unfamiliar with the field of I/O psychology, and few had previously heard or read the testimony of an I/O psychologist. Sixty-six percent of the federal judges rated themselves at least moderately likely to admit the expert's testimony at trial, regardless of the testimony scenario presented. Judges rated the evidence overall as relevant, moderately reliable, moderately probative, and prejudicial. Both judicial familiarity with the field of I/O psychology and prior experience with I/O testimony were found to be positively related to likelihood of admitting the evidence. Manipulations of the scientific foundation for the expert testimony did not substantially affect admission decision. Judges ascribed the most importance to the general acceptance Daubert factor in their evaluation of evidentiary reliability. Implications for the science and practice of I/O psychology in the legal system are presented and discussed.\n      </p>", "In order to assess the extent to which terminal master's level I/O programs were consistent with Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology (SIOP) guidelines, recent graduates of master's level I/O and related programs were surveyed. The survey focused on the competency areas emphasized in the SIOP (1994) guidelines: data collection and analysis competencies, core I/O competencies, and additional I/O competencies. Participants in the survey provided their perceptions of the coverage of the various competencies in graduate school as well as the importance of these competencies in their current jobs. The results of the survey show that current master's level programs are generally consistent with the guidelines. Both data collection/data analysis competencies and core I/O competencies were perceived as having been well covered. Further, these same competencies were for the most part seen as important in the participants' current jobs.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "We contribute to a greater understanding of political psychology by 1) collecting data in a more systematic way for the intellectual community, 2) sensitizing students to the extent to which any intellectual discipline is socially constructed and is a work in progress, 3) heightening awareness of the political aspects of intellectual life, 4) exposing readers to the wide variety of diverse approaches and methodologies utilized by political psychologists, and 5) suggesting the range of topics that political psychology can address successfully and the range of techniques it can utilize.\n      </p>", "This article advocates a discursive approach for examining political rhetoric. Such an approach is particularly useful for studying contemporary political ideology. The current political climate, especially in Britain, has been described as exemplifying a \"Third Way,\" which is said to have replaced the old ideological division between \"left\" and \"right\" by a consensual, non-ideological politics. The discursive approach allows the analyst to look at the continuing dilemmas of an ideology that denies its ideological character. In discursive analyses of interviews with 20 elected local officials in the Midlands of England, the respondents (regardless of party affiliation) tended to give accounts that celebrated the development of consensual, less ideologically divisive politics. These accounts, however, were dilemmatic: As the speakers told of social change, they also stressed their own personal stability, as if they themselves existed outside the previous political climate. They also explicitly distanced themselves from the language of \"left\" and \"right,\" but in this distancing a further ideological dilemma was detectable. All the local politicians were officially affiliated to a political party. In discursively subtle ways, the speakers used the left/right continuum as they distinguished between the parties, thereby showing the sort of variability that discursive theorists have noted in other contexts. The implications of such findings and of the discursive approach to studying ideology are discussed in relation to the possibilities for developing a critical political psychology.\n      </p>", "Radical behaviorism is fundamentally different from traditional psychology, so it is not surprising that is has been widely misunderstood. It offers an alternative to the traditional treatments of mind that avoids some of the insoluble problems raised by those views. B. F. Skinner attempted many times to describe this alternative with limited success, partially attributable to the opacity of his prose and the excessiveness of his proposed applications. We offer annotated excerpts from one of his books dedicated to this end in an effort to show how his approach deals with topics usually viewed as \"cognitive psychology.\" While modern radical behaviorism has progressed beyond Skinner's conception in important ways, his writings remain instructive.\n      </p>", "Economics has typically been the social science of choice to inform public policy and policymakers. In the current paper we contemplate the role behavioral science can play in enlightening policymakers. In particular, we provide some examples of research that has and can be used to inform policy, reflect on the kind of behavioral science that is important for policy, and approaches for convincing policy-makers to listen to behavioral scientists. We suggest that policymakers are unlikely to invest the time translating behavioral research into its policy implications, and researchers interested in influencing public policy must therefore invest substantial effort, and direct that effort differently than in standard research practices.\n      </p>", "This paper examines the ethical status of animals and nature within the thought of Mary Whiton Calkins. Though Calkins held that her self-psychology and absolute personalistic idealism were compatible in many ways, the two schools of thought offer different conceptions of personhood with respect to animals and nature. On the one hand, Calkinss self-psychology classified animals and nature as non-persons, due to the fact that self-psychology viewed animals and nature as physical entities bereft of the psychical qualities necessary for personhood. On the other hand, Calkinss absolute personalistic idealism classified animals and nature as persons, due to the absolute personalistic idealist understanding of the universe as ultimately mental and personal. Because Calkinss ethics requires the ethical individual to will for the benefit of all human beings, an ethics that adopts Calkinss psychological conception of personhood promotes an anthropocentrism that views animals and nature as possessing merely instrumental value, while an ethics that adopts Calkins's philosophical conception of personhood views animals and nature as possessing intrinsic value.\n      </p>", "The paper first discusses the metaphysical framework that allows the soul's integration into the physical world. A close examination of B36, supported by the comparative evidence of some other early theories of the soul, suggests that the word psuch\u00ea could function as both a mass term and a count noun for Heraclitus. There is a stuff in the world, alongside other physical elements, that manifests mental functions. Humans, and possibly other beings, show mental functions in so far as they have a portion of that stuff. Turning to the physical characterization of the soul, the paper argues that B36 is entirely consistent with the ancient testimonies that say that psuch\u00ea for Heraclitus is exhalation. But exhalations cover all states of matter from the lowest moist part of atmospheric air to the fire of celestial bodies. If so, psuch\u00ea for Heraclitus is both air and fire. The fact that psuch\u00ea can manifest the whole range of physical properties along the dry-wet axis guarantees that souls can show different intellectual and ethical properties as well. Moreover, Sextus Empiricus, supported by some other sources, provides us with an answer how portions of soul stuff are individuated into individual souls. The paper closes with a brief discussion of the question whether, and if so with what qualifications, we can apply the term 'physicalism' to Presocratic theories of the soul.\n      </p>", "The 2008 Presidential Address presents the theory of ethical perspective, an identity theory of moral psychology designed to detect the psychological influences on moral choice. Part 1 treats findings on altruism and genocide as an analytical lens through which we can gain insight into political and moral behavior. Part 2 describes moral psychology as a field, presenting a new and broader conceptualization for the discipline. Part 3 outlines an identity theory of moral choice that focuses on the critical role of the ethical perspective, to suggest how an empirically based theory of moral choice looks in practice. Part 4 concentrates on the basic assumptions underlying the theory of ethical perspective. It presents empirical evidence that supports this theoretical framework, from fields as diverse as neuroscience and primatology to child development and linguistics, thus demonstrating political psychology's important links to other disciplines. In addition to presenting a new theory of moral psychology, designed to fill an important gap in the literature on ethics and moral choice, the Address treats studies of altruism and genocide as an illustration of research that reveals broader insight into the nature of political psychology as a discipline.\n      </p>", "Opponents of cosmopolitanism often dismiss the position on the grounds that cosmopolitan proposals are completely unrealistic and that they fly in the face of our human nature. We have deep psychological needs that are satisfied by national identification and so all cosmopolitan projects are doomed, or so it is argued. In this essay we examine the psychological grounds claimed to support the importance of nationalism to our wellbeing. We argue that the alleged human needs that nationalism is said to satisfy are: (i) either more complex than initially one might think or (ii) do not necessarily provide very strong grounds for the theses advocated by nationalists or (iii) can be well met in alternate ways than through national identification. Moreover, commitment to cosmopolitanism is not antithetical to meeting these needs: rather, more cosmopolitan worldviews can do quite well in meeting the needs of interest. Moreover, we argue that since nationalism is a fluid and socially constructed phenomenon, quite open to the influence of other factors, the current evidence suggests that central aspects of cosmopolitanism are quite feasible and realistic.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/>
