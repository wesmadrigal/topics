{"total_words": 904, "documents": ["The authors examined the effects of positive interdependence vs. no interdependence on students' academic achievement. Participants included 151 U.S. college students who took weekly electronic quizzes on which they could interact with group mates in a chat room. In the positive interdependence condition, 1 member was chosen at random, and his or her score was given to all members of the group. In the no-interdependence condition, each group member received his or her own score on each quiz. Achievement was measured by biweekly examinations that students took by themselves and that produced their own independent scores. Students in the positive-interdependence condition engaged in significantly more interaction and more promotive interaction while taking the electronic quizzes and achieved higher scores on the subsequent examinations taken individually.\n      </p>", "Some competitions involve teams comprising different numbers of players. For informal games, such as the popular 'pub quiz', we argue that teams with fewer players are at a disadvantage. This paper investigates the properties of these games and develops several methods for allocating handicaps within such competitions, so that the competitions may be considered fair, based on a simple Bernoulli model for correctly answering questions and assuming exchangeability of participants. We recommend a natural conjugate prior subjective handicapping rule; with this rule handicaps may be set beforehand given the judgement of the quiz setter regarding the difficulty of the questions. We also describe a posterior rule that provides improved accuracy but is calculated after the quiz is complete. Finally, the paper considers modifications of the proposed rules to cope with multiple-choice questions and progressive quizzes.\n      </p>", "Quiz questions can be very effective teachers. They may condition students to study in particular ways, to attend to some types of information and to ignore others, and they may determine how the student processes information. Basic reinforcement theory holds that rewarded behavior is repeated while unrewarded behavior is extinguished. Successful test performance is a powerful reward for specific study techniques; and students, consciously or unconsciously, adapt their study techniques to fit any patterns in requirements of test questions. It has been demonstrated in several studies that frequent quizzes improve final test performance. But it has also been demonstrated that students identify very subtle patterns in test questions and focus their study efforts according to these patterns. A teacher could presumably use this phenomena to insure that students will notice pre-defined classes of information, or by unintentional patterns in questions, may motivate students to memorize inert and useless data. There is some evidence that quiz questions can be used to induce reasoning about information and discovery of unstated implications of particular kinds. Two studies have demonstrated that when a particular type of reasoning is required in a series of quizzes, students improve in their ability to solve similar problems on subsequent tests. Several general rules for designing constructive quizzes may be extracted from these data. Frequent quizzes of appropriate difficulty for individuals can be constructed by identifying a particular type of information or reasoning to be learned. Questions can be written which consistently require students to use the desired knowledge or skill and the questions may be segmented into a series of quizzes to produce a desired type of study. Since any quiz may affect study habits, teachers must insure that their quizzes have positive effects.\n      </p>", "213 eighth grade students were randomly assigned within eight classrooms to one of two treatment groups. Group F took eight weekly quizzes requiring students to recall stated facts, while Group I took weekly quizzes requiring students to draw inferences about political interests of several religious, economic and geographic groups. Four tests were administered at the end of this treatment period. No between-treatment differences were found in ability to recall Random Facts or Inference-Related Facts. Group I scored significantly higher than Group F on a test requiring new inferences about treatment interest groups. There were no differences in scores on a test requiring inferences about an entirely new subject.\n      </p>", "Three groups of college students were given instructions using different testing techniques to determine whether the superior performance obtained with Programmed Student Achievement (PA) was due to a Hawthorne Effect. PA students, operating under the consequence of failing the course if they failed to evidence criterion performance (100% mastery) on weekly quizzes, exhibited superior performance, relative to control groups, on the weekly quizzes and on an unannounced retention test.

However, researchers know much less about how collaborative learning groups may influence student behavior and the extent to which their utility extends to testing as well as projects and papers. In an effort to address these gaps, we used quasi-experimental and survey data to examine the effects of collaborative testing on Introduction to Sociology students' learning, behavior, and attitudes. Findings indicate that collaborative testing improved students' behavior and attitudes. In comparison to a control group, students who participated in collaborative testing reported completing more of their assigned readings and had improved attitudes toward their learning, the testing process, and sociology.\n      </p>", "College students operated under different contingencies in the same classroom. The Programmed Achievement (PA) condition required students to evidence criterion performance (100% mastery) on 12 Chapter quizzes. Failure to evidence mastery performance on any of the quizzes resulted in the loss of a letter grade off the final course grade. The control condition involved a more traditional college classroom structure where students took chapter quizzes with no requirement to evidence mastery. A third group of low achievement students, identified at midterm, operated under control conditions the first half of the semester and were subsequently shifted to the PA contingency the second half of the semester. The results revealed only a slight superiority for PA students over controls and both PA and Control students demonstrated significantly better performance when compared to that of low achievement students prior to midterm. However, following the PA shift these subjects evidenced performance equivalent to that of the other two groups. Procedural and theoretical implications of these data were discussed.\n      </p>", "The study compared the effects of daily assessment and response cards on average weekly quiz scores in an introduction to applied behavior analysis course. An alternating treatments design (Kazdin 1982, Single-case research designs. New York: Oxford University Press; Cooper et al. 2007, Applied behavior analysis. Upper Saddle River: Merrill/Prentice Hall) was used to analyze the effects of response cards and daily assessment on average weekly quiz scores. Differential treatment effects were found between the daily assessment and response card conditions. When compared to baseline, students' consistently earned higher quiz scores on end of week quizzes in the daily assessment condition. Response cards produced mixed results. More substantial effects were revealed when analyzing individual student performance. In some cases, twice as many students earned 90% or better when either response cards or daily assessment were used compared to baseline. We discuss the implications of these results for other content areas and student demographics.\n      </p>", "Educators in large-enrollment courses are faced with the challenge of effectively disseminating information to their students to ensure that they learn the content provided. A related issue involves the means by which instructors evaluate student performance. Offering effective forms of performance feedback may be one technique to provide students with additional information to facilitate learning. Accordingly, the purpose of this investigation was to determine the effects of elaborate feedback and basic feedback on student performance. Two groups from an introductory psychology course participated in the current study. The Basic Feedback Group (N = 108) received basic feedback on all quizzes. The Elaborate Feedback Group (N = 102) received elaborate feedback on all quizzes. Response accuracy and learning gain were evaluated between groups. Visual analyses demonstrated the relative effectiveness of elaborate feedback on subsequent student performance. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses revealed that elaborate feedback was beneficial in general and particularly for questions that were determined to be difficult by item analyses. Results and implications are discussed in further detail.\n      </p>", "A type of mastery learning was implemented in a sophomore-level genetics major course, using a Blackboard course shell and a premade course cartridge. Students were required to take a series of topical quizzes leading up to the hour lecture exam. However, students could take the quiz as many times as they wished, to earn the grade they wished. Each quiz was unique and drew 10 random questions from a pool. The grades for the mastery learning class were not statistically significantly different from a previous class in which homework assignments were given (P=0.28).

The present study attempted to increase student participation, accuracy of responding, and weekly quiz scores, by incorporating student response-cards. Measures of social validity were also addressed. One hundred twenty university students in two sections of an introductory course served as participants. An augmented incomplete ABA reversal design was used to compare the effects of review questions with and without responsecards. Results suggest that response cards can increase participation as well as measures of learning, in this case quiz scores. Also, students rated the intervention positively on a consumer satisfaction rating scale. In addition to improving rates of student participation and quiz scores, response-cards positively impacted both students and the instructor's subjective experience in the classroom.\n      </p>", "We evaluated the effects of specific stimulus prompts on accuracy of academic performance with adolescents who displayed academic problems in a public special education classroom.

The second group studied in pairs and were paid based on pair performance, but could work together on their quizzes. In the third condition, students studied alone, received payment based only on their own quiz scores, and took the quizzes alone.

Results showed that attendance at test meetings (meetings where students took quizzes or exams) was approximately 90 percent for each class, while less than 55 percent for nontest meetings. Further, analysis of attendance for nontest meetings indicated that (a) attendance was lower for the last part of the semester compared to the first and (b) that frequent quizzing resulted in lower attendance for nontest meetings than infrequent quizzing.

Students (N = 356) were randomly assigned to either an overt practice or no-practice condition. Students in the overt practice condition made predictions and postdictions about their performance across 5 quizzes by entering their estimates online just before and after completing the quizzes. Students in the no-practice condition did not enter their predictions and postdictions for their quiz performance. Results did not support the hypothesis that overt calibration practice on the quizzes would improve calibration accuracy or exam performance. Higher achieving students were significantly more accurate in their predictions, yet underconfident in their predictions; lower achieving students were less accurate and overconfident.

Additionally, the Programmed Achievement (PA) students demonstrated higher performance than control students on an unannounced retention test.

Expectancy theory as modified by Porter and Lawler [1968] suggests that performance (a student's exam score) is dependent upon effort, abilities and traits, and role perception (regarding the class). An accounting instructor is able to influence a student's effort through assigning different tasks (teaching techniques) which may include homework collection or quizzes. In this study, a Latin square design allows several teaching techniques to be tested in four accounting classes and controls for possible bias in exam scores resulting from time of class and exam difficulty. Additionally, GPA is used as a covariate. The results indicate that the selected teaching techniques do not significantly affect exam scores.\n      </p>", "The effects on retention of 1) weekly practice with programed multiple-choice reviews, and 2) provision of correct answers as feedback with the reviews were investigated. Reviews provided either with or without answers were used by 60 educational psychology college students to help prepare for quizzes. Twenty-eight students took quizzes without reviews. Analysis indicated that subjects using the reviews scored higher on quiz items based on topics discussed in the reviewed material than on items taken from unreviewed material when all items were equated for difficulty. Although subjects with answers received significantly higher review scores than did subjects without answers, quiz scores were identical for these two groups. Correlation was low between review and quiz scores.\n      </p>", "Forty-five graduate students received three quizzes in one of their courses, and also filled out the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and a questionnaire on cheating.

This test was exhaustively assessed to shed light on the quality of tests and quizzes that students were asked to fill in. The results indicate that the Pathfinder procedure, together with the lexical test, is a good tool to distinguish groups of students with a similar knowledge of the English language.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Students enrolled in an introductory research course in political science were randomly assigned to either (1) a self-paced group in which each student was allowed to take each quiz in the course at whatever pace he chose or (2) an instructor-paced group in which students were required to pass each quiz by a target date set by the instructor. The number of students who withdrew from the course was significantly higher from the self-paced group than from the instructor-paced group. There were no significant differences between groups in attitudes or in achievement. Failure to maintain a steady quiz-taking pace and poor performance on the quizzes were the factors most closely associated with withdrawal from the course.\n      </p>", "A new teaching method based on positively reinforcing attempts at mastery was introduced and empirically tested to determine its validity. The program, labeled Programmed Achievement Study System (PASS), makes use of traditional learning principles by providing rewards (bonus points) contingent upon reaching specified mastery criteria. Specifically, college students enrolled in introductory psychology were awarded additional points if they demonstrated mastery of concept areas on retake quizzes administered during a given week. PASS students, as compared to a control condition, demonstrated higher performance on a final examination given at the end of the semester. These results suggest that the PASS contingencies are preferable to those contingencies operating in more traditional classrooms.

Six hypotheses were set up to be tested in a situation where the primary dependent variables were responses made on quizzes by students performing alone, and students performing as part of a team. The hypotheses dealing with intra- and inter-team functioning were not confirmed. Hypotheses concerned with overall individual proficiency levels were supported by substantial gains made on post-team versus pre-team tests. It was concluded that reinforcement theory concepts were extrapolated successfully from the experimental laboratory to the college classroom when one considered the specific educational and behavioral objectives which the course of instruction sought to accomplish.\n      </p>", "The learning effects of providing teacher verbal feedback of quiz results were studied using two classes of college students. The relationship between amount of learning as a result of feedback and certain characteristics of the students was also studied. After each quiz, students were given feedback on half of the test questions. Their final examination contained an equal number of feedback and nonfeedback items repeated from the previous quizzes. Students did significantly better on those items on which they had originally received feedback, even in the case where the feedback had been given 9 weeks prior to the final examination. These learning gains were found to be unrelated to students' age, grade point average, number of hours employed, and number of college credits accumulated. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.\n      </p>", "A research-translation project introduced a precision-teaching vocabulary intervention to 36 general and special education teachers through two workshops over a two-year period. (The teachers, in turn, introduced the approach to 694 students, 125 of whom were youth with learning disabilities). The goals of the project were threefold: (a) to determine if, after attending one-day training sessions, teachers were able to implement the vocabulary approach with their students; (b) to evaluate the degree to which the intervention influenced student performance, especially that of pupils with learning disabilities; and (c) to gather teacher and student reactions to the approach. Project outcomes revealed that (a) all but one teacher who received training implemented the approach and collected student performance data; (b) the majority of students, whether general or special education youth attending mainstream or special education settings, demonstrated increased accuracy and fluency on timed vocabulary quizzes; and (c) both teachers and students found the approach worthwhile and enjoyable.\n      </p>", "Eighty students who were given study technique guides, took quizzes, and participated in class discussions were matched with 80 students who were not exposed to these aids and activities. Subjects were matched on sex, college status, race, and mental ability and reading test scores. Each group responded to the Survey of Study Habits and Attitudes three times during the semester. Trend analytical results showed significant (a) difference on Teacher Approval scale, with the experimental group scoring higher, (b) differences on five scales over trials reflecting upward shifts, and (c) differences on five scales on interactions displaying reverse patterns of perceptions on study habits by the two groups. Analysis of the semester grade-point averages showed no significant differences between the groups.\n      </p>", "The assessment and grading practices in 19 mathematics classes in 5 high schools in 3 states were studied. In each class the most frequently used assessment tools were tests and quizzes, with these determining about 77% of students' grades. In 12 classes other forms of assessment, such as written projects or interviews with students, were also used, with performance on such instruments counting for about 7% of students' grades averaged across all 19 classes. Test items generally were low level, were stated without reference to a realistic context, involved very little reasoning, and were almost never open-ended. Most test items were either neutral or inactive with respect to technology. Written projects usually involved more complex analyses or applications than tests did. The teachers' knowledge and beliefs, as well as the content and textbook of the course, influenced the characteristics of test items and other assessment instruments. Only in geometry classes did standardized tests appear to influence assessment.\n      </p>", "There were ninety-six Ss who participated in this study to test the relative effectiveness of an individualized secondary science instruction system against a traditional self-contained classroom approach. The Ss were randomly distributed into four groups. Ss in groups A1 and A2 (N = 24 each) received instruction via a teacher-slide mediated presentation while group B (N = 24) received the same instruction via a self-paced presentation. A no-treatment control group (N = 24) constituted the fourth group. Quizzes 1 and 2 demonstrated no significant differences between groups A1, A2, and B. The posttest demonstrated that group B performed significantly better on both achievement (p. &amp;lt; .01) and time (p &amp;lt; .01) than did groups A1 and A2 which performed significantly better than the control group (p &amp;lt; .01). It was concluded that further research should be devoted to increasing the efficiency of the proposed system.\n      </p>", "This article describes 2 studies I conducted with my fourth-grade students. I used group grading in an effort to increase cooperation among group members and the mathematics test scores of low achievers in work groups of 3-5 members. The tests included 4 quizzes and 1 chapter test involving fractions. Because students in the 2 studies differed in attitude, results were inconsistent. Many students in the first study enjoyed working in groups and helping each other. Students in the second study on the whole did not enjoy group work and preferred an individual grade. Group grading was more effective with students who enjoyed working in groups and who accepted this method of assessment.\n      </p>", "Fifteen years after the 'peaceful revolutions' brought about the collapse of communism and the reunification of East and West Germany, a heated debate rages over the legacy of communism and the continuing impact of 1989. This paper describes a new course that explores the contentious issues in this debate through the innovative use of the course management system Blackboard. The paper describes how using Internet technology (video and audio links to archival and documentary footage, historic recordings, web linked academic articles, newspaper reports, internet sites, on-line quizzes and virtual discussions) has brought today's undergraduates into the current debate and engaged them technologically in ways that deviate from more traditional teaching models. Such a course is not as prevalent as one would expect, least of all in undergraduate curricula in Germany and the United States.\n      </p>", "The purpose of this yearlong study of two mathematics teachers was to examine instructional pacing under two forms of instructional organization. The first teacher used a student-paced format where micro-computers were used to correct work assignments and administer mastery quizzes to students. The second teacher used a more typical teacher-paced format with the teacher making work assignments to students several times a week and allowing ample time for assignment completion and correction. Analysis of student work during the school year revealed considerably more assignments completed under the student-paced approach than under the teacher-paced approach. The difference in work completed is a plausible explanation for the achievement differences in favor of the student-paced format. In addition, a leveling effect occurred in the teacher-paced classes, with the high-ability students demonstrating no gain under teacher-paced conditions. The work and achievement data illustrate a number of important issues concerning the potential consequences associated with instructional pace.\n      </p>", "The impact of a behavioral self-control (BSC) procedure with audio-cued self-monitoring (that consisted of self-assessment and self-recording) on academic time on task and spelling acquisition of three elementary-aged students with severe behavior disorders, was investigated during daily spelling study sessions. Time on task was recorded by observers, and spelling aquisition was defined as the percentage of words spelled correctly on daily oral quizzes and periodic written tests. A multiple-baseline-across-subjects design demonstrated that (a) the 2 students who used audio-cued self-monitoring more than doubled their time on task, whereas the 3rd student remained dependent on the teacher's verbal cues to increase his time on task; (b) oral spelling accuracy increased substantially for 1 student, minimally for another, and only when cuing modifications were implemented for the 3rd student; and (c) all 3 students increased the percentage of correctly spelled words on written tests (response generalization probes).\n      </p>", "The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of teaching eight secondary students with disabilities, including seven with learning disabilities, a strategy for answering a variety of inferential questions. A multiple-baseline across-subjects design was employed. Outcome measures included scores on researcher-devised comprehension quizzes, a standardized test of reading comprehension, a strategy use test, a strategy knowledge test, and a reading satisfaction measure. Fidelity of implementation, instructional time, and maintenance of skills were also measured. Results suggest that students with disabilities can learn to use a strategy to answer a variety of inferential questions, and mastery of its use can result in improved scores on criterion-based and standardized measures of reading comprehension. In addition, students' satisfaction with their reading improved.\n      </p>", "Multiple questionnaires completed over the semester by 514 students enrolled in a first year psychology course reveal that no single pattern of reliance on print, online, or in-person resources guarantees a high mark. Analyses of the reported and measured frequency of use of various resources correlated against students', performance on both individual assessments and their final marks suggests that students employ a range of strategies in their use of class resources. They tend to rely on their textbooks, Web-based lecture notes, and online quizzes, but their final marks are more strongly determined by their university entrance scores than by their resource use strategy, their sex, or whether or not English is their first language. The data suggest that students adapt their learning strategies to the resources available, with an apparent emphasis on learning what will be assessed rather than exploring for understanding. Importantly, the results argue that investment in development of educational technologies - and students', use of educational technologies - must be informed by empirical data concerning its impact on the efficiency and quality of learning.\n      </p>", "This study examined the effects of three different types of computer feedback on the following variables in a Personalized System of Instruction (PSI) course: unit quiz and final exam performance, the amount of time tutors and other teaching staff spent answering student questions, and students' preference for each type of feedback. The feedback conditions were the following: (a) end-of-test, (b) item-byitem with the option to skip questions during the test, and (c) item-by-item without the option to skip questions during the test. Students who received item-by-item feedback with the skip option performed the same as students who received end-oftest feedback on the unit quizzes and final exam. However, the teaching staff spent significantly less time answering questions when students received item-by-item feedback with the skip option than when they received end-of-test feedback. Finally, 65% of the students preferred item-by-item feedback with the skip option. The authors concluded that this type of item-by-item feedback decreases the workload on teaching staff in a PSI course without sacrificing performance, and students like it more than the other types of feedback.\n      </p>", "If it is assumed that student failure in the classroom situation is the result of inadequate performance skills rather than a lack of ability, then the attention of the educator should more properly be directed at teaching the student to develop effective methods of studying. The present experiment employed a Programmed Student Achievement (PA) procedure which required that the student evidence 100% mastery of discrete units of material. Two PA contingencies which differed in the intensity of the consequence of failing to evidence mastery were used, testing the hypothesis that the PA effect is analogous to avoidance conditioning. In addition, generalization of the effect of PA on performance in courses taken concurrently was evaluated. The performance of PA students was found to be significantly superior to that of control students on both weekly quizzes and major exams; however, performance under the two experimental contingencies did not differ. Additionally, the PA effect did not generalize to performance in other courses. The implication of these data for an avoidance hypothesis account of the PA effect is discussed.\n      </p>", "The Structure-Conduct-Performance (SCP) paradigm is commonly used in the field of industrial organization. The paradigm links market structure, firm behavior, and economic performance. Questions of industry organization, firm decision-making and economic efficiency in a wide variety of markets have been addressed using the SCP model. This paper applies the SCP paradigm to the area of economic education. To do this, an alternative model of economic education is developed. In this model, students are viewed as producers (of learning) while instructors determine the institutional setting and are one of the inputs into the production process. This view separates the areas where instructors may exert some control (setting class structure and providing good teaching) from the area where they have little control\u2014student behavior. Using the model developed, this study employs an experiment to investigate student behavior. Students are placed in a strategic situation in which they must choose when and how much to study for weekly quizzes. The experiment represents a unique approach in economic education research and sheds light on student decision making.\n      </p>", "This study was an exploration of the effectiveness of a self-scoring punchboard device in a one semester introductory psychology course. Fifty-two Ss were used in four matched groups of 13 each. Group I used the device both for testing and review purposes, Group II for testing only, Group III for review only, while Group IV did not use the device at all. Comparison of the groups yielded significant differences between I and III on the mean amount of change taking place as measured by later performance on the test used for matching the groups, and on the mean cumulative course quiz scores between II and IV. It was noted that this difference could be accounted for by a difference in the things being measured by the test and the course quizzes. An inhibitory effect of the device when used for review purposes was also suggested. It was concluded that although this device's use for testing might be justified, its effectiveness otherwise remains unsupported.\n      </p>", "The problem of student achievement is one which should be of major concern to every educator. The hypothesis in this study was that a student's motivation and consequently his performance can be affected by reinforcement contingencies under the control of the instructor. The particular variable manipulated was the testing procedure. The experimental test contingency was called programmed student achievement (PA). This procedure involved requiring the student to evidence 100 percent mastery of discrete units of material. Two classes of general psychology served as Ss. For one class the PA contingency was in effect the first half of the semester. For the second class the PA contingency was in effect the last half of the semester. Students under the PA contingency evidenced significantly better performance on both weekly quizzes and major exams. It was concluded that the PA test contingency significantly affected the way in which a student prepared for an examination. It was not particularly surprising that the motivational level of the student was related to performance. The more relevant implication was that this motivation can be affected by a simple testing technique under the control of the instructor.\n      </p>", "A form of socially assisted group learning based on a modified version of reciprocal teaching for mathematics (Campione, Brown, &amp; Connell, 1988) was evaluated in terms of its effectiveness in promoting fourth graders' solution of complex 2-step word problems. The emphasis in this method is for an adult tutor to elicit solution suggestions from students and to explore the multiple solutions in seeking group agreement. The method focuses attention both on world representations underlying numbers and on transfer of problem solution planning skills to children over time. The results were compared with those from a modeling-reinforcement tutoring control condition and a classroom activity control in a 10-week study of fourth graders' solution of 4 types of 2-step math word problems, constructed to avoid keywords. Individuals who received either type of training earned higher scores for all problem types than did controls on quizzes; children in the modified reciprocal teaching condition outscored those in the modeling condition on problems that required information to be added from outside the problem and on a quiz of mixed problem types. Subsequent analysis of solutions and videotaped math behaviors suggested that those in the socially assisted learning condition used labeled representations in problem solving more effectively and deduced implied information earlier and more often than those in the modeling condition.\n      </p>", "Over the past several years, scholars of teaching and learning have demonstrated the potential of collaborative learning strategies for improving student learning. This paper examines the use of computer-mediated communication to promote collaborative student learning in large introductory sociology courses. Specifically, we summarize a project we conducted during the 2000-2001 academic year in which we added online collaborative learning activities to the curriculum of two large sections of introductory sociology. Drawing on Novak et al.'s (1999) Just-In-Time Teaching methods, we developed online activities to help prepare students for subsequent in-class work and to cultivate a sense of group solidarity among smaller teams within the larger class. The results suggest that student engagement in the online group learning activities was strongly predictive of better student academic achievement on the biweekly quizzes, cumulative final exam, and course paper. These findings highlight the potential value of online group work for fostering collaborative learning environments in large lecture courses as well as for enhancing student learning.\n      </p>", "To gain an appreciation of the collusion rate of college students in science classes, over three hundred undergraduates from western Pennsylvania were sampled for their attitudes toward different forms of cheating. The science students were sampled from several different divisions within the university. The survey used in the study was developed by Baird (1980) and holds a reliability coefficient of 89%. The results of the survey indicate that eighty three percent of the respondents had cheated in science sometime in their lives. The vast majority (86%) of the pupils had \"shared\" homework answers with classmates and most (81%) had told \"little lies\" to teachers or administrators to avoid getting in trouble. Fewer, but still the majority (75%), of the students admitted to have copied phrases directly out of glossaries, encyclopedias, journals or reference books turning it in as their own work. Most students (80%) had also used crib notes or written science terms on their shoes, wrists or other parts of their body to get by \"minor\" quizzes at times in their biology course. Over three quarters of the students admitted to cheating on large exams and major projects. When the results of the study are compared to students surveyed with the same instrument a decade ago, it is revealed that the cheating among students is growing. Alarmingly, when the results of the 1993 study were compared to the one in 1980, it was discovered that student collusion had increased in all of the categories in the questionnaire.\n      </p>", "The present study provides validity information for the TOEFL by examining some of its inter- and intra-test correlates. Inter-test correlates included: 1) grades in an intensive English program, 2) accumulated scores from objective quizzes administered after each of 15 lessons in a course designed to teach listening comprehension and note taking skills, and 3) scores on the Comprehensive English Language Test (CELT) with subtests representing structure, listening comprehension and vocabulary abilities. In addition, intercorrelations were done within ability groups (high, medium and low, as measured by students' levels in their English program) to determine if correlation patterns vary according to the academic level of the student. Intra-test correlates consisted of investigations of correlations among subtests within the TOEFL. Factor analyses were used to aid in interpretation of the various correlation structures. The purpose of this study is to initiate a validation study of the content of the TOEFL. One factor was identified through factor analysis of TOEFL subtest scores, with the reading comprehension subtest having the highest factor loading. The interrelated nature of the TOEFL subtests is supported by positive correlations (greater than .50) within TOEFL subtests and between TOEFL and CELT subtests. A high correlation between the listening comprehension subtest of the TOEFL and another listening comprehension measure, the listening tracts, as well as a considerable correlation between listening tract scores and TOEFL totals, suggest that listening comprehension may be a separate skill that is significantly interrelated with total score success. Grades in an intensive English program are not predictors of TOEFL success, although relative academic level is.\n      </p>", "Betty's Brain is a computer-based learning environment that capitalizes on the social aspects of learning. In Betty's Brain, students instruct a character called a Teachable Agent (TA) which can reason based on how it is taught. Two studies demonstrate the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 effect: students make greater effort to learn for their TAs than they do for themselves. The first study involved 8th-grade students learning biology. Although all students worked with the same Betty's Brain software, students in the TA condition believed they were teaching their TAs, while in another condition, they believed they were learning for themselves. TA students spent more time on learning activities (e.g., reading) and also learned more. These beneficial effects were most pronounced for lower achieving children. The second study used a verbal protocol with 5th-grade students to determine the possible causes of the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 effect. As before, students learned either for their TAs or for themselves. Like study 1, students in the TA condition spent more time on learning activities. These children treated their TAs socially by attributing mental states and responsibility to them. They were also more likely to acknowledge errors by displaying negative affect and making attributions for the causes of failures. Perhaps having a TA invokes a sense of responsibility that motivates learning, provides an environment in which knowledge can be improved through revision, and protects students' egos from the psychological ramifications of failure.\n      </p>", "           ", "           ", "           ", "           ", "           "], "words": {"all": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "lack":
