To date we have isolated papillary collecting duct cells from 100 normal human kidneys. Papillae were dissected and digested in Cellgro containing 400 U/ml collagenase. Cells were plated on fibronectin-coated culture flasks at a density of 104 live cells/ml in Cellgro supplemented with insulin and 10% fetal bovine serum. Confluent monolayers, which were able to withstand 600 mOSM for 8 h, were obtained within 10 to 15 d. Cells of primary isolates and first passages exhibited epithelial cell ultrastructure including cell junctions, microvilli, and cilia. A dark-brown reaction product was observed in these cells when stained by the immunoperoxidase method with peroxidase-labeled peanut lectin (Arachis hypogaea), which binds specifically to human distal tubule and collecting duct cells. These cells were negative for Factor-VIII (a marker for endothelial cells) and y-glutamyltransferase (a marker for proximal tubule cells). High activities of the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase and arginine vasopressin-stimulated cAMP production in these cells are consistent with a distal nephron origin. The results indicate that human collecting duct cells can be isolated and cultured to provide an in vitro system to probe pathogenetic mechanisms of potential nephrotoxins.\n      </p>", "Isolated renal cortical collecting tubules obtained from rabbits treated chronically with desoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) have been found to possess elevated transepithelial potential differences and a greatly increased capacity for ion transport. Structural examination of tubules from rabbits exposed to either DOCA or dexamethasone for 11-18 d reveals a marked increase in basolateral cell membrane area in these tubules. Morphometric analysis shows that this effect is specifically on the basolateral membrane area of only one of the two cell types found in this nephron segment. Increases of &gt;140% and 90% are found for the basolateral membrane area of the principal cells for DOCA and dexamethasone, respectively, but no change could be detected in the basolateral membrane area of the intercalated cells found in this nephron segment. No significant changes were found in luminal membrane area, cell number, or cell volume for either cell type. These observations demonstrate that significant changes in membrane area can occur in differentiated epithelia and suggest that this may be an important mechanism for modulating epithelial transport capacity.\n      </p>", "This essay concerns memorial collecting, a new trend in Holocaust education and memorialization whereby groups, often student groups, accumulate six million of a particular object (such as paper clips, buttons, or shoes) to symbolize the murdered. Rather than \"work\" through the past, memorial collecting encourages one to \"play\" through it, and thereby redirects attention away from finished memorials toward processes of memorialization themselves. Nevertheless, official institutions of Holocaust memory often refuse to support memorial collections and accuse them of the Holocaust. Using the example of the \"Paper Clip Project\" (the Children's Holocaust Memorial in Whitwell, Tennessee), I examine some of these controversies and what they imply for Holocaust memory.\n      </p>", "A noninvasive microscopic method was used to assess the cell specificity of vasopressin binding within the heterogeneous collecting duct. The binding of a fluorescent vasopressin analog (1-desamino-8-rhodamine-L-lysine vasopressin) to cells of the microperfused rabbit cortical collecting tubule was visualized and quantitated with image-intensified video microscopy and digital image processing. Binding to the basolateral membranes of a subpopulation of cells could be detected within 1-2 min of addition of the fluorescent analog (10 nM) to the peritubular bath. Binding could be prevented or reversed by the addition of a 10-fold excess of the native hormone, which indicates that the fluorescent analog binds specifically to vasopressin receptors. The time course of binding paralleled and slightly preceded hyperpolarization of the lumen-negative transepithelial voltage, an electrical response that is also elicited by the native hormone. Double-label experiments in which the intercalated cell population was stained with fluorescein-labeled peanut lectin revealed that binding of the vasopressin analog was localized to the remaining cell type, the principal cell. Our results support the following conclusions. First, the principal cell constitutes the primary target cell for vasopressin in the rabbit cortical collecting tubule, although the intercalated cell may possess a limited number of receptors at a density below the detection limit of this optical approach. Second, computer-enhanced video microscopy is a powerful, noninvasive method for assessing the kinetics and spatial pattern of hormone binding. We have used computer-enhanced imaging techniques to directly visualize and quantitate the binding of a fluorescent vasopressin analog to individual epithelial cells. This noninvasive optical approach has allowed the generation of spatial and temporal ``maps'' of hormone binding, maps that were used to correlate directly (in individual experiments) the kinetics, magnitude, and spatial pattern of binding with the physiologic effects of the hormone analog.\n      </p>", "One key feature of rural African society concerns the dynamic flexibility of household livelihood strategies which Richards (1992) has conceptualised as an 'adaptive and continuous performance'. Adaptability is essential for rural African households are required to respond to environmental, social, political and economic changes both within and between years. This paper explores the adaptive performance surrounding collecting activities (gathering, hunting and fishing) among rural Jola households in The Gambia, West Africa. Investigation of medium term change shows that collecting from the bush (forest, fallow, semi-cultivated land, sea and river) has increased significantly during the last two decades while examination of short-term change demonstrates that the amount of bush products collected varies seasonally and is closely integrated with agricultural activities and the social world. It is thus necessary to conceptualise rural change as a process, or performance, occurring at various rates (weekly, seasonally, between years) and spatial scales (individual, household, community, international), where there is a 'sequential coupling' of parallel activities in response to unpredictable events. Change to one aspect of rural West African life results in alterations to other aspects. Models and theories of rural change should therefore stress the interconnective and cyclical nature of productive, consumptive and reproductive spheres. The seasonally mobile and porous flexibility of rural performances in The Gambia illustrate the shortcomings of a development discourse based on a dichotomised model of rural livelihoods and a linear theory of progress.\n      </p>", "Aim The aim of this study is to analyse the distribution pattern of the botanical collecting effort in Amazonia so that it can be accounted for when interpreting phytogeographical patterns such as inferred species ranges. We also develop a mechanistic and transparent method for taking into account the bias in collecting effort when estimating likelihoods of species occurrences. Location Amazonia, Neotropics. Methods We utilized electronic data sets of georeferenced herbarium collections (1,063,530 in total). We plotted collecting localities (68,246 in total) on maps overlaid with 1\u00b0 and $0.5\\deg$ square grids, and analysed collecting effort using a geographical information system (GIS). We also drew a map of Thiessen polygons, using collecting localities as polygon centres, to visualize collecting density in a scale-independent way. We then created a 'collecting activity landscape' in which well-collected areas appear as peaks and poorly studied areas as valleys. We demonstrate how this surface can be utilized when estimating species distributions. Results The data available to us confirm that botanical collecting activity is still severely biased in Amazonia. The uncollected area represents 43% of the total area of Amazonia, while another 28% is poorly collected and only 2% can be considered relatively well collected. The Thiessen polygon network represents an improvement in the presentation of collecting intensity compared with square grids. Main conclusions The maps of botanical collecting effort in the Neotropics should be used for visually correcting phytogeographical interpretations. With the help of GIS applications the observed spatial bias in collecting effort can be utilized in estimating the likelihood of occurrence of species in a repeatable manner. These estimates, in turn, can be used for various purposes in basic and applied science as well as in decision-making. The biased collecting effort should, in the long run, be corrected by further field work in unexplored areas, which can be identified with the maps presented here.\n      </p>", "A primary culture from rat renal IMCD cells was established to investigate the permeability characteristics of the luminal and contraluminal plasma membranes of the papillary collecting duct in vitro. Freshly isolated IMCD cells were grown on filters in a special \"epithelial cell\" medium. Confluency was proved with an epithelial volt/ohm meter. After 7 d of culture the transepithelial resistance reached more than $1000 \\Omega \\times cm^2$ . A polarization of the cells with regard to a basolateral localization of a lactate efflux system, and an L-alanine transport system was achieved. The hypotonicity-activated release systems for the organic osmolytes sorbitol and betaine were also located basolaterally, whereas taurine, glycerophosphor-ylcholine, and myo-inositol left the cells at both cell poles but with different capacity. Morphological observations revealed also that the monolayer was well differentiated. Thus, a model of a renal collecting duct epithelium was established which can be used to analyze polarized and differentiated transport processes across the epithelial cells and their plasma membranes.\n      </p>", "There is growing concern about the potential impact of researchers on tropical forest ecology, but few data. The aim of this paper is to examine the effects of collecting botanical specimens from tropical forest trees on their subsequent survivorship, using mortality data from plots in Amazonian Peru that were established in 1989 and reinventoried in 1994. In total, 2017 trees were originally tagged and collections were made from 948 trees. Making voucher collections always involved using unsterilized telescopic plant collecting poles to cut representative small branches, and sometimes also involved using iron-spiked tree-climbing gear to gain access to the canopy. Annual mortality in the four plots averaged 1.99 percent. Among the whole population of dicotyledenous trees, there was no detectable difference between the mortality rate of collected trees (1.96%) and noncollected trees (2.29%). We conclude that in spite of the physical damage caused to collected trees, collecting voucher specimens from tropical moist forest trees may not affect their survivorship, at least in the short-term. Further studies are needed to fully evaluate the potential impacts of research activities on permanent forest plots in the tropics.\n      </p>", "The changing economy of a group of tropical forest hunter-gatherers is examined. The Batak of the Philippines today earn many calories by participating in an external market system; once they would have earned these calories within the traditional subsistence system. Gathering and selling Manila copal to purchase rice has partially displaced digging wild yams as the major source of subsistence. Data show that this change has reduced the productive efficiency of human labor. The Batak must work longer and perform more difficult tasks to obtain the same number of calories by collecting copal as they can obtain by digging wild yams, even as they must today work longer hours anyway to earn necessary cash to satisfy new, nonfood consumer wants. The growing dietary importance of rice is only one aspect of changing food consumption patterns that may be having an unfavorable impact on Batak nutrition.\n      </p>", "We used museum specimens to describe the timing and location of the postbreeding molt in Western Kingbird (Tyrannus verticalis), an insectivore that breeds in arid lowlands of western North America, where late summer conditions are exceedingly dry. Like many other western migrants, adult Western Kingbirds depart their breeding grounds and move to molt in the Mexican monsoon region. By contrast, juveniles stay on the breeding grounds in late summer, delaying their eccentric primary molt and body molt until after undertaking part of their fall migration. The high number of juvenile specimens collected on the breeding grounds in late summer confirms that the decrease in adults, measured as the percentage of all Western Kingbirds that are adults, is not an artifact of inactive collectors. We also demonstrate adult departure using museum databases to calculate the percentage of all passerines collected in breeding areas outside the southwestern molting grounds that were adult Western Kingbirds. The close correlation between these indices validates the use of total number of passerines as an index of the collecting effort targeting a specific passerine. Our results provide another example of the importance of the Mexican monsoon region for molting passerines, highlighting the need to preserve habitat in this region.\n         Usamos espec\u00cdmenes de museo para describir el momento y lugar de la muda que ocurre despu\u00e9s de la reproducci\u00f3n en Tyrannus verticalis, un ave insect\u00cdvora que anida en zonas \u00b4ridas del oeste de Norte Am\u00e9rica donde el final de verano es extremadamente seco. Como en muchas otras aves migratorias del oeste, los adultos de T. verticalis dejan las \u00b4reas de anidaci\u00f3n y se dispersan para mudar en la regi\u00f3n monz\u00f3nica mexicana. En contraste, los juveniles se quedan en las \u00b4reas de cr\u00cda al final del verano, retrasando la muda de las primarias externas y de las plumas del cuerpo hasta arribar a su h\u00b4bitat de invierno. El alto n\u00famero de espec\u00cdmenes juveniles coleccionados en las \u00b4reas de cr\u00cda al final del verano confirma que la disminuci\u00f3n en el porcentaje de individuos adultos no es un artefacto causado por inactividad de los colectores. Tambi\u00e9n demostramos la salida de los adultos usando bases de datos de museo para calcular el porcentaje de todos los paserinos coleccionados en las \u00b4reas de cr\u00cda ubicadas fuera de las \u00b4reas de muda del suroeste que correspond\u00cda a adultos de T. verticalis. La correlaci\u00f3n estrecha entre estos \u00cdndices valida el uso del n\u00famero total de paserinos en las colecciones como un \u00cdndice de esfuerzo de colecci\u00f3n enfocado en un paserino espec\u00cdfico. Nuestros resultados son otro ejemplo de la importancia de la regi\u00f3n monz\u00f3nica mexicana para la muda de los paserinos, lo que resalta la importancia de preservar el h\u00b4bitat en esta regi\u00f3n.\n      </p>", "This paper considers a variant of the travelling salesman problem named the capacitated prize-collecting travelling salesman problem (CPCTSP), which is derived from the colour-coating production scheduling in a cold rolling mill. The objective of the CPCTSP is to minimize the travel cost and the penalties paid for unvisited customers in such a way that a sufficiently large prize is collected and the demand of the visited customers does not exceed the salesman's capacity. For this problem, we propose an iterated local search (ILS) heuristic adopting guided kick and enhanced dynasearch. The experimental results on randomly generated instances show that the proposed heuristic outperforms the improved tabu search algorithm using frequency-based memory, and the further experimental results on instances collected from real colour-coating production also show that the proposed ILS algorithm is more effective and efficient than the currently adopted manual scheduling method.\n      </p>", "The coupon subset collection problem is a generalization of the classical coupon collecting problem, in that rather than collecting individual coupons we obtain, at each time point, a random subset of coupons. The problem of interest is to determine the expected number of subsets needed until each coupon is contained in at least one of these subsets. We provide bounds on this number, give efficient simulation procedures for estimating it, and then apply our results to a reliability problem.\n      </p>", "WNK1 belongs to a unique family of Ser/Thr kinases that have been implicated in the control of blood pressure. Intronic deletions in the WNK1 gene result in its overexpression and lead to pseudohypoaldosteronism type II, a disease with salt-sensitive hypertension and hyperkalemia. How overexpression of WNK1 leads to Na+ retention and hypertension is not entirely clear. Similarly, there is no information on the hormonal regulation of expression of WNK kinases. There are two main WNK1 transcripts expressed in the kidney: the originally described \"long\" WNK1 and a shorter transcript that is specifically expressed in the kidney (KS-WNK1). The goal of this study was to determine the effect of aldosterone, the main hormonal regulator of Na+ homeostasis, on the transcription of WNK1 isoforms in renal target cells, by using an unique mouse cortical collecting duct cell line that stably expresses functional mineralocorticoid receptors. Our results demonstrate that aldosterone, at physiological concentrations, rapidly induces the expression of the KS-WNK1 but not that of the long-WNK1 in these cells. Importantly, stable overexpression of KS-WNK1 significantly increases transepithelial Na+ transport in cortical collecting duct cells. Similarly, coexpression of KS-WNK1 and the epithelial Na+ channel in Fischer rat thyroid epithelial cells also stimulates Na+ current, suggesting that KS-WNK1 affects the subcellular location or activity but not the expression of epithelial Na+ channel. These observations suggest that stimulation of KS-WNK1 expression might be an important element of aldosterone-induced Na+ retention and hypertension.\n      </p>", "The species of Rediviva (Apoidea, Melittidae) occurring in the summer rainfall region of South Africa are revised. Nine species are recognized, four are described as new: R. brunnea, R. autumnalis, R. rhodosoma and R. transkeiana all attributed to Whitehead and Steiner. Distributions and host plants are given for all the summer rainfall area species and a key to identify both males and females is presented. Rediviva rufipes and R. bicava, a winter rainfall area species, are synonymized.\n      </p>", "Two water channel homologs were cloned recently from rat kidney, mercurial-insensitive water channel (MIWC) and glycerol intrinsic protein (GLIP). Polyclonal antibodies were raised against synthetic C-terminal peptides and purified by affinity chromatography. MIWC and GLIP antibodies recognized proteins in rat kidney with an apparent molecular mass of 30 and 27 kDa, respectively, and did not cross-react. By immunofluorescence, MIWC and GLIP were expressed together on the basolateral plasma membrane of collecting duct principal cells in kidney. By immunohistochemistry, MIWC and GLIP were expressed on tracheal epithelial cells with greater expression of GLIP on the basal plasma membrane and MIWC on the lateral membrane; only MIWC was expressed in bronchial epithelia. In eye, GLIP was expressed in conjunctival epithelium, whereas MIWC was found in iris, ciliary body, and neural cell layers in retina. MIWC and GLIP colocalized on the basolateral membrane of villus epithelial cells in colon and brain ependymal cells. Expression of MIWC and GLIP was not detected in small intestine, liver, spleen, endothelia, and cells that express water channels CHIP28 or WCH-CD. These studies suggest water/solute transporting roles for MIWC and GLIP in the urinary concentrating mechanism, cerebrospinal fluid absorption, ocular fluid balance, fecal dehydration, and airway humidification. The unexpected membrane colocalization of MIWC and GLIP in several tissues suggests an interaction at the molecular and/or functional levels.\n      </p>", "To qualitatively ascertain the beetle fauna of lentic habitats, samples collected with a flat-bottomed aquatic net should be supplemented by samples collected by traps. A wide variety of aquatic traps employ inverted cones in cylinders, bottles, or boxes, and their effectiveness can sometimes be enhanced with baits or the addition of a light. A quantitative method is described that uses a large cylinder to enclose a measured area to which an irritant is added to force beetles to the surface where they are easily collected.\n      </p>", "We immunopurified a surface antigen specific for the collecting duct (CD) epithelium. Microsequencing of three polypeptides identified the antigen as the neuronal cell adhesion molecule L1, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The kidney isoform showed a deletion of exon 3. L1 was expressed in the mesonephric duct and the metanephros throughout CD development. In the adult CD examined by electron microscopy, L1 was not expressed on intercalated cells but was restricted to CD principal cells and to the papilla tall cells. By contrast, L1 appeared late in the distal portion of the elongating nephron in the mesenchymally derived epithelium and decreased during postnatal development. Immunoblot analysis showed that expression, proteolytic cleavage, and the glycosylation pattern of L1 protein were regulated during renal development. L1 was not detected in epithelia of other organs developing by branching morphogenesis. Addition of anti-L1 antibody to kidney or lung organotypic cultures induced dysmorphogenesis of the ureteric bud epithelium but not of the lung. These results suggest a functional role for L1 in CD development in vitro. We further postulate that L1 may be involved in the guidance of developing distal tubule and in generation and maintenance of specialized cell phenotypes in CD.\n      </p>", "Anthropogenic disturbances of forest ecosystems are increasingly recognized as fundamental ecological processes with important long-term implications for biogeochemical cycles and vegetation patterns. This article aims at reconstructing the extent and intensity of the two most common types of traditional forest uses\u2014forest litter collecting and wood pasture\u2014in the Swiss Rhone valley (Valais) by (i) identifying the spatiotemporal patterns, and (ii) modeling the biomass removal through these practices. Detailed information on agricultural practices and socio-economic context were essential to develop reliable estimates of anthropogenic disturbance regimes. In the Valais, predominately goats and sheep grazed in the forests. The intensity of grazing was a function of the number of grazing animals and the available grazing area. Forest litter was used as bedding for farm animals during the winter. Key factors determining the intensity of litter collecting were the number of animal units, the amount of available substitute products (straw), and the area where litter raking could be practiced. The results show that wood pasture and forest litter collecting were practiced on a significant proportion of the forested landscape in the Valais up to the second half of the 20th century. Until the implementation of forest management plans in the 1930s, almost half of the forests in the study area were affected by wood pasture and/or forest litter collecting. The regulations in the management plans led to an essential reduction of the area available for these traditional practices but likewise to an increased pressure on the remaining areas. The results suggest that the notion of a slow but steady disappearance of traditional non-timber forest uses and the associated effects on forest ecosystems is oversimplified. Quantitative reconstructions of biomass output resulting from these practices confirm the importance of traditional non-timber forest uses for ecosystem development in this region. Furthermore, it is very likely that similar effects have been widespread throughout regions with similar natural and socio-economic context, for example, throughout a significant proportion of the European Alps. This study underlines the importance of environmental history for ecological sciences as well as for forest management and conservation planning.\n      </p>", "The construction and use of an apparatus for opening, and collecting contents from, the small intestines of ruminants are described. The apparatus, which increases the speed and efficiency of operation, consists essentially of a windlass pulling the intestine over an enterotome device and through two scrapers.

However, this is a race against time since the destruction of natural habitats has also increased dramatically. The rate at which collecting is still adding new species of flowering plants indicates that the inventory is not nearly complete, and that the past estimates of total species numbers are low and should be increased to 320,000. The production of florulas and quantitative inventories of small areas of the tropics, accompanied by intensive fieldwork, has greatly helped to improve the level of inventory. Future collecting should be carefully targeted towards areas that are particularly threatened, such as those defined as hotspots, and also collection of rare species rather than repeated over-collection of widely distributed common taxa. Future collecting should also gather material for ancillary studies such as molecular work and evolutionary development.\n      </p>", "Three methods of harvesting bitterbrush seed that yielded about 5,000 lb clean seed in 1963 were used by the Inyo National Forest. The most economical method of collecting the seed was by Forest Service crews collecting by hand; the most costly was by an experimental browse seed harvester; purchase from private seed collectors was intermediate in cost, but compared favorably with Forest Service crew hand collections. Cost ranged from $47,100 lb clean seed for certain hand collections up to $424 for some machine collections.\n      </p>", "The reproductive biology of some plants is based on the movement of pollen between plants by insects. In many plant-insect pollination systems the plant produces a \"reward\" usually in the form of nectar. However, a number of plant taxa produce oil as a floral reward. Bees of the genus Centris are known as \"oil-collecting\" bees which are the important mediators in the reproductive success of oil reward producing flowers. These bees are solitary and their own reproductive success depends on the interaction between the sexes and the ability of the female to construct and provision a nest. In this paper we discuss the importance of male territorality and its maintenance to the reproductive success of this taxa of bees. We also discuss the nesting biology of Centris in Costa Rica focusing on the resource needs of females. /// La biolog\u00eda reproductiva de algunas plantas est\u00e1 basada en el movimiento de polen entre plantas llevado a cabo por insectos.

The origin of this cellular heterogeneity is not clear. To test the hypothesis that the two cell types might originate from one another, pure populations of ICC (\u03b2 subtype) and PC were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and grown on permeable supports. After the monolayers reached confluence, the expression of ICC- and PC-specific functions and antigens was monitored. Cultures of sorted \u03b2-ICC, in addition to expressing ICC-specific functions (such as an electrogenic H+ secretion) and antigens, progressively acquired PC functions (amiloride-sensitive Na+ transport and K+ secretion). On day 6, cultures of sorted \u03b2-ICC exhibited a lumen-negative transepithelial potential difference of 83 \u00b1 4 mV and a short circuit current of 107 \u00b1 15 \u03bcA/cm2 and created a lumen-to-bath K+ concentration ratio of \u224810. The percentage of cells staining with two PC-specific antibodies was 53% and 65%. On the other hand, cultures of sorted PC failed to acquire ICC-specific functions while maintaining PC characteristics. To rule out preferential proliferation of a few contaminating PC as an explanation of these results, we have generated a continuous collecting duct cell line (M-1) originating from mice transgenic for the early region of simian virus 40. Cell lines cloned from M-1 cells exhibit both PC and ICC functions and show mutually exclusive heterogenous expression of PC and ICC antigens, demonstrating a common origin of the two cell types. These data indicate that while \u03b2-ICC in culture can give rise to both \u03b1-ICC and PC, PC cannot convert to ICC, which raises the possibility that \u03b2-ICC is the stem cell in the renal collecting duct. Differentiation of ICC to PC may explain the cellular heterogeneity in the cortical collecting duct.\n      </p>", "The multisubunit vacuolar-type H+ ATPases mediate acidification of various intracellular organelles and in some tissues mediate H+ secretion across the plasma membrane. Mutations in the B1-subunit of the apical H+ ATPase that secretes protons in the distal nephron cause distal renal tubular acidosis in humans, a condition characterized by metabolic acidosis with an inappropriately alkaline urine. To examine the detailed cellular and organismal physiology resulting from this mutation, we have generated mice deficient in the B1-subunit (Atp6v1b1-/- mice). Urine pH is more alkaline and metabolic acidosis is more severe in Atp6v1b1-/- mice after oral acid challenge, demonstrating a failure of normal urinary acidification. In Atp6v1b1-/- mice, the normal urinary acidification induced by a lumen-negative potential in response to furosemide infusion is abolished. After an acute intracellular acidification, Na+-independent pH recovery rates of individual Atp6v1b1-/- intercalated cells of the cortical collecting duct are markedly reduced and show no further decrease after treatment with the selective H+ ATPase inhibitor concanamycin. Apical expression of the alternative B-subunit isoform, B2, is increased in Atp6v1b1-/- medulla and colocalizes with the H+ ATPase E-subunit; however, the greater severity of metabolic acidosis in Atp6v1b1-/- mice after oral acid challenge indicates that the B2-subunit cannot fully functionally compensate for the loss of B1. Our results indicate that the B1 isoform is the major B-subunit isoform that incorporates into functional, plasma membrane H+ ATPases in intercalated cells of the cortical collecting duct and is required for maximal urinary acidification.\n      </p>", "Collecting policies have been advocated as tools to help archivists build stronger collections.

Large-scale identification and quantification of phosphorylation events triggered by vasopressin is desirable to gain a comprehensive systems-level understanding of this process. We carried out phosphoproteomic analysis of rat inner medullary collecting duct cells by using a combination of phosphopeptide enrichment by immobilized metal affinity chromatography and phosphorylation site identification by liquid chromatography-mass $spectrometry_{n}$ neutral loss scanning. A total of 714 phosphorylation sites on 223 unique phosphoproteins were identified from inner medullary collecting duct samples treated shortterm with either calyculin A or vasopressin. A number of proteins involved in cytoskeletal reorganization, vesicle trafficking, and transcriptional regulation were identified. Previously unidentified phosphorylation sites were found for membrane proteins essential to collecting duct physiology, including eight sites among aquaporin-2 (AQP2), aquaporin-4, and urea transporter isoforms Al and A3. Through label-free quantification of phosphopeptides, we identified a number of proteins that significantly changed phosphorylation state in response to short-term vasopressin treatment: AQP2, Bclaf1, LRRC47, Rgl3, and SAFB2. In the presence of vasopressin, AQP2 monophosphorylated at S256 and diphosphorylated AQP2 (pS256/261) increased in abundance, whereas AQP2 monophosphorylated at S261 decreased, raising the possibility that both sites are involved in vasopressin-dependent AQP2 trafficking. This study reveals the practicality of liquid chromotography-mass $spectrometry_{n}$ neutral loss scanning for large-scale identification and quantification of protein phosphorylation in the analysis of cell signaling in a native mammalian system.\n      </p>", "As governments impose increasingly stringent regulations on the collection of bird specimens and as man alters ever greater areas of habitat with the loss of many of their contained species, museum specimens increase immeasurably in importance. Yet at present, museum collections do not contain an adequate representation of the world's avifauna and, unfortunately, are not likely to do so. Thus, it is imperative that data associated with specimens that are obtained be as complete as possible. To this end, we describe categories of information with wide application to many types of studies, outline character states, and recommend standard forms of data notation. We recognize that under certain circumstances, it may be appropriate to record more limited data. However, we encourage at least those engaged in general collecting to record as many of these standard data as possible.\n      </p>", "Dopamine (DA) produces a natriuretic/diuretic response in the kidney by mechanisms that are still not well understood. There is some indication that DA2 receptors may be involved in mediating the effects of DA, but little is known regarding the nature of this receptor in the kidney. Autoradiographic localization of [3H]spiperone, a DA2 antagonist, indicated that high-density binding was restricted to inner medullary collecting ducts (IMCDs). [3H]spiperone binding was saturable, high affinity (Kd, 17.2 \u00b1 1.65 nM), and high density (Bmax, 935 \u00b1 83 fmol per mg of protein). The photosensitive spiperone analogue N-(p-azido-m-[125]Iiodophenethyl)spiperone labeled similar sized proteins of Mr \u2248 120,000 in membranes prepared from the kidney inner medulla, striatum, and pituitary. However, the rank-order competition profile for the [3H]spiperone binding in the kidney inner medulla differed from the DA2 receptor in striatum and pituitary and, furthermore, RNA (Northern) blot analyses of kidney inner medullary RNA with brain DA2 receptor oligonucleotide probes were negative. Functionally, DA stimulated prostaglandin E2 production by IMCD cells, an effect that could be blocked by the DA2 antagonist domperidone. These results indicate that the kidney inner medulla expresses a functional DA receptor that may represent a newly identified DA receptor subtype (here designated DA2K). Moreover, these results suggest that the kidney inner medulla may be a significant site at which DA, either directly or indirectly, influences water and electrolyte excretion.\n      </p>", "A plant collecting expedition to Nyika National Park, Malawi/Zambia, was completed from 22 March to 10 April 2000 by more than twenty botanists from the southern and eastern African countries of Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The expedition formed part of the SABONET Project which is aimed at developing a strong core of professional botanists, taxonomists and plant diversity specialists competent to inventory and conserve the botanical diversity of the southern African region. During this expedition, 3,343 plant numbers were collected, with preliminary results indicating many new distribution and locality records both for Nyika National Park and the Flora Zambesiaca area. /// Une exp\u00e9dition dans le Parc National Nyika, Malawi/Zambie, en vue de r\u00e9colter des \u00e9chantillons de plantes, a \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9e du 22 mars au 10 avril 2000 par plus de vingt botanistes d'Afrique australe et de l'est originaires du Malawi, du Mozambique, d'Afrique du Sud, de Tanzanie, de Zambie et du Zimbabwe.

We evaluated whether collectors who use destructive methods to harvest individual animals threaten reptile populations in Arizona, USA. Destructive methods usually involve permanent damage to cracks and crevices in rock outcrops that provide moist, cool shelter sites for reptiles. We surveyed 80 rock outcrops in an area slated for development. We treated half of the rock outcrops by imitating the activities of collectors using pry bars to overturn rocks and break open cracks, and we then resurveyed the rock outcrops. Multivariate repeated-measures analysis revealed that damaged rock outcrops support fewer reptiles than undamaged outcrops. We also observed species, sex, age-class, and seasonal effects due to treatment. To combat the growing problem of habitat destruction from reptile harvest, we recommend protection of rock outcrops and education of reptile collectors.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

In order for in vitro collecting to be broadly available as a technique for collecting plant germplasm, the levels of contamination in such cultures must be controlled. Two techniques for in vitro collecting were compared: leaf punch and needle collecting. The effectiveness of these methods for collecting leaf and stem tissues from plants at tropical and temperate sites was compared. Stem tissue collected by the needle collecting method gave cultures with an average contamination percentage of 31% and 16%, from the tropical and temperate sites, respectively, while with the leaf punch method, average contamination percentages were 90% and 69%. The effectiveness of antimicrobial agents in reducing contamination in leaf punch cultures was evaluated. Addition of the fungicide benlate and the antibiotics, cefotaxime and vancomycin, to the leaf punch collections reduced contamination to an average of 30% in the tropical collections and 35% in the temperate collections. Over 90% of both tropical and temperate species collected in multiple samples of 10 or more had at least one clean sample using this medium. The use of either the leaf punch method in combination with a fungicide and antibiotics or the needle collecting technique yielded a high percentage of clean tissues for study and growth.\n      </p>", "To address the question of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) I localization and synthesis in kidney, we used two complementary experimental approaches: immunohistochemistry of fixed paraffinembedded rat kidney sections; and measurement of IGF I mRNA in isolated components of the rat nephron, using a highly sensitive and specific solution hybridization assay. Immunostainable IGF I was localized exclusively to principal cells of cortical and medullary collecting ducts. Administration of growth hormone to hypophysectomized rats for 8 d resulted in enhanced immunohistochemical staining of IGF I within collecting ducts, but no detectable IGF I in other portions of the nephron. The abundance of IGF I mRNA was 7-12-fold higher in isolated papillary collecting ducts than in proximal tubules or glomeruli, and was enriched 10-fold compared with whole kidney. Our data demonstrate colocalization of IGF I and IGF I mRNA in the collecting duct, consistent with focal expression of the IGF I gene at this site.\n      </p>", "\t\t\t\t\t     \t\t For individual subscriptions, please contact the  <a href=\"http://www.ucpressjournals.com/journalBuy.asp?j=cond\">University of California Press</a>\n\t\t\t      \t    \t\t\t . \n\t\t           \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "\t\t\t\t\t     \t\t For individual subscriptions, please contact the  <a href=\"http://www.ucpressjournals.com/journalBuy.asp?j=cond\">University of California Press</a>\n\t\t\t      \t    \t\t\t . \n\t\t           \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "The current state of knowledge of canopy invertebrates in tropical rain forests is reviewed using data drawn, without bias toward taxon, collecting method or biogeographical region, from 89 studies concerned with mass-collecting (&amp;gt1000 individuals). The review is intended to identify the most serious gaps and biases in the distribution of higher taxa among forest types and biogeographical regions. With respect to knowledge, biogeographical regions can be ranked as Neotropical &amp;gt Australian &amp;gt Oriental &amp;gt Afrotropical. The canopy of lowland wet and subtropical forests has been studied in greater detail, whereas the canopy of lowland dry and montane forests is much less well known. Collecting techniques influence greatly the present knowledge of canopy invertebrates. Invertebrates other than arthropods, often abundant in epiphytic habitats, phytotelmata and perched litter, are virtually unknown. The abundance of several groups, such as Acari, Collembola and Isoptera, is almost certainly seriously underestimated. Densities of invertebrate individuals in the canopy of tropical rain forests appear to be lower than in temperate forests, although invertebrate abundance is dissipated by the high standing-biomass of rain forests. Coleoptera, particularly Staphylinidae, Curculionidae and Chrysomelidae, along with Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera and Araneae appear to be the most speciose taxa in the canopy, and it is probable that this reflects their range of feeding habits and exploitation of rain forests habitats. The distribution of individuals among the major arthropod orders and across the studies examined is complex and depends on many factors. The amount of variance that can be directly explained by biogeography, forest types (subtropical, wet, dry or montane), or collecting methods appears to be about 11%. The explained variance increases when considering major families of Coleoptera (28%) or subfamilies of Chrysomelidae (40%). In all cases, the variance explained by the type of forest is much higher than by that explained by biogeography. These conclusions are similar when considering various prey-predator relationships in the canopy. This suggests that, at the higher taxa level, the composition of the invertebrate fauna in the canopy may vary comparatively more across forest types than across biogeographical regions and this is discussed briefly from a conservation viewpoint.\n      </p>", "The pollen-collecting behavior of three species of the South American Andean bee genus Brachyglossula is reported. Species studied are B. martinezi Trucco Alem\u00e1n, B. communis Trucco Alem\u00e1n, and B. ancasti Roig Alsina and Schlumpberger, new species. The new species, which is comparatively described and illustrated, inhabits the isolated mountain range of Sierra de Ancasti, in the province of Catamarca, Argentina. Observation of the bees in the field, and pollen counts from scopal loads strongly support specialization of these bees on the Cactaceae. Members of both major cactus subfamilies, the Opuntioideae and the Cactoideae, are frequently visited and represented in the pollen loads.\n      </p>", "Taphonomic processes affecting samples of amber inclusions are outlined. Comparison of traditional collecting methods dependent on human recognition of amber nodules (hereafter called picking) with bulk sampling, screening and salt water floatation indicate that significant amounts of amber are overlooked by traditional methods. Picking over-represents large nodules and under-represents small ones. This is significant because small nodules produce the highest number of inclusions per kilogram. Although small nodules have the lowest trapping efficiency, this liability is more than compensated for by their abundance and high proportion of external flows. Bulk screened samples produce more inclusions per kilogram of amber with lower between-sample variation. The proposed sampling method, if universally applied, would eliminate investigator bias in amber samples and establish a baseline for standardizing quantification of amber faunas. Bulk sampling and assessment of diversity per kilogram of amber allow more accurate estimation of total arthropod fauna through taxon/mass curves. Completeness of sampling can be estimated through evaluation of standard errors of species abundance as mass of amber increases. Consequently, community structure and organization can be more accurately described and compared with extant communities or other amber faunas, and changes in terrestrial arthropod diversity over time can be more accurately measured.\n      </p>", "The Colletes fasciatus-group is endemic to the winter rainfall area of western South Africa and comprises about 35 species with 11 of them having reduced female scopae. These species very probably carry pollen for nest provision in their crop. Two stages of scopa reduction can be distinguished possibly representing consecutive steps towards a total loss of specialized hairs on the hind legs. Microscopical analysis of pollen collected by females of species with developed scope and a review of published data revealed a strong preference for Aizoaceae that have small to very small pollen grains. A hypothetical scenario for the evolution of scopa reduction is discussed based on flower preferences and considering the harsh environmental conditions during the flowering season in winter and early spring.\n      </p>", "The secondary structural compositions of the human erythrocyte glucose transporter in proteoliposome vesicles were assessed on the basis of circular dichroism (CD) spectra measured in the absence and in the presence of D-glucose or an inhibitor, cytochalasin B. We designed and used a scattered-light-collecting device, which corrects CD spectra for optical artifacts originating from light scattering. Relative contents of eight types of secondary structure were estimated by using basis spectra generated by the eigenvector method based on CD spectra of 15 proteins of known structure. Results indicate that the glucose transporter is composed of approximately 82% \u03b1 -helices, 10% \u03b2 -turns, and 8% other random structure, with no \u03b2 -strands. In the presence of an excess of D-glucose, the \u03b1 -helical content is reduced by more than 10% and there is a significant increase in the random structure content. Cytochalasin B does not appear to affect the secondary structural composition of the transporter to any significant degree.\n      </p>", "The aim of this study was to develop an in vitro system in which we could study the causal relationship between short-term stimulation of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase in the collecting tubule by aldosterone on the one hand and protein synthesis and changes in intracellular Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration on the other hand. Previous in vivo studies suggested that triiodo-thyronine might facilitate aldosterone-induced stimulation of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase. Results show that when segments of cortical collecting tubules microdissected from collagenase-treated kidneys of adrenalectomized rats were incubated for 3 hr in the presence of either 10&lt;sup&gt;-8&lt;/sup&gt; M aldosterone or 10&lt;sup&gt;-8&lt;/sup&gt; M triiodothyronine alone Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase activity was not altered, whereas the addition of both hormones markedly stimulated the activity and the number of catalytic sites sites of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase. This stimulation was abolished by actinomycin D and cycloheximide, whereas it was not altered in the absence of extracellular sodium or in the presence of the luminal Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-channel blocker amiloride. Thus, triiodothyronine facilitates the in vitro induction of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase synthesis by aldosterone.

Oil-collecting bees harvest oil from host flowers by rubbing their forelegs against oil-secreting trichomes. Significant differences in foreleg length occur among populations of both species. Rediviva \"pallidula\" populations vary significantly in mean foreleg length (11.34 \u00b1 0.42 mm to 12.67 \u00b1 0.36 mm), but not in body length (10.59 \u00b1 0.74 to 10.80 \u00b1 0.64), and foreleg length and body size are not significantly correlated. Instead, foreleg variation appears to be a function of host plant spur length. Ninety-two percent of the variance in foreleg length of R. \"pallidula\" is explained by mean Diascia spur length. Rediviva rufocincta populations vary significantly in mean foreleg length (10.12 \u00b1 0.70 mm to 12.34 \u00b1 0.68 mm) and in body length (9.03 \u00b1 0.26 mm to 10.56 \u00b1 0.24 mm). Foreleg length scales allometrically with body size in this species as 90.5% of the variance in foreleg length can be explained as a function of body length. Body size appears to be constrained by the morphology of the oil-secreting host plant. Both bees collect floral oil with specially modified setae on the tarsi of their forelegs. The length of the disti- + mediotarsus (refered to here as \"tarsus\") in relation to the entire foreleg is shorter in R. rufocincta and does not increase as rapidly with increasing foreleg length as for R. \"pallidula.\" These differences in variation can be attributed to differences in position of oil within the flowers of the respective host plants. Rediviva \"pallidula\" collects oil from Diascia species that have the oil deeply situated in narrow floral spurs of varying length, while R. rufocincta collects oil from the broadly saccate flowers of Bowkeria verticillata and B. citrina.\n      </p>", "Collecting art during the nineteenth century served to show that America was not a cultural backwater.

Previously, we observed that the activity of the channel is stimulated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA)-induced channel phosphorylation. We now have applied the patch-clamp technique to study the effects of protein kinase C (PKC) on the secretory K+ channel of rat CCD. In cell-attached patches, application of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate progressively reduced the open probability and current amplitude of the K+ channel. In inside-out patches, administration of PKC reversibly decreased the channel open probability (Po) without changing the channel conductance. The PKC-induced inhibition of channel activity was Ca2+ dependent: Po decreased 42%, 23%, and 11% in the presence of 1000 nM, 100 nM, and 10 nM free Ca2+, respectively. We also demonstrate that PKC antagonizes the stimulatory effect of PKA on the apical K+ secretory channel of rat CCD. These results suggest regulation of K+-channel activity by two separate sites of phosphorylation with distinct and opposite effects on channel activity.\n      </p>", "Although the collecting duct is regarded as the primary site at which mineralocorticoids regulate renal sodium transport in the kidney, recent evidence points to the distal convoluted tubule as a possible site of mineralocorticoid action. To investigate whether mineralocorticoids regulate the expression of the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter (TSC), the chief apical sodium entry pathway of distal convoluted tubule cells, we prepared an affinity-purified, peptide-directed antibody to TSC. On immunoblots, the antibody recognized a prominent 165-kDa band in membrane fractions from the renal cortex but not from the renal medulla. Immunofluorescence immunocytochemistry showed TSC labeling only in distal convoluted tubule cells. Semiquantitative immunoblotting studies demonstrated a large increase in TSC expression in the renal cortex of rats on a low-NaCl diet (207 \u00b1 21% of control diet). Immunofluorescence localization in tissue sections confirmed the strong increase in TSC expression. Treatment of rats for 10 days with a continuous subcutaneous infusion of aldosterone also increased TSC expression (380 \u00b1 58%) of controls). Furthermore, 7-day treatment of rats with an orally administered mineralocorticoid, fludrocortisone, increased TSC expression (656 \u00b1 114% of controls). We conclude that the distal convoluted tubule is an important site of action of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone, which strongly up-regulates the expression of TSC.\n      </p>", "The light and, to a lesser extent, the dark cells of the cortical collecting tubules in mouse kidney contain a great number of granules which according to histochemical tests are composed of phospholipids and proteins. These granules are bounded by a triple-layered membrane measuring approximately 75 A across, and contain one or several crystals with a hexagonal or square lattice. These crystals are built up of rod-shaped units, which appear dense after osmium fixation, measure about 48 A in diameter, and are separated by a light interspace of similar dimensions. The mean center-to-center distance of the rods is about 96 A. The structure is explained as a lipoprotein crystallized within a membrane-bounded vacuole. No relationship between these granules and mitochondria was found. The physiological significance of the granules remains unknown.\n      </p>", "ABSTRACT The linking of a series of nineteenth-century collections of a prominent Belgian family reveals more than just the outlines of the cultures of nineteenth-century collecting.

Since the availability of viable seed cannot always be assured during botanical expeditions, a simple tissue culture method was developed to allow the collection of living vegetative material from the field. Field-testing of this culture method in western Mexico resulted in 10% overall shoot formation from six Gossypium species; seed was not available from four of these species. Rooting the cuttings was possible, but more effective rooting procedures need to be developed for general utilization by field botanists, at least with Gossypium.

Ouabain had no influence on these changes. In the absence of net water flow intercellular width was unaffected when tubules were swollen in hypotonic external media. Therefore, during ADH-induced flow widening of intercellular spaces is not a consequence of osmotic swelling of a closed intercellular compartment containing trapped solutes, but rather is due to flow of solution through the channel. Direct evidence of intercellular flow was obtained. Nonperfused tubules swollen in hypotonic media were reimmersed in isotonic solution with resultant entry of water into intercellular spaces. The widened spaces gradually collapsed completely. Spaces enlarged in this manner could be emptied more rapidly by increasing the transtubular hydrostatic pressure difference. In electron micrographs a path of exit of sufficient width to accommodate the observed rate of fluid flow was seen at the base of the intercellular channel. It is concluded that the intercellular spaces communicate with the external extracellular fluid and that water, having entered the cells across the luminal plasma membrane in response in ADH, leaves the cells by osmosis across both the lateral and basilar surface membranes.\n      </p>", "If biological collections tend to be taken near accessible areas, and the number of such areas is limited, then we should expect a similar spatial distribution of collecting effort across taxa. Alternatively, if researchers working on a given taxon pick collection localities based on idiosyncratic criteria, then there should be no spatial similarity in collecting effort. This study compares the spatial distribution of collecting effort for plants and birds in Amazonia. Collection localities were transformed into a Thiessen network where polygon size works as a surrogate for collecting effort. A correlation between botanical and ornithological datasets, with an adjustment for spatial autocorrelation, showed little congruence in the spatial distribution of collecting effort between the two taxa. This incongruence of the distribution of collection effort among taxa suggests that the identification of priority areas for research, and correction for Wallacean and Linnean shortfalls based on taxon-specific studies, should not be generalized.\n      </p>", "The recently naturalized oil-collecting bee Centris n\u00edtida pollinates the cultivated Oncidium sphacelatum in southern Florida. Female C. nitida bees seeking food are the pollinators of this food deceit orchid, which appears to mimic species of Malpighiaceae, which have oil rewards collected by the bee. The fruit set rate ranged from 0.54% to 3.0% and averaged 1.49%, which is many times higher than the 0.0% and 0.25% reported for this orchid in its native Mexico. The many capsules produced (66 fruits in the three large exposed plants in this study) contain many millions of seed. The large number of seeds produced could promote the naturalization of O. sphacelatum in Florida if suitable mycorrhizae are present. Centris n\u00edtida and O. sphacelatum are broadly sympatric in tropical America and may interact in their native area.

The capability for nephron induction is lost and the epithelium develops into a heterogeneously composed epithelium consisting of principal and intercalated cells. Part of this development can be mimicked under in vitro conditions, when embryonic collecting duct epithelia are isolated from neonatal rabbit kidneys and kept under perfusion culture. The differentiation pattern is quite different when the embryonic collecting duct epithelia are cultured in standard Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium as compared to medium supplemented with additional NaCl. Thus, the differentiation behavior of embryonic CD epithelia is unexpectedly sensitive. To obtain more information about how much influence the medium has on cell differentiation, we tested medium 199, basal medium Eagle, Williams' medium E, McCoys 5A medium, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium under serum-free conditions. The experiments show that in general, all of the tested media are suitable for culturing embryonic collecting duct epithelia. According to morphological criteria, there is no difference in morphological epithelial cell preservation. The immunohistochemical data reveal two groups of expressed antigens. Constitutively expressed antigens such as cytokeratin 19, $P_{CD} 9$ , Na/K ATPase, and laminin are present in all cells of the epithelia independent of the culture media used. In contrast, a group of antigens detected by mab 703, mab 503, and PNA is found only in individual series.

Participants: A telephone survey was held with 563 Californians, including 105 whites, 97 blacks, 199 Hispanics (162 Spanishspeaking), 129 Asians (73 Chinese-speaking), and 33 multiracial individuals. Measures: Attitudes towards HCPs asking patients their race/ethnicity and preferred language, concerns about providing their own information, reactions to statements explaining the rationale for data collection, and attitudes towards possible policies. Results: Most (87.8%) somewhat or strongly agreed that HCPs should collect race/ethnicity information and use this to monitor disparities, and 73.6% supported state legislation requiring this. Support for collection of patients' preferred language was even higher. However, 17.2% were uncomfortable (score 1-4 on 10-point scale) reporting their own race/ethnicity, and 46.3% of participants were somewhat or very worried that providing information could be used to discriminate against them. In addition, 35.9% of Hispanics were uncomfortable reporting their English proficiency. All statements explaining the rationale for data collection modestly increased participants' comfort level; the statement that this would be used for staff training increased comfort the most. Conclusions: Although most surveyed believe that HCPs should collect information about race/ethnicity and language, many feel uncomfortable giving this information and worry it could be misused. Statements explaining the rationale for collecting data may assuage concerns, but community engagement and legislation to prevent misuse may be needed to gain more widespread trust and comfort.\n      </p>", "With recent advances in molecular techniques, collecting blood from birds has become a common practice among field ornithologists. There are a variety of techniques for collecting blood samples and numerous caveats for how samples should be processed, depending on the research question being asked. Currently, few resources are available for individuals learning how to collect blood from birds or needing more information about how to process blood samples. Here, I describe commonly used methods for collecting, processing, and storing blood for particular research objectives, and provide answers to frequently asked questions about blood collection.

These organs are formed by various arrays of single rows of highly specialized setae, compound rows of little modified setae, and pads of fine, branched setae. Structure and position of the oil-collecting organs is correlated with the types of floral elaiophores (oil glands) utilized by different bees. Basitarsal combs of specialized setae predominant in the Centridini, a group which appears to be primitively associated with flowers having epithelial elaiophores. Compound combs of simple setae and setal pads predominate in the Exomalopsini and are apparently primitively associated with plant taxa having trichome elaiophores. Loss of oil collection, as well as radiation onto alternate types of oil hosts, has occurred in both tribes. The role of Monoeca as a possible connecting link between the Exomalopsini and the Centridini is discussed. Oil-collecting behavior of Tetrapedia is described for the first time as are unusual tarsal and abdominal setal arrays in two subgenera of Tapinotaspis. Possible roles of the floral oils in the biology of oil-collecting bees and implications for both the evolution and loss of oil-collecting structures are discussed.\n      </p>", "The traditional methods for developing collecting policies do not work well in social history archives. Because social history archives typically have less than complete knowledge of the records available in their collecting universe, coherent guidance, flexibility, and a means for ongoing reassessment become equally important requirements of an effective collecting policy.

Remarkably, the first preformative (= first prebasic) molt is complete in Lucy's Warblers, including the replacement of flight feathers, primary coverts, and rectrices; thus, previous aging criteria based on the wear and appearance of these feathers are invalid. We suggest that the recent conclusion that Lucy's Warblers molt on their breeding grounds (Voelker and McFarland 2002) is an artifact of more collecting in the southwestern United States than in western Mexico during late summer. An index of relative collecting in Mexico and the United States, as well as data from constant-effort mist netting, suggest that most Lucy's Warblers move south to molt. /// Nuevos espec\u00edmenes de Sinaloa, M\u00e9xico, y dos especimenes m\u00e1s antiguos, muestran que tanto los adultos como los juveniles reci\u00e9n emplumados de Vermivora luciae se mueven frecuentemente hacia el sur de su \u00e1rea de distribuci\u00f3n reproductiva para mudar en los bosques deciduous tropicales del noroeste de M\u00e9xico.

The contraluminal, but not the luminal, membrane was found to contain antidiuretic hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclase. The luminal membrane was found to contain a cyclic 3\u2032:5\u2032-adenosine monophosphate-sensitive self-phosphorylating system consisting of a membrane-bound protein kinase and its membrane-bound substrate(s); this intrinsic protein kinase was not present in the contraluminal membrane. These findings provide direct evidence that the initiating steps in the action of antidiuretic hormone on the kidney take place at the contraluminal pole of the hormone-sensitive target cell and that the late or terminal steps occur at the luminal pole, where they involve an alteration in the level of membrane phosphorylation.\n      </p>", "Recent scholarship has investigated the rate of deterioration of the Great Barrier Reef of Australia since European settlement and the severity of human impacts on that ecosystem. Yet in previous environmental histories of the Great Barrier Reef, the impacts of coral collecting have not been adequately documented. Using documentary and oral history sources, a reconstruction of historical coral collecting is possible; analysis of those sources indicates that the extent, duration and intensity of coral collecting led to profound transformations of some coral reefs, with particular degradation at Double, Green, Heron, Masthead and Lady Musgrave Islands, and at Wistari Reef. That degradation was due to the combined impacts of prolonged, cumulative coral souveniring by tourists and to the removal of large amounts of material by commercial collectors. Although coral collecting has been restricted since 1933, both licensed and unlicensed collecting continued after that year. Extensive documentary evidence indicates that coral collecting was accompanied by the deterioration of coral reefs; those documentary accounts are supported by oral history evidence. Evaluation of the precise impacts of coral collectors in the Great Barrier Reef requires further scientific research and monitoring, although comparison with other coral reef ecosystems suggests that those impacts are likely to have been severe.\n      </p>", "An efficient field method for rapidly collecting feather lice from large numbers of dead or living birds is described.

This record, which has not been analyzed or depicted in prior publications, was created by Locker, who was a naval administrator, a pioneering museum curator, and an amateur artist. It takes the form of a pair of handheld screens, a type of collection catalogue that has gone almost entirely unnoticed in studies of the history of collecting. The images on the screens reveal how one family used the domestic display of art to mark a tradition of naval service and to construct their identity as imperial citizens. The screens not only provide evidence of how art was hung in early nineteenth-century homes but also suggest how viewers interacted with that art. These portable keys to the collection likely served as cues to conversations about national and family history.\n      </p>", "We re-evaluate the plausibility that five species of birds that breed in late summer in northwestern Mexico are migratory double breeders that first bred earlier in the same season to the north. We use data aggregated from scientific collections to generate abundance indices that adjust counts of specimens in collections by collecting effort, which we measure as the number of passerines collected in the same region and time period as the species of interest. Our abundance indices generally show displaced phenologies, such that presumed double breeders arrive and breed early in the north, then later in northwestern Mexico. We also compare breeding records for these regions, but these records could not be corrected for effort. Our phenologies suggest that the breeding populations of the Yellow-billed Cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus) from the western U.S. and northwestern Mexico may be derived from birds that bred earlier in eastern North America. Similarly, Orchard Orioles (Icterus spurius) breeding in late summer in northwestern Mexico and on the Mexican plateau may be derived from birds that attempted to breed earlier in North America. Our abundance indices and other new data suggest migratory double breeding is less likely in the Hooded Oriole (I. cucullatus) and probably not occurring in the Yellow-breasted Chat (Icteria virens) and Cassin's Vireo (Vireo cassinii).\n         Reevaluamos la posibilidad de que cinco especies de aves que se reproducen al final del verano en el noroeste de M\u00e9xico son reproductores dobles migratorios que anidan primero m\u00e1s temprano en la misma estaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s al norte.

Fluorescence quenching measurements showed that the isolated vesicles maintained a high, HgCl2-sensitive water permeability, consistent with the presence of vasopressin-sensitive water channels. They did not, however, exhibit ATP-dependent luminal acidification, nor any N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive ATPase activity, properties that are characteristic of most acidic endosomal compartments. Western blotting with specific antibodies showed that the 31- and 70-kD cytoplasmically oriented subunits of the vacuolar proton pump were not detectable in these apical endosomes from the papilla, whereas they were present in endosomes prepared in parallel from the cortex. In contrast, the 56-kD subunit of the proton pump was abundant in papillary endosomes, and was localized at the apical pole of principal cells by immunocytochemistry. Finally, an antibody that recognizes the 16-kD transmembrane subunit of oat tonoplast ATPase cross-reacted with a distinct 16-kD band in cortical endosomes, but no 16-kD band was detectable in endosomes from the papilla. This antibody also recognized a 16-kD band in affinity-purified H+ ATPase preparations from bovine kidney medulla. Therefore, early endosomes derived from the apical plasma membrane of collecting duct principal cells fail to acidify because they lack functionally important subunits of a vacuolar-type proton pumping ATPase, including the 16-kD transmembrane domain that serves as the proton-conducting channel, and the 70-kD cytoplasmic subunit that contains the ATPase catalytic site. This specialized, non-acidic early endosomal compartment appears to be involved primarily in the hormonally induced recycling of water channels to and from the apical plasma membrane of vasopressin-sensitive cells in the kidney collecting duct.\n      </p>", "This paper presents the structure and properties of a total stream model that simulates the dynamics of small, flowing-water ecosystems in the northwestern United States. Conceptually, the model is hierarchically structured, consisting of 7 basic processes: periphyton dynamics, grazing, shredding, collecting, invertebrate predation, vertebrate predation, and detrital conditioning. These processes are subprocesses of 3 echelons of higher level processes: detritivory; herbivory; primary consumption; predation; and the total ecosystem. The model has 14 state variables in the 7 basic processes, and is conceptualized in discrete time with a basic time step corresponding to 1 day. Behavior of the stream model relative to different schedules of energy inputs and to the practice of clear-cut logging was investigated and related to contemporary theory of lotic ecosystems. In general, model behavior indicated that the regulation of biological processes in streams is complex, the mechanisms of which vary seasonally and from process to process. If a process is regulated by food supply, its annual production tends to increase as predation increases, while mean biomass may or may not be affected appreciably. In contrast, an increase in predation tends to decrease both mean biomass and annual production in processes regulated primarily by predation and such life history phenomena as insects emergence. The stream model provided the stimulus that led to a mathematical expression for the rate of production at the level of the entire ecosystem, and model behavior suggests that this rate tends to remain constant along a continuum from small, first-order streams with no tributaries to larger rivers which eventually drain into the sea.\n      </p>", "In September 1901, Professor L.

The individuals who created these enterprises simultaneously helped to promote and hoped to profit from the burgeoning interest in both scientific and popular specimen collecting. At a time when other employment and educational prospects in natural history were severely limited, hundreds of dealers across the nation provided encouragement, specimens, publication outlets, training opportunities, and jobs for naturalists of all motivations and levels of expertise. This paper explores the crucial role that specimen dealers played in the larger natural history community. After briefly examining the development of local taxidermy shops in the mid-nineteenth century, it then traces the history of four large natural history dealerships established in the United States during the latter half of the century: Ward's Natural History Establishment, Frank Blake Webster's Naturalists' Supply Depot, Southwick &amp; Jencks' Natural History Store, and Frank H. Lattin &amp; Co. By the early twentieth century, changing tastes in interior design, the growth of the Audubon movement, and the dramatic expansion of alternate training and job opportunities for naturalists led many specimen dealers either to shift their emphasis or to shut their doors.\n      </p>", "Throughout his life, Alejo Carpentier was a tireless collector of paintings, sculpture, musical recordings, and folklore objects. In light of Carpentier's Swiss birth and many years of residence outside of Cuba, the act of collecting plays a crucial role in defining the relationship between the author and Latin American culture in his life and work. This article first examines the significance of Carpentier's drive to collect objects from Latin America. It then argues that while Carpentier's fascination with collecting originates in surrealist techniques of juxtaposing incongruent items for artistic impact, his accumulation of objects ultimately fuels his conception of lo barroco americano. Finally, it demonstrates the centrality of collecting in Carpentier's novelistic work, most importantly in Los pasos perdidos (1953).\n      </p>", "Most ethno-archaeological research involves the study of single communities over short time periods. As archaeology endeavors to appreciate the processes of change over extended periods of time it is important to obtain insights into the dynamics of past communities by studying comparable communities over periods long enough to delineate significant changes in site formation, uses of material culture and reactions to environmental, economic, and political stimuli. The study of the Ghanaian village of Hani, the successor community to the medieval town of Begho (ca.

Polyclonal anti-peptide antibodies directed against two regions of murine erythroid band 3 gave a pattern of basolateral labeling similar to that seen with antibodies directed against the entire protein. In the medullary collecting duct almost all intercalated cells expressed basolateral membrane band 3 and displayed apical membrane H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase. In the cortical collecting duct and the connecting segment, band 3 labeling was restricted to a subpopulation of intercalated cells.

Squires in early 1896 to the lower R\u00edo Orinoco, Venezuela, was sponsored by The Orinoco Company Limited, which was promoted by many residents of Faribault, Rice Co., Minnesota, U.S.A. In February 1896, the company formed an exploring party in order to map a large concession of approximately 10,000,000 acres that they had received from the Venezuelan government and to prospect the mineral deposits, study the vegetation, and ascertain the conditions affecting colonization of the concession. The botanical work was entrusted to Rusby, who, with the assistance of Squires and an unnamed laborer from Trinidad, collected almost 500 numbers of vascular plants in sets as large as thirty-two. Rusby indicated that he spent only 51 days in the field and lost a week of that time to an accident that befell the explorers. He was less constrained than the Minnesotans (who were promoting development), and he wrote that botanical exploration was hampered also by the inundation of the forest and savannahs with each tide, the lack of trails, and the large numbers of annoying insects and poisonous snakes. An annotated catalog of 43 new taxa of vascular plants based on Rusby and Squire's collection is provided. Lectotypes are designated for Tachigalia rusbyi Harms (Fabaceae), Cupania semidentata Radlk.

CHF was induced by left coronary artery ligation. Compared with sham-operated animals, rats with CHF had severe heart failure with elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressures (LVEDP): 26.9 \u00b1 3.4 vs. 4.1 \u00b1 0.3 mmHg, and reduced plasma sodium concentrations (142.2 \u00b1 1.6 vs. 149.1 \u00b1 1.1 mEq/liter). Quantitative immunoblotting of total kidney membrane fractions revealed a significant increase in AQP2 expression in animals with CHF (267 \u00b1 53%, n = 12) relative to sham-operated controls (100 \u00b1 13%, n = 14). In contrast, immunoblotting demonstrated a lack of an increase in expression of AQP1 and AQP3 water channel expression, indicating that the effect on AQP2 was selective. Furthermore, postinfarction animals without LVEDP elevation or plasma Na reduction showed no increase in AQP2 expression (121 \u00b1 28% of sham levels, n = 6). Immunocytochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated very abundant labeling of the apical plasma membrane and relatively little labeling of intracellular vesicles in collecting duct cells from rats with severe CHF, consistent with enhanced trafficking of AQP2 to the apical plasma membrane. The selective increase in AQP2 expression and enhanced plasma membrane targeting provide an explanation for the development of water retention and hyponatremia in severe CHF.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

In his writings from South America and the Malay Archipelago (1848-1852, 1854-1862). Wallace consistently emphasized species and genera, and separated these descriptions from his rarer and briefer discussions of individual organisms. In contrast, Darwin's writings during the Beagle voyage (1831-1836) emphasized individual organisms, and mingled descriptions of individuals and groups. The contrast is explained by the different practices of the two naturalists in the field. Wallace and Darwin went to the field with different educational experiences and social connections, constrained by different responsibilities and theoretical interests. These in turn resulted in different natural history practices; i.e., different habits and working routines in the field. Wallace's intense collecting activities aimed at a complete inventory of different species and their distributions at many localities. Darwin's less intense collecting practice focused on detailed observations of individual organisms. These different practices resulted in different material, textual and conceptual products. Placing natural history practices at the center of analysis reveals connections among these diverse products, and throws light on Wallace and Darwin's respective treatment of individuals and groups in natural history. In particular, this approach clarifies the relation between individuals and groups in Wallace's theory of natural selection, and provides an integrative starting point for further investigations of the broader social factors that shaped Victorian natural history practices and their scientific products.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Employer-worker matched data, data containing information about workers and their employing establishments, provide a beneficial data source for organizational sociologists.

This article describes three methods of collecting employer-worker matched data and the benefits and drawbacks associated with each method. I highlight how researchers can use matched data by linking each method with specific research goals. In doing so, I pay particular attention to the ways researchers can use matched data to improve our understanding of inequality in the workplace.\n      </p>", "The nature of contemporary classical collecting is explored by studying seven celebrated new collections and exhibitions. The concept of provenance is defined in terms of an object's origins, or findspot, and its modern story, or history. The several hundred objects in these collections are analyzed in terms of their findspot and history since unearthing. These show that the dismaying picture previously demonstrated for Cycladic antiquities applies to classical objects across the board: the overwhelming majority have no declared or credible findspots and simply surface as orphans without history. Some of the many material aspects of this central fact are explored.\n      </p>", "This paper seeks to provide a preliminary study of the Greek embroidery collecting of R.M. Dawkins and A.J.B. Wace, who between them collected over 1200 pieces of embroidery during their years in Greece from 1902 to 1923. Dawkins and Wace's sources of purchase, collecting methodologies, academic influences, cataloguing, research and interpretation of their embroideries are described, using contemporary archives and publications, and concluding with an account of the dispersal and disposal of their collections. Through re-evaluating Dawkins and Wace's methods and motives in collecting embroideries, another facet of the BSA's early work in Greece is examined.\n      </p>", "An electric fence, used as the principal collecting method in a study of terrestrial vertebrates in Sinaloa, Mexico, is described.

The fence, which is both inexpensive and easily portable, has unique potential for capturing rare or secretive animals.\n      </p>", "Twelve collecting sites, all located on privately owned land and representing a total of six salvadorean departamentos, are described with respect to altitude, clinal zone, traveling time from San Salvador and general floristic attributes.\n      </p>", "The unique floral morphology of the South African orchid H. pulchra, with its twin meranthia, is best explained as an adaptation to pollination by oil-collecting bees. Flowers consisting of meranthia (floral parts that function as single pollination units; commonly observed in garden Iris) are extremely rare among the angiosperms and their significance poorly understood. Unlike all other known examples of meranthia, the novel type described for H. pulchra is not bilabiate. All Huttonaea species are unique in having twin petal sacs with glandular verrucae that secrete oil and are pollinated by Rediviva (Melittidae) oil-collecting bees. But only Huttonaea pulchra has long and widely divergent petal claws that place the oil sacs well beyond the reach of a centrally positioned bee. The wide separation of these sacs forces the pollinator, R. colorata, to visit each side of the flower independently and effectively divides the flower into two meranthia. Molecular data indicate that the evolution of the Huttonaea-type meranthium was dependent on the prior evolution of the oil flower/oil bee relationship. Meranthium evolution was also facilitated by the presence of oil in two separate structures (petal sacs) that were not physically constrained to remain in close proximity.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Based on primary field work carried out annually since 1992, the argument is advanced that even in a relatively small space, environment-society relationships are sufficiently complex to make the enterprises of empirical analysis and theory-building quite challenging. Yet, as this case study of informal resource use practices shows, it is precisely because environment-society relationships are so intertwined that a 'symmetrical' treatment of humans and non-human actors is required; one that takes us well beyond the traditional political ecology of Blaikie or Black, but which, I shall argue, does not escape it entirely. Through a detailed ethnographic account of herb and mushroom collecting I develop the idea of 'symmetry' in three distinct ways. First I will explore the by now well-publicised notion that non-humans can be actors too. Second this basic insight will be developed via the more advanced conceptualisation of entities such as Thrift's 'effloresences' or expressions of 'distributed' information spaces and applied to the case study of herb and mushroom collection in a southwestern Bulgarian locality. Finally I consider the theoretical and practical policy implications of this analysis for all concerned, but most particularly those who claim to 'manage' and 'regulate' human-forest interactions.\n
