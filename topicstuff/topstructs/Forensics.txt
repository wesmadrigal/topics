The heavy isotope content of precipitated water and snow ( $\\delta \\text{D}_{\\text{p}}$ , $\\delta {}^{18}\\text{O}{}_{\\text{p}}$ ) varies widely and systematically across the globe, providing a label that is incorporated through diet into animal tissue. As a result, these isotopes are potentially ideal tracers of geographic origin. The hydrogen and oxygen isotope tracer method has excellent potential where (1) spatial variation of precipitation isotopes exist, and (2) strong, mechanistic relationships link precipitation and isotope ratios in biological tissue. Here, we present a method for interpolation of precipitation isotope values and use it to create global basemaps of growing-season (GS) and mean annual (MA) $\\delta \\text{D}_{\\text{p}}$ and $\\delta {}^{18}\\text{O}{}_{\\text{p}}$ . The use of these maps for forensic application is demonstrated using previously published isotope data for bird feathers ( $\\delta \\text{D}_{\\text{f}}$ ) in North America and Europe. The precipitation maps show that the greatest potential for applying hydrogen and oxygen isotope forensics exists in mid- to high-latitude continental regions, where strong spatial isotope gradients exist. We demonstrate that $\\delta \\text{D}_{\\text{f}}/\\delta \\text{D}_{\\text{p}}$ relationships have significant predictive power both in North America and Europe, and show how zones of confidence for the assignment of origin can be described using these predictive relationships. Our analysis focuses on wildlife forensics, but the maps and approaches presented here will be equally applicable to criminal forensic studies involving biological materials. These maps are available in GIS format at http://www.waterisotopes.org.\n      </p>", "The use of short tandem repeats (STRs) for the identification of animals has developed alongside similar STR applications for humans. Population studies, kinship analysis, paternity testing, and unique identification have been applied to humans and many other animals. The field of forensic science has adapted this information extensively in the prosecution of suspected criminals with great success. The power of human DNA testing is demonstrated routinely by the convictions and exonerations of individuals. We discuss how the use of nonhuman DNA testing is beginning to find a place in the prosecution of individuals. Animal evidence can be an important element in a case when used to establish an association between a crime scene and a suspect or in crimes involving a specific animal. Although the testing of animal evidence may be routine, its use in court is far less common. As the presentation of animal evidence in court increases, appropriate standards and guidelines must be applied to assure the admissibility of the DNA testing results in court. This requires rigorous validation of precision and accuracy, allele heritability and independence, accurate sampling, evidence handling, and appropriate statistical evaluation of the results before the criminal courts will accept and apply the power of DNA testing in cases involving animals.\n      </p>", "We discuss and comment on the use of statistics in a number of topical issues in forensics and medicine. The forensic issues are scientific misconduct, DNA pattern matching, and causal analysis. In the biomedical area, particular statistical approaches are suggested for problems of mass screening, interim analysis, and the regulation of chronic diseases.\n      </p>", "High school teacher and forensics coach Lynette Williamson describes ways to teach writing-including on-demand essays-that draw on successful practices she developed in coaching.

Since text is \"authority\" and \"original\" and yet also \"network\" and \"tissue\" and since forensics encompasses both hard physical \"facts\" and the rhetorical formulation that gives such data interpretive meaning, a textual forensics will codify and test the interaction of the phenomenological world and the hermeneutic analysis of its evidence. With procedural and conceptual links both to scientific empiricism and to rhetorical strategies for persuasion, textual scholarship becomes a vehicle for anatomizing the postmodernist breakdown of the master narratives, including that of evidence and proof.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "The importance of wood for human societies can hardly be understated. If dry wood were amenable to molecular genetic investigations, this could lead to major applications in wood forensics, certification, archaeology and palaeobotany. To evaluate the potential of wood for molecular genetic investigations, we have attempted to isolate and amplify, by PCR, DNA fragments of increasing size corresponding to all three plant genomes from different regions of 10 oak logs. Stringent procedures to avoid contamination with external DNA were used in order to demonstrate the authenticity of the fragments amplified. This authenticity was further confirmed by demonstrating genetic uniformity within each log using both nuclear and chloroplast microsatellites. For most wood samples DNA was degraded, and the sequences that gave the best results were those of small size and present in high copy number (chloroplast, mitochondrial, or repeated nuclear sequences). Both storage conditions and storage duration play a role in DNA conservation. Overall, this work demonstrates that molecular markers from all three plant genomes can be used for genetic analysis on dry oak wood, but outlines some limitations and the need for further evaluation of the potential of wood for DNA analysis.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

This model incorporates exchangeable and nonexchangeable hydrogen and oxygen atoms in amino acids to predict the \u03b4\u00b2H and \u03b4\u00b9\u2078O values of scalp hair (primarily keratin). We evaluated model predictions with stable isotope analyses of human hair from 65 cities across the United States. The model, which predicts hair isotopic composition as a function of drinking water, bulk diet, and dietary protein isotope ratios, explains &amp;gt;85% of the observed variation and reproduces the observed slopes relating the isotopic composition of hair samples to that of local drinking water. Based on the geographical distributions of the isotope ratios of tap waters and the assumption of a \"continental supermarket\" dietary input, we constructed maps of the expected average H and O isotope ratios in human hair across the contiguous 48 states. Applications of this model and these observations are extensive and include detection of dietary information, reconstruction of historic movements of individuals, and provision of region-of-origin information for unidentified human remains.\n      </p>", "Caiman crocodilus and C. yacare are economically valuable species afforded legal protection both within the United States and around the world. While five populations of these species have received formal taxonomic recognition between 1758 and 1955, there has never been an analysis of variation across populations representing the entire range of these species. We examined 13 external morphological characteristics in 360 individuals from known localities distributed throughout the range of these taxa. Using covariance, principal component and discriminant function analyses, we find no defensible basis for the partition of C. crocodilus into subspecies, nor do we feel that considering C. yacare a subspecies of C. crocodilus, as proposed by some, is warranted. The implication of these findings for enforcement of current legislation is discussed.\n      </p>", "Assignment of an individual to the population from which it most probably originated based on its multilocus genotype has been widely applied in recent years. In this study, individual assignment based on microsatellite data was used to identify a case of fishing competition fraud. Despite the fact that the true population of origin was most probably not among the reference populations, recent modifications of the assignment tests were used in confidently excluding (p &lt; 0.0001) the possibility of a 5.5 kg salmon (Salmo salar) originating from the fishing competition location, Lake Saimaa (south-east Finland). In fact, the probability of the suspect salmon originating from one of the regions that supply most of Finland's fish markets was found to be over 600 times higher than it originating from Lake Saimaa. When presented with this evidence, the offender confessed to purchasing the salmon at a local fish shop and criminal charges were laid. This study emphasizes the potential practical application of the individual assignment procedure, in particular the usefulness of confidently excluding populations as the origin of an individual. A similar strategy could be also used, for example in suspected cases of illegal poaching, in order to assign or exclude individuals from originating from a claimed population.\n      </p>", "Coalescence theory predicts when genetic drift at nuclear loci will result in fixation of sequence differences to produce monophyletic gene trees. However, the theory is difficult to apply to particular taxa because it hinges on genetically effective population size, which is generally unknown. Neutral theory also predicts that evolution of monophyly will be four times slower in nuclear than in mitochondrial genes primarily because genetic drift is slower at nuclear loci. Variation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) within and between species has been studied extensively, but can these mtDNA data be used to predict coalescence in nuclear loci? Comparison of neutral theories of coalescence of mitochondrial and nuclear loci suggests a simple rule of thumb. The \"three-times rule\" states that, on average, most nuclear loci will be monophyletic when the branch length leading to the mtDNA sequences of a species is three times longer than the average mtDNA sequence diversity observed within that species. A test using mitochondrial and nuclear intron data from seven species of whales and dolphins suggests general agreement with predictions of the three-times rule. We define the coalescence ratio as the mitochondrial branch length for a species divided by intraspecific mtDNA diversity. We show that species with high coalescence ratios show nuclear monophyly, whereas species with low ratios have polyphyletic nuclear gene trees. As expected, species with intermediate coalescence ratios show a variety of patterns. Especially at very high or low coalescence ratios, the three- times rule predicts nuclear gene patterns that can help detect the action of selection. The three-times rule may be useful as an empirical benchmark for evaluating evolutionary processes occurring at multiple loci.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Policing this trafficking has been hampered by the inability to reliably determine geographic origin of contraband ivory. Ivory can be smuggled across multiple international borders and along numerous trade routes, making poaching hotspots and potential trade routes difficult to identify. This fluidity also makes it difficult to refute a country's denial of poaching problems. We extend an innovative DNA assignment method to determine the geographic origin(s) of large elephant ivory seizures. A Voronoi tessellation method is used that utilizes genetic similarities across tusks to simultaneously infer the origin of multiple samples that could have one or more common origin(s). We show that this joint analysis performs better than sample-by-sample methods in assigning sample clusters of known origin. The joint method is then used to infer the geographic origin of the largest ivory seizure since the 1989 ivory trade ban. Wildlife authorities initially suspected that this ivory came from multiple locations across forest and savanna Africa. However, we show that the ivory was entirely from savanna elephants, most probably originating from a narrow east-to-west band of southern Africa, centered on Zambia. These findings enabled law enforcement to focus their investigation to a smaller area and fewer trade routes and led to changes within the Zambian government to improve antipoaching efforts. Such outcomes demonstrate the potential of genetic analyses to help combat the expanding wildlife trade by identifying origin(s) of large seizures of contraband ivory.

In Hong Kong, the world's largest shark fin market, fins are classified by traders into Chinese-name categories on the basis of market value, but the relationship between market category and shark species is unclear, preventing identification of species that are the most heavily traded. To delineate these relationships, we designed a sampling strategy for collecting statistically sufficient numbers of fins from traders and categories under conditions of limited market access because of heightened trader sensitivities. Based on information from traders and morphological inspection, we hypothesized matches between market names and shark taxa for fins within 11 common trade categories. These hypotheses were tested using DNA-based species identification techniques to determine the concordance between market category and species. Only 14 species made up approximately 40% of the auctioned fin weight. The proportion of samples confirming the hypothesized match, or concordance, varied from 0.64 to 1 across the market categories. We incorporated the concordance information and available market auction records for these categories into stochastic models to estimate the contribution of each taxon by weight to the fin trade. Auctioned fin weight was dominated by the blue shark (Prionace glauca), which was 17% of the overall market. Other taxa, including the short fin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus), silky (Carcharhinus falciformis), sandbar (C. obscurus), bull (C.leucas), hammerhead (Sphyrna spp.), and thresher (Alopias spp.), were at least 2-6% of the trade.

We used salivary DNA obtained from attack wounds on domestic sheep carcasses to identify the species of predator responsible for the kill, as well as the sex and individual identity of coyotes (Canis latrans) that killed sheep. Coyotes killed 36 of 37 depredated sheep. Breeding pairs whose territories overlapped sheep grazing areas were the primary predators on domestic sheep, and only breeding pairs killed multiple sheep. Breeding males, acting alone or with their mate, were involved in 21 of 25 kills. Breeding females participated in 13 kills, but only 1 breeding female killed sheep on her own. Transient females did not kill sheep, and both kills by transient males occurred in territories with a breeding vacancy. Our results suggest that predator control should be targeted at breeding male coyotes. Salivary DNA is a potentially powerful means of both investigating predation patterns and evaluating the effectiveness of control at targeting individuals that kill livestock.\n      </p>", "We describe the development of a method to predict percent body fat of killed birds from the percent fat in the most distal wing tissue, which is often left uneaten by aerial predators.

Oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope ratios of organic matter were linearly related with those of the media water. We used the relationships determined in these experiments to calculate the effective whole-cell fractionation factors between water and organic matter for B. subtilis. We then predicted the \u03b418O and \u03b4 D values of spores produced in nutritionally identical media and local water sources for five different locations around the United States. Each of the measured \u03b418O and \u03b4 D values of the spores matched the predicted values within a 95% confidence interval, indicating that stable isotope ratio analyses may be a powerful tool for tracing the geographic point-of-origin for microbial products.\n      </p>", "Accounts of powerful new forensic technologies such as DNA typing, data mining, biometric scanning, and electronic location tracking fill the daily news. Proponents praise these techniques for helping to exonerate those wrongly accused, and for exposing the failings of a criminal justice system that previously relied too readily upon faulty forensic evidence like handwriting, ballistics, and hair and fiber analysis. Advocates applaud the introduction of a \"new paradigm\" for forensic evidence, and proclaim that these new techniques will revolutionize how the government investigates and tries criminal cases. While the new forensic sciences undoubtedly offer an unprecedented degree of certainty and reliability, these characteristics alone do not necessarily render them less susceptible to misuse. In fact, as this Article argues, the most lauded attributes of these new forms of forensic evidence may actually exacerbate the conditions that first caused traditional forensic sciences to fall into disrepute. This Article challenges the new orthodoxy of forensic science. In so doing, it reframes the debate about the role of forensic evidence in the criminal justice system in three respects. First, this Article sets forth a new taxonomy of forensic evidence that distinguishes first from second generation forensic sciences. Second, using this framework, this Article illustrates how the particular characteristics of the second generation aggravate, rather than relieve, the pathologies that ultimately afflicted the first generation. Lastly, this Article criticizes current suggestions for improving the use of forensic evidence in the criminal justice system that fail to account for the peculiar characteristics of the second generation, and advocates alternative remedies tailored to these specific concerns.\n      </p>", "1. Spatially explicit Bayesian clustering techniques offer a powerful tool for ecology and wildlife management, as genetic divisions can be correlated with landscape features. We used these methods to analyse the genetic structure of a population of European wild boar Sus scrofa with the aim of identifying effective barriers for disease management units. However, it has been suggested that the methods could produce biased results when faced with deviations from random mating not caused by genetic discontinuities, such as isolation by distance (IBD). 2. We analysed a data set consisting of 697 wild boar multilocus genotypes using spatially explicit (BAPS, GENELAND) and non-explicit (STRUCTURE) Bayesian methods. We also simulated and analysed data sets characterized by different degrees of IBD, with and without genetic discontinuities. 3. When analysing the empirical data set, different programs did not converge on the same clustering solution and some clusters were difficult to explain biologically. Results from the simulated data showed that IBD, also present in the empirical data set, could cause the Bayesian methods to overestimate genetic structure. Simulated barriers were identified correctly, but the programs superimposed further clusters at higher IBD levels. 4. It was not possible to ascertain with confidence whether the clustering solutions offered by the various programs were an accurate reflection of population genetic structure in our empirical data set or were artefacts created by the underlying IBD pattern. 5. Synthesis and applications: We show that Bayesian clustering methods can overestimate genetic structure when analysing an individual-based data set characterized by isolation by distance. This bias could lead to the erroneous delimitation of management or conservation units. Investigators should be critical and suspicious of clusters that cannot be explained biologically. Data sets should be tested for isolation by distance and conclusions should not be based on the output from just one method.\n      </p>", "This lesson uses characters from the Harry Potter series of novels as a \u2018hook\u2019 to stimulate students' interest in introductory forensic science.

We contend that the most effective way to contain this illegal trade is to determine where the wildlife is being removed. This allows authorities to direct law enforcement to poaching hot spots, potentially stops trade before the wildlife is actually killed, prevents countries from denying their poaching problems at home, and thwarts trade before it enters into an increasingly complex web of international criminal activity. Forensic tools have been limited in their ability to determine product origin because the information they can provide typically begins only at the point of shipment. DNA assignment analyses can determine product origin, but its use has been limited by the inability to assign samples to locations where reference samples do not exist. We applied new DNA assignment methods that can determine the geographic origin(s) of wildlife products from anywhere within its range. We used these methods to examine the geographic origin(s) of 2 strings of seizures involving large volumes of elephant ivory, 1 string seized in Singapore and Malawi and the other in Hong Kong and Cameroon. These ivory traffickers may comprise 2 of the largest poaching rings in Africa. In both cases all ivory seized in the string had common origins, which indicates that crime syndicates are targeting specific populations for intense exploitation. This result contradicts the dominant belief that dealers are using a decentralized plan of procuring ivory stocks as they became available across Africa. Large quantities of ivory were then moved, in multiple shipments, through an intermediate country prior to shipment to Asia, as a risk-reduction strategy that distances the dealer from the poaching locale. These smuggling strategies could not have been detected by forensic information, which typically begins only at the shipping source. /// El crimen de vida silvestre internacional est\u00e1 floreciendo en este tiempo de comercio global.

Two distinct patterns of isotopic (\u00b9\u2078O/\u00b9\u2076O and \u00b9\u00b3C/\u00b9\u00b2C) variation were identified. The first, found in specimens collected alive from two sites in 2006, is characterized by several unique features that correlate with predicted oxygen-isotope values calculated from temperature and salinity measurements and with records of phytoplankton blooms, indicating that these oysters were recruited at the end of 2001 or early in 2002. The isotope profiles from other specimens differ from these, and do not show evidence of significant environmental events that occurred in 2003, 2004, and 2006, despite the fact that some of these oysters were also collected alive in 2006. These oysters were likely recruited between 1998 and 2000, based on shell growth rates estimated with the von Bertalanffy growth function and on the record of phytoplankton blooms. Poor resolution due to slowed shell growth associated with senescence probably accounts for the absence of the 2003-2006 environmental events in these shell isotope records. These findings indicate that at least two cohorts of C. gigas settled in San Francisco Bay in recent years. That two successful recruitment events occurred over a relatively short time suggests that further recruitment may occur. Such studies as the one conducted here can potentially be used to identify favorable environmental conditions or circumstances associated with past biological invasions as well as those likely to come.\n      </p>", "Would you rather solve a forensics puzzle or take a lab practical?

These advances have led to an explosion in genetic research on bear populations and an increased interest in genetic technology among researchers working in other scientific disciplines. This paper provides an overview of genetic techniques and markers, recent publications, and future directions. Five major applications of genetic analyses are addressed: forensics, population structure and gene flow, genetic diversity, maternity and paternity analysis, and non-invasive genetic sampling.\n      </p>", "Restriction enzymes have proved to be invaluable for the physical mapping of DNA. They offer unparalleled opportunities for diagnosing DNA sequence content and are used in fields as disparate as criminal forensics and basic research. In fact, without restriction enzymes, the biotechnology industry would certainly not have flourished as it has. The first experiments demonstrating the utility of restriction enzymes were carried out by Danna and Nathans and reported in 1971. This pioneering study set the stage for the modern practice of molecular biology in which restriction enzymes are ubiquitous tools, although they are often taken for granted.\n      </p>", "We have developed an in vitro method for amplifying a large fraction of the DNA sequences present in a single haploid cell by repeated primer extensions using a mixture of 15-base random oligonucleotides. We studied 12 genetic loci and estimate that the probability of amplifying any sequence in the genome to a minimum of 30 copies is not less than 0.78 (95% confidence). Whole genome amplification beginning with a single cell, or other samples with very small amounts of DNA, has significant implications for multipoint mapping by sperm or oocyte typing and possibly for genetic disease diagnosis, forensics, and the analysis of ancient DNA samples.\n      </p>", "Genetic epidemiology developed in the middle of the last century, focused on inherited causes of disease but with methods and results applicable to other traits and even forensics. Early success with linkage led to the localization of genes contributing to disease, and ultimately to the Human Genome Project. The discovery of millions of DNA markers has encouraged more efficient positional cloning by linkage disequilibrium (LD), using LD maps and haplotypes in ways that are rapidly evolving. This has led to large international programmes, some promising and others alarming, with laws about DNA patenting and ethical guidelines for responsible research still struggling to be born.\n      </p>", "A consensus view appears to prevail among academics from diverse disciplines that biological races do not exist, at least in humans, and that race-concepts and race-objects are socially constructed. The consensus view has been challenged recently by Robin O. Andreasen's cladistic account of biological race. This paper argues that from a scientific viewpoint there are methodological, empirical, and conceptual problems with Andreasen's position, and that from a philosophical perspective Andreasen's adherence to rigid dichotomies between science and society, facts and values, nature and culture, and the biological and the social needs to be relinquished. DNA forensics is just one field of research that reveals how race remains both idea and object for human population biologists, an indication that it is premature to accept the existence of a no-race consensus across the disciplines. DNA forensics research also demonstrates ways in which race is reified by scientists by the representation of what is cultural or social as natural or biological, and of what is dynamic, relative, and continuous as static, absolute, and discrete. The philosophical analysis of foundational concepts of human population biology such as population, race, and ethnic group is best served by foregoing traditional objectivist approaches for a critical stance that recognises the inextricability of the biological and the social.\n      </p>", "Variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) loci are extremely valuable for the forensic technique known as DNA fingerprinting because of their hypervariability. Nevertheless, the use of these loci in forensics has been controversial. One criticism of DNA fingerprinting is that the VNTR loci used for the \"fingerprints\" violate the assumption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (H-W), making it difficult to calculate the probability of observing a genotype in the population. If one can assume H-W, the probability of observing the pair of alleles constituting an individual's genotype can be calculated by taking the product of the alleles' frequencies in the population and multiplying by two if the alleles are different. The evidence cited against assuming H-W is homozygote excess, which is presumed to be caused by an undetected mixture of two or more populations with limited interpopulational mating and distinct allele frequencies. For most VNTR loci, measurement error makes it impossible to test these claims by standard methods. The Lifecodes database of three VNTR loci used for forensics was used to show that the claimed excess of homozygotes is not necessarily real because many heterozygotes with similar allele sizes are misclassified as homozygotes. A simple test of H-W that takes such misclassifications into account was developed to test for an overall excess or dearth of heterozygotes in the sample (the complement of homozygote dearth or excess). The application of this test to the Lifecodes database revealed that there was no consistent evidence of violation of H-W for the Caucasian, black, or Hispanic populations.\n      </p>", "Molecular phylogenetic analyses are frequently used in epidemiologic testing, although only occasionally in forensics. Their acceptability is hampered by a lack of statistical confidence in the conclusions. However, maximum likelihood testing provides a sound statistical framework for the testing of phylogenetic hypotheses relevant for forensic analysis. We present the results of applying this method to a small hepatitis C outbreak produced in a hospital hemodialysis unit that involved 6 patients. Polymerase chain reaction products from a 472-nt fragment of the E1-E2 region, including the hypervariable region, HVR-1, of the hepatitis C virus genome were cloned, and an average of 10 clones/patient and from 11 additional control patients were sequenced. The method allows a statistical evaluation that the likelihood of each sample belonging or not to a given group, a question of relevance in many forensic and epidemiological analyses of molecular sequences.\n      </p>", "Conventional asymmetric PCR is inefficient and difficult to optimize because limiting the concentration of one primer lowers its melting temperature below the reaction annealing temperature. Linear-After-The-Exponential (LATE)-PCR describes a new paradigm for primer design that renders assays as efficient as symmetric PCR assays, regardless of primer ratio. LATE-PCR generates single-stranded products with predictable kinetics for many cycles beyond the exponential phase. LATE-PCR also introduces new probe design criteria that uncouple hybridization probe detection from primer annealing and extension, increase probe reliability, improve allele discrimination, and increase signal strength by 80-250% relative to symmetric PCR. These improvements in PCR are particularly useful for real-time quantitative analysis of target numbers in small samples. LATE-PCR is adaptable to high throughput applications in fields such as clinical diagnostics, biodefense, forensics, and DNA sequencing. We showcase LATE-PCR via amplification of the cystic fibrosis CF\u0394508 allele and the Tay-Sachs disease TSD 1278 allele from single heterozygous cells.\n      </p>", "The evolutionary relationships of the burrowing amphisbaenians ('worm lizards') have long been controversial for several reasons: the rarity of museum specimens available for study., highly derived morphological conditions that can confound comparative studies and difficulty in obtaining tissues for molecular phylogenetic studies because of their secretive habits in the wild. We present a phylogenetic analysis of two nuclear genes obtained from both fresh tissues and museum specimens of worm lizards. We achieved sufficient taxonomic sampling for analysis by extracting DNA from museum specimens using a modified forensics protocol. Results show the limbless Rhineuridae to be the most basal lineage., whereas the limbed Bipedidae occupy a more derived position as the sister-taxon to a Trogonophidae-Amphisbaenidae clade. This pattern of relationships indicates widespread morphological convergence within the group, including three independent incidences of limb loss. Convergence in skull shape and scalation is also prevalent. Mosaic evolution in the skull versus postcranial skeleton parallels that seen in snake evolution.\n      </p>", "The analysis of short tandem repeats (STRs) plays an important role in forensic science, human identification, genetic mapping, and disease diagnostics. Traditional STR analysis utilizes gel- or column-based approaches to analyze DNA repeats. Individual STR alleles are separated and distinguished according to fragment length; thus the assay is generally hampered by its low multiplex capacity. However, use of DNA microarray would employ a simple hybridization and detection for field forensics and biology. Here we demonstrate a rapid, highly sensitive method for STR analysis that utilizes DNA microarray technology. We describe two adaptations to accomplish this: the use of competitive hybridization to remove unpaired ssDNA from an array and the use of neural network classification to automate the analysis. The competitive displacement technique mimics the branch migration process that occurs during DNA recombination. Our technique will facilitate the rapid deduction of identity, length, and number of repeats for the multiple STRs in an unknown DNA sample.\n      </p>", "We have developed a color complementation assay that allows rapid screening of specific genomic DNA sequences. It is based on the simultaneous amplification of two or more DNA segments with fluorescent oligonucleotide primers such that the generation of a color, or combination of colors, can be visualized and used for diagnosis. Color complementation assay obviates the need for gel electrophoresis and has been applied to the detection of a large and small gene deletion, a chromosomal translocation, an infectious agent, and a single-base substitution. DNA amplification with fluorescent oligonucleotide primers has also been used to multiplex and discriminate five different amplified DNA loci simultaneously. Each primer set is conjugated to a different dye, and the fluorescence of each dye respective to its amplified DNA locus is scored on a fluorometer. This method is valuable for DNA diagnostics of genetic, acquired, and infectious diseases, as well as in DNA forensics. It also lends itself to complete automation.\n      </p>", "           ", "           ", "On the morning of July 16, 1945, the first atomic bomb was exploded in New Mexico on the White Sands Proving Ground. The device was a plutonium implosion device similar to the device that destroyed Nagasaki, Japan, on August 9 of that same year. Recently, with the enactment of US public law 111-140, the \"Nuclear Forensics and Attribution Act,\" scientists in the government and academia have been able, in earnest, to consider what type of forensic-style information may be obtained after a nuclear detonation. To conduct a robust attribution process for an exploded device placed by a nonstate actor, forensic analysis must yield information about not only the nuclear material in the device but about other materials that went into its construction. We have performed an investigation of glassed ground debris from the first nuclear test showing correlations among multiple analytical techniques. Surprisingly, there is strong evidence, obtainable only through microanalysis, that secondary materials used in the device can be identified and positively associated with the nuclear material.\n      </p>", "The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is a molecular biological technique for 'amplifying' selected DNA sequences. In the decade after its invention, PCR has worked its way into numerous fields of practice. It was one of the DNA-profiling techniques which were subjected to detailed, critical scrutiny during the OJ Simpson trial. In this paper we 'follow the technique around' to investigate how PCR is adapted to different circumstances in science, medicine, industry and criminal forensics. We examine how PCR adapted in different organizational contexts, and we also treat it as a cultural object in its own right. Interviews with staff scientists, managers, technicians, forensic case workers and others involved in the design and use of PCR indicate that this named and patented technique is both a stabilized artefact with standard uses in many circumstances of production, and a highly flexible and often problematic procedure. The paper explores the material and organizational contingencies which in some times and places give PCR impressive stability and industrial strength, and in others subvert its standardized and commercialized identity.\n      </p>", "Recent work has demonstrated that the diversity of skin-associated bacterial communities is far higher than previously recognized, with a high degree of interindividual variability in the composition of bacterial communities. Given that skin bacterial communities are personalized, we hypothesized that we could use the residual skin bacteria left on objects for forensic identification, matching the bacteria on the object to the skin-associated bacteria of the individual who touched the object. Here we describe a series of studies demonstrating the validity of this approach. We show that skin-associated bacteria can be readily recovered from surfaces (including single computer keys and computer mice) and that the structure of these communities can be used to differentiate objects handled by different individuals, even if those objects have been left untouched for up to 2 weeks at room temperature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that we can use a high-throughput pyrosequencing-based approach to quantitatively compare the bacterial communities on objects and skin to match the object to the individual with a high degree of certainty. Although additional work is needed to further establish the utility of this approach, this series of studies introduces a forensics approach that could eventually be used to independently evaluate results obtained using more traditional forensic practices.\n      </p>", "Illegal harvesting is a serious threat to the persistence of many plant and animal taxa. The combination of highly polymorphic DNA markers and new statistical methods called \"assignment tests\" can potentially help detect and thereby reduce poaching. Assignment tests can identify the population of origin of individuals if populations are genetically differentiated. We evaluated the usefulness of two assignment tests to wildlife forensics by applying them to large empirical (microsatellite DNA) data sets from 10 species. We also conducted computer simulations to assess the influence of genetic polymorphism (heterozygosity) and population differentiation (FST) on the performance of the tests. The fully Bayesian assignment test of Pritchard et al. (2000) performed better than the partially Bayesian exclusion test of Cornuet et al. (1999), but the fully Bayesian method requires the assumption that the true population of origin was sampled. The median percentage of individuals correctly assigned for the 10 empirical data sets was 61% and 36% for the assignment and exclusion tests, respectively. Both the empirical and simulated data sets suggest that nearly all individuals can be assigned with high statistical certainty (99.9%) for two highly differentiated populations (FST \u2248 0.15-0.2) when 10 loci (H &gt; 0.6) and samples of 30-50 individuals are used per population. We recommend using both tests when the true population of origin might not have been sampled in the data set.\n      </p>", "A rapid nonradioactive approach to the diagnosis of sickle cell anemia is described based on an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (ASPCR). This method allows direct detection of the normal or the sickle cell \u03b2 -globin allele in genomic DNA without additional steps of probe hybridization, ligation, or restriction enzyme cleavage. Two allele-specific oligonucleotide primers, one specific for the sickle cell allele and one specific for the normal allele, together with another primer complementary to both alleles were used in the polymerase chain reaction with genomic DNA templates. The allele-specific primers differed from each other in their terminal 3\u2032 nucleotide. Under the proper annealing temperature and polymerase chain reaction conditions, these primers only directed amplification on their complementary allele. In a single blind study of DNA samples from 12 individuals, this method correctly and unambiguously allowed for the determination of the genotypes with no false negatives or positives. If ASPCR is able to discriminate all allelic variation (both transition and transversion mutations), this method has the potential to be a powerful approach for genetic disease diagnosis, carrier screening, HLA typing, human gene mapping, forensics, and paternity testing.\n      </p>", "Genetic analysis of limiting quantities of genomic DNA play an important role in DNA forensics, paleoarcheology, genetic disease diagnosis, genetic linkage analysis, and genetic diversity studies. We have tested the ability of degenerate oligonucleotide primed polymerase chain reaction (DOP-PCR) to amplify picogram quantities of human genomic DNA for the purpose of increasing the amount of template for genotyping with microsatellite repeat markers. DNA was uniformly amplified at a large number of typable loci throughout the human genome with starting template DNAs from as little as 15 pg to as much as 400 ng. A much greater-fold enrichment was seen for the smaller genomic DOP-PCRs. All markers tested were amplified from starting genomic DNAs in the range of 0.6-40 ng with amplifications of 200- to 600-fold. The DOP-PCR-amplified genomic DNA was an excellent and reliable template for genotyping with microsatellites, which give distinct bands with no increase in stutter artifact on di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide repeats. There appears to be equal amplification of genomic DNA from 55 of 55 tested discrete microsatellites implying near complete coverage of the human genome. Thus, DOP-PCR appears to allow unbiased, hundreds-fold whole genome amplification of human genomic DNA for genotypic analysis.\n      </p>", "Forensic palynology is the science of applying modern and fossil pollen and spores (palynomorphs) to help solve legal problems. Although knowledge of this technique has been known for many years, it has been used rarely. Surveys conducted of major law enforcement agencies in the United States show that little is known about this area of forensics. Only law enforcement agencies in New Zealand, among the major countries of the world, routinely collect and use forensic pollen studies in civil and criminal cases. Palynomorphs recovered from dirt, clothing, hair, rope, baskets, and materials used as packing can reveal geographical origin or can link an individual or item with the scene of a crime. Likewise, the palynomorphs found in illegal drugs, like marijuana and cocaine, can link those drugs with their source area and can show which shipments of drugs originated from the same, or from different, source areas. Techniques used for collection, processing, and analysis of forensic pollen samples are discussed. Actual case studies using forensic pollen evidence are included as examples.\n      </p>", "Fundamental to most genetic analysis is availability of genomic DNA of adequate quality and quantity. Because DNA yield from human samples is frequently limiting, much effort has been invested in developing methods for whole genome amplification (WGA) by random or degenerate oligonucleotide-primed PCR. However, existing WGA methods like degenerate oligonucleotide-primed PCR suffer from incomplete coverage and inadequate average DNA size. We describe a method, termed multiple displacement amplification (MDA), which provides a highly uniform representation across the genome. Amplification bias among eight chromosomal loci was less than 3-fold in contrast to 4-6 orders of magnitude for PCR-based WGA methods. Average product length was &gt; 10 kb. MDA is an isothermal, strand-displacing amplification yielding about 20-30 \u00b5g product from as few as 1-10 copies of human genomic DNA. Amplification can be carried out directly from biological samples including crude whole blood and tissue culture cells. MDA-amplified human DNA is useful for several common methods of genetic analysis, including genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms, chromosome painting, Southern blotting and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, subcloning, and DNA sequencing. MDA-based WGA is a simple and reliable method that could have significant implications for genetic studies, forensics, diagnostics, and long-term sample storage.\n      </p>", "Length variation in short tandem repeats (STRs) is an important family of DNA polymorphisms with numerous applications in genetics, medicine, forensics, and evolutionary analysis. Several major diseases have been associated with length variation of trinudeotide (triplet) repeats including Huntingtons disease, hereditary ataxias and spinobulbar muscular atrophy. Using the reference human genome, we have catalogued all triplet repeats in genie regions. This data revealed a bias in noncoding DNA repeat lengths. It also enabled a survey of repeat-length polymorphisms (RLPs) in human genomes and a comparison of the rate of polymorphism in humans versus divergence from chimpanzee. For short repeats, this analysis of three human genomes reveals a relatively low RLP rate in exons and, somewhat surprisingly, in introns. All short RLPs observed in multiple genomes are biallelic (at least in this small sample). In contrast long repeats are highly polymorphic and some long RLPs are multiallelic. For long repeats, the chimpanzee sequence frequently differs from all observed human al\u00edeles. This suggests a high expansion/contraction rate in all long repeats. Expansions and contractions are not however, affected by natural selection discernable from our comparison of human-chimpanzee divergence with human RLPs. Our catalog of human triplet repeats and their surrounding flanking regions can be used to produce a cost-effective whole-genome assay to test individuals. This repeat assay could someday complement SNP arrays for producing tests that assess the risk of an individual to develop a disease, or become part of personalized genomic strategy that provides therapeutic guidance with respect to drug response.\n      </p>", "This article elucidates Gertrude Stein's theory of rhetorical grammar by locating it in her studies at Harvard University/Radcliffe College in the mid-1890s and by demonstrating how for Stein the study of grammar correlates with rhetoric's first canon, invention. In her experimental primer. How to Write (1931), a book about the craft of composition, Stein devotes chapters to vocabulary, sentences, paragraphs, grammar, and forensics, but refuses to reduce writing to mechanical correctness. For Stein, a grammar that supposes invention as both discovering and creating does something much more than offer pre-existing rules for writers to follow. Placing Gertrude Stein's writing practices in the rhetorical traditions of the nineteenth century reveals a Gertrude Stein who is not necessarily or not only a literary figure, but rather a twentieth- century rhetorician who refigures past traditions to teach a new century how to write.\n      </p>", "Pharmacologically active ingredients in plants can cause significant morbidity through their increasingly common use in herbal alternative medicines and dietary supplements. Monitoring consumer products for the presence of toxic plants is encumbered by the lack of rapid and specific assays. To create a sensitive, reliable, fast, and broad-spectrum assay for medicinal or toxic plant species, we tested multiplexed ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), which requires partial genomic DNA sequences from species of plants that are not well represented in currently available genetic databases. Genomic DNA was obtained from 21 species of medicinal and/or toxic plants. The PCR products were amplified from these plants and cloned for sequencing. The MLPA method was successful with DNA samples from many different species. The use of a microarray to facilitate screening of potentially thousands of plants in a single assay also was successful. The combination of the specificity of the MLPA assay with the broad-scale capabilities of microarray technology should make this an especially useful tool in screening in foods and commercial herbal preparations to identify the plant compounds actually present. Other applications could potentially extend to the identification of any plant species in samples for academic botanical studies and for biodefense and forensics applications.\n      </p>", "The best way to reconcile political actors in a controversial electoral process is a full audit. When this is not possible, statistical tools may be useful for measuring the likelihood of the results. The Venezuelan recall referendum (2004) provides a suitable dataset for thinking about this important problem. The cost of errors in examining an allegation of electoral fraud can be enormous. They can range from legitimizing an unfair election to supporting an unfounded accusation, with serious political implications. For this reason, we must be very selective about data, hypotheses and test statistics that will be used. This article offers a critical review of recent statistical literature on the Venezuelan referendum. In addition, we propose a testing methodology, based exclusively on vote counting, that is potentially useful in election forensics. The referendum is reexamined, offering new and intriguing aspects to previous analyses. The main conclusion is that there were a significant number of irregularities in the vote counting that introduced a bias in favor of the winning option. A plausible scenario in which the irregularities could overturn the results is also discussed.\n      </p>", "Physicians become involved in child sexual abuse when they must report suspected abuse or when they are asked to medically evaluate a child who is an alleged victim of abuse. This article reviews recent progress in the medical profession's attention to child sexual abuse and discusses current issues surrounding reporting and medical evaluation. The reporting requirement raises several concerns for pediatricians. Their legal responsibilities as reporters may conflict with their traditional relationship with the family as a unit and with the confidentiality of the doctor-patient relationship. Knowledge about pediatric anogential anatomy is in a relatively early stage of development, and few pediatricians receive training adequate to enable them to determine whether medical observations are consistent with sexual abuse. Even fewer pediatricians receive training in the unique considerations and needs present when taking the medical history of a possible abuse victim or when preserving evidence for possible later use in court. The medical evidentiary evaluation of suspected sexual abuse also raises a number of concerns. There is great variability in referral patterns, which determine whether a medical examination will be requested and whether a general practice physician or a specialist will be asked to conduct the exam. Although professional medical associations have laid out broad outlines of recommended procedures for medical exams when sexual abuse is suspected, more detailed protocols are needed for addressing the many cases where findings are ambiguous or subtle. Often physicians need training in forensics and assistance in coordinating services with multiple agencies and professions. Finally, attention must be given to ensuring adequate cost reimbursement for medical evaluations.\n      </p>", "Highly polymorphic segments of the human genome containing variable numbers of tandem repeats (VNTRs) have been widely used to establish DNA profiles of individuals for use in forensics. Methods of estimating the probability of occurrence of matching DNA profiles between two randomly selected individuals have been subject to extensive debate regarding the possibility of significant substructure occurring within the major races. We have sampled two Caucasian subpopulations, Finns and Italians, at four commonly used VNTR loci to determine the extent to which the subgroups differ from each other and from a mixed Caucasian database. The data were also analyzed for the occurrence of linkage disequilibrium among the loci. The allele frequency distributions of some loci were found to differ significantly among the subpopulations in a manner consistent with population substructure. Major differences were also found in the probability of occurrence of matching DNA profiles between two individuals chosen at random from the same subpopulation. With respect to the Finnish and Italian subpopulations, the conventional product rule for estimating the probability of a multilocus VNTR match using a mixed Caucasian database consistently yields estimates that are artificially small. Systematic errors of this type were not found using the interim ceiling principle recently advocated in the National Research Council's report [National Research Council (1992) DNA Technology in Forensic Science (Natl. Acad. Sci., Washington)]. The interim ceiling principle is based on currently available racial or ethnic databases and sets an arbitrary lower limit on each VNTR allele frequency. In the future the ceiling frequencies are expected to be established from more adequate data acquired for relevant VNTR loci from multiple subpopulations.\n      </p>"], "words": {"chain": {"number":
