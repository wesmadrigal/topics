{"total_words": 1060, "documents": ["Over the past two centuries, Orthodox Judaism's attitude toward the Reform movement has been dominated by animosity and polemical efforts at delegitimization and demonization. In particular because of the Reform sanction of patrilineal descent as a basis for Jewish identity, the early 1980s was a period of acute tensions. Various Orthodox parties gave the impression that they were on the verge of completely cutting themselves off from their Reform contemporaries. This article demonstrates that, in the subsequent decades, hostilities have diminished and a new style of Orthodox interaction with Reform has begun to emerge. This dynamic, though by no means leading to harmony between the religious streams, was far removed from prior predictions of \u201cseparation-cum-divorce\u201d of these two movements. The article analyzes a range of examples that manifest this transition and offer insight that helps to account for the ensuing changes.\n      </p>", "Several religious traditions are widely believed to advocate the use of life-sustaining treatment in all circumstances. Hence, many believe that these faiths would require the use of a feeding tube in patients with advanced dementia who have lost interest in or the capacity to swallow food. This article explores whether one such tradition\u2014halachic Judaism\u2014in fact demands the use of artificial nutrition and hydration in this setting. Traditional (halachic) arguments have been advanced holding that treatment can be withheld in persons who are dying, in individuals whose condition causes great suffering, or in the event that the treatment would produce suffering. Individuals with advanced dementia can be considered to be dying, often suffer as a result of their dementia, and are likely to suffer from the use of a feeding tube. Given these observations and the absence of a compelling case for distinguishing between tube feeding and other forms of medical treatment, traditional Judaism appears compatible with withholding artificial nutrition for individuals with advanced dementia.\n      </p>", "In one of the essays in his recent book on Christianity, La d\u00e9closion (2005), Nancy discusses the relationship between Judaism and Christianity. Nancy opens this discussion with a reference to Lyotard's book on this relationship: Un trait d' union (1993). Both Lyotard and Nancy examine a very early figure in the emergence of Christianity from Judaism\u2014whereas Lyotard focuses on the epistles of Paul, Nancy reads the epistle of James. Lyotard concludes that the hyphen in the expression 'Judeo-Christian' actually conceals 'the most impenetrable abyss within Western thought'. With this abyss, Lyotard refers to the point of departure of Judaism: the event in which a Voice has left behind letters, inaugurating an interminable work of interpretation. For Nancy, however, it is rather Christianity, and therefore, Western culture, which is deconstructive in nature. Its composition is co-original with a decomposition, and therefore, with an openness. In James, Nancy finds an emphasis on praxis, in such a way that existence is to be understood as transcendent within itself. With this reading of James, Nancy seems to deny that there is a fundamental difference between Judaism and Christianity. In order to clarify the differences between Lyotard and Nancy, it is shown that, in Lyotard's view, an unsublatable alterity comes with aisth\u00e8sis, whereas in Nancy's view, alterity comes with existence as such.\n      </p>", "Scholars have too little investigated questions of religious meaning in Handel's Messiah, particularly the work's manifest theological anti-Judaism. Previously unknown historical sources for the work's libretto compiled and arranged by Charles Jennens (1700\u201373) reveal the text's implicit designs against Jewish religion. Handel's musical setting powerfully underscores these tendencies of Jennens's libretto and adds to them, reaching a euphoric climax in the Hallelujah chorus.\n         Within its arrangement of juxtaposed Old Testament prophecies and their New Testament fulfillment and with its matching musical styles, Handel's Messiah could hardly have expressed more powerfully its rejoicing against Judaism than by having the ferocious tenor aria \u201cTHOU [Jesus] shalt break THEM [the Jews] with a rod of iron\u201d answered by the chorus \u201cHallelujah! for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.\u201d The aria is a setting of Psalm 2:9, a passage that was generally and unquestioningly believed among Christians in Handel's day to have foretold the destruction of Jerusalem and its Temple in the year 70. This horrible event was construed as a divine punishment of Judaism for its failure to accept Jesus as God's promised messiah. The Hallelujah chorus apparently sees cause for rejoicing in such vengeance. Further, this chorus quotes the melodies of several hymns whose texts concern the depiction in Matthew 25 of acceptance by a bridegroom of five wise virgins and his rejection of five foolish virgins. This parable was taken to symbolize the welcoming of Ecclesia, Christianity and Jesus as the messiah, and the rejection of Synagoga and Judaism.\n         In 18th-century England most Christians fervently believed that a choice between Judaism and Christianity was a choice between eternal damnation and eternal salvation. This would have represented motivation indeed for Messiah to project Christian theological contempt for its sibling religion.\n      </p>", "Modifications of the self, that is to say, transformation of the psychological, physical and spiritual make up of an individual to achieve or approximate an ideal individual is one of the main goals of religion, medicine and psychology. However, these fields approach self-modification from their own perspective, with little intercorrelations between them. This article explores how mechanisms for self modification delineated by Judaic sources are very much in line with new discoveries in neurosciences, especially with recent scientific data indicating that the brain is in a constant state of structural and functional change, a property denominated brain plasticity.\n      </p>", "Concern for the plight of Soviet Jewry grew steadily from the early 1950s. The rise of this issue to the forefront of American Jewish consciousness, however, was driven by the broader protest movement that emerged in the mid-1960s. Its central goal was to ensure civic and religious rights for Jewish residents of the Soviet Union, with a particular emphasis on the ability to emigrate. The movement's peak impact was in the 1970s. This decade witnessed the proliferation of grassroots organizations throughout the United States, along with the adoption of a more activist orientation by large segments of the American Jewish establishment.\n         To date, minimal attention has been paid to the place of the Soviet Jewry movement in the religious history of American Judaism. The article's investigation of American Orthodoxy's role is intended to confront this lacuna and describes the central role played by Orthodox Jews in the rise and development of the Soviet Jewry movement. Through their actions, the members of this segment of American Jewry experienced a role reversal in which they helped to redefine the nature of the Jewish relationship to the public sphere. Simultaneously, such activism sharpened the internal divide between Modern Orthodoxy and its traditionalist counterparts who opposed demonstrations, encouraged quiet diplomacy, and were loathe to work in unison with the broader Jewish community. Through their involvement in a core Jewish activity that entailed partnership with non-Orthodox Jews in efforts for their common brethren, a generation of Modern Orthodox leaders arose that made Jewish solidarity a central expression of their Orthodox religious identities.\n      </p>", "In 1950, Raphael Patai published his research on Venta Prieta, a Mexican town in which some residents lived as Jews despite having little knowledge of Judaism. Like other visitors, Patai was perplexed. Why did they wish to live as Jews? While Patai never answered this question to his satisfaction, he believed the answer would be found by developing a psychological profile of the residents, an approach in keeping with culture and personality theorists of the day. The present article provides a different solution. Drawing on additional sources, and short visits, we argue that Venta Prieta was not only a stop on the Jewish tourist circuit by 1950 but also developed out of a unique exchange. While U.S. Jews, as evangelical Protestants before them, provided a model for upwardly mobile Mexicans, Venta Prieta enabled middle-class tourists to experience Judaism in a pastoral setting and to \"repair the world\" (tikkun).\n      </p>", "This article first describes some of the chief contrasts between Judaism and American secularism in their underlying convictions about the business environment and the expectations which all involved in business can have of each other-namely, duties vs. rights, communitarianism vs. individualism, and ties to God and to the environment based on our inherent status as God's creatures rather than on our pragmatic choice. Conservative Judaism's methodology for plumbing the Jewish tradition for guidance is described and contrasted to those of Orthodox and Reform Judaism. One example of how Conservative Judaism can inform us on a current matter is developed at some length-namely, privacy in the workplace. That section discusses (1) the reasons for protecting privacy; (2) protection from intrusion, including employer spying; (3) protection from disclosure of that intended to remain private; (4) individualistic vs. communitarian approaches to grounding the concern for privacy; and (5) contemporary implications for insuring privacy in business.\n      </p>", "After establishing its mission in Copenhagen, Denmark, over ten years ago, the Hasidic group, Chabad, has little success to show for its proselytizing efforts. Yet it is admired and welcomed by the religiously liberal Danish Jews for its stringent religiosity, cultural otherness, and commitment to social ethnicity. Despite the profound ideological differences between the two, relations between Chabad and the Jewish community have been markedly positive. Indeed, Chabad's organizational independence has allowed it to relieve internal strains that have increasingly troubled the established Jewish community. The anthropology of religious fundamentalism has largely focused on ideological conflicts between fundamentalist and liberal religious ideologies. This case suggests that closer attention to social processes can enrich an understanding of the complexities of social interaction and the possibilities for engagement between ideologically opposed religious groups.\n      </p>", "The permeable boundaries of the major components of Chinese religion (Confucianism, Daoism, Buddhism) and the relatively tolerant pluralism of the religious milieu are important factors in accounting for the religious acculturation of the Jewish community in the Chinese city of Kaifeng. A comparison of the acculturation of Chinese Jews with that of Muslims in Imperial China shows that, though the small size of the Jewish community and its lack of contact with other Jewish communities for a long period made it particularly susceptible to the influence of the Chinese milieu, this milieu was conducive to the acculturation of even a large minority. The unwillingness of the Catholic Church to compromise with the syncretistic milieu and its demand for an exclusive commitment from Chinese converts led to the expulsion of its missionaries. A comparison of Buddhism and Islam in China indicates that an important social structural basis for the long survival of the Kaifeng Jewish community was the combination of communal and congregational religion.\n      </p>", "Many new reproductive methods such as artificial insemination, in vitro fertilisation, freezing of human embryos, and surrogate motherhood were at first widely condemned but are now seen in Western society as not just ethically and morally acceptable, but beneficial in that they allow otherwise infertile couples to have children. The idea of human cloning was also quickly condemned but debate is now emerging. This article examines cloning from a Jewish perspective and finds evidence to support the view that there is nothing inherently wrong with the idea of human cloning. A hypothesis is also advanced suggesting that even if a body was cloned, the brain, which is the essence of humanity, would remain unique. This author suggests that the debate should be changed from \"Is cloning wrong?\" to \"When is cloning wrong?\".\n      </p>", "When discussing Jewish burial laws, Radbaz, a sixteenth-century rabbi, quotes a story about a dead woman possessed by a vampire-like demon, causing hundreds of deaths. The story attributes the woman's transformation to the fact that her corpse had remained unburied for three days\u2014violating statutes that require standing vigil over a dead body and then burying it as soon as possible. While this story conforms to the well-known tropes of epidemiology and social marginalization found in the scholarship of vampire folklore, it also underscores the importance of adhering to Jewish burial laws, and stresses society's collective responsibility in caring for all people.\n      </p>", "The paper examines Max Weber's Ancient Judaism, one of the least studied of Weber's works, and relates Ancietn Judaism to Weber's other writings, to its background in contemporary German scholarship, and to the question of the nature of Weber's historical sociology. Special emphasis is given to (1) Weber's analysis of the early Israelite tribal confederacy, (2) the role of the priesthood in ethical rationalization, and (3) the contribution of secular historiography (especially that of Eduard Meyer) as well as biblical studies to Weber's analysis.\n      </p>", "This paper analyses some historical and political questions concerning the five eclogues written by Bernardim Ribeiro, and published in 1554, in Ferrara, on the initiative of Abraham Usque, a Portuguese Jew exiled in Italy. Up until the nineteenth century, the eclogues were viewed as romantic love poetry, and only recently have been identified (together with Menina e mo\u00e7a, the pastoral novel by the same author) as works of Jewish resistance. Abraham Usque had published, a year earlier, the historical treatise Consola\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s Tribula\u00e7\u00f5es de Israel [Consolation for the Tribulations of Israel], one of the most important works of political resistance by exiled Portuguese Jews, also known as \u2018New Christians\u2019.

Four antisecularization arguments are evaluated: a change in Jewish religiosity from practice to beliefs and ethics; the development of a Jewish civil religion with its own sacred beliefs and practices; the search among Jews for supernatural compensators outside Judaism; and a revival of traditional Jewish religious practices among the fourth generation.

One began by stating the fact - of common sense that the biblical prophets reject almost completely the ludicrous and one tried to explain this phenomenon by using concepts and methods of cultural anthropology.

Then one showed how Judaism passes from a conception of \"univocal truth\" to a conception of \"plural truth\". To the first corresponds the biblical and qumranic seriousness, to the second the rabbinic joke.

The next major focus is the recent work of David Novak, who has sought in different ways to show how one can proceed from traditional Jewish premises to the endorsement of nonliberal political arrangements that nonetheless preserve the best of liberalism's achievements.

Our basic claim is that the nature of the present international system bolsters the dominant position of nationalists in a given conflict with an opposing political entity, as well as within their own constituency. For this reason, the Palestinian leadership has never entered a power-sharing arrangement with the Islamists, and in Israel, the consociational arrangement with the national religious camp floundered when this internal arrangement threatened Israel's relationship with its key ally, the USA, and jeopardized its standing in the international community. Religion expresses, however, important primordial values, particularly in Palestinian society, and is often a crucial dimension of collective identity.

This portrayal of Judaism and religious Jews drew upon the pervasive antisemitic tropes and motifs in Russian culture and society and served to demonize Judaism and its adherents.\n      </p>", "Within ancient Judaism may be found development precursive to the Protestant ethic.

The analyses of historic Judaism by Werner Sombart and Max Weber imply that this religion bears a strong modernization potential, but this has not been substantiated by empirical examination. This paper seeks to demonstrate the actualization of this potential, as suggested directly by Sombart and broadly and obliquely by Weber, through modernizing movements that arose within rabbinic Judaism. The orthodox kibbutz federation in Israel is singled out as a case study for demonstrating such actualization, by virtue of the socialist structure of its settlements and its outstanding economic success. It is contended that it is primarily the political ethic of Judaism that impels this religion toward modernization.\n      </p>", "The incongruous details included in Judah Halevi's account of the conversion of the king of the Khazars lead to the conclusion that Halevi saw proselyte Judaism as having a different status than that of \"native-born\" Judaism. This conclusion fits in well with Halevi's explicit statement that proselytes cannot be equal with Jews by birth. This inequality is expressed throughout the \"Kuzari,\" and Halevi shows, mainly by the king's constant use of the second person when discussing Judaism, that proselytes are not full participants in the religion. To understand Halevi's view of proselyte Judaism, it is useful to analyze his attitude towards Christianity and Islam, which, to a certain extent, are inferior forms of proselyte Judaism. Halevi argued, both in the \"Kuzari\" and in his poetry, that the two daughter religions of Judaism are poor imitations of the original. They do, however, fulfill the role of preparing humanity to accept Judaism as the correct religion. Their very success is to be attributed to the fact that they imitate the true divine religion; this success, in turn, serves as proof of the truth of Judaism. Eventually humanity will turn to proselyte Judaism which is a more exact imitation of Judaism but still not a perfect copy. Despite their lower status, proselytes may aspire to become pious saints who achieve a form of subprophetic inspiration. Halevi's attitude towards proselytes is a consequence of his theory of Jewish chosenness and may be a result also of his selective, particularistic reading of rabbinic sources.\n      </p>", "This research note examines patterns of denominational switching and the characteristics of switchers within Judaism in the United States. Viewing orthodox, conservative, and reform Judaism and a fourth \"nonspecific\" group as categories that range from the most traditional to the least traditional, respectively, we focus on the movement of individuals toward or away from a more traditional denomination in comparison with remaining in the same denomination in which they were raised. The data were drawn from the National Jewish Population Survey (NJPS) 2000-2001 (NJPS 2003). We found that 62 percent stay within the same group, 29 percent move away from tradition, and 9 percent move to a more traditional denomination. Multivariate logistic regression analyses show that a lower level of Jewish background, higher previous travel to Israel, a greater extent of organizational affiliation, and a higher level of spiritual feelings and beliefs are associated with moving to a more traditional denomination whereas a higher level of Jewish background, lower previous travel to Israel, and a lower level of spiritual feelings and beliefs are associated with moving to a less traditional denomination. In addition, a few sociodemographic factors (previously married, has a child at home, lives in a western state) are associated with movement toward tradition whereas others (older age, female, not living in the northeast or west) are associated with movement in the other direction.\n      </p>", "The author shows that the application of Jewish ethical precepts derived from the Halakhah (Bible, Talmud, Rabbinic writings and related sources) to 21st century concerns is not easy.

The views of Louis Finkelstein, Simon Federbusch, and Sol Roth on this question are considered. Distinctions are drawn between descriptive and prescriptive concepts of equality, as well as between absolute equality and the uniquely Judaic concept of infinite human value. Also discussed is the conflict between complete equality and absolute liberty and its resolution in the prescriptive concept of equality of negative liberty.

When sages drew consequences from things that had happened in the past, that formed a theological, not a historical, judgment, one concerning an eternal present. Proof of these propositions lies in the analysis of the treatment of events in a principal rabbinic Midrash-compilation, which recognizes no taxon, \"events, historical,\" but submerges things that have happened, e.g., the Exodus from Egypt, the destruction of the Temple, on lists of other things (\"theological things\"), in combinations that make points having nothing to do with the meaning of the past. /// [Abstract in Hebrew].\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "", "", "", "2 Maccabees, the first work to pose an opposition between Judaism and Hellenism, sees Hellenism as a new kind of threat in Jewish history.

Yet 2 Maccabees itself shows the influence of Hellenism in many ways. This article considers particularly its descriptions of the martyrs and other heroes, which employ a vocabulary of praise drawn from Greek culture rather than the biblical tradition.

Both Judaism and Christianity for most of their histories have read the Hebrew Scriptures from within an other-than-historical framework. They found in Scripture's words paradigms of an enduring present, by which all things must take their measure; they possessed no conception whatsoever of the pastness of the past. Rabbinic Judaism invented an entirely new way to think about times past and to keep all time-past, present, and future-within a single framework. For that purpose, a model was constructed, consisting of selected events held to form a pattern that imposes order and meaning on the chaos of what happens, whether past or present or future. Time measured in the paradigmatic manner is time formulated by a free-standing, (incidentally) atemporal model, not appealing to the course of sun and moon, nor concerned with the metaphor of human life and its cyclicality. Not only so, but the paradigm obliterates distinctions between past, present, and future, between here and now and then and there. The past participates in the present, the present recapitulates the past, and the future finds itself determined, predetermined really, within the same free-standing structure comprised by God's way of telling time.\n      </p>", "Franz Delitzsch (1812-1890) and Hermann Strack (1848-1922) were two missionary Protestants who were also leaders in the fight against antisemitism. Well-known figures in their own day, Strack and Delitzsch have been marginalized in studies of Protestant missionary efforts to convert Jews and also in the histories of anti-antisemitism in Imperial Germany. This essay argues that Jews and Judaism presented a difficult crux for both men, who were deeply involved in the world of Wissenschaft des Judenthums, personally and professionally. On the one hand, missionary Protestants upheld the physical and spiritual descent of Jesus from Judaism, rejected the antisemitic caricatures of Judaism found in both propagandistic and scholarly literature of the period and evinced a genuine affection for rabbinic literature. Strack, in particular, played a unique role as someone who defended Judaism not from the secular Enlightenment perspective of universal tolerance, but from the perspective of a committed Christian who was also an expert on Jews and Judaism. On the other hand, Delitzsch and Strack held very conservative views regarding a wide range of Christian dogmas. They regarded Jewish (and Christian) scholarly speculation about the comparative truth-claims of Judaism and Christianity as offensive and were profoundly supersessionist in orientation. Strack's Einleitung in den Talmud offered an accurate and sympathetic characterization of rabbinic literature; his Kommentar zum Neuen Testament aus Talmud und Midrasch offered a massive \"demonstration\" of the superiority of the New Testament material to the same.

It argues that while Jewish thought contains many \"green\" elements, it also contains a number of beliefs that challenge some contemporary environmental values. The key to the Jewish contribution to environmental ethics lies in the concept of balance-balance between the values and needs of humans and the claims of nature, and between viewing nature as a source of life and moral values and as a threat to human life and social values.

The present paper, originally offered as a contribution to an AAR session devoted to \"Mircea Eliade and the Study of Judaism,\" seeks to expand the use of that symbol by pointing to a link between the imagery of axis mundi and the tradition of the \u1e93addiq or holy man in the mystical sources of Judaism. In the writings of the Kabbalistic and Hasidic masters, the holy man is often described in various terms highly reminiscent of the notion of sacred space. The \u1e93addiq may be Zion, Temple, Jacob's ladder, or Holy of Holies. While the transference of sacred space imagery to another realm might seem especially apt for the Jews, given their long history of exile, it is pointed out that such transference never meant the replacement of the geographical Jerusalem or Holy Land by the \u1e93addiq, but rather an additional locus of divine presence: the cosmos of homo religiosus may know more than one center (e.g., Jerusalem and Rome for the Catholic). It is also briefly noted that the transference of sacred space imagery to that of sacred person takes place in Christianity and Islam as well, a point which is meant to invite further discussion. Notions of singular leadership and the place of the \u1e93addiq in Jewish cosmology are traced from first century rabbinic sources down to rival Hasidic claims in the mid-nineteenth century. Finally, one particular Hasidic reading of the \u1e93addiq as sacred center is offered as an example of the power of religious language to transcend its own formal categories in order to emerge as a profound and painful description of one man's own situation in life.\n      </p>", "This paper surveys the field of Judaism and health.

Evidence for this assumption is drawn from accounts of the king's religious practices in the \"Jewish Antiquities\" of Josephus and in rabbinic literature. A re-examination of the evidence shows that none of the observances attributed to Agrippa is uniquely Pharisaic.

None of the incidents our story relates about \"Yannai\" is paralleled in other sources about Alexander Janneus. On the other hand, all the incidents find parallels in the career of Agrippa I.

Based on interviews with newly Orthodox men and women, our analysis reveals important gender differences in the processes of recruitment and resocialization. Male recruits were more likely to have been active seekers and to have found Orthodoxy \"on their own,\" while women were more likely to enter through personal contacts. Men emphasized ethical and workplace concerns in discussing the appeal of Orthodoxy; women stressed issues related to family and personal relationships. Men reported higher levels of belief in an anthropomorphic God. Questions of gender roles were more salient for the women. These differences are consistent with gender role distinctions both in the wider society and within Orthodox Judaism.

In the context of rapid population movements, political and religious reforms, and increased acculturation, what it meant to be \"Jewish\" was redefined, and administrators needed to establish an acceptable criterion by which (baptized) Jews could be classified. On another level, this essay draws on individual petitions and government correspondence to analyze the personal choices and social dilemmas that baptized Jews faced when they attempted to return to Judaism.\n      </p>", "In today's fragmented society a large number of religious and secular neo-pagan expressions have emerged and are gathering strength. An increased interest in nature is a central element in many of its manifestations. Expressions of this attitude are found among neo-pagan believers, neo-Nazis and some extreme environmentalist currents. The ancient revulsion with regard to paganism felt by adherents of Judaism links up with the need to take stock of these contemporary phenomena. The return of paganism forces Judaism to focus on Jewish law and tradition, which proclaim that God is central in the world. Nature is not sacred and its laws represent barbarity; the Noahide laws represent civil society. There are many reasons for Jewish observers to watch attentively which direction the powerful, renewed interest in nature will take, and what consequences this may have for world Jewry.\n      </p>", "Over the course of his career, Johannes Reuchlin, the founder of Christian Hebrew studies, portrayed Jews, Judaism, and the potential contributions of Jewish theology and scholarship to Christianity in increasingly empathetic ways. His representation evolved from being rooted in the goal of appropriating Jewish Kabbalah and even Christianizing the Hebrew language to a willingness to acknowledge godliness and piety, in addition to biblical learning, in the medieval Jewish tradition.\n      </p>", "           ", "           ", "Leonard V. Rutgers's critique of my \"Jew and Gentile in the Ancient World\" mistakenly assumes that my thesis is that the masses disliked Judaism but the intellectuals admired it. He then wonders where all the alleged converts came from. In fact, I cite Jewish success in winning converts, as well as \"sympathizers,\" among the masses, and I note the importance of economic factors in inducing poverty-stricken pagans to embrace Judaism. Dr. Rutgers is skeptical as to the number of converts won by the Jews; but I note that the evidence comes from many authors--Philo, Josephus, the New Testament, rabbinic literature, and pagans alike--as well as from the fact that the Jews were expelled from Rome on at least two occasions because of their success in winning converts. Rutgers asserts that I view the interaction between Jews and non-Jews as a one-way phenomenon that was essentially religious in nature, whereas I devote much attention to the influence of non-Jewish culture upon the Jews in the Diaspora, whether in language, thought, education, athletics, the theater, and/or religion. In the Land of Israel, however, I insist that we must distinguish between outward and inward hellenization. As to the repetition of laws included in the Codex Theodosianus containing penalties for conversion to Judaism, Rutgers argues that they do not represent a current state of affairs but rather a strictly legal statement and that the repetition serves the purpose of supplying information omitted from earlier laws. But my contention is that such laws reflect answers to requests on current practical issues, and the fact that they are more than a century apart indicates that the original prohibition had not been sufficiently strong to stamp out the problem.\n      </p>", "Within the liberal wings of American Judaism, women are increasingly prominent both as leaders and participants, and men are increasingly marginal. This gender imbalance differs from most Jewish communities historically and from many other Jewish communities around the world today, in which men characteristically played the most prominent roles in Jewish affairs as well as public religious settings and rituals. The systemic alienation of American Jewish males begins in boyhood, and has profound effects on every aspect of Jewish life. This development is of concern to Jewish leaders and policy planners because it affects not only religious but also communal and demographic realities. Jewish activities have less value, and Jewish friends and potential marriage partners seem less appealing to Jewish boys and men than they do to girls and women. American Jewish men are also less engaged than American Jewish women in the \"peoplehood\" aspects of Jewishness, including visiting Israel and seeing Israel as very important to their personal lives. This essay suggests that research and policy planning efforts should be placed in the broader American context, which profoundly influences American Jews. Gender imbalance is not a foregone conclusion. Jewish social history, and other Jewish societies today, show that men need not be distant from Jewishness.\n      </p>", "This study presents a discussion of Isidore of Seville's attitude toward Judaism and the Jews as reflected in his works, and offers a tentative assessment of the impact of this attitude on medieval anti-Jewish legislation as reflected in the anti-Jewish decisions of the Fourth Council of Toledo (633), over which Isidore presided and the decisions of which he redacted. Isidore's views on Judaism and the Jews are stated both in his polemical (\"De Fide Catholica\") and in his exegetical works (\"Allegoriae and Quaestiones in Vetus Testamentum\"). They were written for the instruction of the clergy, and anti-Jewish polemic was an important feature of this educational program. Yet the sheer number and vehemence of his anti-Jewish exegeses reveal the extent of Isidore's anti-Jewish attitude: the Jews were the killers of Christ and were therefore condemned to exile and persecution. Jews who persist in their faith should be condemned to servitude and eventually to extermination. Isidore's theological anti-Judaism was translated into practical measures through the legislation of the Fourth Council of Toledo. Although the problem of Isidore's authorship of the Hispana is still unresolved, all citations of the anti-Jewish enactments of this council in the canonical collections of Burchard of Worms, Yvo of Chartres, and Gratian prove his lasting influence. Two Toledan decisions were Isidore's original and harsh contribution: Canon 60, calling for the removal of Jewish children from their families and their education by Christians, and Canon 65, forbidding Jews and Christians of Jewish origin (aut his qui ex iudaeis sunt) to hold public office. Burchard, Yvo, and Gratian retained Canons 59, 60 and 62. Gratian alone retained the original text of the famous Canon 65 and included seven out of ten anti-Jewish provisions of the Fourth Council of Toledo in his Decretum. As the Decretum became almost the only source for previous canonical decisions, it was Gratian who assured Isidore's lasting influence on anti-Jewish legislation.\n      </p>", "The virtue of humility was central to the moral-religious understanding of traditional Judaism, although the significance of the virtue has yet to receive extensive attention from contemporary scholarship. An investigation of humility's role within the tradition, particularly as it illuminates the meaning of pride and idolatry, shows that an approach focusing on the moral significance of humility in isolation from its religious meaning is misleading. Humility's simultaneous meanings as true worship and as the foundation of all good works and virtues are intertwined and interdependent. Professor Ronald M. Green's paper (1973) about humility in Judaism is valuable because it explicates and emphasizes the virtue's central and broad importance. Nevertheless, Green's attempt to show that humility is congruent with what turns out to be a particularly modern understanding of moral reason (contemporary contractual ethical theory) needs to be challenged. The prophet Micah's exhortation \"to walk humbly with thy God\" cannot be translated into Green's exhortation to enter impartially into the original position-at least not without considerable loss and distortion.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "This paper analyzes and compares the charity ethics of Judaism and Christianity during three formative historical periods: in ancient Israel, early rabbinic Judaism, and primitive Christianity. Both religious traditions have encouraged a variety of charity practices including hospitality to strangers and generous private assistance to the needy. In both traditions religious officials have at times been primary beneficiaries of charitable assistance. However, charity in each tradition has had somewhat different emphases and meanings. The charity ethic of the Tannaiam was integrated with a wide range of quite specific communal rituals and codes, which were viewed both as minimal obligations of justice and signs of personal righteousness. In primitive Christianity charity ethics were assimilated to two major principles: one called for an ethic of mutual assistance among communal members and the other called for an heroic ethic of self-sacrificing devotion. The paper notes briefly subsequent developments of the charity ethic of these religions during late antiquity and the Middle Ages. During these times the Christian standards of charity expanded to include ascetic as well as philanthropic practices. The paper concludes with some comments about social functions of charity and the unique characteristics of the charity ethic of each tradition.\n      </p>", "The University of Chicago Press recently published Fundamentalisms Comprehended, the fifth and final volume in the series based on the Academy's Fundamentalism Project. The book, edited by study codirectors Martin E. Marty (University of Chicago) and R. Scott Appleby (University of Notre Dame), marks the culmination of a six-year effort funded by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. The volume's contributors return to, and test, the project's initial premise: that all fundamentalisms share certain \"family resemblances.\" Several reconsider the project's original definition of fundamentalism as a reactive, absolutist, comprehensive mode of antisecular religious activism. Some authors challenge the idea that fundamentalism is a distinctively modern phenomenon; others question whether the term fundamentalist accurately applies to movements outside Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. Several essayists employ new approaches, drawn from psychology and literary criticism, to assess the problems of comparing fundamentalisms. The book concludes with a capstone statement that offers an analytical framework for understanding and comparing fundamentalisms worldwide. The following chapter (reprinted in abridged form and without endnotes) is by Samuel C. Heilman, Harold Proshansky Chair in Jewish Studies and Sociology at the Graduate Center and Queens College of the City University of New York. In comparing scholastic enclaves within ultra-Orthodox Judaism and Shi'ite Islam, Mr. Heilman develops a nuanced distinction between traditionalism and fundamentalism.\n      </p>", "Recovery of faunal remains in a rich deposit of household trash in Washington, Arkansas, presented an opportunity to examine ethnicity in the archaeological record because the trash was discarded by the early 1840s by the Blocks, a prominent Jewish family. Analysis of the faunal collection suggests that Block foodways did not differ markedly from contemporaneous collections in urban settings. However, the ambiguity of ethnic signatures in this case record may provide clear evidence of cognitive uncertainty and assimilation, particularly since the documentary record suggests continued identification by some family members with Judaism.\n      </p>", "This study explores the correlation between notions of language and territory in the ideology of a present-day Ultraorthodox Jewish group, the Hasidim of Satmar, in the context of Jewish Ultraorthodoxy (Haredism) in general. This involves the present-day role of Yiddish vis-\u00e0-vis Hebrew, particularly in Israel. We first address the relative sanctity of a space that accommodates a closed Haredi lifestyle and of a language in which it is expressed, then contrast this with the absolute sanctity of the land of Israel and the language of Scripture both in their intensional (positive) and in their extensional (negative) dimensions, and finally examine the quasi-absolute sanctity with which the Yiddish language and Jewish habitat of Eastern Europe have been invested. Our conclusion is that three such cases of a parallel between linguistic and territorial ideology point to an intrinsic link. Indeed, the correlation of language and territory on the plane of quasi-absolute sanctity betokens an ongoing, active ideological tie, rather than a set of worn, petrified values evoking mere lip-service. These notions of quasi-sanctity find many echoes in reality: in the use of Yiddish and in the creation of a surrogate Eastern European lifestyle in the Haredi \"ghettos.\"\n      </p>", "This essay examines the existential philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas in relation to issues of food and eating. I argue that for Levinas, the act of eating is central to founding the ethical self, and that any understanding of Levinas's approach to embodiment must begin with what it means for us to ingest the outside world. Even in Levinas's earliest work, food is already a freighted ontological category. As his ideas mature, eating is transformed from the grounding for an ethical system to the system itself. The act of giving bread to another person takes its place as the ethical gesture par excellence. The story is not that we eat. The story is that we eat and develop a relationship to eating, and that relationship in turn helps determine our sense of ourselves in the world. Eating is the ethical event. The essay ends by asking how Levinas can help us answer the question, what would it mean to imagine every bite I take, or give to another, as a direct engagement with my own and my neighbor's existence?\n      </p>", "This paper formulates the categories of \"ethics,\" \"self,\" and \"subject\" for an analysis of classical rabbinic ethics centered on the text, \"The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan.\" Early rabbis were concerned with the realms of life that today's scholars describe as ethics and self-cultivation, yet they had no overarching concepts for either the self/person or for ethics. This analysis, then, cannot rely only upon native rabbinic terminology, but also requires a careful use of contemporary categories. This paper first sets out basic features of \"Rabbi Nathan\" and presents appropriate formulations of the relevant scholarly terms. The latter sections address possibilities for employing and revising these categories in descriptive and comparative studies more broadly, first surveying relevant scholarship on Christian, Muslim, and Manichaean sources, and then turning to ancient East Asian sources with a particular focus upon passages in the \"Zhuangzi\".\n      </p>", "Ultra-orthodox (haredi) Jews in Israel have an exceptionally high fertility rate of 7.7. As most fathers spend their days studying the Bible, the women struggle to support their large families under severe economic pressures. Some women experience maternal exhaustion coping with this life situation. Contraception for pregnancy spacing raises myriad dilemmas in the haredi community, however, many of which apply to promoting family planning in religious settings more generally. In a health promotion course for 23 haredi registered nurses at the University of Haifa in 2006-2007, pregnancy spacing was selected as the subject of the class project, the main aim of which was to convey an influential health message in a culturally acceptable manner. As the issue was debated, it was agreed the project should also address a range of women's health problems as well as pregnancy spacing. Thus, maternal nutrition, pelvic floor tone, dental health, maternal exhaustion and competition over number of children were added. A brochure was prepared and widely distributed in the haredi community, where it was well received. This paper describes the classroom dynamics during the planning and application of the project. It illustrates the importance of cultural awareness when addressing sensitive issues and communities with particular cultural dispositions. /// Les Juifs ultra-orthodoxes (haredim) en Isra\u00ebl ont un taux exceptionnellement \u00e9lev\u00e9 de f\u00e9condit\u00e9 de 7,7.

Informed by an ethnographic study of popular music programming on national and regional radio stations it is shown how broadcasting schedules operate as a uniform pendulum alternating between everyday life and times of commemoration or emergency. Following examples of music broadcasting during 'Memorial Day for Fallen Soldiers,' the first Gulf War and terror attacks during the second Palestinian Intifadah the author explores a practice of \"mood shifting\" that is borrowed from the bureaucratic logic of commemoration rituals to times of war and terror attacks. The mood shift activates a commemorative mode that echoes sacred mnemonic devices of Jewish remembrance. Consequently, it is argued that times of emergency in Israeli culture are represented through and subordinated to sacred experience, substituting a political interpretation of terrorism with a mythic framework.\n      </p>", "In the post-World War II years, strict separation of church and state, especially with regard to education, has been viewed as an essential ingredient of social comity in the United States. In Canada, however, that has not been so. In fact, there, religion and education have been intimately connected since colonial times, and the role of religion in the schools has constitutional sanction. In the years before World War II, the outsider status of Jews and Judaism in schools and universities was demeaning to them. Ultimately it served to reinforce group loyalty, but Jewish educational institutions did not emerge. The much less parochial and eventually multicultural environment that developed beginning in the 1950s allowed Jews to become part of the mainstream. Ethnic legitimacy, however, fostered the development of a very successful system of all-day Jewish schools and of programs of Jewish Studies at universities across the country. This essay discusses these developments and suggests explanations for the seeming paradox.\n      </p>", "L'\" Histoire du mariage de Jacob \", \u00e9pisode fondateur de la Gen\u00e8se a suscit\u00e9 maints commentaires dans la tradition juive europ\u00e9enne.
