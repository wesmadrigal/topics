{"total_words": 471, "documents": ["Quantitative examination of major pathways and routes of exposure to pesticides is essential for determining human risk. The current study was conducted in two apartments and examines the accumulation of the pesticide chlorpyrifos in childrens' toys after the time suggested for reentry after application. It has been established for the first time that a semivolatile pesticide will accumulate on and in toys and other sorbant surfaces in a home via a two-phase physical process that continues for at least 2 weeks postapplication. A summation of the above for a 3-6-year-old child yielded an estimated nondietary total dose of 208 \u03bcg/kg/day. Potential exposure from the inhalation pathway was negligible, while dermal and nondietary oral doses from playing with toys contributed to 39 and 61% of the total dose, respectively. If children with high frequency mouthing behavior are considered as candidates for acute exposure to chlorpyrifos residues, the estimated acute dose could be as high as 356 \u03bcg/kg/day. Routine reapplication of pesticides could lead to continued accumulation in toys and other sorbant surfaces, e.g., pillows, with large sorbant reservoirs, which can become a long-term source of exposure to a child. Estimates of a child's nondietary exposure to chlorpyrifos associated with toys and other sorbant surfaces for a period of 1 week following application appear to be of public health concern, and studies of actual childhood exposure from this pathway are warranted in the home environment. The above information should be used to determine if current procedures for postapplication reentry are sufficient and to evaluate the need for procedures to store frequently used household toys, pillows, and other sorbant objects during insecticidal application.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Boys played more with vehicles and girls spent more time with dolls, in domestic role play and in dressing-up. Both boys and girls played about equally with items generally considered non-stereotyped.

Managers in many businesses can learn valuable lessons in managing uncertainty from toy makers. This article describes supply chain lessons focused on reducing risk by actively managing both demand and supply variability. These lessons include product variety strategies based on product extensions; rolling mix strategies; leveraged licensing agreements; coordinated outsourcing strategies; and hedging against political and currency risk by producing in many different countries.\n      </p>", "In a laboratory study of imported natural poultry and artificial toy items, 6 of the 18 toys examined were found to be contaminated with Salmonella give. The natural poultry toys were 2- or 3-day-old birds that were eviscerated and stuffed. The method of processing and preserving these toys was not determined. Isolation of Salmonella organisms from these toys destined for the retail market as Easter basket decorations revealed a source of potential outbreaks of salmonellosis. The study emphasizes the ubiquitousness of Salmonella, the value of continual surveillance, and the need for more effective methods of control.\n      </p>", "Claims that young infants fail to react in a social manner to one another and that toys preempt attention to peers were assessed by comparing the interactions observed between infant peers when they met in the presence of toys versus in their absence. 44 pairs of unacquainted infants (either 10-12 or 22-24 months of age) came with their mothers to an unfamiliar room. Without toys available in the room, infants of both ages more often contacted one another, smiled at and gestured to one another, and duplicated each other's actions. With toys, they showed and exchanged toys and spent more time synchronously manipulating similar play material. The results document that infants as young as 10 months of age are responsive to the person and behavior of an unfamiliar peer and that they are no less responsive than older infants to the social versus nonsocial aspects of a novel setting.\n      </p>", "This article describes the development of the history of toys through a survey of the literature. It shows how this history originated in different ways in France, Germany, and England, and involved contact with other disciplines such as folklore, ethnography, psychology, economic history, and sociology. The development of toy history is related to the policies and practices of the Bethnal Green Museum. Collections of toys were displayed in the South Kensington Museum in the 1850s, but their status within the Victoria and Albert Museum remained, for many decades, uncertain. 'Would not be wanted in our department' was a characteristic response to opportunities for acquisitions. Nevertheless, from an early stage, the V &amp; A designated the Bethnal Green Museum (BGM) as the chief site for the display of toys, and the collections gradually grew. In the early 1970s, with the transfer to BGM of the V &amp; A's holdings of children's clothes and furniture and the acquisition of the Renier Collection of some 80,000 children's publications, the museum became a specialist centre for the study of childhood. This status was recognized by its designation, in 1974, as the Bethnal Green Museum of Childhood. Yet its existence was to be called into question less than a decade later by the Rayner Scrutiny. BGM successfully made the case against closure. And, in the following decade, changing attitudes within the V &amp; A made the status of the childhood collections less anomalous. More recently their particular significance as one of the largest such collections in the world has led to the redesignation of BGM as the National Museum of Childhood. The author outlines the history of the collections and their display and indicates how recent literature, together with the more inclusive intellectual approach which now obtains within the V &amp; A, have given the BGM, though severely limited in its resources, a new sense of confidence and purpose.\n      </p>", "The goal of these studies was to investigate how preschool children use gender-based reasoning in making judgments about toy preferences for themselves and for others. In Studies 1 and 2, children (n = 22, n = 71) were shown unfamiliar, non-sex-typed toys and asked to rate how much they, other girls, and other boys would like each toy. As expected, children made gender-based inferences: \"What I like, children of my sex will also like, and children of the other sex will not like.\" Study 3 was designed to assess how children use gender-based reasoning to make decisions about attractive and unattractive toys when they are given gender labels. Children (n = 91) were shown unfamiliar toys varying in attractiveness that were given explicit gender labels (e. g., \"this is a toy girls really like\") or no label. With a different experimenter (to avoid demand characteristics), children rated their own and others' liking of the toys. Children used gender labels to guide their own preferences and their expectations for others. Even with very attractive toys, children liked toys less if they were labeled as being for the other sex, and expected other girls and boys to do the same. The role of gender-based reasoning in cognitive theories of gender and on children's play preferences is discussed.\n      </p>", "A review of Plains ethnographies indicates that children were invariably supplied with small-scale bows and arrows to practice archery skills at an early age. If small arrowheads tipped these toys, toy arrowheads should appear in the archaeological record. An examination of Late Prehistoric projectile points from the processing area at Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump in southwestern Alberta, Canada, was undertaken to determine whether toys could be distinguished in this assemblage. This paper argues that numerous tiny, poorly made arrowheads from this site could not function as adult weapons and are better explained as toys. The comparative workmanship and neck widths of projectile points are evaluated as indices useful to distinguish toys from adult weapons. The results of this study may have important ramifications beyond Head-Smashed-In. The occurrence of toys in an assemblage may affect considerations of social organization and site function at Plains sites. Also, the inappropriate classification of toys may hamper interpretations of culture history based on point typology.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Educational toys, objects intended to teach skill or develop abilities, became a common feature of postwar childhood.

The present study was designed to determine whether parents encourage involvement with sex-stereotyped toys or avoidance of cross-sex-stereotyped toys and to determine whether masculine and feminine toys lead to different patterns of parent-child interaction, regardless of gender. 40 parent-toddler dyads were videotaped while playing with 6 different sets of sex-stereotyped toys. Equal numbers of boys and girls were observed with mothers and fathers. The children showed greater involvement when playing with same-sex-typed toys than with cross-sex toys even when statistically controlling for parents' behaviors. Parents' verbal behaviors, involvement, and proximity to the child differed across toy groups, regardless of the parent's or child's gender. Parents' initial nonverbal responses to the toys, however, were more positive when the toys were stereotyped for the child's and parent's gender than when they were not.\n      </p>", "In this inquiry, I have examined how 11- to 14-year-old students used technology to design and produce toys.

Rooted in our culture's longstanding ambivalence regarding leisure and its concerns about children's vulnerability, claims about troublesome toys also reflect anxiety about children's increased susceptibility to non-familial influences, their growing access to toys, and an expanded toy industry, as well as an active social movement sector. Typically, these claims argue that toys represent undesirable values, and that children who play with the toys acquire those values. Parallel arguments may be found in claims regarding other forms of popular and material culture. Interactionists should be wary of making or accepting these claims, because rather than treating children's play as a topic (or empirical study, such claims locate meaning in objects, rather than actors.\n      </p>", "The turbulent social conflict over what counts as good-enough mothering and the greedy institution of work leaves many women trapped in what Joan Williams called the gender system of domesticity. Like self-help books, advertisements can lead mothers toward a culturally sanctioned compromise. This article looks at the \"cultural deals\" being offered for mothers by toy catalogs. The author examined the marketing of more than 3,500 toys in 11 catalogs from the 2000-2001 holiday season. She found that the catalogs presented toys as solutions that would allow mothers to be good mothers without having to physically be there, even as the advertising copy evoked images of companionship and togetherness. Catalogs also emphasized skill building over fun, defined only certain skills as skills in the first place, and dismissed nurturing as feelings at best worth of expression and not of practice. The author argues that the toys promise to perpetuate for the children the same contradictions the catalogs purport to solve for their mothers.\n      </p>", "12-month-old infants were observed responding to 3 stimulus toys: 1 pleasant, 1 ambiguous, and 1 aversive. One-third of the infants (N = 16 in the final analysis) were randomly assigned to each of 3 maternal display conditions. In 1 condition mothers displayed positive affect in face, voice, and gestures; in 1, mothers displayed negative, disgust affect; and in 1, mothers were silent and neutral. After all 3 toys had been presented once, infants in the Mother Positive and Mother Negative conditions were shown the toys again, this time with their mothers silent and neutral. The specificity of effects was examined by comparing infant responses to the stimulus toys with responses to free-play toys. Maternal displays influenced responses only to the stimulus toys as predicted by the social referencing hypothesis. The results also suggested that maternal negative affect displays have a more immediate effect on infant behavior than do positive affect displays. Finally, the data indicated that the infants carried over their appraisals to the second presentation of the toys even though their mothers ceased delivering the affectively toned messages.\n      </p>", "Infants spend much of their waking time exploring toys and other objects.

(2) What type of social acts are used during these early encounters? (3) Do toys facilitate the interactions? Successful attempts to interact occurred about 47% of the time. Interactions of the form \"social behavior/social response\" were the most common exchange even at 6 months, although less social sequences were also common. Within the exchanges, vocalizations, smiles, and touches were the most frequent social acts. Toys were found to have a significant effect. More and longer interactions occurred in the absence of toys, and every social act with the exception of object related social acts was more frequent in the toys-absent condition.

The order of maternal condition was counterbalanced. Maternal affect had no effect on infant reactions on the first trial with each toy. On the second trial, positive maternal affect resulted in more positive infant responses, but only for the ambiguous toy. No significant effects of maternal affect were found on either trial for the pleasant or fear-eliciting toys.

Consumer goods both reflect and construct the complex social relations that give rise to gift-giving. Toys emerged as mass consumer items in the nineteenth century because the responded to the internal antinomies within the ideology of bourgeois domesticity. The family as a privileged site of affection underwriting a healthy individuality often worked at cross-purposes to the family as the site of construction of culturally middle-class citizens. The inevitable tensions between these competing ideals and tasks were resolved through family festivals, especially Christmas. Christmas emphasized the mutual affection of the family members through attention to the immediate desires of other family members. This attention to the desires of children tended to encourage toys as a gift since more than any other gift, particularly books, they were capable of generating immediate excitement and happiness.\n      </p>", "Various themes in the scholarly literature have argued that an entrenched military is able to maintain its level of influence through the manipulation of perceptions of a hostile environment. While I argue that any alleged manipulation is generally not carried out under the guise of conscious 'security policy', there is some evidence that the perception of an international threat can be and is maintained through the use of the media and entertainment outlets. Using the prevalence of war toys and war movies as indicators of societal symbols, I find that there is a consistent pattern between: (a) the trends of militarization in the USA, (b) public attitudes toward military spending and the expectation of a future war, (c) the popularity of war toys and movies, and (d) press reporting with pro-military themes. The correlation between war movies and societal militarization is 0.83; war toys and militarization 0.74; and press reporting with pro-military themes and militarization 0.44. These patterns appear to hold in the USA over the first 85 years of the 20th century, and not only lend credence to those arguments that suggest that a threat need not be existential for the military to remain 'well prepared', but also point to areas that could help facilitate long-term demilitarization efforts.\n      </p>", "8 19-month-old toddlers were observed during free play at home, with and without a familiar toddler playmate.

Less verbal interaction with mother occurred during the peer's presence than during the peer's absence; in contrast, frequencies of mother-toddler non-care-giving touching were similar. The findings suggest the importance of the peer as a social object in the second year of life. Peers enhance toddlers' competence with their own toys. Moreover, the selective effect on verbal versus tactile interaction with mother suggests some differentiation of the social from emotional aspects of the mother-toddler relationship at this age.\n      </p>", "Motivated by an actual problem, we discuss a sampling situation involving estimation of the incidence rate of a rare phenomenon in connection with the functioning of an electronic toy. Because of a manufacturing fault, such toys may have a built-in loose metallic piece which moves freely while the children play with the toy. As soon as the freely moving metal lands into a designated potential danger zone inside the toy, it gives an electric shock! The problem is to provide point and interval estimators of the chance of this event happening which is a priori known to be rather negligible.\n      </p>", "To define and evaluate new strategies for merchandising Amoco gasoline, motor oil, tires, batteries, and accessories, Standard Oil (Indiana) used a combination of judgmental modeling and multiattribute utility theory. The model combined objective data and subjective assessments to calculate objective weights for the multiattribute model. Ordinary sets of Tinker Toys were used to demonstrate the analytical approach of the model to management. Another visual aid, \"the Christmas tree,\" was used to display new merchandising strategies. A guaranteed car repair strategy, Certicare, was selected and is projected to improve annual profit by $10 million and to strengthen the dealer organization.\n      </p>", "Children with autism were taught spontaneous requests through a time delay procedure. Unlike previous research, which usually employed food as the target stimuli to be requested, the present study used toy pieces from multi-component toys. The procedure involved presenting a child with the target stimulus, with the trainer prompting the child by immediately modeling the request response. When the response was imitated without error, prompting was delayed with the time interval gradually being increased over trials. A spontaneous or imitated response was reinforced by giving the child the requested object. As the stimulus/model interval increased, children with autism were expected to initiate the request by themselves prior to the prompt. The efficacy of the time delay procedure was assessed using a multiple baseline across subject design with three Chinese boys with autism. Results showed that the three children acquired a 100% performance within five to nine sessions of training and the skill was maintained at the one-month and three-month followups. Furthermore, the learned response transferred to various conditions when tested across setting, person, toy, and food items. These results suggest that toys, the multi-component ones in particular, served well as reinforcers for language training. Furthermore these finding? confirmed the practical utility of the time delay procedure for promoting spontaneous communication skills in children with autism.\n      </p>", "Girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) who were exposed to high levels of androgen in the prenatal and early postnatal periods showed increased play with boys' toys and reduced play with girls' toys compared with their unexposed female relatives at ages 3 to 8. Boys with CAH did not differ from their male relatives in play with boys' or girls' toys. These results suggest that early hormone exposure in females has a masculinizing effect on sex-typed toy preferences.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

In this article, I want to make a similar case, based on Erik H. Erikson's \"Toys and Reasons\" (1977), for art (in this particular case, a painting of the Annunciation). I have made a similar case for the restorative role of art in articles on Leonard da Vinci's Mona Lisa (Capps, Pastoral Psychology, 53, 107-137, 2004) and James McNeill Whistler's painting of his mother (Capps, Pastoral Psychology, 2007d). In the present article, however, I focus on the special biographical circumstances in Erikson's own development of a melancholy self and the painting he discusses in \"Toys and Reasons\", thereby suggesting that individuals may find a particular work of art especially relevant to their own experience of melancholy. I conclude with Erikson's testimonial at the memorial service of a colleague and friend who translated her own melancholy into her service to others.\n      </p>", "The reproduction of racism and class-based oppression are taught to children through various cultural media, including toys and games. Between 1880 and 1930, the popularity of racialized toys and banks were fear-based responses to the perceived encroachment by \"foreign and exotic\" migrations of African American, Chinese, Irish and Native Americans into the cultural landscape of white middle-class America. This article analyzes how artifacts associated with children, such as mechanical banks, clockwork figures, and other toys are part of a larger cultural structure that viewed race and class as inseparable, and that these objects were essential in the development of a learned habitus that exposed white middle class children in the Victorian era to a racially and class oriented world. We argue that these objects reflect both the times in which they were made, and illuminate the relationship between adults and a newfound emphasis on children and childhood, in which toys serves as symbolic mediators of culture.\n      </p>", "Toy choices of 3- to 10-year-old children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and of their unaffected siblings were assessed. Also assessed was parental encouragement of sex-typed toy play. Girls with CAH displayed more male-typical toy choices than did their unaffected sisters, whereas boys with and without CAH did not differ. Mothers and fathers encouraged sex-typical toy play in children with and without CAH. However, girls with CAH received more positive feedback for play with girls' toys than did unaffected girls. Data show that increased male-typical toy play by girls with CAH cannot be explained by parental encouragement of male-typical toy play. Although parents encourage sex-appropriate behavior, their encouragement appears to be insufficient to override the interest of girls with CAH in cross-sexed toys.\n      </p>", "The article describes how the boundary between necessary and unnecessary consumption items was defined in Finland in the years following World War II. On the basis of extensive comparative data, it focuses on the history of two items: the washing machine and the cellular phone. The data consist of press coverage and material published by manufactuters and consumer counseling organizations. The need for household appliances was invented, shaped, normalized, and legitimized through a social interaction process in which the media were a central vehicle. The data suggest that the need for novelties is interpreted though similar types of cultural modes, no matter what the product or type of cultural text. Thus, the entry of technology into the home in the postwat years was accompanied by a discussion flavored not only by technological determinism, but also by a form of social and cultural determinism manifested in deep-grounded conceptual distinctions, such as tools versus toys. The world-tecord pace at which Finnish consumers took up new technology in the postwar period provides illustrative evidence and new stimuli for evaluating the potential for digitalizing the home in the twenty-first century.\n      </p>", "This article examines the contribution of inadequate design to the virtual demise of the indigenous British toy industry from the 1970s onwards. The protection of the home market from 1932, and the unchallenging nature of the imperial markets to which the bulk of exports were directed, induced a degree of complacency among manufacturers which proved fatal in the more competitive international economic environment developing after the ending of the long post-war boom. A survey conducted by Children's Play Activities (Ltd.) confirmed other evidence that lack of innovative concepts, poor product quality and outmoded design presentation were all important features of this lack of competitiveness. The final part of the article attributes these design defects to a lack of consumer research, and a corporate business culture which was resistant to collaborative work on design, marketing or production, and suspicious of designers lacking direct experience of the industry. There is also evidence to suggest that the manufacturers were suspicious of intellectual influences which were pushing toy design towards the educationally stimulating and the politically correct. Finally, it is noted that Britain lacked any significant supply of trained toy designers.\n      </p>", "Psychological scientists use statistical information to determine the workings of human behavior. We argue that young children do so as well. Over the course of a few years, children progress from viewing human actions as intentional and goal directed to reasoning about the psychological causes underlying such actions. Here, we show that preschoolers and 20-month-old infants can use statistical information\u2014namely, a violation of random sampling\u2014to infer that an agent is expressing a preference for one type of toy instead of another type of toy. Children saw a person remove five toys of one type from a container of toys. Preschoolers and infants inferred that the person had a preference for that type of toy when there was a mismatch between the sampled toys and the population of toys in the box. Mere outcome consistency, time spent with the toys, and positive attention toward the toys did not lead children to infer a preference. These findings provide an important demonstration of how statistical learning could underpin the rapid acquisition of early psychological knowledge.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Ganaway argues that toys allowed millions of comfortably situated Germans to participate in a debate in Imperial Germany about the role modern technology would play in shaping the ideal middle-class citizen. Germany's nascent consumer culture easily facilitated this argument. Entrepreneurs envisioned the ideal German as a masculine engineer controlling human and natural environments. They marketed accurately miniaturized toys designed to turn boys into manipulators of technology and girls into domestic managers. Artists, intellectuals and maternal feminists demanded humanistically-trained individuals who could unite Germany's fractious society. They called for hand-crafted miniatures that emphasized imagination and creativity and blurred gender boundaries. Neither side wanted to entirely destroy the other, but both felt compelled to argue that only their vision could ensure a strong Germany. In the end, the engineers and entrepreneurs won this debate, but only at the cost of assimilating the most appealing aspects of \"reform\" toys into the factory process. Artists and intellectuals carved out a space for themselves and their vision of the middle-class via the market which outlived the Kaiserreich. This shows that consumer culture permits personal self-fashioning; while it tends to reinforce the power of dominant social groups it is remarkably permeable to subversive ideas.\n      </p>", "60 33-68-month-old children were interviewed to assess relations among sex-stereotype knowledge, stereotype flexibility, gender constancy, sex-typed toy preferences, gender schematization, and recognition memory for gender-relevant illustrations. Age was positively associated with recognition memory for stereotype-consistent and inconsistent activities and negatively associated with simple recognition errors. Gender schematization was negatively associated with memory for stereotype-inconsistent activities and positively associated with gender transformational memory errors. Boys' toy preferences were more stereotype consistent and, for all children, preferences for sex-appropriate toys were positively associated with age and gender schematization. Sex-inappropriate preferences were negatively associated with gender schematization. Neither stereotype knowledge, stereotype flexibility, nor gender constancy reliably predicted memories or preferences.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Because food patterns established in childhood influence life-long patterns, toy premiums that may sway food preference are being questioned. The motivational pull of collectible toys is of particular interest in this discussion because repeated exposure to foods engendered by frequent purchases to obtain collectibles may establish food preference. Thus, Study 1 addresses the role of collectible toys as premiums accompanying food offerings. The authors show that these premiums influence children's attitudes toward both unhealthful and healthful meal offerings. In Study 2, a choice task reveals that a healthful meal is favored when it is paired with a collectible toy premium and the unhealthful meal is presented with no premium.
