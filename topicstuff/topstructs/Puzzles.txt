It presents a purported puzzle whose solution is said to call upon the \"entities\" of semantics (meanings) and psychological explanation (Psychological states, beliefs, concepts). The paper separates three separate alleged puzzles that can be read into Frege's data. It then argues that none are genuine puzzles. In turn, much of the Frege-driven theoretical development, motivated as an inevitable \"solution\", is thrown into doubt.\n      </p>", "Recreational problem-solving activities such as word searches, crossword puzzles, tic-tac-toe, scrambled words, and word creation represent interesting and challenging opportunities for students to acquire Spanish vocabulary. This article discusses practical strategies designed to elicit vocabulary without translation and presents examples of a cross-skills approach that requires students to utilize different linguistic abilities to generate appropriate lexical responses. Figures at the end provide specific examples to demonstrate how these exercises may be constructed.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "This article explores Gareth Evans's idea that there are such things as descriptive names, i.e. referring expressions introduced by a definite description which have, unlike ordinary names, a descriptive content. Several ignored semantic and modal aspects of this idea are spelled out, including a hitherto little explored notion of rigidity, super-rigidity. The claim that descriptive names are (rigidified) descriptions, or abbreviations thereof, is rejected. It is then shown that Evans's theory leads to certain puzzles concerning the referential status of descriptive names and the evaluation of identity statements containing them. A tentative solution to these puzzles is suggested, which centres on the treatment of definite descriptions as referring expressions.\n      </p>", "Boggle logic puzzles are based on the popular word game Boggle played backwards. Given a list of words, the problem is to recreate the board. We explore these puzzles on a 3 \u00d7 3 board and find the minimum number of three-letter words needed to create a puzzle with a unique solution.

Improving on Thomas Kuhn's rudimentary account of puzzles in science, this paper formulates logical and functional criteria for the occurrence of scientific puzzles, and examines the two-fold nature of their solutions. Then, with the aid of erotetic logic, puzzle-posing questions are identified, their presuppositional relations to scientific theory and explanations are explored, and a new tool for history of science research (sub-puzzle analysis) is developed.\n      </p>", "Although everyone is for \"more theory,\" most of us have rather little understanding of how to get \"more theory.\" This essay suggests one approach to theory development: thinking in terms of puzzles. To develop the concept of \"puzzlement,\" three bodies of literature are reviewed, and sets of conflicting evidence are presented as puzzles. The solutions to the puzzles are left to the next generation of IR researchers.\n      </p>", "The authors demonstrate that marketing actions, such as pricing, can alter the actual efficacy of products to which they are applied. These placebo effects stem from activation of expectancies about the efficacy of the product, a process that appears not to be conscious. In three experiments, the authors show that consumers who pay a discounted price for a product (e.g., an energy drink thought to increase mental acuity) may derive less actual benefit from consuming this product (e.g., they are able to solve fewer puzzles) than consumers who purchase and consume the exact same product but pay its regular price. The studies consistently support the role of expectancies in mediating this placebo effect. The authors conclude with a discussion of theoretical, managerial, and public policy implications of the findings.\n      </p>", "In textbook expositions of the equity-premium, riskfree-rate and equity-volatility puzzles, agents are sure of the economy's structure while growth rates are normally distributed. But because of parameter uncertainty the thin-tailed normal distribution conditioned on realized data becomes a thick-tailed Student-t distribution, which changes the entire nature of what is considered \"puzzling\" by reversing every inequality discrepancy needing to be explained. This paper shows that Bayesian updating of unknown structural parameters inevitably adds a permanent tail-thickening effect to posterior expectations. The expected-utility ramifications of this for asset pricing are strong, work against the puzzles, and are very sensitive to subjective prior beliefs-even with asymptotically infinite data.\n      </p>", "Complex computer and video games may provide a vehicle, based on appropriate theoretical concepts, to transform the educational landscape. Building on the original game object model (GOM) a new more detailed model is developed to support concepts that educational computer games should: be relevant, explorative, emotive, engaging, and include complex challenges; support authentic learning activities that are designed as narrative social spaces where learners are transformed through exploration of multiple representation, and reflection; be gender-inclusive, include non-confrontational outcomes, and provide appropriate role models; develop democracy, and social capital through dialogue that is supported by means of computer mediated-communication tools; and include challenges, puzzles or quests, which form the core of the learning process, where access to explicit knowledge, conversations, and reflection results in the construction of tacit knowledge. It is argued that the GOM version II can be used not only to support the development of educational computer games but to provide a mechanism to evaluate the use of computer games in the classroom.\n      </p>", "Parental involvement in a math program that includes professional development for teachers can improve relationships and increase student motivation and achievement.\n      </p>", "This paper identifies the more glaring puzzles and contradictions in the policy instruments embodied in the budget, seeks to locate their sources in terms of macro-economic models and examines the efficacy of alternative policies. The analysis leads to the conclusion that there is substantial scope for public investment without adding to inflationary pressures. Such investment would in fact raise the overall saving ratio of the economy and reduce the investment-saving gap in the public sector. Also missing in the budgetary measures is a rational system of tariffs, taxes and subsidies based on considerations of both comparative advantage in production and comparative benefits from domestic absorption of goods and services.\n      </p>", "An edge tessellation is a tiling of the plane generated by reflecting a polygon in its edges. In this article we prove that a polygon generating an edge tessellation is one the following eight types: a rectangle; an equilateral, 60-right, isosceles right, or 120-isosceles triangle; a 120-rhombus; a 60-90-120 kite; or a regular hexagon. A stamp folding puzzle is a paper folding problem constrained to the perforations on a sheet of postage stamps. Such sheets necessarily embed in an edge tessellation. On page 143 of his book Piano-Hinged Dissections: Time to Fold!, G. Frederickson poses the following conjecture: \u201cAlthough triangular stamps have come in a variety of different triangular shapes, only three shapes seem suitable for [stamp] folding puzzles: equilateral, isosceles right triangles, and 60\u00b0-right triangles.\u201d We prove that the four non-obtuse polygons mentioned above generate edge tessellations suitable for stamp folding puzzles. Our proof of suitability, which establishes Frederickson\u2019s Conjecture, exhibits explicit algorithms for folding each suitable edge tessellation into a packet of single stamps.\n      </p>", "The 1990s have seen a renewed interest in issues of capital accumulation and growth. New paradigms for saving, investment, and growth have been advanced to address theoretical and empirical puzzles and to guide the design of better policies. This paper provides a policy-oriented review of recent theoretical and empirical work on the determinants of saving and investment and on their links to growth. It takes stock of new findings as well as still unresolved questions and gives particular attention to empirical regularities and to the policy issues relevant to developing countries.\n      </p>", "This article examines several ways that word search puzzles can be created and modified for use in the foreign language classroom. Although computer technology has made the customized creation of word search puzzles easier than ever before, teachers should be aware of the pedagogical needs of their students and modify the word search puzzles accordingly. How word search puzzles can focus on a wide variety of vocabulary, grammar topics and skills is shown by a number of examples. Web addresses for both Macintosh and Windows resources are provided.\n      </p>", "Comparative research has consistently established a relationship between support for so-called extremist parties and various measures of political turmoil. The present analysis combines citizen survey data from 12 nations with aggregate data to address two puzzles posed by these results: (1) the role of such parties as reflections of citizen discontent or as independent sources of turmoil; (2) the importance of the parties' ideological extremism or their alienation from the system. The findings suggest a sharp distinction between parties' proximate impact on legislative turmoil (cabinet instability) and their primarily associative role in riots and protests. They also emphasize system alienation, rather than left-right ideological extremism as such, as a source of turmoil.\n      </p>", "A sentence containing a number of definite descriptions, each lying within the scope of its predecessor, is naturally read as asserting the uniqueness of a sequence of objects satisfying the descriptions. The project of providing a general uniform procedure for eliminating embedded definite descriptions that gets this and other logical forms right is impeded by several puzzles.\n      </p>", "Light is puzzling in modern physics-witness wave-particle duality, the two-slit experiment, and the invariant speed of light. These puzzles are not intrinsic to light but arise from overly narrow views of light. Disregarding the expansive, unitary nature of light that informs everyday experience, modern physics treats light as if it were self-bounded and separable. Further, physics assumes that light is not complicit with observations of light, that the two are separable. By likening light to light-illuminated entities, these attitudes set the stage for puzzles. When, however, conceptions of light are aligned with visual experience, those puzzles become occasions of understanding. This is because visual experience already embodies that aspect of light which physics finds so anomalous: nonseparability. Light's interactive vastness shows up wherever light shows up, and because no observer can back away from light or step outside its integrative embrace, different parts of light (photons) cannot be lifted out of the observation as distinct - i.e., distinctly-observed - entities.\n      </p>", "This paper is about a puzzle \u2013 I'll call it 'the Return' \u2013 that puts considerable pressure upon Christians to accept a very robust scepticism about the future. Those familiar with work on so-called 'lottery puzzles' will notice much similarity between those puzzles and the Return. However, there is an important difference that renders the Return an especially difficult problem for a Christian who believes that he has much knowledge about the future. After introducing the Return, I'll argue that it is immune to the most promising non-sceptical approaches to more familiar lottery puzzles.\n      </p>", "Students analyze items from the media to answer mathematical questions related to the article.

It shows that allowing for preference reversals, as it is the case in the \"quasi-hyperbolic discounting\" and \"temptation\" models, may contribute to explain jointly these economic puzzles. A life-cycle model based on temptation preferences, in particular, is attractive as it preserves time consistency and can be solved with standard dynamic programming techniques.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "The odd\u2013even effect in numerical processing has been explained as the easier processing of even numbers compared with odd numbers. We investigated this effect in Sudoku puzzles, a reasoning problem that uses numbers but does not require arithmetic operations. Specifically, we asked whether the odd\u2013even effect occurred with Sudoku puzzles and whether individual differences in working memory (WM), aging, and experience with Sudoku modulated this effect. We manipulated the presence of odd and even numbers in Sudoku puzzles, measured WM with the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and backward digit span task, tested older and younger adults, and collected Sudoku experience frequency. Performance on Sudoku was more accurate for even puzzles than odd ones. Younger, experienced, and higher-WM participants were more accurate on Sudoku, but these individual difference variables did not interact with the odd\u2013even effect. Odd numbers may impose more cognitive load than even numbers, but future research is needed to examine how age, experience, or WM may influence the odd\u2013even effect.\n      </p>", "Three puzzles arise in looking at the history of public education through the lens of gender. Why did some major shifts in gender practices, like the emergence of coeducation in the early 19th century, take place with only minor controversy and in relative silence? Conversely, why did certain kinds of vehement policy talk--for example about the way hard study ruined girls' health or about the way women teachers \"feminized\" boys--affect practice so little? And finally, how did reforms that, on their face, had little to do with gender actually alter the two sexes' educational opportunities? This essay focuses on the complexities of silent institutional change and stability, the reasons why conscious gender policies often left checquered results, and the implications of this history for gender policy and practice today.\n      </p>", "The central claim in this paper is that by explicitly introducing costs of international trade (narrowly, transport costs, but more broadly, tariffs, nontariff barriers, and other trade costs), one can go far toward explaining a great number of the main empirical puzzles that international macroeconomists have struggled with over twenty-five years. Our approach elucidates J. McCallum's home-bias-in-trade puzzle, the Feldstein-Horioka saving-investment puzzle, the French-Poterba equity-home-bias puzzle, and the Backus-Kehoe-Kydland consumption-correlations puzzle. That one simple alteration to an otherwise canonical international macroeconomic model can help substantially to explain such a broad range of empirical puzzles, including some that previously seemed intractable, suggests a rich area for future research. We also address a variety of international pricing puzzles, including the purchasing-power-parity puzzle emphasized by Rogoff, and what we term the exchange-rate disconnect puzzle. The latter category of riddles includes the Meese-Rogoff exchange-rate forecasting puzzle and the Baxter-Stockman neutrality-of-exchange-rate-regime puzzle. Here, although many elements need to be added to our extremely simple model, trade costs still play an essential role.\n      </p>", "The maximum degree of hierarchical structure of organisms has risen over the history of life, notably in three transitions: the origin of the eukaryotic cell from symbiotic associations of prokaryotes; the emergence of the first multicellular individuals from clones of eukaryotic cells; and the origin of the first individuated colonies from associations of multicellular organisms. The trend is obvious in the fossil record, but documenting it using a high-resolution hierarchy scale reveals three puzzles: 1) the rate of origin of new levels accelerates, at least until the early Phanerozoic; 2) after that, the trend may slow or even stop; and 3) levels may sometimes arise out of order. The three puzzles and their implications are discussed; a possible explanation is offered for the first.\n      </p>", "Standards-based, hands-on activities spotlight the classic story.\n      </p>", "I discuss three puzzles of probability theory which seem connected with problems of direct reference and rigid designation. The resolution of at least one of them requires referential use of definite descriptions in probability statements. I argue that contrary to common opinion all these puzzles are in a way still unsolved: They seem to exemplify cases in which a change of probabilities is rationally required, even though any specific change presupposes unjustified assumptions.\n      </p>", "This paper provides a selective overview of puzzles in exchange rate economics. We begin with the forward bias puzzle: high interest rate currencies appreciate when one might guess that investors would demand higher interest rates on currencies expected to fall in value. We then analyse the purchasing power parity puzzle: the real exchange rate displays no (strong) reversion to a stable long-run equilibrium level. Finally, we cover the exchange rate disconnect puzzle: the lack of a link between the nominal exchange rate and economic fundamentals. For each puzzle, we critically review the literature and speculate on potential solutions.\n      </p>", "My concern in this paper is with the intentionality of emotions. Desires and cognitions are the traditional paradigm cases of intentional attitudes, and one very direct approach to the question of the intentionality of emotions is to treat it as sui generis\u2014as on a par with the intentionality of desires and cognitions but in no way reducible to it. A more common approach seeks to reduce the intentionality of emotions to the intentionality of familiar intentional attitudes like desires and cognitions. In this paper, I argue for the sui generis approach.\n      </p>", "This paper investigates Euler equations involving security prices and household-level consumption data. It provides a useful complement to many existing studies of consumption-based asset pricing models that use a representative-agent framework, because the Euler equations under investigation hold even if markets are incomplete. It also provides a useful complement to simulation-based studies of market incompleteness. The empirical evidence indicates that the theory is rejected by the data along several dimensions. The results therefore indicate that some well-documented asset-pricing puzzles do not result from aggregation problems for the preferences under investigation.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "We examine how worker productivity differs when compensation is based on quantity, creativity, or the product of both measures. In an experiment in which participants design \"rebus puzzles,\" we find that combining quantity and creativity measures in a creativity-weighted pay scheme results in creativity-weighted productivity scores that are significantly lower than those generated by participants with quantity incentives alone. Follow-up analysis indicates that relative to participants in the quantity-only condition, participants in the creativity-weighted condition produce approximately the same number of high-creativity puzzles, but produce significantly fewer puzzles overall. Thus, while participants rewarded for creativity-weighted output tend to restrict their production to high-creativity efforts, they are unable to translate this focus into a greater volume of high-creativity output. Implications address a possible explanation for firms' reluctance to incorporate creativity measures within multidimensional performance measurement systems, notwithstanding published suggestions to do so.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
