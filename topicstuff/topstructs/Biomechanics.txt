Conceptual models, which have been used only occasionally, clarify a point without having to be constructed physically or analysed mathematically. Some physical models are designed to demonstrate a proposed mechanism, for example the folding mechanisms of insect wings. Others have been used to check the conclusions of mathematical modelling. However, others facilitate observations that would be difficult to make on real organisms, for example on the flow of air around the wings of small insects. Mathematical models have been used more often than physical ones. Some of them are predictive, designed for example to calculate the effects of anatomical changes on jumping performance, or the pattern of flow in a 3D assembly of semicircular canals. Others seek an optimum, for example the best possible technique for a high jump. A few have been used in inverse optimization studies, which search for variables that are optimized by observed patterns of behaviour. Mathematical models range from the extreme simplicity of some models of walking and running, to the complexity of models that represent numerous body segments and muscles, or elaborate bone shapes. The simpler the model, the clearer it is which of its features is essential to the calculated effect.\n      </p>", "Biomechanics has made large contributions to dinosaur biology. It has enabled us to estimate both the speeds at which dinosaurs generally moved and the maximum speeds of which they may have been capable. It has told us about the range of postures they could have adopted, for locomotion and for feeding, and about the problems of blood circulation in sauropods with very long necks. It has made it possible to calculate the bite forces of predators such as Tyrannosaurus, and the stresses they imposed on its skull; and to work out the remarkable chewing mechanism of hadrosaurs. It has shown us how some dinosaurs may have produced sounds. It has enabled us to estimate the effectiveness of weapons such as the tail spines of Stegosaurus. In recent years, techniques such as computational tomography and finite element analysis, and advances in computer modelling, have brought new opportunities. Biomechanists should, however, be especially cautious in their work on animals known only as fossils. The lack of living specimens and even soft tissues oblige us to make many assumptions. It is important to be aware of the often wide ranges of uncertainty that result.\n      </p>", "In this paper we present rotational symplectic geometry for use in modern biomechanics of human motion. Generalized Hamiltonian formalism has been formulated on the configuration manifold consisting of rotational Lie groups. The proposed symplectic biodynamics includes conservative, dissipative, and driving forces and spinal reflex-like servo controls. Reduction of the angular configuration manifold enables topological brain-like control, as well as a subsequent topological analysis.\n      </p>", "The three terminal cladode junction regions along branches of four arborescent platyopuntias\u2014Nopalea cochenillifera, Opuntia ficus\u2010indica, Opuntia robusta, and Opuntia undulata\u2014were investigated for their reaction wood traits, flexural stiffness, and elastic moduli. The junctions had suberized tissue, phloem, wood, and pith and were surrounded by a collar composed of epidermis, hypodermis, and chlorenchyma. Gelatinous fibers, which were often associated with lignified axial parenchyma and vessels, occurred only in the wood of the two older junction positions for the three species with the most massive cladodes (the Opuntia spp.). Gelatinous fibers were more frequent in lateral regions, indicating that they are formed in response to large static loads and that they limit lateral movement of the branches. Axial parenchyma cells in regions under tension often stained lightly and had irregularly thickened walls. Pith eccentricity, which resulted from a greater wood extent in compressive than in tensile regions, occurred for all three positions for all four species, except for the youngest junctions of O. robusta and O. undulata. Greater wood extent in compressive regions may be because the wood is primarily made up of parenchyma, which resists compressive forces better than tensile forces. Flexural stiffness of junctions did not differ between bending parallel to the cladode face toward compressive regions versus bending perpendicular to the cladode face toward lateral regions but increased with increases in junction age, reflecting increases in junction cross\u2010sectional area. Collars significantly resisted compressive stresses, accounting for 34% of junction flexural stiffness. Junction region elastic moduli varied among species but did not increase with junction age. Thus, the biomechanics for the cladode junctions of arborescent platyopuntias are affected mostly by the wood cross\u2010sectional area and the resistance provided by the collar.\n      </p>", "Terrestrial plant leaves are complex structures of composite materials. Resistance to fracture is achieved by a number of mechanisms, which operate at the molecular, cell, tissue, and structural levels. Leaves of dicots have different venation patterns and cell wall volume fractions from those of grasses, and consequently, they potentially resist fracture in different ways. Animals mechanically process plants in order to rupture the cell wall in preparation for enzymic hydrolysis, for which the imperative is to maximize new surface area and/or to expedite access to cell contents, ideally by promoting elastic fracture. The two different plant types are fed on by two different groups of organisms of very different sizes, digestive physiologies, mechanical processing abilities and properties, and nutritional requirements. Small insects can feed in or on parts of leaves, while larger mammals generally have to feed on the whole leaf. The scale of feeding also differs for the two groups of herbivores, but how this interacts with the scale of the mechanical properties of the leaf is not well understood. Plant leaves are attacked at all scales and probably can only produce generalized responses to specialized herbivores. In addition, the opportunities that these different scales of interactions open for the different herbivores remain unexplored.\n      </p>", "We provide a brief overview of the articles appearing in this special issue and place them in the context of the long history of the study of plant biomechanics and what we judge to be the next major intellectual and/or technological challenges in this field.\n      </p>", "We report the biomechanics and anatomy of fruit wall peels (before and after cellulase/pectinase treatment) from two Lycopersicon esculentum cultivars (i.e., Inbred 10 and Sweet 100 cherry tomatoes). Samples were tested before and after enzyme treatment in uniaxial tension to determine their rate of creep, plastic and instantaneous elastic strains, breaking stress (strength), and work of fracture. The fruit peels of both cultivars exhibited pronounced viscoelastic and strain-hardening behavior, but differed significantly in their rheological behavior and magnitudes of material properties, e.g., Inbred 10 peels crept less rapidly and accumulated more plastic strains (but less rapidly), were stiffer and stronger, and had a larger work of fracture than Sweet 100 peels. The cuticular membrane (CM) also differed; e.g., Sweet 100 CM strain-softened at forces that caused Inbred 10 to strain-harden. The mechanical behavior of peels and their CM correlated with anatomical differences. The Inbred 10 CM develops in subepidermal cell layers, whereas the Sweet 100 CM is poorly developed below the epidermis. Based on these and other observations, we posit that strain-hardening involves the realignment of CM fibrillar elements and that this phenomenon is less pronounced for Sweet 100 because fewer cell walls contribute to its CM compared to Inbred 10.\n      </p>", "We report on the root system of the large columnar cactus species Pachycereus pringlei to explore the hypothesis that increasing plant size decreases the ability to resist wind-throw but increases the capacity to absorb and store nutrients in roots (i.e., plant size limits the performance of these functions and may shift the performance of one function in favor of another as size increases). Based on 18 plants differing in size, the root system is characterized by a broad and deep bayonet-like root central to a shallow and extensive lateral system of root elements bearing sinker roots near the stem base. All root types have a living secondary cortex and contain wood with a large volume fraction of ray tissues that increases toward the stem base. Wood stiffness and tensile strength are correlated negatively with the ray tissue volume fraction and thus decrease toward the stem base in lateral and bayonet roots. Calculations show that the ability of the bayonet and proximal lateral root elements to resist wind-throw decreases with increasing plant size, whereas the nutrient absorption/storage capacity of the total root system increases with plant size (i.e., a size-dependent shift between these two root functions occurs).\n      </p>", "Lianas are common in the Apocynaceae s.l. and are predominant in the subfamily Secamonoideae. Shrub-like taxa are rare within this subfamily but occur in Malagasy genera such as Secamone, Secamonopsis, and Pervillaea. We explored the evolutionary appearance of shrub-like growth forms in Malagasy Secamonoideae through a molecular phylogeny using chloroplastic sequences. The phylogeny revealed several independent appearances of shrub-like growth forms within the Secamonoideae. Biomechanics and development of the shrub-like growth form were detailed in one species, Secamone sparsiflora, which has upright and self-supporting young stems that become procumbent in older stages of development. Biomechanical investigations revealed characteristics atypical of both lianas and self-supporting shrubs. Anatomical development in S. sparsiflora is initially similar to lianas in the same clade but shows potentially neotenic retention of juvenile wood development for most of the growth trajectory. The results suggest that evolution of lianescence can carry a high degree of specialization and developmental burden that might limit evolution back to self-supporting growth forms. Under certain geographic and ecological conditions, such as geographic isolation, xeric conditions and/or reduced biotic competition, escapes from lianescence to other growth forms can occur in some angiosperm groups via relatively simple heterochronic shifts of mechanically significant growth processes.\n      </p>", "Hybridization between the introduced arborescent Opuntia ficus-indica and the native shrubby O. littoralis has led to populations, referred to as O. \"occidentalis,\" which form thickets that can dominate hillsides of chaparral and that can survive fires. Because the thickets apparently develop via vegetative reproduction, O. \"occidentalis\" was hypothesized to have a greater ability than its parent species to reproduce vegetatively due to weaker cladode junctions. Of the three taxa, the junctions for O. \"occidentalis\" had the least amount of wood, despite having cladode masses and junction cross-sectional areas similar to those of O. littoralis. The cladodes of O. \"occidentalis\" resisted defiection about their junctions the least and their junctions required the least amount of applied mass and the smallest bending moment to fail mechanically. The junction wood for all three taxa consisted mostly of parenchyma, with lesser amounts of cells with thickened secondary cell walls, indicating that some junction strength depended on hydrostatic pressure, especially for terminal junctions. Libriform fibers, which contribute to support and resist bending moments, were about 80% less frequent in the sub-subterminal junctions of O. \"occidentalis\" than in O. ficus-indica and O. littoralis. Vascular tracheids, which probably reduced shear among cells in the wood, were 90% less frequent in the terminal and sub-subterminal junction wood of O. \"occidentalis\" compared to O. littoralis. Thus wood characteristics can account for the weaker junctions of O. \"occidentalis\" compared to those of O. ficus-indica and O. littoralis, which apparently increases the ability of the hybrid to reproduce vegetatively.\n      </p>", "Skipping, a gait children display when they are about four- to five-years-old, is revealed to be more than a behavioural peculiarity. By means of metabolic and biomechanical measurements at several speeds, the relevance of skipping is shown to extend from links between bipedal and quadrupedal locomotion (namely galloping) to understanding why it could be a gait of choice in low-gravity conditions, and to some aspects of locomotion evolution (ground reaction forces of skipping seem to originate from pushing the walking gait to unnaturally high speeds). When the time-courses of mechanical energy and the horizontal ground reaction force are considered, a different locomotion paradigm emerges, enabling us to separate, among the bouncing gaits, the trot from the gallop (quadrupeds) and running from skipping (bipeds). The simultaneous use of pendulum-like and elastic mechanisms in skipping gaits, as shown by the energy curve analysis, helps us to understand the low cost of transport of galloping quadrupeds.\n      </p>", "Since its coming of age in the mid 1960s, continuum biomechanics has contributed much to our understanding of human health as well as to disease, injury, and their treatment. Nevertheless, biomechanics has yet to reach its full potential as a consistent contributor to the improvement of health-care delivery. Because of the inherent complexities of the microstructure and biomechanical behaviour of biological cells and tissues, there is a need for new theoretical frameworks to guide the design and interpretation of new classes of experiments. Because of continued advances in experimental technology, and the associated rapid increase in information on molecular and cellular contributions to behaviour at tissue and organ levels, there is a pressing need for mathematical models to synthesize and predict observations across multiple length- and time-scales. And because of the complex geometries and loading conditions, there is a need for new computational approaches to solve the boundary- and initial-value problems of clinical, industrial, and academic importance. Clearly, much remains to be done. The purpose of this paper is twofold: to review a few of the many achievements in the biomechanics of soft tissues and the tools that allowed them, but, more importantly, to identify some of the open problems that merit increased attention from those in applied mechanics, biomechanics, mathematics and mechanobiology.\n      </p>", "Heart valves (HVs) are cardiac structures whose physiological function is to ensure directed blood flow through the heart over the cardiac cycle. While primarily passive structures that are driven by forces exerted by the surrounding blood and heart, this description does not adequately describe their elegant and complex biomechanical function. Moreover, they must replicate their cyclic function over an entire lifetime, with an estimated total functional demand of least 3\u00d710\u2079 cycles. As in many physiological systems, one can approach HV biomechanics from a multi-length-scale approach, since mechanical stimuli occur and have biological impact at the organ, tissue and cellular scales. The present review focuses on the functional biomechanics of HVs. Specifically, we refer to the unique aspects of valvular function, and how the mechanical and mechanobiological behaviours of the constituent biological materials (e.g. extracellular matrix proteins and cells) achieve this remarkable feat. While we focus on the work from the authors' respective laboratories, the works of most investigators known to the authors have been included whenever appropriate.

Forces were applied to two trees of Sloanea spp., a tropical genus that develops typical thin buttresses, and the three-dimensional strains were measured at different parts of the trunk base. Risks of failure were greater on the buttress sides, where shear and tangential stresses are greater, not on the ridges, in spite of high longitudinal (parallel to the grain) stresses. A simple beam model, computed from the second moment of area of digitized cross sections, is consistent with longitudinal strain variations but cannot predict accurately variations with height. Patterns of longitudinal strain variation along ridges are very different in the two individuals, owing to a pronounced lateral curvature in one specimen. The constant stress hypothesis is discussed based on these results. Without chronological data during the development of the tree, it cannot be proved that buttress formation is activated by stress or strain.\n      </p>", "Fundamental plant traits such as support, anchorage, and protection against environmental stress depend substantially on biomechanical design. The costs, subsequent trade-offs, and effects on plant performance of mechanical traits are not well understood, but it appears that many of these traits have evolved in response to abiotic and biotic mechanical forces and resource deficits. The relationships between environmental stresses and mechanical traits can be specific and direct, as in responses to strong winds, with structural reinforcement related to plant survival. Some traits such as leaf toughness might provide protection from multiple forms of stress. In both cases, the adaptive value of mechanical traits may vary between habitats, so is best considered in the context of the broader growth environment, not just of the proximate stress. Plants can also show considerable phenotypic plasticity in mechanical traits, allowing adjustment to changing environments across a range of spatial and temporal scales. However, it is not always clear whether a mechanical property is adaptive or a consequence of the physiology associated with stress. Mechanical traits do not only affect plant survival; evidence suggests they have downstream effects on ecosystem organization and functioning (e.g., diversity, trophic relationships, and productivity), but these remain poorly explored.\n      </p>", "Leaf tensile properties were compared between the mesic deciduous tree Prunus serrulata (var. \"Kwanzan\") and the xeric and sclerophyllous chaparral evergreen shrub Heteromeles arbutifolia (M. Roem). All values for biomechanical parameters for H, arbutifolia were significantly greater than those of P. serrulata. The fracture planes also differed between the two species with P. serrulata fracturing along the secondary veins, while H. arbutifolia most often fractured across the leaf irrespective of the vein or mesophyll position, thus yielding qualitative differences in the stress-strain curves of the two species. Anatomically. P. serrulata exhibits features typical for a deciduous mesophytic leaf such as a thin cuticle, a single layer of palisade mesophyll, isodiametric spongy mesophyll, and extensive reticulation of the laminar veins. Heteromeles arbutifolia leaves, however, are typically two- to three-fold thicker with a 35% higher dry mass/fresh mass ratio. The vascular tissue is restricted to the interface of the palisade and spongy mesophyll near the center of the leaf. Both epidermal layers have a thick cuticle. The palisade mesophyll is tightly packed and two to three layers thick. The spongy mesophyll cells are ameboid in shape and tightly interlinked both to other spongy cells as well as to the overlying palisade layer. We conclude that the qualitative and quantitative biomechanical differences between the leaves of these two species are likely due to a complex interaction of internal architectural arrangement and the physical/chemical differences in the properties of their respective cell walls. These studies illustrate the importance that morphological and anatomical correlates play with mechanical behavior in plant material and ultimately reflect adaptations present in the leaves of chaparral shrubs that are conducive to surviving in arid environments.\n      </p>", "", "", "", "", "Relationships between Secamonoideae and their closest relatives in Apocynaceae, as well as genera and species within the subfamily, have been examined, using a molecular phylogeny with the plastid gene matK. Our molecular results show that Secamonoideae form a monophyletic group. Delimitations of genera are also discussed together with the evolution of pollinarium and biomechanical characters within species. The patterns of pollinial organization, as well as change in growth forms, are mapped onto a phylogenetic tree obtained from the plastid gene matK, all of which together significantly contribute toward a better understanding of the evolution of the Apocynaceae s.l.\n      </p>", "While retaining a feeding apparatus that is surprisingly conservative morphologically, frogs as a group exhibit great variability in the biomechanics of tongue protraction during prey capture, which in turn is related to differences in neuromuscular control. In this paper, I address the following three questions. (1) How do frog tongues differ biomechanically? (2) What anatomical and physiological differences are responsible? (3) How is biomechanics related to mechanisms of neuromuscular control? Frog species use three non-exclusive mechanisms to protract their tongues during feeding: (i) mechanical pulling, in which the tongue shortens as its muscles contract during protraction; (ii) inertial elongation, in which the tongue lengthens under inertial and muscular loading; and (iii) hydrostatic elongation, in which the tongue lengthens under constraints imposed by the constant volume of a muscular hydrostat. Major differences among these functional types include (i) the amount and orientation of collagen fibres associated with the tongue muscles and the mechanical properties that this connective tissue confers to the tongue as a whole; and (ii) the transfer of inertia from the opening jaws to the tongue, which probably involves a catch mechanism that increases the acceleration achieved during mouth opening. The mechanisms of tongue protraction differ in the types of neural mechanisms that are used to control tongue movements, particularly in the relative importance of feed-forward versus feedback control, in requirements for precise interjoint coordination, in the size and number of motor units, and in the afferent pathways that are involved in coordinating tongue and jaw movements. Evolution of biomechanics and neuromuscular control of frog tongues provides an example in which neuromuscular control is finely tuned to the biomechanical constraints and opportunities provided by differences in morphological design among species.\n      </p>", "Plants in light-limited tropical rainforest understories face an important carbon allocation trade-off: investment of available carbon into photosynthetic tissue should be advantageous, while risk of damage and mortality from falling debris favors investment into nonphotosynthetic structural tissue. We examined the modulus of rupture (\u03c3max). Young's modulus of elasticity (E), and flexural stiffness (F) of stems and petioles in 14 monocot species from six families. These biomechanical properties were evaluated with respect to habitat, rates of leaf production, clonality, and growth form. Species with higher E and \u03c3max, indicating greater resistance per unit area to bending and breaking, respectively, tended to be shade-tolerant, slow growing, and nonclonal. This result is consistent with an increase in carbon allocation to structural tissue in shade-tolerant species at the expense of photosynthetic tissue and growth. Forest-edge species were weaker per unit area (had a lower E), but had higher flexural stiffness due to increases in stem and petiole diameter. While this is inefficient in requiring more carbon per unit of structural support, it may enable forest-edge species to support larger and heavier leaves. Our results emphasize the degree to which biomechanical traits vary with ecological niche and illustrate suites of characteristics associated with different carbon allocation strategies.\n      </p>", "We report the longitudinal variations in stiffness and bulk density of tissue samples drawn from along the length of two Pachycereus pringlei plants measuring 3.69 and 5.9 m in height to determine how different tissues contribute to the mechanical stability of these massive vertical organs. Each of the two stems was cut into segments of uniform length and subsequently dissected to obtain and mechanically test portions of xylem strands, stem ribs, and a limited number of pith and cortex samples. In each case, morphometric measurements were taken to determine the geometric contribution each tissue likely made to the ability of whole stems to resist bending forces. The stiffness of each xylem strand increased basipetally toward the base of each plant where stiffness sharply decreased, reaching a magnitude comparable to that of strands 1 m beneath the stem apex. The xylem was anisotropic in behavior, i.e., its stiffness measured in the radial and in the tangential directions differed significantly. Despite the abrupt decrease in xylem strand stiffness at the stem base, the contribution made by this tissue to resist bending forces increased exponentially from the tip to the base of each plant due to the accumulation of wood. A basipetal increase in the stiffness of the pith (and, to limited extent, that of the cortex) was also observed. In contrast, the stiffness of stem rib tissues varied little as a function of stem length. These tissues were stiffer than the xylem in the corresponding portions of the stem along the upper two-fifths of the length of either plant. Tissue stiffness and bulk density were not significantly correlated within or across tissue types. However, a weak inverse relationship was observed for these properties in the case of the xylem and stem rib tissues. We present a simple formula that predicts when stem ribs rather than the xylem strands serve as the principal stiffening agents in stems. This formula successfully predicted the observed aspect ratio of the stem ribs (the average quotient of the radial and tangential dimensions of rib transections), and thus provided circumstantial evidence that the ribs are important for mechanical stability for the distal and younger regions of the stems examined.\n      </p>", "The slender upright culms of the giant reed (Arundo donax L.) are often exposed to dynamic wind loads causing significant swaying. The giant reed has slightly tapered hollow stems (4-6 m high) with flat leaves and an extensive underground rhizomatous system with solid branches bearing adventitious roots. Quantitative analyses of videorecordings prove that A. donax responds to dynamic deflections of the stem with damped harmonic bending oscillations. The logarithmic decrement can be used to calculate the relative damping, as a measure of the plant's capacity to dissipate vibrational energy. Plants with leaves have a significantly higher damping compared to plants without leaves. A comparison of the relative damping of plants with and without leaves shows that this finding is only partly due to aerodynamic resistance of the leaves. Structural damping also contributes considerably to the overall damping of the foliate A. donax stem. By stepwise removal of the underground plant organs the influence of rhizome, roots, and soil on the vibrational behavior was determined. The data indicate that underground plant organs as well as leaf sheaths covering the nodes have no significant influence on damping.\n      </p>", "We report the longitudinal, biomechanical, and anatomical trends observed for tissue samples drawn from the parallel aligned, prismatic woody vascular bundles running the length of a Pachycereus pringlei plant measuring 5.22 m in height. The main vertical stem of this plant was cut into five segments (labeled A through E in the acropetal direction) measuring \u223c1.02 m in length. Four of the 14 vascular bundles in each segment were surgically removed to obtain 20 vascular bundle segments that were tested in bending to determine their stiffness measured in the radial ER and tangential ET direction. We also determined the lignin content of representative samples of wood. A nonlinear trend in stiffness was observed: ER and ET were highest in segments B or C (1.67 GN/m2 and 1.09 GN/m2, respectively), lower in segment A (ER = 1.18 GN/m2 and ET = 0.35 GN/m2), and lowest in segment E (ER = 0.03 GN/m2 and ET = 0.20 GN/m2). Similar longitudinal trends were seen for axial tissue volume fraction and fiber wall thickness, which achieved their highest values in segment B (69.8% and 6.59 \u03bcm, respectively). Wood stiffness also correlated significantly with cell wall lignin content: with respect to segment B (which had the highest lignin content, and was thus used as the standard reference for percent lignin content), lignin content, was 15, 60, 85, and 43% in segments E, D, C, and A, respectively. Fiber cell length, which increased toward the base of the stem and toward the vascular cambium in the most proximal vascular bundle segment, did not correlate with ER or ET. Basic engineering principles were used to calculate stem stresses resulting from self-loading and any wind-induced bending moment (produced by drag forces). Calculations indicated that the less stiff wood produced in segment A eliminates a rapid and potentially dangerous increase in stresses that would otherwise occur in segments B or C. The less stiff wood in segment A also reduces the probability of shear failure at the cellular interface between the wood and surrounding tissues in this portion of the stem. We conclude that P. pringlei wood stiffness is dependent on the volume fraction and lignification of axial tissues, less so on fiber wall thickness, and that wood development in this species is adaptively responsive to self-loading and differentially applied external mechanical forces\n      </p>", "Stem mechanical properties are critically linked to foliage deployment and growth strategy, yet variation in stem mechanics across species and habitats is poorly understood. Here, we compared 32 plant species growing across four sites of contrasting rainfall and soil nutrient availability in Australia. The modulus of elasticity (MOE) and modulus of rupture (MOR) were tightly correlated with dry sapwood density within sites, but species from low-rainfall environments had higher wood density for a given MOE and MOR compared with species growing in high-rainfall environments. The ratio of MOE to MOR was slightly lower for species at low-rainfall sites, suggesting that wood was stronger for a given elasticity. Most species had thick bark, but the mechanical contribution of bark to stem MOE was small. Our results suggest that arid-adapted species would need to deploy more dry mass to support stems. Our results also highlight the importance of understanding how the biomechanics\u2014wood density relationship evolves under different environmental conditions to better understand plant growth across diverse habitats.\n      </p>", "Extreme animal movements are usually associated with a single, high-performance behavior. However, the remarkably rapid mandible strikes of the trap-jaw ant, Odontomachus bauri, can yield multiple functional outcomes. Here we investigate the biomechanics of mandible strikes in 0. bauri and find that the extreme mandible movements serve two distinct functions: predation and propulsion. During predatory strikes, 0. bauri mandibles close at speeds ranging from 35 to 64 m\u00b7s\u207b\u00b9 within an average duration of 0.13 ms, far surpassing the speeds of other documented ballistic predatory appendages in the animal kingdom. The high speeds of the mandibles assist in capturing prey, while the extreme accelerations result in instantaneous mandible strike forces that can exceed 300 times the ant's body weight. Consequently, an 0. bauri mandible strike directed against the substrate produces sufficient propulsive power to launch the ant into the air. Changing head orientation and strike surfaces allow 0. bauri to use the trap-jaw mechanism to capture prey, eject intruders, or jump to safety. This use of a single, simple mechanical system to generate a suite of profoundly different behavioral functions offers insights into the morphological origins of novelties in feeding and locomotion.\n      </p>", "One hundred fifty years ago glial cells were discovered as a second, non-neuronal, cell type in the central nervous system. To ascribe a function to these new, enigmatic cells, it was suggested that they either glue the neurons together (the Greek word \"\u03b3\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1\" means \"glue\") or provide a robust scaffold for them (\"support cells\"). Although both speculations are still widely accepted, they would actually require quite different mechanical cell properties, and neither one has ever been confirmed experimentally. We investigated the biomechanics of CNS tissue and acutely isolated individual neurons and glial cells from mammalian brain (hippocampus) and retina. Scanning force microscopy, bulk rheology, and optically induced deformation were used to determine their viscoelastic characteristics. We found that (i) in all CNS cells the elastic behavior dominates over the viscous behavior, (ii) in distinct cell compartments, such as soma and cell processes, the mechanical properties differ, most likely because of the unequal local distribution of cell organelles, (iii) in comparison to most other eukaryotic cells, both neurons and glial cells are very soft (\"rubber elastic\"), and (iv) intriguingly, glial cells are even softer than their neighboring neurons. Our results indicate that glial cells can neither serve as structural support cells (as they are too soft) nor as glue (because restoring forces are dominant) for neurons. Nevertheless, from a structural perspective they might act as soft, compliant embedding for neurons, protecting them in case of mechanical trauma, and also as a soft substrate required for neurite growth and facilitating neuronal plasticity.\n      </p>", "Studying animal mechanics is critical for understanding how signals in the neuromuscular system give rise to behavior and how force-sensing organs and sensory neurons work. Few techniques exist to provide forces and displacements appropriate for such studies. To address this technological gap, we developed a metrology using piezoresistive cantilevers as force-displacement sensors coupled to a feedback system to apply and maintain defined load profiles to micrometer-scale animals. We show that this system can deliver forces between 10\u207b\u2078 and 10\u207b\u00b3 N across distances of up to 100 \u03bcm with a resolution of 12 nN between 0.1 Hz and 100 kHz. We use this new metrology to show that force-displacement curves of wild-type nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans) are linear. Because nematodes have approximately cylindrical bodies, this finding demonstrates that nematode body mechanics can be modeled as a cylindrical shell under pressure. Little is known about the relative importance of hydrostatic pressure and shell mechanics, however. We show that dissipating pressure by cuticle puncture or decreasing it by hyperosmotic shock has only a modest effect on stiffness, whereas defects in the dpy-5 and lon-2 genes, which alter body shape and cuticle proteins, decrease and increase stiffness by 25% and 50%, respectively. This initial analysis of C. elegans body mechanics suggests that shell mechanics dominates stiffness and is a first step in understanding how body mechanics affect locomotion and force sensing.\n      </p>", "The hollow stem of Equisetum giganteum owes its mechanical stability to an outer ring of strengthening tissue, which provides stiffness and strength in the longitudinal direction, but also to an inner lining of turgid parenchyma, which lends resistance to local buckling. With a height &gt;2.5 m isolated stems are mechanically unstable. However, in dense stands individual stems support each other by interlacing with their side branches, the typical growth habit of semi-self-supporters.\n      </p>", "The allometric relationship of stem length L with respect to mean stem diameter D was determined for 80 shoots of each of three columnar cactus species (Stenocereus thurberi, Lophocereus schottii, and S. gummosus) to determine whether this relationship accords with that predicted by each of three contending models purporting to describe the mechanical architecture of vertical shoots (i.e., geometric, stress, and elastic similitude, which predict L ~ $\\varpropto$ D\u03b1 with \u03b1 = 1/1, 1/2, and 2/3, respectively). In addition, anatomical, physical, and biomechanical stem properties were measured to determine how the stems of these three species maintain their elastic stability as they increase in size. Reduced major axis regression of L with respect to D showed that \u03b1 = 2.82 \u00b1 0.14 for S. thurberi, 2.32 \u00b1 0.19 for L. schottii, and 4.21 \u00b1 0.31 for S. gummosus. Thus, the scaling exponents for the allometry of L differed significantly from that predicted by each of the three biomechanical models. In contrast, these exponents were similar to that for the allometry previously reported for saguaro. Analyses of biomechanical data derived from bending tests performed on 30 stems selected from each of the three species indicated that the bulk stem tissue stiffness was roughly proportional to L2, while stem flexural rigidity (i.e., the ability to resist a bending force) scaled roughly as L3. Stem length was significantly and positively correlated with the volume fraction of wood, while regression analysis of the pooled data from the three species (i.e., 90 stems) indicated that bulk tissue stiffness scaled roughly as the 5/3-power of the volume fraction of wood in stems. These data were interpreted to indicate that wood served as the major stiffening agent in stems and that this tissue accumulates at a sufficient rate to afford unusually high scaling exponents for stem length with respect to stem diameter (i.e., disproportionately large increments of stem length with respect to increments in stem diameter). Nevertheless, the safety factor against the elastic failure of stems (computed on the basis of the critical buckling height divided by actual stem length) decreased with increasing stem size for each species, even though each species maintained an average safety factor equal to two. We speculate that the apparent upper limit to plant height calculated for each species may serve as a biomechanical mechanism for vegetative propagation and the establishment of dense plant colonies by means of extreme stem flexure and ultimate breakage, especially for S. gummosus.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "Research on the biomechanics of animal and human locomotion provides insight into basic principles of locomotion and respective implications for construction and control. Nearly elastic operation of the leg is necessary to reproduce the basic dynamics in walking and running. Elastic leg operation can be modelled with a spring-mass model. This model can be used as a template with respect to both gaits in the construction and control of legged machines. With respect to the segmented leg, the humanoid arrangement saves energy and ensures structural stability. With the quasi-elastic operation the leg inherits the property of self-stability, i.e. the ability to stabilize a system in the presence of disturbances without sensing the disturbance or its direct effects. Self-stability can be conserved in the presence of musculature with its crucial damping property. To ensure secure foothold visco-elastic suspended muscles serve as shock absorbers. Experiments with technically implemented leg models, which explore some of these principles, are promising.\n      </p>", "This paper reports on the effect of wind loading below damaging strength on tree mechanical and physical properties. In a wind-exposed Sitka spruce stand in western Scotland, 60 trees at four different levels of wind exposure (10 m, 30 m, 50 m, 90 m from edge) were characterized for stem and crown size and shape and mechanical properties, including structural Young's modulus (&lt;tex-math&gt;$E_{struct}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;), natural frequency, and damping ratio. &lt;tex-math&gt;$E_{struct}$&lt;/tex-math&gt; increased from the stand edge to the mid-forest, but with a large inter-tree variation. Swaying frequency and damping ratio of the trees also increased with distance from edge. Wind-exposed edge trees grew shorter, but more tapered with an overall lower &lt;tex-math&gt;$E_{struct}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;, allowing for greater flexural stiffness at the stem base due to the larger diameter and for higher flexibility in the crown region of the stem. The trees at the middle of the stand compensated for their increased slenderness with a higher &lt;tex-math&gt;$E_{struct}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;. Thus, for the different requirements for wind-firmness at stand edge and mid-forest, an adapted combination of tree form and mechanical properties allows the best withstanding of wind loads. The results show the requirement to understand the different strategies of trees to adapt to environmental constraints and the heterogeneity of their growth reactions in response to these strategies.\n      </p>", "Catching insects to ensure pollination is one of the most elaborate and specialized mechanisms of insect\u2013plant interactions. Phylogenetically, Aristolochiaceae represent the first angiosperm lineage that developed trap flowers. Here we report the structure and function of specific trichomes contributing to the highly specialized trapping devices. Investigations were carried out on six Mediterranean Aristolochia species. The morphology and arrangement of the trapping trichomes were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cryo-SEM. To demonstrate frictional anisotropy of the trapping trichome array, a microtribological approach was used. The results of our experiments support a hypothesis long proposed, but never tested, regarding the trapping mechanism in proterogynous Aristolochia flowers: that an array of highly specialized trichomes arranged eccentrically to the underlying surface is responsible for the easy entrance of insects into flowers but impedes their escape. As they enter the male stage of anthesis, flowers significantly modify their inner surface characteristics, allowing insects to leave. We have demonstrated the substantial contribution of trapping trichomes to the capture, retention and release of pollinators, an important prerequisite for making cross-pollination possible in most Aristolochia species. Finally, we compare trapping trichomes of Aristolochia with similar structures found in other trapping flowers as well as in pitchers of carnivorous plants not optimized for insect release.\n      </p>", "Ballistospore discharge is a feature of 30 000 species of mushrooms, basidiomycete yeasts and pathogenic rusts and smuts. The biomechanics of discharge may involve an abrupt change in the center of mass associated with the coalescence of Buller's drop and the spore. However this process occurs so rapidly that the launch of the ballistospore has never been visualized. Here we report ultra highspeed video recordings of the earliest events of spore dispersal using the yeast Itersonilia perplexans and the distantly related jelly fungus Auricularia auricula. Images taken at camera speeds of up to 100 000 frames/s demonstrate that ballistospore discharge does involve the coalescence of Buller's drop and the spore. Recordings of I. perplexans demonstrate that although coalescence may result from the directed collapse of Buller's drop onto the spore, it also may involve the movement of the spore toward the drop. The release of surface tension at coalescence provides the energy and directional momentum to propel the drop and spore away from the fungus. Analyses show that ballistospores launch into the air at initial accelerations in excess of 10 000 g. There is no known analog of this micromechanical process in animals, plants or bacteria, but the recent development of a surface tension motor may mimic the fungal biology described here.\n      </p>", "The aim of this review is to describe the biomechanical, functional and sensory modelling work that can be used to integrate the physiological, anatomical and medical knowledge of the gastrointestinal (GI) system. The computational modelling in the GI tract was designed, implemented and evaluated using a series of information and communication technologies-based tools. These tools modelled the morphometry, biomechanics, functions and sensory aspects of the human GI tract. The research presented in this review is based on the virtual physiological human concept that pursues a holistic approach to representation of the human body. Such computational modelling combines imaging data, GI physiology, the gut-brain axis, geometrical and biomechanical reconstruction, and computer graphics for mechanical, electronic and pain analysis. The developed modelling will aid research and ensure that medical professionals benefit through the provision of relevant and precise information about a patient's condition. It will also improve the accuracy and efficiency of the medical procedures that could result in reduced cost for diagnosis and treatment.\n      </p>", "Diversity in organismal forms among taxa is thought to reflect distinct selection pressures across environments. The central assumption underlying this expectation is that taxa experiencing similar selection have similar response to that selection. However, because selection acts on trait function, taxa similarity in selection response depends crucially on the relationship between function and morphology. Further, when a trait consists of multiple parts, changes in function in response to selection can result from modification of different parts, and adaptation to the same environment might result in functional but not morphological similarity. Here, we address the extent to which functional and morphological diversity in masticatory apparatus of soricid shrews reflects a shared ecological characteristic of their diet type. We examine the factors limiting morphological variation across shrew species by assessing the relative contribution of trait function (biomechanics of the jaw), ecology, and phylogeny to species similarity in mandibular traits. We found that species that shared diet type were functionally but not morphologically similar. The presence of multiple semi-independently varying traits enabled functional equivalence of composite foraging morphologies and resulted in variable response to selection exerted by similar diet. We show that functional equivalence of multiple morphologies enabled persistence of differences in habitat use (e.g., habitat moisture and coverage) among species that specialize on the same diet. We discuss the importance of developmental and functional integration among traits for evolutionary diversification of morphological structures that generate equivalent functions.\n      </p>", "This review is concerned with the modern development of animal joint biomechanics. The understanding of the biomechanical function of synovial joints depends upon our ability to quantitatively measure and model the biorheological behavior of the major tissues of these joints (synovial fluid and articular cartilage), and their dynamic interactions during motion. Since synovial fluid is a macromolecular solution of the polyanionic hyaluronic acid and a dialysate of blood plasma, its rheological behavior is highly nonlinear and therefore most difficult to characterize quantitatively. And, since articular cartilage is composed of a permeable fiber-reinforced composite solid matrix swollen with water, its deformational behavior is also very difficult to characterize. As such, the dynamic interactions of these two biorheologically complex materials offer what are indeed challenging biomechanics problems. In this survey, we will discuss both the evolution, over the past 50 years or so, of our understanding of joint function and the difficult and unresolved problems arising from our attempts to quantitatively formulate and solve problems related to the characterization of normal and pathological joint function.\n      </p>", "Contact forces are important in maintaining the twining habit of viny stems. A stem twining around a supporting pole puts itself into tension and uses a helical geometry to generate normal loads that are large relative to stem mass per unit length (Silk and Hubbard, Journal of Biomechanics 24(7):599-606, 1991). An electronic pressure-sensing device has been constructed to provide continuous, in vivo measurements of the forces exerted by twining stems. The pressure-sensing element is based on a thin beam load cell that is sheared by a twining stem ascending a split pole. Preliminary results show that after morning glory stems begin to coil around a supporting pole, the twining force increases in an oscillatory fashion over 3 or 4 d, corresponding to positions at least 200 mm from the apex. The force-measuring device should reveal relationships between twining forces and developmental attributes or environmental factors.\n      </p>", "A running animal coordinates the actions of many muscles, tendons, and ligaments in its leg so that the overall leg behaves like a single mechanical spring during ground contact. Experimental observations have revealed that an animal's leg stiffness is independent of both speed and gravity level, suggesting that it is dictated by inherent musculoskeletal properties. However, if leg stiffness was invariant, the biomechanics of running (e.g. peak ground reaction force and ground contact time) would change when an animal encountered different surfaces in the natural world. We found that human runners adjust their leg stiffness to accommodate changes in surface stiffness, allowing them to maintain similar running mechanics on different surfaces. These results provide important insight into the mechanics and control of animal locomotion and suggest that incorporating an adjustable leg stiffness in the design of hopping and running robots is important if they are to match the agility and speed of animals on varied terrain.\n      </p>", "Bipedal walking is evident in the earliest hominins [Zollikofer CPE, Ponce de Leon MS, Lieberman DE, Guy F, Pilbeam D, et al. (2005) Nature 434:755-759], but why our unique two-legged gait evolved remains unknown. Here, we analyze walking energetics and biomechanics for adult chimpanzees and humans to investigate the long-standing hypothesis that bipedalism reduced the energy cost of walking compared with our ape-like ancestors [Rodman PS, McHenry HM (1980) Am J Phys Anthropol 52:103-106]. Consistent with previous work on juvenile chimpanzees [Taylor CR, Rowntree VJ (1973) Science 179:186-187], we find that bipedal and quadrupedal walking costs are not significantly different in our sample of adult chimpanzees. However, a more detailed analysis reveals significant differences in bipedal and quadrupedal cost in most individuals, which are masked when subjects are examined as a group. Furthermore, human walking is \u224875% less costly than both quadrupedal and bipedal walking in chimpanzees. Variation in cost between bipedal and quadrupedal walking, as well as between chimpanzees and humans, is well explained by biomechanical differences in anatomy and gait, with the decreased cost of human walking attributable to our more extended hip and a longer hindlimb. Analyses of these features in early fossil hominins, coupled with analyses of bipedal walking in chimpanzees, indicate that bipedalism in early, ape-like hominins could indeed have been less costly than quadrupedal knucklewalking.\n      </p>", "On its opening day, the London Millennium Bridge (LMB) experienced unexpected large amplitude lateral vibrations due to crowd loading. This form of pedestrian-structure interaction has since been identified on several other bridges of various structural forms. The mechanism has generally been attributed to 'pedestrian synchronous lateral excitation' or 'pedestrian lock-in'. However, some of the more recent site measurements have shown a lack of evidence of pedestrian synchronization, at least at the onset of the behaviour. This paper considers a simple model of human balance from the biomechanics field-the inverted pendulum model-for which the most effective means of lateral stabilization is by the control of the position, rather than the timing, of foot placement. The same balance strategy as for normal walking on a stationary surface is applied to walking on a laterally oscillating bridge. As a result, without altering their pacing frequency, averaged over a large number of cycles, the pedestrian effectively acts as a negative (or positive) damper to the bridge motion, which may be at a different frequency. This is in agreement with the empirical model developed by Arup from the measurements on the LMB, leading to divergent amplitude vibrations above a critical number of pedestrians.\n      </p>", "In recent years, comparative biomechanics, while anything but a new subject, has by an odd concatenation of circumstances emerged from obscurity to become a widely recognized and active area of biology-remarkably diverse in questions asked and techniques employed but with clear intellectual coherence.

In this instance, we asked children to design models of the human elbow. Children's models were then used as the basis for an exploration of the biomechanics of the human arm. The investigation of biomechanical principles is a major extension of our earlier research. By building on children's design-based models, we were able to engage students in an investigation of the relation between force and the location of the attachment point of the biceps. In so doing, we were able to provide children with opportunities to develop their understanding of the relations between mathematics and science through the construction and interpretation of data tables and graphs.\n      </p>", "Many aquatic plants and animals spend part of their lives anchored to the substratum as water flows by. There are a number of mechanisms by which such sessile organisms can affect the magnitude of the flow-induced forces they encounter, as well as the distribution and magnitude of the mechanical stresses in their bodies produced by those forces. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of the skeletal tissues of such organisms affect how much they deform and whether or not they will break in response to flow-induced stresses. There are different mechanisms by which organisms can withstand the water flow characterizing a particular type of habitat. Biomechanics is a useful tool for studying how the performance of organisms depends on their structure. Biomechanical studies should be accompanied by knowledge of the natural history and ecology of the organisms in question if they are to lead to insights about how organisms work.\n      </p>", "Resistance to xylem cavitation depends on the size of xylem pit membrane pores and the strength of vessels to resist collapse or, in the case of freezing-induced cavitation, conduit diameter. Altering these traits may impact plant biomechanics or water transport efficiency. The evergreen sclerophyllous shrub species, collectively referred to as chaparral, which dominate much of the mediterranean-type climate region of southern California, have been shown to display high cavitation resistance (pressure potential at 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity; P50). We examined xylem functional and structural traits associated with more negative P50 in stems of 26 chaparral species. We correlated raw-trait values, without phylogenetic consideration, to examine current relationships between P50 and these xylem traits. Additionally, correlations were examined using phylogenetic independent contrasts (PICs) to determine whether evolutionary changes in these xylem traits correlate with changes in P50. Co-occurring chaparral species widely differ in their P50 (-0.9 to -11.0 MPa). Species experiencing the most negative seasonal pressure potential (Pmin) had the highest resistance to xylem cavitation (lowest P50). Decreased P50 was associated with increased xylem density, stem mechanical strength (modulus of rupture), and transverse fiber wall area when both raw values and PICs were analyzed. These results support a functional and evolutionary relationship among these xylem traits and cavitation resistance. Chaparral species that do not sprout following fire but instead recruit post-fire from seed had the greatest resistance to cavitation, presumably because they rely on post-fire survival of seedlings during the summer dry period to persist in the landscape. Raw values of hydraulic vessel diameter (dh), maximum vessel length, and xylem-specific hydraulic conductivity (Ks) were correlated to P50; however, dh, maximum vessel length, and Ks were not correlated to P50 when analyzed using PICs, suggesting that these traits have not undergone correlated evolutionary change. We found no difference in xylem traits between species occurring at freezing vs. nonfreezing sites, although freezing has been shown to affect the survival and distributions of some chaparral species. Stem mechanical strength, fiber properties, and post-fire regeneration type appear to be key factors in the evolution of cavitation resistance among chaparral shrubs.\n      </p>", "Wind can alter plant growth and cause extensive, irreversible damage in forested areas. To better understand how to mitigate the effects of wind action, we investigated the sensitivity of tree aerodynamic behavior to the material and geometrical factors characterizing the aerial system. The mechanical response of a 35-yr-old maritime pine (Pinus pinaster, Pinaceae) submitted to static and dynamic wind loads is simulated with a finite element model. The branching structure is represented in three dimensions. Factor effects are evaluated using a fractional experimental design. Results show that material properties play only a limited role in tree dynamics. In contrast, small morphological variations can produce extreme behaviors such as either very little or nearly critical dissipation of stem oscillations. Slender trees are shown to be relatively more vulnerable to stem breakage than uprooting. Dynamic loading leads to deflections and forces up to 20% higher near the base of the tree than those calculated for a static loading of similar magnitude. Effects of branch geometry on dynamic amplification are substantial yet not linear. The flexibility of the aerial system is found to be critical to reducing the resistance to the airflow and thus to minimizing the risk of failure.\n      </p>", "The African Plio-Pleistocene hominins known as australopiths evolved a distinctive craniofacial morphology that traditionally has been viewed as a dietary adaptation for feeding on either small, hard objects or on large volumes of food. A historically influential interpretation of this morphology hypothesizes that loads applied to the premolars during feeding had a profound influence on the evolution of australopith craniofacial form. Here, we test this hypothesis using finite element analysis in conjunction with comparative, imaging, and experimental methods. We find that the facial skeleton of the Australopithecus type species, A. africanus, is well suited to withstand premolar loads. However, we suggest that the mastication of either small objects or large volumes of food is unlikely to fully explain the evolution of facial form in this species. Rather, key aspects of australopith craniofacial morphology are more likely to be related to the ingest ion and initial preparation of large, mechanically protected food objects like large nuts and seeds. These foods may have broadened the diet of these hominins, possibly by being critical resources that australopiths relied on during periods when their preferred dietary items were in short supply. Our analysis reconciles apparent discrepancies between dietary reconstructions based on biomechanics, tooth morphology, and dental microwear.\n      </p>", "Recently developed methods in phylogenetic systematics enable the discovery of associations among diverse characters of organisms such as morphology, biomechanics, and ecology among clades. In this study, the results of multiple character correlation techniques were compared using a data set on the functional morphology and ecology of feeding in the Cheilinini and outgroups (Perciformes: Labridae). The following two questions were addressed: What are the patterns of evolutionary change in structure and function of the feeding mechanisms of labrid fishes? Are evolutionary changes in trophic structure, feeding biomechanics, and feeding ecology congruent at different levels of labrid phylogeny? This study integrated previous work on the phylogenetic relationships of labrid fishes, quantitative modeling of jaw protrusion and hyoid depression mechanisms, analysis of morphometric variation in the trophic apparatus, and description of the natural diet of labrids. Analysis of phylogenetic association between dietary and biomechanical characters within the phylogeny was performed using character optimization to map characters onto the phylogeny. Statistical tests of association between pairs of discrete characters involved contingent states tests and concentrated changes tests. Phylogenetic correlations between continuous quantitative characters were determined using the methods of squared-change parsimony, independent contrasts, and phylogenetic autocorrelation. A diversity of techniques yielded similar answers in this case study, suggesting that evolution of dietary habits and feeding behavior is tightly linked to the biomechanics of the feeding apparatus.\n      </p>", "Any planar displacement of a rigid body can be uniquely characterized as a rotation about some fixed axis through a certain angle. These same rotational parameters can also describe the relative motion of two joint components and have been used to describe the rotational behavior of human body joints. This article derives estimates of these parameters and their standard errors, based on geometric arguments for the coordinates of markers observed during the rotation. This in turn identifies optimal placements of the experimental markers, which maximize the precision of the estimated center of rotation and the angle of rotation. This is the first statistical treatment of this problem.

In general, regardless of taxonomic affinity, petioles were found to be mechanically constructed in one of two ways: Type I petioles-as cantilevered, end-loaded beams with relatively uniform flexural stiffness (EI) (simple and palmate leaves); and Type II petioles-as tapered cantilevered beams whose static loadings (biomass) and EI increase basipetally (pinnate leaves). In general, collenchyma and sclerenchyma were found to be peripherally located in transections through Type I and II petioles, respectively. Statistical analyses within each species and among species with either type of petiole indicated that EI \u2248 k1Lp2.98 and EI \u2248 k2Lp2.05 for Type I and II petioles, respectively, where k1 and k2 are dimensional constants and Lp is petiolar length. The data are interpreted to indicate that Type I and II petioles mechanically operate to deal with static loadings in two distinct ways, such that Type II petioles function in an analogous manner to branches supporting separate leaves (leaflets). The convergence in mechanical \"designs\" among taxonomically distinct lineages (angiosperms and ferns) is interpreted as evidence for selection on mechanical attributes of load supporting structures (petioles).\n      </p>", "1. We measured the closing force of the major claw of live fiddler crabs (Uca pugnax), using a flexible beam equipped with strain gauges and connected to a Wheatstone bridge and computer. 2. Crabs usually produced a series of rhythmic contractions. Maximum closing force of an individual was related approximately linearly to claw length. 3. Closing force scaled as predicted from the force expected from dimensions used to calculate muscle cross-sectional area and mechanical advantage. This suggests that the major claw, which is an extreme case of sexual selection, is fully functional as a closing device, rather than losing the closing force function, which might be expected if it was used primarily as a display to signal body size to other males or females.\n      </p>", "We studied the selection of preferred step width in human walking by measuring mechanical and metabolic costs as a function of experimentally manipulated step width (0.00-0.45L, as a fraction of leg length L). We estimated mechanical costs from individual limb external mechanical work and metabolic costs using open circuit respirometry. The mechanical and metabolic costs both increased substantially (54 and 45%, respectively) for widths greater than the preferred value (0.15-0.45L) and with step width squared (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0.91 and 0.83, respectively). As predicted by a three-dimensional model of walking mechanics, the increases in these costs appear to be a result of the mechanical work required for redirecting the centre of mass velocity during the transition between single stance phases (step-to-step transition costs). The metabolic cost for steps narrower than preferred (0.10-0.00L) increased by 8%, which was probably as a result of the added cost of moving the swing leg laterally in order to avoid the stance leg (lateral limb swing cost). Trade-offs between the step-to-step transition and lateral limb swing costs resulted in a minimum metabolic cost at a step width of 0.12L, which is not significantly different from foot width (0.11L) or the preferred step width (0.13L). Humans appear to prefer a step width that minimizes metabolic cost.\n      </p>", "Ballistospores of basidiomycete fungi form at the tips of spear-shaped projections called sterigmata that extend from basidia. At maturity, a spherical drop of fluid appears at the base of each spore, and a few seconds later the spore is propelled into the surrounding air. The development of the fluid drop was first reported in 1889, but a century of innovative research was necessary to solve the mechanistic link between the drop and spore discharge. Through an extraordinary series of experiments the composition of the drop has now been established, its development is explained, and an effective solution to the relationship between drop appearance and spore discharge has been proposed. Drop formation is initiated when a femtomole quantity of mannitol and hexoses is excreted from a specific site at the base of the spore, forming a hygroscopic nucleus upon which water condenses from the surrounding air. Discharge of the spore occurs when the drop fuses with a film of liquid that curves over the adjacent spore surface. This rapid coalescence results in a decrease in surface free energy within the liquid and displaces the center of mass of the spore. The change in weight distribution exerts a force that is opposed by the pressurized sterigma, and the spore is shot away from the basidium into the surrounding air. The mechanism is described as a surface-tension catapult. During discharge, ballistospores are subjected to an acceleration of 25 000 g, which is about ten thousand times the acceleration experienced by astronauts during the launch of the Space Shuttle! Even more impressive is the fact that while the Shuttle consumes 50% of its weight in fuel in the first 2 min of flight, ballistospore discharge is fueled by the mannitol and hexoses that cause water to condense on the spore surface, and these solutes represent only 1% of the mass of the spore..\n      </p>", "By applying the principles and methods of mechanics to the musculoskeletal system, new insights can be discovered about control of human limb dynamics both in adults and infants. Here, we first provide a basic primer about biomechanics-its historical context, terminology, and analytical techniques. Next we review research with animals and human adults that illustrates how limb dynamics provides a window for examining the physical mechanisms underlying neuromotor control. Finally, we elaborate on how our research group has adapted dynamics techniques to investigate how infants gain control of their limbs and learn to reach in the first year of life.\n      </p>", "A mathematical method, based on polar coordinates that allow modelling of primary and secondary growth processes in stems of extant and fossil plants, is summarized and its potential is discussed in comparison with numerical methods using digitizing tablets or electronic image analysing systems. As an example, the modelling of tissue distribution in the internode of an extant sphenopsid (Equisetum hyemale) is presented. In the second half of the paper we present new data of a functional analysis of stem structure and biomechanics of the early lignophyte Tetraxylopteris schmidtii (Middle Devonian) using the polar coordinate method for modelling the tissue distribution in stems of different ontogenetic age. Calculations of the mechanical properties of the stems, based on the modelling of the tissue arrangement, indicate that there is no increase in structural bending modulus throughout the entire development of the plant. The oldest ontogenetic stage has a significantly smaller bending elastic modulus than the intermediate ontogenetic stage, a 'mechanical signal', which is not consistent with a self-supporting growth form. These results, and the ontogenetic variations of the contributions of different stem tissues to the flexural stiffness of the entire stem, are discussed in the evolutionary context of cambial secondary growth.\n      </p>", "The relationships between prey utilization and jaw biomechanics were explored in two Caribbean populations (La Parguera and Mona Island) of four triggerfishes. The volumetric contribution of major prey types and six biomechanical features of the jaws that characterize biting strength were contrasted between populations. At Mona, Xanthichthys ringens ate 45% benthic organisms, whereas conspecifics at La Parguera fed exclusively on plankton. Balistes vetula at Mona consumed 63% soft and nonelusive invertebrates, in contrast to their La Parguera conspecifics, which consumed 62% hard prey. Differences in diet between populations were associated with differences in jaw biomechanics. Xanthichthys at Mona had jaw muscles, bones, and closing-lever ratios larger than those of fish at La Parguera, indicating a stronger bite. Balistes at Mona had 50% smaller jaw bones, muscles, and closing-lever ratios than their La Parguera conspecifics, indicating a weaker but swifter bite. Melichthys niger and Cantherhines macrocerus ate similar prey at the two locations and showed little difference in trophic anatomy. We hypothesize that the interpopulation differences in morphology are induced by the activities of feeding on different prey and enhance the feeding ability of fishes for locally dominant prey. Plasticity of the feeding mechanism may be a widespread attribute of fish feeding systems that promotes the ability of species to occupy multiple habitat types successfully.\n      </p>", "Clonal plant networks consist of interconnected individuals (ramets) of different sizes and ages. They represent heterogeneous ramet assemblages with marked differences in quality and attractiveness for herbivores. Here, feeding preferences of a generalist herbivore (Spodoptera exigua) for differently-aged ramets of Trifolium repens were studied, and changes in herbivore preference in response to systemic defense induction were investigated. Dual-choice tests were used to assess the preference of herbivores for young versus mature ramets of induced and uninduced plants, respectively. Additionally, leaf traits related to nutrition, biomechanics and chemical defense were measured to explain variation in tissue quality and herbivore preference. Young ramets were heavily damaged in control plants. After systemic defense induction, damage on young ramets was greatly reduced, while damage on mature ramets increased slightly. Defense induction increased leaf strength and thickness, decreased leaf soluble carbohydrates and substantially changed phenolic composition of undamaged ramets connected to attacked individuals. Systemic induced resistance led to a more dispersed feeding pattern among ramets of different ages. It is proposed that inducible defense acts as a risk-spreading strategy in clonal plants by equalizing herbivore preference within the clone, thereby avoiding extended selective feeding on valuable plant tissues.\n      </p>", "Strong covariation between organismal traits is often taken as an indication of a potentially adaptively significant relationship. Because one of the main functions of woody stems is mechanical support, identifying the factors that covary with biomechanics is essential for inference of adaption. To date in such studies, stem biomechanics is plotted against stem age or size, thus with implicit assumptions regarding the importance of each in determining mechanics. Likewise, comparing ontogenies between individuals is central to the study of ontogenetic evolution (e.g., heterochrony). Both absolute age and size have been used, but the rationale for choosing one over the other has not been examined. Sampling a plant of simple architecture across microsites with differing sizes for the same absolute age, we compared regressions of stem length, mechanics, and tissue areas against age and size. Stem length was predicted by diameter but not by age, and stem biomechanics and tissue areas were better explained by stem length rather than age. We show that the allometric and mechanical properties observed across microsites are uniform despite great platsicity in other features (e.g., size and wood anatomy) and suggest that this uniformity is an example of developmental homeostasis. Finally, we discuss reasons for preferring size over absolute age as a basis for comparing ontogenies between individuals.\n      </p>", "Physical models, like mathematical models, are useful tools in biomechanical research. Physical models enable investigators to explore parameter space in a way that is not possible using a comparative approach with living organisms: parameters can be varied one at a time to measure the performance consequences of each, while values and combinations not found in nature can be tested. Experiments using physical models in the laboratory or field can circumvent problems posed by uncooperative or endangered organisms. Physical models also permit some aspects of the biomechanical performance of extinct organisms to be measured. Use of properly scaled physical models allows detailed physical measurements to be made for organisms that are too small or fast to be easily studied directly. The process of physical modelling and the advantages and limitations of this approach are illustrated using examples from our research on hydrodynamic forces on sessile organisms, mechanics of hydraulic skeletons, food capture by Zooplankton and odour interception by olfactory antennules.\n      </p>", "Wood, or secondary xylem, is composed mostly of three components-cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin. Yet this apparent simplicity is deceiving because the sophisticated arrangement of the components on various structural levels, ranging from intricate molecular architecture to defined cellular arrangements to tissue morphology, makes wood a challenging and interesting subject of biomechanical investigation. Recent advances in genetic transformation, providing easier access to wood of specifically altered composition or structure, have opened new opportunities for research on the intricate relation between material structure and composition and mechanical properties. At the same time, investigations into the mechanical properties have provided new information regarding the structural configuration of wood. The present paper reviews the work conducted in this field and outlines future perspectives and prospects for research.\n      </p>", "The fossil evidence is re-examined to determine the structure of Pteranodon ingens. New measurements include the cross-sections and thickness of the wing bones, the degree and direction of movement of the joints, and the size and position of major tendon and muscle insertions. From this data a reconstruction is made suitable for engineering and aerodynamic analysis. The reconstruction is based largely on Eaton's type specimen, 1175, and has a wing span of 6.95 m. The mass is estimated as 16.6 kg by calculating the volume of each part, making due allowance for the soft parts and cavities. The engineering design of the wing is considered in some detail. The shape deduced from the angles of the joints agrees well with that required for strength and aerodynamic efficiency. The strength of each part has been compared with the loads on it in gliding flight, showing that the structure is extremely well designed; it is strong enough everywhere, but with little unnecessary weight. Wind-tunnel experiments on model heads show that the sagittal crest was primarily a weight-saving device; by balancing the aerodynamic loads on the beak, it allows the neck muscles to be reduced, saving much more than its own weight. The performance of Pteranodon as a glider has been calculated, and compared with birds and manmade gliders. With a sinking speed of only 0.42 m/s at a flying speed of 8 m/s, Pteranodon is a superb low speed soaring aircraft, able to soar in weak thermals, or hill lift in very light winds. With its low stalling speed, it could also land very gently. Powered flight is considered, and it is shown that Pteranodon is just capable of level flight; but it is clearly primarily a glider. The environment in which Pteranodon lived is determined as far as possible from an analysis of the palaeobotany, palaeozoology and palaeoclimatology of the Cretaceous. The evidence points to a warmer and more uniform climate with lighter winds than today. This agrees well with Pteranodon's performance, which is ideally suited to light wind conditions. The mode of life is considered, showing that Pteranodon probably lived on sea cliffs facing the prevailing wind. After landing on the top, it would scrabble forwards (it could neither stand up nor walk) and hang from its hind feet over the edge. From here it could easily launch itself. When flying near the cliff it would soar in the hill lift; when far out at sea it would use the weak thermals generated by convection over the warm sea. Dynamic soaring and slope-soaring over the waves are not possible for such a slow-speed glider. Some consideration is given to methods of feeding, social organization and defence against predators. Finally it is suggested that extinction could have been due to climatic change, particularly an increase in the average wind speed at the end of the Cretaceous.\n      </p>", "Growth of turgid cells, defined as an irreversible increase in cell volume and surface area, can be regarded as a physical process governed by the mechanical properties of the cell wall and the osmotic properties of the protoplast. Irreversible cell expansion is produced by creating a driving force for water uptake by decreasing the turgor through stress relaxation in the cell wall. This mechano-hydraulic process thus depends on and can be controlled by the mechanical properties of the wall, which in turn are subject to modification by wall loosening and wall stiffening reactions. The biochemical mechanisms of these changes in mechanical wall properties and their regulation by internal signals (e.g., hormones) or external signals (e.g., light, drought stress) are at present incompletely understood and subject to intensive research. These signals act on walls that have the properties of composite materials in which the molecular structure and spatial organization of polymers rather than the distribution of mechanical stresses dictate the allometry of cell and organ growth and thus cell and organ shape. The significance of cell wall architecture for allometric growth can be demonstrated by disturbing the oriented deposition of wall polymers with microtubule-interfering drugs such as colchicine. Elongating organs (e.g., cylindrical stems or coleoptiles) composed of different tissues with different mechanical properties exhibit longitudinal tissue tensions resulting in the transfer of wall stress from inner to peripheral cell layers that adopt control over organ growth. For physically analyzing the growth process leading to seed germination, the same mechanical and hydraulic parameters as in normal growth are principally appropriate. However, for covering the influences of the tissues that restrain embryo expansion (seed coat, endosperm), an additional force and a water permeability term must be considered.\n      </p>", "Sauropod dinosaurs were the largest terrestrial animals to have ever existed, and are difficult to interpret as living animals owing to their lack of living descendants. With computer models that employ the basic physics of buoyancy and equilibrium, it is possible to investigate how the bodies of these animals would have reacted when immersed in water. Multi-tonne sauropods are found to be extremely buoyant and unstable in water when aspects of their probable respiratory anatomy are considered, which obviates the old problem of them being unable to breathe when fully immersed. Interpretations of 'manus-only' trackways made by floating sauropods will depend on the details of buoyancy as not all sauropods float in the same manner.\n      </p>", "The mechanical environment plays an important role in cell signaling and tissue homeostasis. Unraveling connections between externally applied loads and the cellular response is often confounded by extracellular matrix (ECM) heterogeneity. Image-based multiscale models provide a foundation for examining the fine details of tissue behavior, but they require validation at multiple scales. In this study, we developed a multiscale model that captured the anisotropy and heterogeneity of a cell-compacted collagen gel subjected to an off-axis hold mechanical test and subsequently to biaxial extension. In both the model and experiments, the ECM reorganized in a nonaffine and heterogeneous manner that depended on multiscale interactions between the fiber networks. Simulations predicted that tensile and compressive fiber forces were produced to accommodate macroscopic displacements. Fiber forces in the simulation ranged from -11.3 to 437.7 nN, with a significant fraction of fibers under compression (12.1% during off-axis stretch). The heterogeneous network restructuring predicted by the model serves as an example of how multiscale modeling techniques provide a theoretical framework for understanding relationships between ECM structure and tissue-level mechanical properties and how microscopic fiber rearrangements could lead to mechanotransductive cell signaling.\n      </p>", "Biological exoskeletons, in particular those with unusually robust and multifunctional properties, hold enormous potential for the development of improved load-bearing and protective engineering materials. Here, we report new materials and mechanical design principles of the iron-plated multilayered structure of the natural armor of Crysomallon squamiferum, a recently discovered gastropod mollusc from the Kairei Indian hydrothermal vent field, which is unlike any other known natural or synthetic engineered armor. We have determined through nanoscale experiments and computational simulations of a predatory attack that the specific combination of different materials, microstructures, interfacial geometries, gradation, and layering are advantageous for penetration resistance, energy dissipation, mitigation of fracture and crack arrest, reduction of back deflections, and resistance to bending and tensile loads. The structure-property-performance relationships described are expected to be of technological interest for a variety of civilian and defense applications.\n      </p>", "During postembryonic ontogeny, Varanus niloticus shows the formation of a crushing dentition correlated with changes in mandibular mechanics. Postembryonic changes of the feeding apparatus of V. niloticus might be correlated with an adaptational shift from an insectivorous to a molluscivorous diet. Proportional changes of the lower jaw result in a slower yet stronger bite. The adaptational shift, involving quantitative and qualitative modifications of a complex of funcionally correlated characters, results from differential growth during ontogeny.\n      </p>", "Certain joints in the pedipalps of scorpions and sun-spiders lack extensor muscles but have elastic transarticular sclerites that store energy during flexion and return energy as elastic recoil during extension. This study quantifies the extension torque contributed by elastic recoil and hydraulic pressure in the chela (tibia-tarsus) and femur-patella joints of scorpions and the patella-tibia and tibitarsus joints of sun-spiders. Extension torque was measured as isolated joints were cycled through a natural range of angles and angular velocities by a computer controlled stepper motor. Resilience (efficiency of elastic energy return) of transarticular sclerites in the absence of internal fluid pressure was about 60% in scorpion joints and 80% in sun-spider joints. Elastic torque increased almost linearly with flexion angle in most joints except in the scorpion chela, where elastic torque decreased rapidly as the fully closed joint began to open, increased gradually and then decreased again near the fully open position. Hydraulic pressure contributed more to extension of pedipalpal joints of scorpions than those of sun-spiders. Our results indicate that mechanical properties of a \"passive\" transarticular sclerite can be changed by altering internal fluid pressure and by capitalizing on the sclerite's intrinsic viscoelasticity.\n      </p>", "1. Many taxa of freshwater invertebrates show active upstream movements, particularly the snails. Hypotheses explaining this behaviour invoke the search for food or space, compensation for drift, avoidance of predation and hydrodynamic effects. The pervasiveness of upstream movements among remote lineages of snails (two subclasses, three orders, 10 families), however, suggests that snails may move upstream for mechanical rather than adaptive reasons. 2. It is proposed that upstream movements by snails are a function of torque on the snail's foot generated by hydrodynamic drag on the shell. When subject to high broadside drag-forces on their shells, snails are able to reduce torque and stabilize orientation only by directing their anterior aspect upstream. 3. Movements of the freshwater pleurocerid snail Elimia were studied by following marked free-ranging individuals in six streams in Alabama, USA (four species, eight populations). 4. Populations showed either no net movement (two streams) or significant upstream movements ranging to a mean of \u224840 m over a 3-month period (four streams). Movement patterns were stream specific rather than species or population specific. Within populations showing significant upstream movements, snails with shell lengths \u2264 10 mm showed little net movement. Larger snails showed movements from 0 to &gt; 200 m upstream. 5. A torque-constrained random walk model was used to perform a post hoc test of the hypothesis that upstream movements were a function of torque on the snail's foot generated by hydrodynamic drag on the shell. The model predicted upstream and size-dependent movement patterns that approximated those observed for snails in the field.\n      </p>", "Recent observations of \"compression filtration\" in live euphausiids and unresolved historic controversies about filter feeding in euphausiids based mostly on inferences from preserved specimens suggest that reconsideration of the biomechanics of filter feeding is in order. Explanations of filter feeding in reviews by Mauchline and Fisher (1969) and Mauchline (1980) are incorrect. Here I review previous work and present new observations on the morphology and mechanics of the thoracic endopodites and exopodites of Euphausia superba. Movements of the endopodites are rapid and stereotyped. As the feeding basket expands laterally a pressure gradient is created which sucks water and particles into the basket from the front. Water and particles never enter the basket from the sides, below, or behind. Once inside the feeding basket, particles are retained on the filter and water is squeezed out laterally between the setae. During expansion of the basket the exopodites act as flapper valves which inhibit lateral entry of water, but during the compression stroke the exopodites lift for approximately 100 ms and permit expulsion of water. Comb setae loosen food particles trapped on the filter setae and the tips of the filter setae brush them to the mandibular palps. When phytoplankton is scarce, krill feed steadily with metronomic sweeps of the basket. When phytoplankton is abundant, they exhibit discontinuous feeding patterns. Filter feeding by compression pumping may occur in all those euphausiids that have thoracic appendages like those of E. superba and which filter feed on phytoplankton.\n      </p>", "Late Cretaceous and early Tertiary radiations in cheilostome bryozoans gained major impetus from the evolutionary development of rigidly erect, branching growth habits from ancestral encrusting forms. Consideration of the skeletal strength, branching morphology, and behaviour in water flow of living and fossil arborescent cheilostomes suggests that: (1) the earliest species of the Cretaceous depended on high-strength skeletal material to resist failure, but were limited in growth by weak designs resulting from inability to thicken branches and thus augment skeletal cross sections toward the colony base; (2) with increasing ability to enhance design through branch thickening, a growing number of Cainozoic species have become capable of avoiding failure in likely regimes, even though they commonly have skeletons of weaker material; and (3) concurrently with the waning importance of mechanical limitations, spatial constraints have become more significant, so that most species now have branches diverging at angles that minimize crowding as a colony reaches maximum size. Morphological data from a total of 70 species ranging from the Cenomanian to the present provide statistically significant support for these trends. Preliminary data on detailed changes through time suggest that the trends arose through selection among species of generally advantageous morphological differences that are species-specific and fluctuate randomly within species.\n      </p>", "Mammalian skeletons experience peak locomotor stresses (force per area) that are 25 to 50% of their failure strength, indicating a safety factor of between two and four. The mechanism by which animals achieve a constant safety factor varies depending on the size of the animal. Over much of their size range (0.1 to 300 kilograms), larger mammals maintain uniform skeletal stress primarily by having a more upright posture, which decreases mass-specific muscle force by increasing muscle mechanical advantage. At greater sizes, increased skeletal allometry and decreased locomotor performance likely maintain stresses constant. At smaller sizes, skeletal stiffness may be more critical than strength. The decrease in mass-specific muscle force in mammals weighing 0.1 to 300 kilogram indicates that peak muscle stresses are also constant and correlates with a decrease in mass-specific energy cost of locomotion. The consistent pattern of locomotor stresses developed in long bones at different speeds and gaits within a species may have important implications for how bones adaptively remodel to changes in stress.\n      </p>", "The mechanical behaviour of large foliage leaves in response to static and dynamic mechanical forces is reviewed in the context of a few basic engineering principles and illustrated in terms of species drawn from a variety of vascular plant lineages. When loaded under their own weight or subjected to externally applied forces, petioles simultaneously bend and twist, and thus mechanically operate as cantilevered beams. The stresses that develop in petioles reach their maximum intensities either at their surface or very near their centroid axes, where they are accommodated either by living and hydrostatic tissues (parenchyma and collenchyma) or dead and stiff tissues (sclerenchyma and vascular fibres) depending on the size of the leaf and the species from which it is drawn. Allometric analyses of diverse species indicate size-dependent variations in petiole length, transverse shape, geometry and stiffness that accord well with those required to maintain a uniform tip-deflection for leaves with laminae differing in mass. When dynamically loaded, the laminae of many broad-leaved species fold and curl into streamlined objects, thereby reducing the drag forces that they experience and transmit to their subtending petioles and stems. From a mechanical perspective, the laminae of these species operate as stress-skin panels that distribute point loads more or less equally over their entire surface. Although comparatively little is known about the mechanical structure and behaviour of foliage leaves, new advances in engineering theory and computer analyses reveal these organs to be far more complex than previously thought. For example, finite-element analyses of the base of palm leaves reveal that stresses are decreased when these structures are composed of anisotropic as opposed to isotropic materials (tissues).\n      </p>", "\u2022 Mechanical architectures of two Clematis species, the herbaceous perennial Clematis recta and the woody liana, Clematis vitalba, were investigated and compared with the woody rhizomatous sand dune plant Clematis flammula var. maritima. \u2022 Bending mechanical properties of stems from various developmental stages were compared and related to stem geometry and relative proportions of tissues during development. \u2022 Clematis vitalba and C. flammula var. maritima showed mechanical architectures with reductions in structural Young's modulus of the stem during ontogeny. Irreversible loss of stem rigidity was mediated by disruption, separation and eventual loss of primary phloem fibres via secondary growth of the periderm and cambial activity. Each species showed variations of non-self-supporting mechanical architecture relating to specific habitat preferences. In aerial stems of C. recta the structural Young's modulus remained approximately constant during ontogeny, a mechanical signal characteristic for semi-self-supporting architectures. \u2022 Woody aerial plant stems are extremely rare in the Ranunculaceae and seldom, if ever, show self-supporting characteristics. Growth form evolution in the group may have been canalised by evolution of rhizomatous geophytic growth forms with secondary growth confined to underground stems specialized for water conduction, storage and perennation. Variation of this ground plan includes climbing, straggling or rhizomatous architectures but not self-supporting shrubs or trees with secondary growth generating requisite self-supporting mechanical properties. Certain body plan organisations appear to have inbuilt mechanical constraints which may have profound effects on the subsequent evolution of growth forms.\n      </p>", "Legged animals routinely negotiate rough, unpredictable terrain with agility and stability that outmatches any human-built machine. Yet, we know surprisingly little about how animals accomplish this. Current knowledge is largely limited to studies of steady movement. These studies have revealed fundamental mechanisms used by terrestrial animals for steady locomotion. However, it is unclear whether these models provide an appropriate framework for the neuromuscular and mechanical strategies used to achieve dynamic stability over rough terrain. Perturbation experiments shed light on this issue, revealing the interplay between mechanics and neuromuscular control. We measured limb mechanics of helmeted guinea fowl (Numida meleagris) running over an unexpected drop in terrain, comparing their response to predictions of the mass-spring running model. Adjustment of limb contact angle explains 80% of the variation in stance-phase limb loading following the perturbation. Surprisingly, although limb stiffness varies dramatically, it does not influence the response. This result agrees with a mass-spring model, although it differs from previous findings on humans running over surfaces of varying compliance. However, guinea fowl sometimes deviate from mass-spring dynamics through posture-dependent work performance of the limb, leading to substantial energy absorption following the perturbation. This posture-dependent actuation allows the animal to absorb energy and maintain desired velocity on a sudden substrate drop. Thus, posture-dependent work performance of the limb provides inherent velocity control over rough terrain. These findings highlight how simple mechanical models extend to unsteady conditions, providing fundamental insights into neuromuscular control of movement and the design of dynamically stable legged robots and prosthetic devices.\n      </p>", "1. Previous evidence demonstrates that closing force decreases proportionally as fiddler crab claw size increases. Larger crabs do have greater absolute closing force, but less than would be expected if claw proportions were isometric. In the Mud Fiddler Crab, Uca pugnax, this is explained by a decrease in mechanical advantage with increasing claw size. 2. We here re-measure mechanical advantage with a more direct method than used previously; the relationship of mechanical advantage to claw size was similar to the older indirect measure. Because the fiddler crab claw is a simple lever, we predicted that the observed decline in closing force should be compensated by a proportional increase in closing speed. 3. We tested this hypothesis using high-speed video to observe crabs closing their major claws spontaneously under controlled conditions. Closing speed scaled positively to claw length as predicted, and the value of the exponent conformed to expectation from a simple biomechanical model. 4. Evolution of the fiddler crab claw therefore involved a trade-off of closing force for closing speed. An adaptive explanation of relative weakening with increasing body size may lie in the increased ability to rapidly grasp an opponent, a crucial advantage in fiddler crab combat.\n      </p>", "'Terror bird' is a common name for the family Phorusrhacidae. These large terrestrial birds were probably the dominant carnivores on the South American continent from the Middle Palaeocene to the Pliocene-Pleistocene limit. Here we use a mechanical model based on tibiotarsal strength to estimate maximum running speeds of three species of terror birds: Mesembriornis milneedwardsi, Patagornis marshi and a specimen of Phorusrhacinae gen. The model is proved on three living large terrestrial bird species. On the basis of the tibiotarsal strength we propose that Mesembriornis could have used its legs to break long bones and access their marrow.\n      </p>", "Theropod dinosaurs attained the largest body sizes among terrestrial predators, and were also unique in being exclusively bipedal. With only two limbs for propulsion and balance, theropods would have been greatly constrained in their locomotor performance at large body size. Using three-dimensional restorations of the axial bodies and limbs of 12 theropod dinosaurs, and determining their rotational inertias (RIs) about a vertical axis, we show that these animals expressed a pattern of phyletic size increase that minimized the increase in RI associated with increases in body size. By contrast, the RI of six quadrupedal, carnivorous archosaurs exhibited changes in body proportions that were closer to those predicted by isometry. Correlations of low RI with high agility in lizards suggest that large theropods, with low relative RI, could engage in activities requiring higher agility than would be possible with isometric scaling.\n      </p>", "Physical forces generated by cells drive morphologic changes during development and can feedback to regulate cellular phenotypes. Because these phenomena typically occur within a 3-d i mensional (3D) matrix in vivo, we used microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology to generate arrays of microtissues consisting of cells encapsulated within 3D micro patterned matrices. Microcantilevers were used to simultaneously constrain the remodeling of a collagen gel and to report forces generated during this process. By concurrently measuring forces and observing matrix remodeling at cellular length scales, we report an initial correlation and later decoupling between cellular contractile forces and changes in tissue morphology. Independently varying the mechanical stiffness of the cantilevers and collagen matrix revealed that cellular forces increased with boundary or matrix rigidity whereas levels of cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins correlated with levels of mechanical stress. By mapping these relationships between cellular and matrix mechanics, cellular forces, and protein expression onto a bio-chemo-mechanical model of microtissue contractility, we demonstrate how intratissue gradients of mechanical stress can emerge from collective cellular contractility and finally, how such gradients can be used to engineer protein composition and organization within a 3D tissue. Together, these findings highlight a complex and dynamic relationship between cellular forces, ECM remodeling, and cellular phenotype and describe a system to study and apply this relationship within engineered 3D microtissues.\n      </p>", "1. Crowding is a common ecological phenomenon that has been widely studied from the perspective of competition for limiting resources. The extent to which crowded plants and sessile animals are positively affected by their neighbours, however, has received much less attention. Here, we use four salt-marsh plant species to examine the hypothesis that crowding leads to morphologically modified individuals that are dependent on their neighbours for structural support. 2. In the spring, crowded and isolated treatments were created for the four species (Juncus gerardi, Spartina alterniflora, Iva frutescens and Salicornia europaea). By the end of the growing season, crowded plants (a) were generally taller, thinner and produced less above-ground biomass, (b) were more susceptible to breaking and (c) grew closer to their theoretical maximum heights. 3. To explicitly test the hypothesis that crowding leads to plants that are dependent on their neighbours for support, we thinned crowded plant stands at the end of the growing season and compared the survivorship of these secondarily isolated plants with that of permanently isolated plants. For all four species, a significant number of previously crowded plants fell over, whereas plants grown in isolation remained upright. 4. Our results show that crowded plants often develop morphologies that cause them to be structurally dependent on their neighbours for support. Thus, the continuing presence of neighbours provides a positive benefit that may mitigate the negative effects of crowding. Our findings contribute to a growing body of evidence that positive interactions among crowded plants and sessile animals are a more pervasive feature of natural assemblages than is generally acknowledged.\n      </p>", "1. An instrumented perch was used to measure the reaction forces during take-off of starlings from perches of three thicknesses. There was no significant decrease in reaction force with decreasing perch thickness; however, over the range of perch sizes there was a 10-fold decrease in safety factor and a 400-fold increase in the energy of deflection of the thinnest perch. 2. The implications of these results are that birds do not change their take-off strategy when faced with perches of variable thickness and that, as a result, leaps from thin perches are very much less efficient than those from thicker perches. Birds appear not to adjust their leaping behaviour to minimize the risk of substrate failure during take-offs.\n      </p>", "It has been argued that minimization of metabolic-energy costs is a primary determinant of gait selection in terrestrial animals. This view is based predominantly on data from humans and horses, which have been shown to choose the most economical gait (walking, running, galloping) for any given speed. It is not certain whether a minimization of metabolic costs is associated with the selection of other prevalent forms of terrestrial gaits, such as grounded running (a widespread gait in birds). Using biomechanical and metabolic measurements of four ostriches moving on a treadmill over a range of speeds from $0.8 to 6.7 m s^{-1}$ , we reveal here that the selection of walking or grounded running at intermediate speeds also favours a reduction in the metabolic cost of locomotion. This gait transition is characterized by a shift in locomotor kinetics from an inverted-pendulum gait to a bouncing gait that lacks an aerial phase. By contrast, when the ostrich adopts an aerial-running gait at faster speeds, there are no abrupt transitions in mechanical parameters or in the metabolic cost of locomotion. These data suggest a continuum between grounded and aerial running, indicating that they belong to the same locomotor paradigm.\n      </p>", "The lepidosaurian skull has long been of interest to functional morphologists and evolutionary biologists. Patterns of bone loss and gain, particularly in relation to bars and fenestrae, have led to a variety of hypotheses concerning skull use and kinesis. Of these, one of the most enduring relates to the absence of the lower temporal bar in squamates and the acquisition of streptostyly. We performed a series of computer modeling studies on the skull of Uromastyx hardwickii, an akinetic herbivorous lizard. Multibody dynamic analysis (MDA) was conducted to predict the forces acting on the skull, and the results were transferred to a finite element analysis (FEA) to estimate the pattern of stress distribution. In the FEA, we applied the MDA result to a series of models based on the Uromastyx skull to represent different skull configurations within past and present members of the Lepidosauria. In this comparative study, we found that streptostyly can reduce the joint forces acting on the skull, but loss of the bony attachment between the quadrate and pterygoid decreases skull robusticity. Development of a lower temporal bar apparently provided additional support for an immobile quadrate that could become highly stressed during forceful biting.\n      </p>", "In order to increase locomotor efficiency, breath-holding divers are expected to adjust their forward thrusts in relation to changes of buoyancy with depth. Wing propulsion during deep diving by Br\u00fcnnich's guillemots (Uria lomvia) was measured in the wild by high-speed (32 Hz) sampling of surge (tail-to-head) and heave (ventral-to-dorsal) accelerations with bird-borne data loggers. At the start of descent, the birds produced frequent surges (3.2 Hz) during both the upstroke and the downstroke against buoyancy to attain a mean speed of 1.2-1.8 m s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; that was close to the expected optimal swim speed. As they descended deeper, the birds decreased the frequency of surges to 2.4 Hz, relaying only on the downstroke. During their ascent, they stopped stroking at 18 m depth, after which the swim speed increased to 2.3 m s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, possibly because of increasing buoyancy as air volumes expanded. This smooth change of surge frequency was achieved while maintaining a constant stroke duration (0.4-0.5 s), presumably allowing efficient muscle contraction.\n      </p>", "Mechanical forces are closely involved in the construction of an embryo. Experiments have suggested that mechanical feedback plays a role in regulating these forces, but the nature of this feedback is poorly understood. Here, we propose a general principle for the mechanics of morphogenesis, as governed by a pair of evolution equations based on feedback from tissue stress. In one equation, the rate of growth (or contraction) depends on the difference between the current tissue stress and a target (homeostatic) stress. In the other equation, the target stress changes at a rate that depends on the same stress difference. The parameters in these morphomechanical laws are assumed to depend on stress rate. Computational models are used to illustrate how these equations can capture a relatively wide range of behaviours observed in developing embryos, as well as show the limitations of this theory. Specific applications include growth of pressure vessels (e.g. the heart, arteries and brain), wound healing and sea urchin gastrulation. Understanding the fundamental principles of tissue construction can help engineers design new strategies for creating replacement tissues and organs in vitro.\n      </p>", "The purpose of this work is to provide a biomechanical model to investigate the interplay between cellular structures and the mechanical force distribution during the elongation process of Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. Epithelial morphogenesis drives the elongation process of an ovoid embryo to become a worm-shaped embryo about four times longer and three times thinner. The overall anatomy of the embryo is modelled in the continuum mechanics framework from the structural organization of the subcellular filaments within epithelial cells. The constitutive relationships consider embryonic cells as homogeneous materials with an active behaviour, determined by the non-muscle myosin II molecular motor, and a passive viscoelastic response, related to the directional properties of the filament network inside cells. The axisymmetric elastic solution at equilibrium is derived by means of the incompressibility conditions, the continuity conditions for the overall embryo deformation and the balance principles for the embryonic cells. A particular analytical solution is proposed from a simplified geometry, demonstrating the mechanical role of the microtubule network within epithelial cells in redistributing the stress from a differential contraction of circumferentially oriented actin filaments. The theoretical predictions of the biomechanical model are discussed within the biological scenario proposed through genetic analysis and pharmacological experiments.\n      </p>", "Scaffold biomaterials for tissue engineering can be produced in many different ways depending on the applications and the materials used. Most research into new biomaterials is based on an experimental trial-and-error approach that limits the possibility of making many variations to a single material and studying its interaction with its surroundings. Instead, computer simulation applied to tissue engineering can offer a more exhaustive approach to test and screen out biomaterials. In this paper, a review of the current approach in biomaterials designed through computer-aided design (CAD) and through finite-element modelling is given. First we review the approach used in tissue engineering in the development of scaffolds and the interactions existing between biomaterials, cells and mechanical stimuli. Then, scaffold fabrication through CAD is presented and characterization of existing scaffolds through computed images is reviewed. Several case studies of finite-element studies in tissue engineering show the usefulness of computer simulations in determining the mechanical environment of cells when seeded into a scaffold and the proper design of the geometry and stiffness of the scaffold. This creates a need for more advanced studies that include aspects of mechanobiology in tissue engineering in order to be able to predict over time the growth and differentiation of tissues within scaffolds. Finally, current perspectives indicate that more efforts need to be put into the development of such advanced studies, with the removal of technical limitations such as computer power and the inclusion of more accurate biological and genetic processes into the developed algorithms.\n      </p>", "Humans tend to swing their arms when they walk, a curious behaviour since the arms play no obvious role in bipedal gait. It might be costly to use muscles to swing the arms, and it is unclear whether potential benefits elsewhere in the body would justify such costs. To examine these costs and benefits, we developed a passive dynamic walking model with free-swinging arms. Even with no torques driving the arms or legs, the model produced walking gaits with arm swinging similar to humans. Passive gaits with arm phasing opposite to normal were also found, but these induced a much greater reaction moment from the ground, which could require muscular effort in humans. We therefore hypothesized that the reduction of this moment may explain the physiological benefit of arm swinging. Experimental measurements of humans (n = 10) showed that normal arm swinging required minimal shoulder torque, while volitionally holding the arms still required 12 per cent more metabolic energy. Among measures of gait mechanics, vertical ground reaction moment was most affected by arm swinging and increased by 63 per cent without it. Walking with opposite-to-normal arm phasing required minimal shoulder effort but magnified the ground reaction moment, causing metabolic rate to increase by 26 per cent. Passive dynamics appear to make arm swinging easy, while indirect benefits from reduced vertical moments make it worthwhile overall.\n      </p>", "1. The generation of shoot thrust was measured in eight contrasted herbaceous species (Arrhenatherum elatius, Bromus erectus, Campanula rotundifolia, Cerastium fontanum, Hypericum perforatum, Koeleria macrantha, Poa trivialis and Urtica dioica) using a framework of weighted windows that could be opened by an expanding shoot. 2. The species that occur as vegetation dominants in their usual habitats (A. elatius, B. erectus and U. dioica) were found to have the greatest ability to generate thrust. 3. To test the prediction that shoot thrust was positively related to competitive ability, additional data were obtained by growing all eight species together in a productive turf in a glasshouse. 4. The rate of development of thrust was positively correlated with an index of competitive ability obtained in the productive, undisturbed conditions of the mixture experiment. 5. When associated with certain other attributes such as a tall leaf canopy, shoot thrust may be an important characteristic influencing the ability to forage for resources during competition and the potential of a plant to attain dominance in vegetation.\n      </p>", "Adhesive organs on the legs of arthropods and vertebrates are strongly direction dependent, making contact only when pulled towards the body but detaching when pushed away from it. Here we show that the two types of attachment pads found in cockroaches (Nauphoeta cinerea), tarsal euplantulae and pretarsal arolium, serve fundamentally different functions. Video recordings of vertical climbing revealed that euplantulae are almost exclusively engaged with the substrate when legs are pushing, whereas arolia make contact when pulling. Thus, upward-climbing cockroaches used front leg arolia and hind leg euplantulae, whereas hind leg arolia and front leg euplantulae were engaged during downward climbing. Single-leg friction force measurements showed that the arolium and euplantulae have an opposite direction dependence. Euplantulae achieved maximum friction when pushed distally, whereas arolium forces were maximal during proximal pulls. This direction dependence was not explained by the variation of shear stress but by different contact areas during pushing or pulling. The changes in contact area result from the arrangement of the flexible tarsal chain, tending to detach the arolium when pushing and to peel off euplantulae when in tension. Our results suggest that the euplantulae in cockroaches are not adhesive organs but 'friction pads', mainly providing the necessary traction during locomotion.\n      </p>", "The basic mechanics of human locomotion are associated with vaulting over stiff legs in walking and rebounding on compliant legs in running. However, while rebounding legs well explain the stance dynamics of running, stiff legs cannot reproduce that of walking. With a simple bipedal spring-mass model, we show that not stiff but compliant legs are essential to obtain the basic walking mechanics; incorporating the double support as an essential part of the walking motion, the model reproduces the characteristic stance dynamics that result in the observed small vertical oscillation of the body and the observed out-of-phase changes in forward kinetic and gravitational potential energies. Exploring the parameter space of this model, we further show that it not only combines the basic dynamics of walking and running in one mechanical system, but also reveals these gaits to be just two out of the many solutions to legged locomotion offered by compliant leg behaviour and accessed by energy or speed.\n      </p>", "In a related paper, we demonstrated that mimetic Heliconius butterflies have converged in wing-beat frequency and degree of asymmetry in the wing motion, whereas sister species are dissimilar in these same traits. Warning signals of sympatric, distasteful species converge in evolutionary models in order to educate their predators more efficiently that the signal is associated with unprofitable prey. Barring other constraints, the behaviours of the different co-mimetic pairs should ultimately converge on that behaviour which minimizes the energetic cost of flight. We estimated the energetic cost of each mimic's flight behaviour in order to predict the difference in height of each fitness peak and the direction of convergent selection qualitatively. Following adjustments for body mass, mimetic Heliconius melpomene and Heliconius erato required more aerodynamic power than Heliconius cydno and Heliconius sapho. This differnce was attributed to the slower flight speeds and higher wing-beat frequencies of H. melpomene and H. erato. Consequently, H. melpomene and H. erato expended more energy per unit distance per unit body mass than H. cydno and H. sapho. However, differences in body mass may equalize energy budgets and stabilize the sympatric coexistence of the two pairs of co-mimics.\n      </p>", "The importance of the centre of percussion (CP) of some hand-held sporting equipment (such as tennis rackets and baseball bats) for athletic performance is well known. In order to avoid injuries it is important that powerful blows are located close to the CP. Several species of glyptodont (giant armoured mammals) had tail clubs that can be modelled as rigid beams (like baseball bats) and it is generally assumed that these were useful for agonistic behaviour. However, the variation in tail club morphology among known genera suggests that a biomechanical and functional analysis of these structures could be useful. Here, we outline a novel method to determine the CP of the glyptodont tail clubs. We find that the largest species had the CP very close to the possible location of horny spikes. This is consistent with the inference that they were adapted to delivering powerful blows at that point. Our new analysis reinforces the case for agonistic use of tail clubs in several glyptodont species.\n      </p>", "The initial Upper Paleolithic (Chatelperronian) of western Europe was associated with late European Neandertals, best known through the Saint-Cesaire 1 partial skeleton. Biomechanical cross-sectional analysis of the Saint-Cesaire 1 femoral diaphysis at the subtrochanteric and midshaft levels, given the plasticity of mammalian diaphyseal cortical bone, provides insights into the habitual levels and patterns of loading on the lower limbs from body mass, proportions, and locomotion. The overall robustnesses of the femoral diaphyses of European Neandertals and early modern humans are similar once contrasts in body proportions are incorporated into the body size scaling. Saint-Cesaire 1 matches these samples only if it is provided with Neandertal-like hyperarctic body proportions. And the rounded proximal femoral diaphysis of Saint-Cesaire 1 is similar to those of earlier Neandertals, likely also reflecting similar cold-adapted broad pelvic regions. However, although morphologically similar to those of archaic Homo, the Saint-Cesaire 1 femoral midshaft exhibits the anteroposterior reinforcement characteristic of early modern humans. Consequently, Saint-Cesaire 1 appears as a morphological Neandertal with hyperarctic body proportions who nonetheless had shifted locomotor patterns to more closely resemble those of other Upper Paleolithic humans.\n      </p>", "Little is known about the reproductive ecology of aquatic angiosperms, despite their wide distribution and ecological importance. Surfgrass (Phyllospadix torreyi) is a clonal marine angiosperm that lives on turbulent rocky shores. Surfgrass exhibits a strongly female-biased sex ratio in flowering shoots throughout its distribution along the Pacific coast of North America. The ecological causes for this biased sex ratio were examined over 3 yr in a surfgrass population off Catalina Island in southern California, USA. Abundances, biomass, and C:N content of male and female flowering ramets were measured, and the reproductive phenology, reproductive losses to abortions, herbivore damage to fruits and seeds, and clonal survival and growth were quantified. Each year, a quarter of the vegetative ramets reproduced sexually and seed production in the population was prolific. The population sex ratio was female biased across the entire depth distribution of surfgrass, but males were more abundant deeper in the bed. Despite male rarity, pollen was abundant in the population, and virtually all ovules were fertilized, with few losses to abortions or herbivory before seed release. Potential female fitness (seeds produced) was highest at shallow depths where light availability was greatest and abortions were reduced. The spatial segregation of the sexes was not due to environmental sex lability but to greater ramification of female vs. male clones in shallow depths. Female flowering shoots had significantly higher biomass than males across water depth, despite no obvious cost in terms of vegetative growth, or advantage in terms of plant size. If current theory on sex allocation than the sex ratio should be biased toward the gender with the lower reproductive cost is true for surfgrass, then surfgrass provides an example of how a subtle resource allocation difference can result in a dramatic population bias. An alternative explanation for the female bias in surfgrass population is greater male mortality due to significantly weaker attachment to the substratum. This study demonstrates the potential role hydrodynamics can play in aquatic plant reproduction and in structuring their population.\n      </p>"], "words": {"xylem": {"number": 1, "prob":
