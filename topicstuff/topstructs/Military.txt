{"total_words": 1233, "documents": ["Three complementary explanations are tested for the phenomenon that, since 1940, the inflation rate for military goods and services has been higher on average than the inflation rates for the nonmilitary government sector or the economy as a whole. First, higher rates of public-sector inflation are often attributed to the low productivity of labor-intensive government activities compared with the relatively capital-intensive private sector. Because military goods and services are not necessarily labor intensive, however, this pattern explains only a small part of military inflation. A second, more important, consideration is that rapid buildups in military spending, usually associated with wars, lead to high inflation. For political reasons, however, retrenchments at the ends of wars do not produce a corresponding drop in prices, leading to higher average inflation over time. Finally, there is evidence that the Pentagon's interest in higher military spending may have influenced the construction of the deflator series.\n      </p>", "As the American death toll in Iraq surpassed 1,900, some international research scholars may have been perplexed. Only a few years ago, foreign policy makers in Western democracies, including the United States, were described as being extremely sensitive to the risk of military combat casualties. Among the factors that influence the number of casualties that a democracy will experience in conflict, one variable that should not be ignored is its military manpower system. The author contends that democracies with conscript armies experience fewer combat casualties than democracies with volunteer or professional forces because the societal actors most closely affected by conscript casualties are more likely to have the political power and access with which to constrain policy makers. Using several selection models, the author finds that democracy and conscription contribute to fewer casualties than democracy and volunteer militaries, with democracy alone being responsible for casualty numbers that lie somewhere in between.\n      </p>", "Many international relations theorists suggest that improved military capabilities will make the use or threat of military force a more attractive policy choice. Tests of this argument are complicated because policy makers' anticipation of their future needs for military capabilities could also produce a relationship between capabilities and policy choice. Results show that military capabilities indeed increase the frequency with which force is used, but although past uses of force influence the construction of military capabilities, evidence that decision makers can effectively anticipate their current needs is weak. The results also suggest that the recent trend in force structure toward a smaller number of high-value weapons and relatively well-paid personnel has mitigated the relationship between military spending and the use of force.\n      </p>", "This paper investigates three research topics in military scenario training and implementation: (1) the functions what military scenarios can provide which can be implemented by training, and the knowledge content of military scenario training for specific procedure and tasks; (2) the appropriate architecture to develop military scenario training systems; (3) a system architecture that incorporates the function of scenario base, rule base, geographical database, and learning mechanism with geographical information systems to develop military scenario training. The prototype of proposed scenario training systems and an example of system functions is also presented. This research considers that the proposed system architecture would offer a potential alternative method in order to build military scenario training systems for the Taiwanese Army.\n      </p>", "Planning United States military procurement commits a significant portion of our nation's wealth and determines our ability to defend ourselves, our allies, and our principles over the long term. Our military pioneered and has long used mathematical optimization to unravel the distinguishing complexities of military capital planning. The succession of mathematical optimization models we present exhibits increasingly detailed features; such embellishments are always needed for real-world, long-term procurement decision models. Two case studies illustrate practical modeling tricks that are useful in helping decision makers decide how to spend about a trillion dollars.\n      </p>", "Understanding the link between terrestrial and aquatic systems is important because disturbance to terrestrial systems may also influence stream processes. Military training lands provide a unique opportunity to examine the influence of large-scale disturbance on terrestrial and aquatic communities in the absence of other anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., agriculture, urbanization). The objective of this study was to determine the effects of past mechanized infantry training on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem properties on Fort Riley Military Reservation in northeastern Kansas. We used a long-term data set and supplemental study plots to determine the effects of military training use on terrestrial systems. Headwater and middle stream reaches were also sampled to determine the effects of watershed training use on habitat and fish community structure. High military training use was associated with increased bare soil, reduced total plant cover, and compositional shifts in plant communities. Reduced cover of perennial, matrix-forming grasses and native species, and increased cover of annuals and introduced species were also associated with high training activity. High military training use in study watersheds was associated with increased sediment in pools and riffles and reduced abundance of benthic insectivores, herbivore-detritivores, and silt-intolerant species. Sites in watersheds receiving high training use were also characterized by an abundance of trophic generalists and tolerant species. Our results suggest that military training activities had significant ecological effects on the properties of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, both with respect to recovery from past disturbance and resilience to future disturbance.\n      </p>", "This paper highlights the methodologies, organizations, and applications of military operations research in practice as evidenced by presentations at ORSA/TIMS meetings over the last seven and a half years.

The model routes cargo and passengers through a specified transportation network with a given fleet of aircraft subject to many physical and policy constraints. The time-dynamic model captures a significant number of the important aspects of an airlift system in a large-scale military deployment, including aerial refueling, tactical (intracontinental) aircraft shuttles, and constraints based on crew availability. The model is designed to provide insight into issues associated with designing and operating an airlift system. We describe analyses for the U.S. Air Force system concerning fleet modernization and concerning the allocation of resources that affect the processing capacity of airfields.\n      </p>", "The Sereer-Saf\u00e8n are a minority population in a predominantly Wolof and Muslim region. During the colonial period the Saf\u00e8n were ruled by Wolof chiefs, who treated them as a conquered population. Until the First World War, Saf\u00e8n resistance was based on preserving a separate religious and ethnic identity, symbolized by the village shrine and matrilineal descent. Conversion to Islam had its roots in the crisis created by military recruitment. When the Saf\u00e8n were forced to give soldiers to the French, 'maternal uncles' used their authority over their 'nephews' to recruit soldiers. Today this act is remembered as a 'betrayal' that called into question the legitimacy of the matrilineal system of labor and inheritance. Conversion to Islam has been studied by focusing on long-term Islamization rather than the moment of conversion. Oral testimony from converts emphasizes changes in behavior, funeral rites, inheritance and patterns of labor and power in the village community.\n      </p>", "One compelling aspect of U.S. foreign policy during the cold war was the propensity of policy makers to seek harmony between the pursuit of security objectives and a stated American belief in enduring values of peace and justice. One need look no further than campaign monikers such as \"Operation Just Cause\" and \"Operation Restore Hope\" or declarations of the existence of an \"axis of evil\" for more recent anecdotal evidence of the moral justifications for U.S. military actions. The question of whether this \"rhetoric of justice,\" which has been pressed into service as a public rationale for U.S. military intervention, might consist of more than mere rhetoric is addressed. The historically grounded, yet timely, theory of the \"just war\" is applied to a set of U.S. military intervention decisions to assess conditions in which considerations of justice may have driven U.S. decisions to employ military force in international crisis.\n      </p>", "This study evaluates the characteristics of the men who served in the volunteer military in combat occupations. It examines whether these characteristics stem from supply-side or demand-side decisions, or reflect class bias. The findings suggest that, on the supply side, men who had greater academic abilities were more likely to go to college, thereby avoiding military service and the possibility of serving in a combat occupation. On the demand side, the armed forces were more likely to exclude men with lower academic abilities but were more likely to assign such men in the military to combat occupations. Net of the impacts of these supply-side and demand-side decisions, men who served in combat occupations still differed from those who did not in terms of their family background. The impact of family background was stronger on entering the military than on being assigned to combat occupations once in the military.\n      </p>", "We provide a summary of the limited research on three uniquely stressful experiences of military families: relocation, separation, and reunion.

None of the former and only one of the latter (0.07%) resulted seropositive on repeated ELISA and Western-blot. For comparison we also report the results of routine anti-HIV antibody testing in our diagnostic laboratory: the highest proportion of seropositive subjects was found among symptomatic patients (79%), followed by haemophiliac patients (31%), drug addicts (24%), sexual partners of seropositive subjects (21%), prisoners (5%) and homosexual men (5%). Health care personnel and prison guards were all negative. These data confirm that in Italy HIV infection is still relatively confined to the classic risk groups. While generalized screening during military service seems to be excessive, periodic sample surveys could be very useful to follow the evolution of HIV epidemiology.\n      </p>", "This paper is concerned with the study of force deployment in a conventional theatre-level military engagement. First, it discusses some of the governing parameters that affect the modelling. A non-linear programming model is then developed to describe the combat dynamics. Sensitivity analysis on the optimal solution is also discussed. The merit of the model is demonstrated by applying the formulation to study the effect of various sustainment policies on the outcome of a battle.\n      </p>", "During January 1986-September 1988 we studied the behavioral responses of 71 radiocollared mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) to military activity on the Pi\u00f1on Canyon Maneuver Site in southeastern Colorado. Military training was initiated on the site during August 1985 and recurred about 3 times yearly for periods of one month. During a maneuver, 3/7 of the site was used for training in accordance with a rotational land use schedule. During the nonsummer seasons, female seasonal convex polygon and harmonic mean home ranges were larger in maneuver and previous-maneuver areas than nonmaneuver areas (P &lt; 0.002). During summer, female convex polygon home ranges were larger in maneuver than nonmaneuver areas (P = 0.066). Fawn summer home ranges were larger in maneuver than previous-maneuver areas (P &lt; 0.01). Male home range sizes differed only for 50% harmonic mean transformation annual home ranges (P = 0.056); bucks in maneuver areas had larger home ranges than in nonmaneuver areas. Female deer in maneuver areas exhibited significant home area shifts (P = 0.049) between premaneuver and maneuver periods more frequently (40.0%) than did deer in nonmaneuver (control) areas (12.5%). Mule deer in military training areas may have responded to human harassment, alteration of security cover, or destruction of the forage base. We suggest that deer may respond more intensely to unpredictable than predictable human activity.\n      </p>", "UK military satellite communications systems are currently provided by the Skynet programme. The current generation is collectively known as Skynet 4, and is due to be replaced from 2003 by the next generation. CDA has been asked to conduct an operational research study to review the potential communications requirements of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) in the period 2003-2013, and assess what contribution could be made to them by the proposed future military satellite communications system. This paper discusses some of the political and technical issues surrounding the work carried out. Technically, the study looked at the dynamic loading of five different satellite options in three scenarios set in 2010. Each combination of scenario and satellite was modelled, and the results produced in terms of the chosen measures of effectiveness. The sensitivity of these results to various assumptions was tested to determine the robustness of the results. The scenarios included land, air and maritime operations. In an area where little or no analysis had previously been attempted (at least in the military context) in the UK, this `intervention' succeeded in clarifying the main issues, and setting a course for future work.\n      </p>", "The Military Airlift Command (MAC) is responsible for planning the allocation of airlift resources for moving cargo and passengers during peacetime and in crisis situations. The airlift-planning heuristic is a candidate for incorporation in the Airlift Deployment Analysis System, an interactive data-base environment. It was developed for the US Air Force under a subcontract with Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The heuristic is fast and flexible, incorporating all significant constraints for both deliberate (peacetime) and execution (crisis) planning. Because of its speed and detail, MAC will be able to evaluate many options quickly when performing deliberate planning. With its interactive data-base structure and ability to interrupt and restore a problem at any time in the analysis, MAC can be very responsive in execution planning.\n      </p>", "Execution planning at the military airlift command of the US Air Force involves updating the routes and schedules of aircraft to reflect changing requirements for moving freight and personnel and changing airlift resources. The problem can be characterized as a pickup and delivery problem with time windows and node capacities. The constraints on the capacities of the nodes (airfields) limit the rate at which the aircraft can be serviced and the amount of requirements (tonnage of cargo, number of passengers) that can be loaded and unloaded at an airfield per day. The execution planning algorithm described can be used daily to modify the existing airlift operations plan. An algorithm based on the insertion heuristic was selected for implementation due to its computational feasibility and its capability to absorb complex constraints arising in the execution planning problem. The insertion heuristic has the additional desirable feature of keeping intact as much of the existing schedule as possible.\n      </p>", "The primary functions of military training areas is to support military missions; however, management of natural resources that is compatible with that function has become a focal issue on many military installations. We investigated the relationship between black bear (Ursus americanus) habitat use and weapons-firing exercises at 3 spatial scales on the western portion of U.S. Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune (Camp Lejeune), North Carolina. In 2000 and 2001, we collected 1,494 telemetry locations for 14 bears (6 males, 8 females). We used spatial contours of human auditory disturbance levels based on the noise generated from firing activities to establish high-, medium-, and low-disturbance noise zones for each firing range. We used the multinomial logit form of discrete choice analysis to examine whether bears exhibited a spatial (i.e., general avoidance of areas associated with military activity) or temporal resonse (i.e., avoidance of military training areas but only when firing exercises occurred). Except for small areas near the firing positions, differences in bear use among the 3 noise zone areas was mostly a function of the prevalence of selected vegetation types and not a response to military activity. Our temporal anaysis further suggested that bears did not respond to weapons exercises; the distance of bears to the nearest high-disturbance noise zone was not associated with the occurrence of weapons exercises.\n      </p>", "This article explores the nature and evolution of government-military relations in Chile since democratic restoration in 1990. Its highlights both the attempts by the Concertaci\u00f3n governments to reinstate civilian control on the armed forces, as well as the mechanisms used by the military establishment to resist it. Special attention is given to two particular actors of the Chilean democratic transition who have played a critical role in the evolution of government-military relations in the post-authoritarian period: the civilian Right and the Judiciary. As this article aims to show, the strength of the Chilean right has constantly represented a formidable barrier for the Concertaci\u00f3n governments in attempts to introduce the legal reforms required to re-establish civilian supremacy over the military. Furthermore, legal decisions adopted by the Chilean judiciary on human rights-related cases have also played a crucial role in the evolution of government-military relations during the past decade.\n      </p>", "The Fortymile Caribou Herd (FCH) is the most prominent caribou herd in interior Alaska. A large portion of the FCH calving and summer range lies beneath heavily used Military Operations Areas (MOA) that are important for flight training. We observed the behavior of Grant's cow caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti) and their calves before, during, and immediately following low-level military jet overflights. We also monitored movements of radiocollared cow caribou and survival of their calves. We conducted fieldwork from mid May through early June 2002. We concluded that military jet overflights did not cause deaths of caribou calves in the FCH during the calving period nor result in increased movements of cow-calf pairs over the 24-hour period following exposure to overflights. Short-term responses to overflights were generally mild in comparison to caribou reactions to predators or perceived predators. Caribou responses to overflights were variable, but responses were generally greater as slant distances decrease4d and jet speeds increased. A-10 jets caused less reaction than F-15s and F-16s. Although we found that short-term reactions of caribou to jet overflights were mild, we advise against assuming there are no long-term effects on calving caribou from jet overflights.\n      </p>", "The war in Iraq has spanned the full spectrum of military operations: intense combat, stability-and-support operations, and peacetime activities. Regardless of their nature and relative intensity, military operations are shaped by the characteristics of the military operating environment. Consequently, the scale, tempo, and complexity of any type of military endeavor are linked to the physical and cultural landscapes of the region in which it is conducted. Military geographers use geographical information, tools, and techniques to examine those links. Iraq's operating environment is studied to identify the relevant components of its physical and human geography. This military geographical examination of Iraq tells us a great deal about how the physical and cultural environment have influenced the war, as well as how the complexity of its human landscape continues to affect the postwar rebuilding of the country.\n      </p>", "Our objectives in this study were to determine whether military activities (e.g., overflight noise, noise from ordnance delivery, ground-based human activity) on the Barry M. Goldwater Range (BMGR) affect the behavior and hearing of Sonoran pronghorn (Antilocapra americana sonoriensis). We contrasted the behavior of pronghorn on BMGR with the closest population of pronghorn in the United States that was not subjected to routine military activity (i.e., on the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge [BANWR], Arizona). Forty percent of the landscape used by the endangered Sonoran pronghorn in the United States is within the &lt;tex-math&gt;$5,739\\ {\\rm km}^{2}$&lt;/tex-math&gt; BMGR, a bombing and gunnery facility in southwestern Arizona. The range of Sonoran pronghorn covers about 88% of BMGR. The 179 Sonoran pronghorn that lived in the United States in December 1992 declined to 99 by December 2000. The Sonoran pronghorn has been listed as endangered for &gt;30 years, but population limiting factors are unknown. Because Sonoran pronghorn use BMGR, land and wildlife managers raised concerns about the potential effects of military activities on the population. Possible indirect effects of military activities on Sonoran pronghorn, aside from direct mortality or injury, from ordnance delivery, chaff, flares, live ammunition, aircraft mishaps, interference from ground vehicles and personnel, include alteration of behavior or physiology. We conducted the study on the North and South Tactical Ranges (NTAC and STAC), BMGR, from February 1998 to June 2000. Hearing exams were conducted in Camp Verde, Arizona, the University of Arizona, and on the East Tactical Range (ETAC), BMGR. Interactions between pronghorn and military activity were restricted to 4 observation points that provided viewing areas from which pronghorn and military activity could be observed from \u226410 km. We systematically located pronghorn with spotting scopes and telemetry. When located, we described their behavior and military activity using scan sampling. We tested hearing using auditory brainstem responses (ABR). We could not test the hearing of Sonoran pronghorn because of their endangered status, so we contrasted hearing of pronghorn near Camp Verde, Arizona, and desert mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus eremicus) that were and were not exposed to sound pressure levels from military activity. We recorded behavior observations of Sonoran pronghorn on 172 days (44,375 observation events [i.e., 1 observation/30 second]) over 373 hours. These data were compared with 93 days of behavioral data (24,297 observation events) over 202 hours for pronghorn not regularly influenced by military aircraft. Overall, we did not detect behavioral differences (i.e., time spent bedding, standing, foraging, traveling) between males and females. Pronghorn exposed to military activity, and those that were not, bedded the same amount of time. Pronghorn at BMGR foraged less and stood and traveled more than pronghorn not exposed to military activity. These trends were the same with and without anthropogenic activity. Only 7.3% of behavioral events occurred with identifiable stimuli. Military overflights occurred 363 times (0.8%) and non-military overflights occurred 77 times (&lt;0.2%). Pronghorn rarely responded to military aircraft, but often moved &gt;10 m when ground stimuli were present. Ambient noise levels ranged up to 123.1 decibels (dB). The average sound pressure level on days with military activity was 65.3 dB compared to 35.0 dB without military activity. Because we obtained hearing tests from deer and pronghorn, we were able to develop an ungulate weighting filter on the noise generated from overflights of A-10 and F-16 aircraft. Desert ungulates do not hear sound pressure levels generated from these aircraft as well as humans do (i.e., 14-19 dB lower). The military activity we examined had only marginal influence on Sonoran pronghorn. Pronghorn used the ranges shared with the military throughout the year and behavioral patterns of pronghorn were similar with and without the presence of military stimuli. Furthermore, pronghorn behavior exposed to military activity was similar to behaviors of pronghorn not exposed to regular military activity. The auditory characteristics of pronghorn were similar for those that have and have not been exposed to military activity. The population of Sonoran pronghorn in the United States continues to decline and is in serious danger of extirpation. Clearly, additional work needs to be done, but military activity as measured herein is not a limiting factor. /// Los objetivos de este estudio fueron determinar si las actividades militares (ruidos por sobrevuelo, de suministro de artiller\u00eda, y de actividades humanas de la base de tierra) del Campo militar Barry M. Goldwater Range (BMGR) afecta el comportamiento y audici\u00f3n de la cabra Sonorense (Antilocapra americana sonoriensis). Comparamos el comportamiento de la cabra de Sonorense en BMGR con la poblaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s cerca de la cabra de Sonorense en los Estados Unidos que no estaba sujeta a la actividad de la rutina militar (en el refugio nacional de vida silvestre Buenos Aires en Arizona [BANWR]). Cuarenta por ciento del territorio usado por la cabra Sonorense en peligro de extinci\u00f3n en los Estados Unidos esta dentro de los &lt;tex-math&gt;$5,739\\ {\\rm km}^{2}$&lt;/tex-math&gt; del BMGR, que es una facilidad militar de pr\u00e1ctica de tiro y bombardeo en el suroeste de Arizona. El territorio de la cabra de Sonorense cubre alrededor del 88% del BMGR. De 179 cabras Sonorenses que se encontraban en los Estados Unidos en Diciembre de 1992 declinaron a 99 para Diciembre del 2000. La cabra Sonorense ha sido enlistado como una especie en peligro de extinci\u00f3n por &gt;30 a\u00f1os, pero los factores limitantes de la poblaci\u00f3n son aun desconocidos. Debido a que la cabra Sonorense usa el campo militar BMGR, los encargados de vida silvestre y de su manejo ten\u00edan preocupaci\u00f3n acerca del efecto potencial de las actividades militares en su poblaci\u00f3n. Posibles efectos indirectos de actividades militares en la cabra Sonorense, aparte de la mortalidad o da\u00f1os por la ca\u00edda de artiller\u00eda, material militar abandonado, luces de bengala, uso de municiones, percances de aviones, interferencia con veh\u00edculos y personal de tierra quer\u00edan ser estudiados debido a incluyen alteraciones de comportamiento o de su fisiol\u00f3gicas. Condujimos el estudio en los terrenos de pr\u00e1cticas Norte y Sur (NTAC y STAC) del campo militar BMGR de Febrero 1998 a Junio 2000. Ex\u00e1menes de audici\u00f3n fueron conducidos en el Camp Verde, Arizona, la Universidad de Arizona y en el Terreno de Pr\u00e1ctica Este (ETAC) del BMGR. Las interacciones de la cabra Sonorense y las actividades militares se estudiaron en 4 puntos de observaci\u00f3n que proveyeron \u00e1reas en la cual la cabra y las actividades militares pod\u00edan ser observadas a 10 Km. o menos de distancia. Las cabras Sonorenses se localizaron sistem\u00e1ticamente con telemetr\u00eda y con telescopios puntuales. Una vez localizadas se describi\u00f3 su comportamiento y la actividad militar usando muestreos de exploraci\u00f3n \"scan samplings\". La audici\u00f3n se examino usando respuestas auditivas del tallo cerebral (ABR, auditory brainstream responses). No se pudo examinar la audici\u00f3n de la cabra Sonorense porque es una especie en peligro de extinci\u00f3n, as\u00ed que la audici\u00f3n se contrasto con audiciones de cabras cerca de Camp Verde, Arizona, y con venado del desierto (Odocoileus hemionus eremicus) que fueron no expuestos y expuestos a niveles de presi\u00f3n de ruido provenientes de la actividad militar. Las observaciones del comportamiento de la cabra sonorense fueron gravadas por 172 d\u00edas (44,375 eventos observados [1 observaci\u00f3n/30 segundos] en 373 horas). Esos datos fueron comparados con 93 d\u00edas de datos de comportamiento (24,297 eventos observados) con 202 horas para cabras no influenciadas regularmente por vuelos militares. En general no se detecto diferencias de comportamiento [como tiempo usado para dormir, descansar, forrajear, viajar] entre hembras y machos. Las cabras expuestas a la actividad militar, y esas que no lo estuvieron durmieron la misma cantidad de tiempo. Las cabras en el BMGR forrajearon menos y estuvieron paradas y viajando m\u00e1s que las cabras no expuestos a la actividad militar. Esas tendencias fueron las mismas con y sin actividades antropog\u00e9nicas. Solo 7.3% del comportamiento ocurri\u00f3 con est\u00edmulos identificables. Los sobrevuelos militares ocurrieron 363 veces (0.8%) y los no militares ocurrieron 77 veces (&lt;0.2%). La cabra raramente respondi\u00f3 a vuelos militares, pero se movi\u00f3 frecuentemente &gt;10 m cuando el estimulo terrestre estuvo presente. Los niveles de ruido del ambiente tuvieron rangos de 123.1 decibeles (dB). La media del nivel de presi\u00f3n del sonido en d\u00edas con actividad militar fue de 65.3 dB comparada con 35 dB sin la actividad militar. Los an\u00e1lisis auditivos de venados y de cabras nos permitieron desarrollar un coeficiente del sonido filtrado (ungulate weigting filter) por los ungulados con respecto al ruido generado de los sobrevuelo de aviones A-10 y F-16. Los ungulados del desierto no escuchan los niveles de presi\u00f3n del sonido generados por aviones como los humanos lo hacen (dB 14-19 mas bajo). La actividad militar que examinamos tuvo solo influencia marginal en la cabra Sonorense. Las cabras utilizan terrenos compartidos con los militares a trav\u00e9s del a\u00f1o y los patrones de comportamiento de las cabras fueron similar con y sin la presencia del estimulo militar. Adem\u00e1s, el comportamiento de las cabras expuestas a la actividad militar fue similar al comportamiento de cabras no expuestas a actividades militares regularmente. Las caracter\u00edsticas auditivas de las cabras fueron similares para esas que estaban expuestas y no a la actividad militar regular. La poblaci\u00f3n de cabras Sonorenses en los Estados Unidos continua declinando y esta en serio peligro de extinci\u00f3n. Claramente, se necesita hacer trabajo adicional, pero la actividad militar como se midi\u00f3 en este trabajo no es un factor limitante. /// Nos objectifs dans cette \u00e9taient de d\u00e9terminer si les activit\u00e9s militaires (ex. le bruit du trafic a\u00e9rien, le bruit caus\u00e9 par la d\u00e9livrance de l'ordonnance, l'activit\u00e9 humain au sol) dans la Cha\u00eene de Barry M.

Nous avons syst\u00e9matiquement localis\u00e9 l'antilope d'Am\u00e9rique avec un t\u00e9l\u00e9m\u00e8tre dans des endroits fixes. Au cas de localisation, nous avons d\u00e9crit leur comportement et l'activit\u00e9 militaire utilisant des models au scanner. Nous avons test\u00e9 son ou\u00efe utilisant les r\u00e9ponses brainstem et auditives (auditory brainstem responses, ABR). Puisque nous n'avons pas pu tester l'ou\u00efe de l'antilope d'Am\u00e9rique de Sonora, \u00e0 cause de leur statut d'esp\u00e8ce en vue de disparition, nous avons examin\u00e9 et compar\u00e9 son ou\u00efe pr\u00e8s de Campe Verde, Arizona, avec l'ou\u00efe du cerf mulet du d\u00e9sert (Odocoileus hemionus eremicus) qui \u00e9taient et qui n'\u00e9taient pas expos\u00e9s aux niveaux de pression de bruit caus\u00e9 par l'activit\u00e9 militaire. Nous avons enregistr\u00e9 les observations du comportement de l'antilope de Sonora pendant une dur\u00e9e de 172 jours (44,375 \u00e9v\u00e9nements d'observation [ex., 1 observation/30 seconds]) pendant 373 heures. Cette information est compar\u00e9e avec l'observation de 93 jours (24,297 \u00e9v\u00e9nements d'observation) pendant 202 heures pour l'antilope d'Am\u00e9rique qui n'\u00e9tait pas influenc\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement par l'activit\u00e9 militaire. En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral nous n'avons pas remarqu\u00e9 des diff\u00e9rences de comportement (ex, le temps pass\u00e9 \u00e0 dormir, rester debout, fourrager, marcher) entre les males et les femelles. Les antilopes d'Am\u00e9rique expos\u00e9s \u00e0 l'activit\u00e9 militaire et celles qui n'\u00e9taient pas, passaient \u00e0 dormir la m\u00eame dur\u00e9e de temps. Les antilopes d'Am\u00e9rique dans CBMG fourrageaient moins mais restaient et marchaient plus de temps debout, si on les comparaient avec les antilopes d'Am\u00e9rique qui n'\u00e9taient pas expos\u00e9es \u00e0 l'activit\u00e9 militaire. Ces tendances \u00e9taient similaires avec ou sans l'activit\u00e9 anthropique. Seulement 7.3% des \u00e9v\u00e9nements de comportement sont produits sans un stimulus identifiable. L'activit\u00e9 militaire a\u00e9rienne a eu lieu 363 fois (0.8%) et l'activit\u00e9 a\u00e9rienne non militaire a eu lieu 77 fois (&lt;0.2%). L'antilope d Am\u00e9rique a rarement r\u00e9agi \u00e0 l'activit\u00e9 militaire, mais souvent a boug\u00e9 &gt;10m quand le stimulus au sol \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent. Les niveaux de bruit d'ambiance montaient \u00e0 123.1 d\u00e9cibels (dB). Le moyen de la pression du bruit pendant les jours d'activit\u00e9 militaire \u00e9tait 65.3 dB compar\u00e9 avec 35.0 dB pendant les jours sans activit\u00e9 militaire. Puisque nous avons examin\u00e9 et obtenu des tests d'ou\u00efe du cerf et de l'antilope d'Am\u00e9rique, nous \u00e9tions capable de d\u00e9velopper un filtre ongul\u00e9 de pond\u00e9ration dans le bruit produit par ces activit\u00e9s d'avion ou humain (ex., 14-19 dB plus bas). L'activit\u00e9 militaire qu'on a examin\u00e9e a eu une influence marginale sur l'antilope d'Am\u00e9rique. L'antilope d'Am\u00e9rique a utilis\u00e9 les cha\u00eenes de montagnes, les partageant avec les militaires durant toute l'ann\u00e9e et les r\u00e9actions de son comportement \u00e9taient similaires avec ou sans la pr\u00e9sence du stimulus militaire. En plus, le comportement de l'antilope d'Am\u00e9rique expos\u00e9 \u00e0 l'activit\u00e9 militaire \u00e9tait similaire avec le comportement de l'antilope d'Am\u00e9rique pas expos\u00e9 \u00e0 l'activit\u00e9 militaire r\u00e9guli\u00e8re. Les caract\u00e9ristiques auditives de l'antilope d'Am\u00e9rique \u00e9taient les m\u00eames pour celles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9s ou qui n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9s expos\u00e9es \u00e0 l'activit\u00e9 militaire. La population de l'antilope d'Am\u00e9rique de Sonora dans les Etats-Unis continue d'abaisser et se trouve dans un grand danger d'extirpation. C'est \u00e9vident qu'il faut mener plus de recherche mais l'activit\u00e9 militaire comme mesur\u00e9e ci-dessus, ce n'est pas un facteur limit\u00e9.\n      </p>", "Why are democracies unusually successful in war? We find that superior human capital, harmonious civil-military relations, and Western cultural background are largely responsible. These traits correlate positively with democracy, and account for democracy's apparent effectiveness bonus. This is either good news or bad news for democratic effectiveness theorists. Many believe that democracy causes these traits. If so, our findings strengthen democratic effectiveness theory by explicating its causal mechanism. But others see democracy as a consequence rather than a cause of such traits. If so, our findings challenge the thesis by identifying alternative causes of the effectiveness bonus previously attributed to democracy. Either way, the results show a powerful effect for unit level variables in military performance. In the process, these same results sharpen our understanding of military effectiveness in general, and the relationship between military performance and regime type in particular.\n      </p>", "Objective: To determine if premature discharge from the US Air Force was associated with the smoking status of recruits. Design and setting: A total of 29 044 US Air Force personnel recruited from August 1995 to August 1996 were administered baseline behavioural risk assessment surveys during basic military training. They were tracked over a 12 month period to determine those who were prematurely discharged. Main outcome measures: Excess training costs as a result of premature discharge. Results: In this 12 month period, 14.0% of those entering the US Air Force were discharged at a one year follow up. In both univariate and multivariate models, the best single predictor of early discharge was smoking status. Overall, 11.8% of non-smokers versus 19.4% of smokers were prematurely discharged (relative risk 1.795). Conclusions: Using US Department of Defense data on the cost of military training, recruits who smoke in the US Air Force are associated with $18 million per year in excess training costs. Applied to all service branches, smoking status, which represents a constellation of underlying behaviours and attitudes that can contribute to early discharge, is associated with over $130 million per year in excess training costs.\n      </p>", "In this essay, I argue that institutions in military regimes have a significant impact not only on regime durability, but also on the level of control the military is likely to exert when it withdraws from rule. Borrowing from a typology of military regimes developed by Karen Remmer, I note how the feudal regime engenders a level of investment that drives it to remain in office despite the inability of this institutional arrangement to contain politicisation in the armed forces. The obstinacy of the feudal regime thus inevitably leads it toward collapse. The argument is tested with a detailed case study of the Proceso regime in Argentina.\n      </p>", "In a major Air Force study of future space systems, SPACE-CAST 2020, study teams produced a set of system concepts for 21st century military space operations. Our goal was to assess the potential operational utility of these systems in an objective, traceable, and robust manner, so that we could compare the systems and identify the most important. An additional goal was to determine the technologies whose advancement will do the most to make the high-priority systems a reality. To do this, we developed a hierarchical value model based on Department of Defense policy documents and the operational judgments of Air University faculty and students (senior and mid-level managers who will be future Air Force leaders). We completed the study within an extremely tight deadline, and it was widely accepted within the Air Force.\n      </p>", "We discuss firstly the problem of military decision, in the context of the more general development of ideas in the representation of decision making. Within this context, we have considered a mathematical model-Bayesian Decision-of decision making and military command. Previous work has been extended, and applied to this problem. A distribution of belief in outcome, given that a decision is made, and a Loss function-a measure of the effect of this outcome relative to a goal-are formed. The Bayes' Decision is the decision which globally minimises the resultant bimodal (or worse) Expected Loss function. The set of all minimising decisions corresponds to the surface of an elementary Catastrophe. This allows smooth parameter changes to lead to a discontinuous change in the Bayes' decision. In future work this approach will be used to help develop a number of hypotheses concerning command processes and military headquarters structure. It will also be used to help capture such command and control processes in simulation modelling of future defence capability and force structure.\n      </p>", "Are bureaucracies in fact controlled by the president, Congress, or legislation? We analyze a 1998 policy change in the Department of Defense's (DoD) $6.5 billion annual military housing allowance program. Results show that both the president and Congress were able to influence the bureaucracy, even in the presence of an exceedingly specific law that outlined the manner in which the DoD was to allocate the funds. After policy implementation, allowances were disproportionately higher in locations that (a) supported the president in the 1996 election and (b) were represented by members of the House or Senate Armed Services Committees.\n      </p>", "Corporations, nongovernmental organizations, and other organizational forms are major players in the social world. Recently, sociological scholarship on organizations has converged with research on the professions to discuss the ways in which professions are shaped or influenced by different organizational forms. In this article, I borrow from the notion of framing within social movement research to argue that organizational forms frame the bids of aspiring professionals. More specifically, I argue that certain organizational forms\u2014such as that of the modern corporation\u2014can aid would-be professionals in making their claims for professional recognition. Organizations do this, I argue, by providing aspiring professionals with a ready-made setting, rationale, and guarantees that make the newcomers more easily recognizable as professionals to outside audiences. I explore this argument by examining how the corporate form has facilitated private military contractors in their attempts to legitimate and develop this highly controversial new industry. The data are drawn from my interviews with private military contractors, state officials, and other interested parties surrounding private military corporations, as well as from archival data that detail the rise of the private military industry.\n      </p>", "This study used structural equation modeling to examine a strengths-based, community practice model to explore the relationship between formal and informal community-based social networks and family adaptation in military communities. \"Sense of community\" was examined as a critical mediating variable. Results provide support for the practice model. Several important insights were revealed about the strength and nature of pathways between components in the model. Results suggest that communities (including the workplace) can be important sources of tangible information and expressive support. Other important implications for community practice and research are discussed.\n      </p>", "The Military Airlift Command of the United States Air Force is responsible for evaluating the ability of the air force to move cargo and passengers during contingency situations (\"deliberate planning\"). This requires that aircraft be assigned to loads and scheduled. While most analyses have addressed aircraft assignment as a plane minimization problem because of constraints on the available airlift capacity, we addressed the problem as an aircraft load maximization problem. Our algorithm seeks to utilize each aircraft more fully. We compare this approach with a previous procedure.\n      </p>", "In this article we analyze an annual live-fire exercise held by Japan's Self-Defense Forces for the general public. On the basis of our analysis, we suggest that anthropologists seriously examine the military establishments of technologically advanced societies. If anthropologists want to understand violent acts, we need to study the perpetrators of such acts and not only their victims. In most of the scholarly literature, violence is seen as anomalous and disruptive-as the reverse of social order. In contrast, we demonstrate how violence can also be understood as an object of fascination, enjoyment, and celebration. We show how the link between violence and the military is variously concealed, naturalized, or blurred in events such as the live-fire exercise.\n      </p>", "Thailand's current partisan turmoil is paralleling growing authoritarianism and democratic decay. This article examines contemporary Thai civil-military relations, the state of armed forces unity, and potential outcomes. It argues that amid heightened political uncertainty and diminished democracy, the only surety today is an enhanced role for Thailand's armed forces.\n      </p>", "Background: It has been suggested that exposure to radiofrequency/microwaves radiations could be associated with greater health hazards and higher mortality. Methods: The all-cause mortality of 27,671 Belgian militaries who served from 1963 until 1994 in battalions equipped with radars for anti-aircraft defence was studied over the period 1968-2003. End of the seventies, technical modifications brought to the shielding of the micro-wave generators resulted in a reduction in irradiations. A control group was formed by 16,128 militaries who served during the same period in the same military area but who were never exposed to radars. Administrative procedures for identifying militaries and their vital status were equivalent in the radar and the control groups. Results: The age-standardized mortality ratio (SMR) in the radar battalions was 1.05 (95% CI: 0.95-1.16) in professional militaries, and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.75-0.85) in conscripts. In professional militaries no difference in mortality was found according to duration (less than, or five years or more) or to period of service (before 1978 or after 1977). Conclusions: During a 40-year period of observation, we found no increase in all-cause mortality in Belgian militaries who were in close contact with radar equipments of anti-aircraft defence battalions.\n      </p>", "All three branches of the Indian armed forces have recently articulated the need to operate beyond the country's immediate borders. While the Indian military is highly unlikely to achieve its more ambitious power projection objectives in the medium term, the conventional wisdom that India's traditional foreign-policy orientation precludes military power projection is untenable, especially for an aspiring regional hegemon.\n      </p>", "Some 30 years ago, O. G. Haywood, Jr. published a pioneering paper relating game theory considerations to historical cases of World War II (\"Military Decision and Game Theory\"). The paper has become one of the most cited in military operations research literature.

Using event-history data from a 13-year panel study of 2,857 White males from Washington State high schools in 1966, we found that Vietnam combat veterans (n = 610) and Vietnam-era veterans (n = 581) married at the same rate as nonveterans (n = 1,666). Marriages initiated before or during military service in Vietnam did not have a significant negative impact on long-term marital stability. Marrying for the first time after military service, however, increased marital stability.\n      </p>", "This article examines the implications of mandatory conscription for women by studying the experience of women soldiers who serve as secretaries in the Israeli military. The author argues that the military service of the secretaries is shaped by three organizing principles: an employment principle of cheap labor, a matrimonial principle of the office wife, and a hierarchy principle that shapes the secretaries as status symbols. Employing the theory of gendered organizations, the author maintains that each one of these organizing principles operates as a gendering and a power mechanism. The convergence of these three gender/power principles results in overgendering of these women and their military experience. This overgendering reflects gender discrimination and creates feelings of alienation and frustration. For them, military service is not an experience that articulates their citizenship or enhances feelings of national belonging but rather stands in opposition to the values and goals of the mandatory people's army by estranging them from the state and its major institution.\n      </p>", "Objective: To compare the tobacco use profile of recruits with that of military personnel on active duty to determine whether the military environment in some way induces service members to initiate tobacco use. Design and setting: Cross-sectional survey of United States armed forces active duty and recruit personnel in 1994-95. Subjects: 2711 military recruits and 4603 military personnel on active duty. Main outcome measures: Comparative cigarette smoking and smokeless tobacco use prevalence between recruits and personnel on active duty controlling for age, sex, and race. Impact of demographic factors on the odds of smoking or using smokeless tobacco. Results: Increases in tobacco use in American military personnel occurred exclusively in men. The highest tobacco use resided with white men on active duty (43% cigarette smoking; 24% smokeless tobacco use) and represents a doubling of tobacco use seen among white male recruits. Among non-white men, tobacco use increased 2-4 times between recruits and personnel on active duty. Conclusions: Efforts to reduce tobacco use by American military personnel on active duty should focus more on discouraging the initiation of tobacco use.\n      </p>", "This article argues that political learning with regard to civil-military relations in Chile has proved an obstacle to democratization. In the postauthoritarian period, both the armed forces and political parties have referred to history when considering civil-military reform, especially with regard to how to avoid a repeat of the conflict of the Unidad Popular period. Meanwhile, the military also utilizes the Spanish example when resisting changes it feels are inimical to its interests. The 'lessons' each takes from the past directly influence political strategies and the overall result is that while civilian rule continues, democratic civil-military relations are not necessarily advanced.\n      </p>", "Prior studies usually \"guesstimated\" the extent of the Vietnamese population's involvement in the armed forces during the Vietnamese War. Using a sociodemographic approach, this study analyzes innovative and regionally representative data from the Vietnam Longitudinal Survey to examine the prevalence of military experience among successive cohorts of men in the Red River Delta, and to assess how their military experiences varied across the periods of war, peace, and social change. In addition, it also addresses whether social class bias in military selection existed in northern Vietnam with respect to who was called to serve in the military.\n      </p>", "Although female employment is associated with lower levels of completed fertility in the civilian world, we find family formation rates among U.S. military women to be comparatively high. We compare enlisted women with civilian women using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (N = 3,547), the only data set to measure simultaneously the nuptiality and fertility of both populations. Using propensity score matching, we show that the fertility effect derives primarily from early marriage in the military, a surprisingly \"family-friendly\" institution. This shows that specific organizational and economic incentives in a working environment may offset the more widespread contemporary social and economic factors that otherwise depress marriage and fertility.\n      </p>", "Black bears (Ursus americanus) at Camp Ripley Military Reservation in central Minnesota regularly sought out, obtained, and consumed pre-packaged military foods, known as meals-ready-to-eat (MREs), making the bears a nuisance to personnel and a hindrance to military operations. Two adult females and 3 yearling (1-year-old) offspring of 1 of these females were responsible for most nuisance activity in the reserve. These bears were habituated to humans, enabling us to closely observe them and conduct taste-aversion experiments designed to reduce their attraction to MREs. Each of the 5 bears was given MREs containing thiabendazole (72-165 mg/kg bear). The bears eagerly consumed treatment baits, resulting in illness &lt;90 minutes later. During the next 122 days, we conducted trials to test the response of these bears to MREs. They ignored 6 (15%), approached but did not taste 12 (29%), tasted but did not consume 14 (34%), partially consumed 9 (22%), and did not totally consume any of the 41 MREs that we offered. The bears rejected MREs even if they were not the same type of meal that was used in the treatment, but they continued to consume non-MRE foods (7/9=78%). Post-treatment avoidance of MREs also was unrelated to our method of presentation of the meal and presence or absence of thiabendazole in the food. We concluded that avoidance of MREs was from conditioned taste aversion. This aversion persisted in 2 bears that were retested &gt;1 year later, but not in a bear tested 2 years later. Taste-aversion conditioning toward a specific food or class of food that attracts bears may be an effective component of a management strategy to diminish nuisance activity, if availability of alternate human-related foods also is reduced.\n      </p>", "To provide its personnel with acceptable housing at minimum cost near military installations, the army often enters into agreements for the construction or long-term leasing of housing. The army must support these agreements with a segmented housing market analysis (SHMA). I developed the housing analysis system (HANS) to assist housing managers with the SHMA process. HANS runs on a microcomputer with very user-friendly IFPS computer programs and has automated a portion of the SHMA process. The simplified SHMA process significantly reduces training, implementation time, and personnel costs. Econometric models within HANS also address the practical and theoretical concerns of government auditing agencies.\n      </p>", "A new methodology provides military decision makers with information on the aggregate effectiveness of large-scale conventional (nonnuclear) and combined nuclear and conventional force structures against a wide range of targets. This methodology coupled a generic data base of representative targets, to which real-world targets can be mapped, with a nuclear force-exchange model that uses goal programming techniques to determine optimal allocations of weapons to targets. This methodology enabled military strategists to analyze the effectiveness of existing and proposed weapon systems against a variety of targets and to study a number of force structures constrained by proposed force reduction treaties and tight defense budgets.\n      </p>", "While there is growing concern about, and focus on, the role of dominant constructions of masculinity and male sexuality, this remains a marginalised area of research in the broader terrain of HIV research and intervention. Men are known to dominate women's sexual lives as they dictate the terms of the relationship and negotiate, for example, whether or not a condom will be used. Yet the focus of South African research has been predominantly on women. Given that constructions of masculinities and male sexuality have received relatively little attention, this focus examines -- through a case study of a young man in the military in South Africa -- how male stereotyped masculinity intersects with and facilitates unsafe sexual practices. Considering that HIV has been shown to be more rampant among soldiers than civilians around the world, and taking into account the masculinist, macho culture that prevails in military settings, a study on men in this subculture is considered a relevant one for the broader task of understanding and challenging hegemonic male sexual practices. This case study emerges out of a larger qualitative study on men in the military which explores how they construct their masculinity and how this is interwoven with their sexual practices. The case study's findings are presented to demonstrate in particular the ways in which the participant understands and makes meaning of his masculinity and sexual practices.\n      </p>", "The debate concerning the approach of the early Christians to the military can be advanced by paying attention to a genre of literature that scholars have largely ignored: the church orders. These documents-the \"Apostolic Tradition, Canons of Hippolytus, Testament of Our Lord\", and \"Apostolic Constitutions\" - are illuminating in that they deal with ethics within com- prehensive treatments of worship, catechesis and pastoral life. They also are useful in that they, as variations upon a common original, are means of monitoring change across the third and fourth centuries. This article uses the church orders to assess four elements of a \"new consensus\" (David Hunter) on Christians in the military. By and large it confirms these, but at times it alters emphases and adds nuances. It argues that: (1) the church orders viewed killing as the big problem for Christians in the legions, not idolatry; (2) the church orders confirm that the pre-Christendom church was divided on Christian participation in the legions; (3) the church or- ders provide evidence for both discontinuity and continuity on the issue across the centuries, although the deepest continuity, based on John the Baptist's \"rule\" of Luke 3.14, is between the pre-Constantinian laity and later theologians; (4) the church orders confirm a regional variation in attitude and practice. The church orders' authority in practice is never clear.\n      </p>", "Experimental work on modes of problem representation (Sylvan, Diascro, &amp; Haddad, 1996) has found that the story model of Pennington and Hastie (1986, 1988) is a helpful construct in understanding how people reach decisions when dealing with questions of foreign policy. Here, a modified version of the story model is applied to statements by military officers in the Soviet Union and in France, representing the situations they face before and after the loss of Eastern Europe and Indochina, respectively (Charlick-Paley, 1997). Both baseline stories and those after the losses of empire are examined to test the hypothesis that when a military experiences the loss of its state's empire, officers will formulate a new story that justifies the change in its status, and that this new story will motivate new patterns of civil-military relations in the post-imperial era. The hypothesis finds general support, and stories are found to be a useful vehicle in understanding differences between groups of military officers. An analysis of how officers' stories change over time yields intriguing results as to how mutable stories are and which elements of a story are most likely to change first. In particular, expansion of the level of a goal is found to be a representational response to the political stimulus of loss of empire.\n      </p>", "A unique cluster of childhood leukemia has recently occurred around the city of Fallon in Churchill County, Nevada. From 1999 to 2001, 11 cases were diagnosed in this county of 23,982 people. Exposures related to a nearby naval air station such as jet fuel or an infectious agent carried by naval aviators have been hypothesized as potential causes. The possibility that the cluster could be attributed to chance was also considered. We used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) to examine the likelihood that chance could explain this cluster. We also used SEER and California Cancer Registry data to evaluate rates of childhood leukemia in other U.S. counties with military aviation facilities. The age-standardized rate ratio (RR) in Churchill County was 12.0 [95% confidence interval (CI), 6.0-21.4; p=4.3\u00d7 10-9]. A cluster of this magnitude would be expected to occur in the United States by chance about once every 22,000 years. The age-standardized RR for the five cases diagnosed after the cluster was first reported was 11.2 (95% CI, 3.6-26.3). In contrast, the incidence rate was not increased in all other U.S. counties with military aviation bases (RR = 1.04; 95% CI, 0.97-1.12) or in the subset of rural counties with military aviation bases (RR = 0.72; 95% CI, 0.48-1.08). These findings suggest that the Churchill County cluster was unlikely due to chance, but no general increase in childhood leukemia was found in other U.S. counties with military aviation bases.\n      </p>", "Cultivation of the bodily skills required in cavalry warfare was a prominent theme in India's pre-colonial societies. Demand for these expertises enabled fighting specialists to develop an India-wide network of patronage and employment. Wrestling and its associated exercises became the indispensable accompaniment to military preparation in the early modern period. Appreciation of the wide social diffusion of these expertises also allows for a better understanding of colonial demilitarization, the displacement of important cultures of the body, as well as the loss of mobility and honorable employment. /// La formation aux arts de la guerre mont\u00e9e fut une caract\u00e9ristique dominante important dans les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s pr\u00e9coloniales de l'Inde.

Four major periods of historical change are related to variations in types of warfare and processes of political development. A theory of changing military roles in both democratic and nondemocratic societies is formulated. The militarization of modern society is seen as a result of evolutionary processes of change, rather than as a consequence of plots, cabals, coups, or a return to earlier periods of capture of the political process by military elites. Possible directions for future changes, which could modify and attenuate the power and influence of military complexes, are suggested.\n      </p>", "Parental deployment has substantial effects on the family system, among them ambiguity and uncertainty. Youth in military families are especially affected by parental deployment because their coping repertoire is only just developing; the requirements of deployment become additive to normal adolescent developmental demands. Focus groups were used to inquire about uncertainty, loss, resilience, and adjustment among youth aged 12-18 that had a parent deployed, most often to a war zone. The nature of uncertainty and ambiguous loss was explored. Response themes included overall perceptions of uncertainty and loss, boundary ambiguity, changes in mental health, and relationship conflict. These accounts suggest that ambiguous loss is a useful concept for understanding the experiences of these youth and for structuring prevention and intervention efforts.\n      </p>", "We investigated the influence of military training on the abundance and behavior of raptors at a military training area in the Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area in Idaho during the breeding seasons of 1991-1994. Raptor counts on military training ranges did not differ when we compared all training days to all non-training days. However, during one period of intensive military training in one breeding season, raptor counts were lower during training than on non-training days. During training, Northern Harriers (Circus cyaneus) did not alter their behavior on training days. In years when prey numbers were low, falcons, hawks, and eagles perched and flew at low levels less often and flew at higher altitudes more often during training than they did when training did not occur. We observed fewer prey capture attempts on ranges on days with training than on days without training. Specific types of military training activity affected counts of raptors on ranges. The lowest raptor counts were associated with firing of artillery, small arms, and main turret guns or machine guns on tanks. Raptor counts associated with tank preparation (i.e., assembling and loading ammunition), driving, laser training, and convoy traffic were similar to non-training periods. /// Durante las \u00e9pocas reproductivas de 1991 a 1994, investigamos la influencia del entrenamiento militar en la abundancia y el comportamiento de aves de rapi\u00f1a en un \u00e3rea de entrenamiento en el \u00e1rea nacional de la conservaci\u00f3n de aves de presa del Snake River, Idaho. Los conteos de aves de rapi\u00f1a en \u00e1reas militares no difirieron entre d\u00edas de entrenamiento y d\u00edas sin entrenamiento. Sin embargo, en una \u00e9poca reproductiva los conteos de rapaces fueron menores en d\u00edas de entrenamiento que en d\u00edas sin entrenamiento.

It can be viewed as a kind of bi-dimensional bin-packing problem, with heterogeneous bins and several additional constraints. We introduce two-phase methods for solving this NP-hard problem. The first phase consists in building good initial solutions, thanks to two fast algorithms: a list-based heuristic and a loading pattern generation method. Both algorithms call a constraint-based subroutine, able to determine quickly if the items already loaded can be reshuffled to accommodate a new object. The second phase improves these preliminary solutions using local search techniques.

Some scholars argue that the public holds \"prudent\" opinions regarding the use of the military\u2014supporting efforts to stop aggression but not to engage in nation building. We argue that what seems like a \"prudent\" opinion may be driven more by the White House's rhetoric.

It is particularly difficult to build a generalized model that can adequately fit each instance, generate a workload that exercises the network in a realistic way, and measure network effectiveness in terms of the operational goals. In this work, we describe our approach to building such a model for the US Marine Corps, and demonstrate the model's use by solving a particular equipment allocation problem. We combine object-oriented simulation with new concepts for workload modelling and measuring effectiveness that are based on the operational tasks the Marines perform.\n      </p>", "Objective: This study evaluates the prevalence of betel-nut chewing among military personnel stationed on Taiwan's offshore islands. Furthermore, this study examines variables to identify which may predict a greater predilection toward betel-nut chewing among the conscript population studied. Methods: A cross-sectional mass screening was conducted of compulsory military service personnel stationed on Taiwan's offshore islands between August 1 and December 31, 2001. A total of 7574 military employees were included in this survey. Information regarding betel-nut chewing habits were ascertained using a standard structured questionnaire, which including the level and duration of betel-nut chewing as well as respondents' knowledge, attitude and practices with regard to consumption of this product. Results: Conscripts were found to be less likely to chew betel-nut regularly while performing military service. There are 1535 (20.3%) of respondents reporting to habitually chew betel-nut prior to active duty shrank to 1048 (13.8%) after going on active-duty. The most reasons to chew betel-nut among the recruits after military services are curiosity (33.3%) and as a stimulant (29.8%). About 46% of military employees who currently chew betel-nut report an interest to quit in the future. The risk factors for betel-nut chewing include individual factors (e.g., age, education, knowledge, and attitude toward betel-nut chewing), lifestyle habits (e.g., cigarette smoking), and familial factors (e.g., consumption of betel-nut by parents). More interesting, the recruits had the habit of cigarette smoking associated with increase risk for betel-nut chewing (OR: 7.18; 95% CI: 5.66-9.20). Conclusions: Although the military has made considerable progress in reducing betel-nut chewing on military campuses, the prevalence of betel-nut chewing is still relatively high and, in 2001, affected about one quarter of all military personnel stationed on the abovementioned offshore islands. In future efforts to lower betel-nut consumption among high risk groups, targeting the group of conscripted military personnel described in this study should be considered.\n      </p>", "This article studies a hitherto unexplored dimension of the Chinese Civil War: the disparity between modern military technology and the conceptual and logistical capacities of the two warring sides. It argues that the advanced weaponry received by the Nationalists from their ally, the United States, as well as that of the Chinese Communist Party forces, often captured on the battlefield, proved to be a liability because the Chinese armies, burdened by insufficient logistical capability and antiquated military thinking, were unable to use the weaponry effectively. By examining the intersection of Chinese and modern Western ways of warfare and technological capacities, the article contends that the difficulties experienced by the Chinese leaders in sustaining a modern army created technophobic misperceptions that had a significant effect on their decision making. In this sense, the implication of this article transcends the history of the Chinese Civil War and solidifies often abstract discussions about \"modernity\" and \"tradition.\"\n      </p>", "The year 2007 saw a successful military campaign that led to the \u201cliberation\u201d of the Eastern Province by government security forces.

In the present paper attention is drawn to the way the emphasis shifted in the early years of the nineteenth century from charting by naval surveyors to land mapping by the Army. The need for specialized military topographical education had led to the founding of the Map Depot in 1797 in St Petersburg. The first major survey undertaken by the Depot was of the island of Corfu (1804-1806), in anticipation of further Russo-Turkish hostilities (the Third Russo-Turkish war, 1806-1812). / Cet article compl\u00e8te l'aper\u00e7u sur la production cartographique de la Marine russe d\u00e9j\u00e0 paru dans le volume 52 d'Imago Mundi (2000).

In 1999, NATO forces set up refugee camps for fleeing Kosovars, even as NATO fighter pilots attacked Yugoslavia. US planes dropped both cluster bombs and food packets in Afghanistan in 2001. As the US military finalized plans for invading Iraq, the US Agency for International Development recruited nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to work in the war zone. Despite the heated rhetoric concerning militarized charity, military and humanitarian actors offer little examination of its effects. My analysis of recent military and NGO interaction reveals three types of interaction, which I term humanitarian soldiers, aid workers as government agents, and the humanitarian placebo. I find that in the absence of adequate security, \"humanitarian soldiers\" cannot create stability or meet local humanitarian needs. Additionally, aid organizations face the reality of non-neutrality, and may be considered as de facto government agents, if they operate in close proximity to Western intervention forces.\n      </p>", "Landscape interpretation, or \"reading\" the landscape, is one of cultural geography's standard practices.

Guatemala presents a complicated postwar landscape \"text\" in which the struggle for power continues by many means and media, including how the war is portrayed on memorials, and in which the Catholic Church and the military/state are the two main competing powers.

The focus, however, is on military surprise, which is differentiated from military shock. The types, causes and categories of military surprise are also shown, in the context of the land battle, where surprise occurs in a majority of tactical actions, progressively more so at the operational level and, at the strategic level, nine out of ten wars start with surprise. It acts as a force multipler, increases the probability of success, and reduces the surpriser's casualties. Battlefield surprise is usually caused by the combatants, but can be generated by terrain and weather factors, including, inter alia, difficult terrain, direction, gradient, avalanches, earthquakes, dust, heat haze, fire, water, flooding, ice, mud, the seashore, mist, snow, wind, the sun, and weather forecasting. Analysis of 120 historical battles where environmental factors led to surprise found that in a majority of cases those factors were manmade, and many of the reminder were in any event planned for and exploited by military commanders.

They highlight changes since World War II in the role of the military in the lives of young adults, focusing especially on how the move from a conscription to an all-volunteer military has changed the way military service affects youths' approach to adult responsibilities. The authors note that today's all-volunteer military is both career-oriented and family-oriented, and they show how the material and social support the military provides to young servicemen and women promotes responsible membership in family relationships and the wider community. As a result, they argue, the transition to adulthood, including economic independence from parents, is more stable and orderly for military personnel than for their civilian peers. At the same time, they stress that serving in the military in a time of war holds dangers for young adults. The authors examine four broad areas of military service, focusing in each on how men and women in uniform today make the transition to adulthood. They begin by looking at the social characteristics of those who serve, especially at differences in access to the military and its benefits by socio-demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, race and ethnicity, social class, and sexual orientation. Military service also has important effects on family formation, including the timing of marriage and parenthood, family structure, and the influence of military culture on families. Family formation among servicemen and women, the authors observe, is earlier and more stable than among civilians of the same age. The authors then consider the educational and employment consequences of service. Finally, they scrutinize the dangers of military service during times of war and examine the physical and psychological effects of wartime military service. They also note the sexual trauma endured both by male and female military personnel and the physical and symbolic violence women can experience in a male-dominated institution. Kelty, Kleykamp, and Segal conclude by seeking policy lessons from the military's success in facilitating the transition to adulthood for young men and women in uniform.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

An important element of this representation is the rapid planning process that embodies the processing of information for situation assessment to support a course of action decision (eg in a military headquarters). The application of this work is in support of operational analysis models for defence procurement and balance of investment. This paper describes the application of non-linear multi-attribute utility theory in conflict scenarios in order to extend the representation of the rapid planning process to account for a wider set of subjective attributes of the decision-maker. The results show, through examination of experimental data, that decision-making can be modelled through a particular class of utility functions. These utilities embody a geometry which allows us to classify the types of decision being made when there are conflicting objectives and when decision-makers adopt very different and subjective appraisals of constraints and beliefs in outcome. The experimental results help to demonstrate that the subjective nature of the situation assessment, and the personality, training, experience and history of the decision-maker are central to the functional representations. This paper presents a way to capture this deeper representation of human decision-making in a way that is potentially useful for quantitative modelling using the rapid planning process as a basis.\n      </p>", "Three different regression approaches use a large database developed by the Wharton Center for Applied Research (WCAR) to study the effects of Joint versus Service Specific advertising on military recruitment. (Here 'Joint' refers to advertising designed to serve recruitment for all four services simultaneously. Service Specific refers to advertising administered separately by each of the four services.) These regression approaches and the data and models are examined with special reference to US Army recruitment. The WCAR study led to a recommendation to replace Service Specific with Joint advertising. This recommendation was called into question by the RAND Corporation in its study that used a different regression approach. A third study that combines regressions with data envelopment analysis (DEA) is presented in this paper. This study utilizes recently developed methods based on DEA which, when incorporated in the regression, make it possible to distinguish between efficient and inefficient performances. The resulting regression yields results that show Joint advertising to be not only less efficient but also to attract potential recruits from the Army to other services. Implications for further research are set forth, which can also cast light on commercial practice by regarding Joint as a type of 'category advertising' and Service Specific as a type of 'brand advertising'.\n      </p>", "The armed services must provide their personnel with acceptable housing at minimum cost within the vicinity of military installations. To achieve these housing objectives, the Department of Defense (DoD) has entered into experimental joint ventures with private developers to construct attractive housing projects on military installation property, with some of the projects reserved for military personnel. To support the analysis of the joint ventures, DoD needed a methodology that would help officials evaluate the financial feasibility and cost implications of the housing projects. A decision support system, called the Housing Revitalization Support Office System (HRSOS), was developed to provide the necessary support. This paper describes the decision support system and its underlying methodology. It outlines the process used to determine financially feasible privatized military housing initiatives, reviews the decision support system created to support the process, and describes its application at the US Department of Defense. The paper also discusses the implications for military housing management, public finance, and operations research.\n      </p>", "Several researchers have suggested that the persistently higher rate of divorce among Blacks may be due to hard-to-measure concepts such as culture or norms. To attack this problem, we use data from the NLSY-79 to examine the risk of divorce among enlisted active-duty military servicemen where economic differences and the negative effects of discrimination are minimized. Our results indicate that military service reduces the likelihood of marital dissolution among Blacks serving in the Army and that this finding is not likely the result of unobserved selectivity. We attribute the latter finding to the fact that the Army has a well-defined career ladder for Blacks that fully integrates them into leadership positions providing role models and positive work environments that reduce stress associated with discrimination and promote stable marriages.\n      </p>", "The public debate about the incorporation of women in the U. S. Armed Forces has primarily included feminist-inspired critics, who denounce the hostility toward women they perceive is promoted in the military s masculinist culture, and, alternatively, opponents of the greater inclusion of women in the military, who valorize the exclusivist masculine qualities that many feminists criticize. Although these ideological adversaries differ in their estimation of military culture, they both share -- and have reciprocally reinforced -- a view of the military as steeped in the traditions and practices of aggressive masculinity. This article shows that the prevailing view of the military as hyper-masculine is misguided. Not unhindered aggressiveness, but camaraderie, discipline, and service are the qualities instilled in soldiers. These qualities foster military effectiveness and counterbalance sexist tendencies producing a complex institutional culture congenial to women in significant respects.\n      </p>", "The nature of complex humanitarian relief, peacebuilding, and reconstruction missions increasingly forces military and civilian actors to operate in the same space at the same time thereby challenging their ability to remain impartial, neutral and independent.

We asked if current ground layer vegetation composition or stand structure (canopy openness, tree density, plus depth of the soil A layer) in 32 mixed pine-hardwood forest stands at Fort Benning, GA, reflects military use or fire frequency over the last 20 years. The 32 stands, half on sandy and half on clayey soil, were assigned to two military use categories (heavier, open to tracked vehicles, or lighter, with dismounted infantry training) and three fire frequency (# fires/20 yr) categories [low (0-2 fires), medium (3-4 fires), and high (5-6 fires)]. Ordination reflected abundance of grass and legume species, the proportion of pine in the canopy, canopy openness, and tree density and age; it revealed a relatively stronger influence of military land use and canopy composition, and weaker influence of fire frequency (over the past 20 years), on ground layer vegetation differences among the stands. Soil A-horizon depth, abundance of disturbance features, and tree density differed between lighter and heavier military use categories, but not among fire frequency categories. Our results suggest that mechanized military training has led to a loss of topsoil and convergence on abundant pines, grasses, and legumes, while a range of fire frequencies has led to an array of ground layer composition in stands with lighter military use. Under all land use scenarios examined, 70% pine canopy may be favorable for abundant grasses and legumes in ground layer vegetation.\n      </p>", "This article examines a rare instance in China's warlord period when military officers were actually held accountable for military atrocities. These atrocities occurred in 1920, when retreating Northern troops pillaged and murdered their way through three Hunan counties before being forced to surrender to a Hunan army. A popular outcry immediately arose in Hunan to punish the officers for the crimes of their troops. Responding to this pressure, a Hunan military court ultimately sentenced two commanders and several other officers to death. Nonetheless, it was only the specter of possible political disorder, as protests escalated from angry press reports and petitions into actual street demonstrations by atrocity victims, that convinced Hunan's new and relatively unstable provincial government to accede to these popular demands. The case therefore illuminates both the potential political power and limits of public opinion and popular protests in Republican China.\n      </p>", "The authors employ multiple theories within a political economy framework to examine the structural predictors of the per capita ecological footprints of nations. Engaged theories include ecological modernization, treadmill of production, treadmill of destruction, and ecologically unequal exchange. Results of cross-national panel regression models indicate that the treadmill of production in the context of economic development increases per capita footprints, which contradicts general claims of ecological modernization theory. Similarly, the treadmill of destruction in the mode of military expenditures per soldier positively affects per capita footprints. Those with relatively higher levels of exports sent to economically developed and militarily powerful nations experience suppressed consumption levels, and these effects are especially pronounced and increasingly so for less-developed countries, many of which consume resources well below globally sustainable thresholds. The latter sets of findings support key elements of ecologically unequal exchange theory. Ultimately, this research suggests that a political economy framework that considers domestic attributes and structural relationships in particular contexts is quite useful for understanding the consumption-based environmental harms of nations.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Eight percent of 1,452 eagles monitored near Muck Creek flushed during 373 firing events; 45% from ordnance explosions, 9% from automatic weapons fire, 6% from artillery impacts, 4% from mortar impacts, and 3% from small arms fire. Flushing by eagles decreased with increasing distance from firing events (16% flushed at 0.5-1.0 km, 9% at 1-2 km, 4% at 2-4 km, and &lt;1% at 4-6 km). Forty-seven percent of 919 eagles flushed in response to 48 helicopter overflights, 37% on the Nisqually River and 53% on Muck Creek. Sixty-one percent of 1,825 eagles flushed in response to 52 experimental boat disturbances on the Nisqually River. Subadults flushed more often than adults, and eagles feeding or standing on the ground flushed more often than those perching in trees. Our data suggest that ordnance explosions, low-level helicopter overflights, and boating should be restricted near eagle foraging areas.\n      </p>", "Military spending and its relationship to gross national product (GNP), GNP growth, central government expenditures (CGE), CGE growth, and external indebtedness are examined in six Southeast Asian countries: Burma, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. Military spending in the region varies widely and accounts for only a small portion of total developing country military expenditures. Similarly, the defence burden in the region varies greatly but is relatively low compared to the developing countries generally. National economies and central government expenditures in the region have grown faster than military spending. Finally, military spending has been constrained by external indebtedness in the most highly indebted countries in the region (in Indonesia military spending has been curbed by declining oil revenues as well as increased foreign borrowing).\n      </p>", "In the 1950s modernization began to be an important paradigm for Latin American development. Early modernization theory depicted the economies of Latin America as traditional and underdeveloped. The theme of technological progress runs consistently through the modernization model. The purpose of this article is to assess an important question raised by Latin American development studies: that large allocations for the military sector are conducive to economic growth in Latin America. While this modernization literature is somewhat dated, many recent quantitative studies have also shown positive economic benefits from defence spending in the Third World. The added relevance here is that our model captures technological progress. After controlling for technological progress and externalities, our analysis shows that the military portion of budgets in Latin America have actually hindered modernization. We discuss these findings in terms of regime type and levels of US military aid to the region.\n      </p>", "One dominant explanation for why crises escalate to war is based on misperception. Alternative rational explanations for why crises escalate to war are examined, including commitment problems, the cost of revealing military advantages, and a desire for greater future gains. These explanations for war argue that states are likely to prefer a military to a diplomatic solution and to mobilize their militaries to maximize a surprise attack advantage. This type of mobilization (private) is different from mobilization by states seeking a diplomatic advantage (public) because states are trying to avoid revealing information. When one state in a crisis mobilizes privately, war is more likely because one state is committed to conflict whereas the other is not receiving signals of an impending conflict. The effect of private mobilization on war is tested using the International Crisis Behavior data. The results demonstrate that private mobilization is likely to lead to war.\n      </p>", "A quantitative method of assigning leave to crew members in an operational military flying squadron has the objective of maximizing crew preferences. Manning constraints limit the number of crews on leave at one time. The assignment process is based on a point system which allows each crew to bid for the periods it prefers, with the highest bidder \"winning.\"\n      </p>", "Exploring the links between militarized socialization and social inequality in Israel, the authors aim to examine both the pattern of political socialization, which extols the role of the combat soldier as the emblem of the \"good citizen,\" and the ways by which social agents themselves respond to this socialization. Although an all-encompassing phenomenon, the authors find militarized socialization is not equally \"distributed\" or \"received.\" Rather, it reflects and reproduces the class and ethnic positions of its various recipients. Based on interviews with male soldiers in a wide range of military roles, the authors identify two types of responses to militarized socialization: (a) a dominant response of conformity and obedience, mainly expressed in the unquestioning acceptance of military service in a combat role, and (b) an ambivalent response, of simultaneous acceptance of and resistance to this ideal. In a more comparative vein, the authors argue that military service does not simply reproduce ethnic and class inequalities but rather, by molding the soldiers' conceptions of citizenship, is still a powerful mechanism of legitimizing a hegemonic militarized and class-differentiated social order.\n      </p>", "The article presents an alternative defensive structure for the United States. Operating within the ideas offered by Johan Galtung in his research on transcendence of nuclear deterrence through transarmament, a plausible course of action is outlined. The process of transarmament would provide both superpowers with the means to escape their respective nuclear-dependent military doctrines. While this paper is only a thumbnail sketch of a paradigmatic shift from offensive to defensive national perceptions, its systemic orientation does suggest that transarmament is a possible future. It is a future whereby the US can increase world stability with little risk to its own legitimate national interests. The cost is in surrendering the role of world policeman. As a process of transcending offensive foreign policies, its strength lies in an increase in citizen participation and a total rejection of offensive strategies and weapon systems. The military will be structured to include both a Civil Defense (with a non-violent functional capability) and local militia (citizen soldiers). This deepening of policy-making will reinforce the other changes necessary for a defensively oriented and invulnerable country. The former is vital for the rest of the world and the latter is necessary for the self-interests of the US.\n      </p>", "In 1981 a survey was conducted of all officers with a secondary Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) of Operations Analyst on active duty in the US Marine Corps. Its aim was to determine the usage frequency and the importance of 35 OR techniques and application areas during the officers' most recent tours of duty. The study focused on the use of operations research, but also yields insight on the use of operations researchers.\n      </p>", "Colonel Murray's thesis is that the legal profession should encourage young lawyers to make a career of military legal work.
