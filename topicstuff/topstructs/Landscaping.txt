Our present species concept and definition are being challenged by the growing amount of whole genomic information, which should allow improvements in the natural species definition. The continuous quest for an objective and stable method for sorting strains into coherent homogeneous groups is inherent to prokaryotic systematics and nomenclature. Morphological, biochemical, physiological, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic criteria have been complemented by molecular data and pragmatic, purpose built, species definitions are being replaced by more natural ones based on evolutionary insights. It is imperative to give due consideration to both fundamental and applied aspects of future species concepts and definitions. The present paper discusses the present practice in prokaryotic taxonomy of how this system developed and how it may evolve in the future.\n      </p>", "This article identifies different creative approaches to the question of the dialectic of space and place, the genius loci, in the case of the most significant symbolic locus of Western civilization, the Acropolis of Athens. It presents different schools of thought on genius loci (the spirit of the place) and considers the ways in which different readings of a particular site affect architectural creation and its evaluation. Thus what may seem a mere exercise in good taste and architectural compositional ability hides deeper issues of power relations, political and ideological symbolism, national identity, and, in this case, global and local property rights over the hub of Western civilization. These issues are joined by comparing the landscaping of the Ancient Agora by the American School of Classical Studies in Athens with the landscaping of the site connecting the Acropolis to the Philopappos Hill by the Greek architect Demetris Pikionis.\n      </p>", "Several species of prickly pear cacti are grown as ornamental plants in public, private, residential, and commercial landscapes throughout the more arid areas of Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, and Texas. Several commercial nurseries, ranging in size from small family-owned specialty operations to large diversified wholesale nurseries, produce and sell prickly pear cacti. The greatest nursery production occurs in Arizona, followed by southern California. In Arizona, there are over 40 small commercial operations in the Phoenix area alone. A survey of Arizona nurseries revealed an inventory of 550,000 prickly pear plants on hand with wholesale and retail values of $4.5 million and $9.5 million, respectively. If prickly pear cacti were lost as a viable nursery crop, small specialized nursery operations would be more likely to suffer than large diversified nurseries. /// Varias especies de c\u00e1ctus del g\u00e9nero Opuntia se usan como plantas ornamentals en la jardinizaci\u00f3n de areas p\u00fablicas, privadas, residenciales y comerciales en areas de clima seco en los estados de Arizona, California, Nevada, Nuevo Mejico y Tejas.

This enabling is undermined to some extent when touristic landscaping is understood from a phenomenological perspective and the darker side of its placelike character is illuminated. Touristic landscapes are capable of producing injurious, traumatic forms of disemplacement via their consumption-oriented spatializing of preexisting cultural places. One Philippine luxury destination, Pearl Farm Beach Resort, a target of locational violence in 2001, illustrates how the landscaping of tourist destinations can serve to embed and to signify potential sources of locational violence.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Motorway embankments constructed of quarry-waste material in Belfast are to be landscaped without use of topsoil or other conditioners. The water stress conditions which are likely to arise in vegetation on the embankments were assessed using a soil water model to estimate daily evaporation rates in normal and dry summers. The plant available water capacity of the material was defined after field and laboratory measurements. In situ water content and potential measurements were made to determine field capacity and the wet end of the water release curve. Wilting point was determined from particle size data. The model was run for 1983 to 1986, a period including two dry and two average summers. The modelling results confirmed that water availability will be a crucial element in the development of vegetation on the embankment slopes. Generally, summer weather conditions in Northern Ireland include frequent rainfalls. It is anticipated that in average rainfall years, such as 1985 and 1986, limited water availability may check the growth of established vegetation but will not hinder slow development of a mature vegetation cover. However, when a dry summer occurs, such as 1984, or particularly 1983, significant water stress will be present.\n      </p>", "The theory of regulation in animal populations is fundamental to understanding the dynamics of populations, the causes of mortality and how natural selection shapes the life history of species. In mammals, the great range in body size allows us to see how allometric relationships affect the mode of regulation. Resource limitation is the fundamental cause of regulation. Top-down limitation through predators is determined by four factors: (i) body size; (ii) the diversity of predators and prey in the system; (iii) whether prey are resident or migratory; and (iv) the presence of alternative prey for predators. Body size in mammals has two important consequences. First, mammals, particularly large species, can act as keystones that determine the diversity of an ecosystem. I show how keystone processes can, in principle, be measured using the example of the wildebeest in the Serengeti ecosystem. Second, mammals act as ecological landscapers by altering vegetation succession. Mammals alter physical structure, ecological function and species diversity in most terrestrial biomes. In general, there is a close interaction between allometry, population regulation, life history and ecosystem dynamics. These relationships are relevant to applied aspects of conservation and pest management.\n      </p>", "Previous research has examined the influence of values on human-ecological decisions, yet disparate approaches render inferences across studies difficult. In this paper, we present a robust conceptualization of values, encompassing general life values, broad-based environmental orientations, and specific yard priorities, while comparatively examining how these influence residents' land-management practices. Coupling a social survey with observational field data in Phoenix, Arizona, we address how 1) diverse values affect residents' multifaceted landscaping practices, 2) yard structure impacts water and chemical applications, and 3) land management varies across distinctive geographic contexts. Overall, values were not strongly related to land management decisions. Of those that were significant, most were related to groundcover and herbicide use. Yet diverse environmental values influenced landscaping practices in varying and complex ways. In addition, the historic and socioeconomic setting of neighborhoods affect the extent of lawns and related management inputs, while heightened use of pesticides in rock-based, drought-tolerant yards challenges the notion of these lawn alternatives as an environmentally friendly and low maintenance choice.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

For instance, so-called edge cities (Garreau, 1991) have been heralded as a new Eden for the information age. Meanwhile tenderly manicured urban villages, gated estates and fashionably gentrified inner-city enclaves are all being furiously marketed as idyllic landscapes to ensure a variety of lifestyle fantasies. Such lifestyles are offered additional expression beyond the home, as renaissance sites in many downtowns afford city stakeholders the pleasurable freedoms one might ordinarily associate with urban civic life. None-the-less, strict assurances are given about how these privatized domiciliary and commercialized 'public' spaces are suitably excluded from the real and imagined threats of another fiercely hostile, dystopian environment 'out there'. This is captured in a number of (largely US) perspectives which warn of a 'fortified' or 'revanchist' urban landscape, characterized by mounting social and political unrest and pockmarked with marginal interstices: derelict industrial sites, concentrated hyperghettos, and peripheral shanty towns where the poor and the homeless are increasingly shunted. Our paper offers a review of some key debates in urban geography, planning and urban politics in order to examine this patchwork-quilt urbanism, In doing so, it seeks to uncover some of the key processes through which contemporary urban landscapes of utopia and dystopia come to exist in the way they do.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Once open, treeless spaces, many Honduran plazas are now filled with trees. These trees often support signs announcing the virtues of forests, linking the trees themselves to the official discourse on forest issues and illuminating the role of public-space landscapes in influencing public perception.

Anthropogenic activities leave clear signatures on all three C compartments measured. Management level dominates the response of grass production, biomass, and N tissue concentration. This, in turn, influences the amount of C and N both stored in and harvested from sites. The site age dominates the amount of woody biomass as well as soil C and N. Soil texture only secondarily affects total soil carbon and total bulk density. Established urban green spaces harbor larger C pools, more than double in some cases, than native grasslands or agricultural fields on a per-area basis. Lawn grass produces more biomass and stores more C than local prairie or agricultural fields. Introduced woody vegetation comprises a substantial C pool in urban green spaces and represents a new ecosystem feature. After an initial decrease with site development, soil organic carbon (SOC) pools surpass those in grasslands within two decades. In addition to the marked increase of C pools through time, a shift in storage from belowground to aboveground occurs. Whereas grasslands store ~90% of C belowground, urban green spaces store a decreasing proportion of the total C belowground in soils through time, reaching ~70% 30-40 years after construction. Despite the substantial increase in C pools in this urban area, it is important to recognize that this shift is distinct from C sequestration since it does not account for a total C budget, including increased anthropogenic C emissions from these sites.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Modern urban development provides an excellent laboratory for examining the interplay among socioecological relationships. We analyzed how the rapidly urbanizing Phoenix, Arizona metropolis has affected plant species diversity and community composition at a regional scale. Species diversity and plant density probably result from abiotic sorting in undeveloped desert sites, but not in urban sites. We found that species richness at the plot scale was higher for desert as opposed to urban sites; however, the estimated total species pool in the urban ecosystem is higher than that in the desert, as a result of the increased importation of introduced species through the nursery trade. Ordination of plant communities suggests three unique groupings of species based on land-use type of the site (desert, urban, and agriculture) and two unique groupings of urban sites based on landscaping aesthetics (mesic or xeric). We therefore recognize both bottom-up and top-down controls of plant biodiversity within the urban ecosystem.\n      </p>", "This statement of design philosophy by American designers Charles and Ray Eames is relevant to current issues in the conceptualisation of historic heritage and the management of protected areas in New South Wales. Despite considerable Australian and international literature promoting the idea of cultural landscape as a management category, historic heritage within the NSW reserve system continues to focus on objects, sites and places rather than on broader landscapes. Consequently, historic heritage is often viewed as separate to, and disconnected from, nature and biodiversity conservation, as well as Aboriginal cultural heritage. The paper will map out the initial work of a project being undertaken by the Department of Environment and Climate Change (NSW). At its heart, the project seeks to understand the context of historic heritage management within the NSW reserve system and to develop a cultural landscape-based conceptual frame-work for historic heritage conservation that sees all landscape as historic.

Which attributes of the invasion process exhibit scale dependency and which do not? Location: Hokkaido prefecture, northern Japan. Methods: We calculated the invasion extent of 316 non-native plant species based on gridded maps at three different spatial scales (grain size of approximately 2 km x 2 km, 10 km x 10 km and 80 km x 80 km). Relationships between the invasion extent of 316 non-native plant species and their attributes that are likely to enhance introduction (human use and introduction period), establishment (height, clonality, longevity and life form) and expansion (seed size, introduction period) were evaluated using phylogenetic regression. Results: Irrespective of grain size, non-native species with clonality, those used as fodder or for landscaping, and those with a historically earlier introduction period had significantly larger invasion extents than species without such attributes. In contrast, seed size, which is related to successful expansion, was negatively correlated with invasion extent and was significant only at the finest grain. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the presence of scale-dependent responses of the species attributes on their grain size may be caused by the invasion process to which the attribute is related. When developing general rules for invasiveness, researchers must consider the grain size at which the invasion extent is calculated.\n      </p>", "The most obvious means of conserving water throughout the Denver Water Department's service area is to curb the thirst of homeowners' bluegrass lawns, which consume 80 percent of the residential water used during the summer months.

Lawns eliminate diversity of topography and vegetation and are more costly to maintain than natural vegetation. Dunes on private lots are generally lower and less mobile than municipally managed foredunes, and contain more shrubs than natural dunes would have at similar distances from the sea. Unvegetated troughs and structures, such as bulkheads, boardwalks and walls, are conspicuous cultural features that interrupt the natural environmental gradient. The low elevation and stability of lots landward of protective foredunes and the lack of space for natural backdune environments in developed areas argues for maintaining lots using backdune species. Topographic relief, space, aesthetics of the vegetation, and cost affect willingness and capability of residents to use natural landscaping. Seashore plants that have attractive flowers or foliage or provide height and texture are aesthetically appealing and may cause owners to adopt more natural landscaping. New vegetation can look more natural if planted in irregular masses of color and texture and cutting is minimized. The physical and visual impact of cultural features should be minimized by removing them or by allowing sand to inundate them. Maintenance should be specified in landscaping contracts, and success of vegetation should be guaranteed. These provisions would reduce the uncritical use of exotics that have low probability of surviving.

We modified our exclosure design in 2002 and only one nest (7%) was depredated and no nests were abandoned prior to hatch. Kaplan-Meier estimates of chick survival in the absence of predation were 0.87 to 18 days in 2001 and 0.90 to 15 days in 2002. Mass ratios among first, second, and third-hatched chicks indicated that size hierarchies were present in broods near time of brood completion, but linear growth rates and asymptotic mass were not affected by hatch order in 2- or 3-chick broods. Predation was the primary determinant of chick survival in Black Tern colonies studied and food availability was not limiting chick growth.

This article examines the concept and rationale for establishing need, identifies strategic principles of the urban regeneration process and assesses the elements of good practice in urban regeneration. During 1992, the authors undertook a survey of all local authorities in Wales to identify urban regeneration needs. This research has been supplemented in 1993 with the availability of 1991 Census data from the Welsh Office on urban deprivation indices in Wales at both district and ward levels. This data provided the basis for ranking priority areas in the Principality for bids from local authorities for support in 1994-95 under the new Strategic Development Scheme. The second annual round of bids associated with this Scheme was launched in March 1994 for consideration in the 1995/96 programme. Recent urban regeneration polices for Wales are reviewed, and the authors conclude that urban initiatives need to be selective and targeted, both in relation to the nature of an area and types of programme.

Similarly, any opposition to the dominant ideology expressed in the design of landscape was mainly mounted by disaffected groups within the ranks of the franchised.

Authorship of the landscape is a key theoretical issue, for the work stemmed from a group of landscape architects whose goals, while unfortunately not in conflict with the political objectives of the regime, were by no means identical with or reducible to \"National Socialism.\" The tradition of the landscape garden was important here, but an even greater debt was owed to the turn-of-the-century Heimatschutz movement, which formulated a native landscape aesthetic as an explicit counterweight to highly rationalized landuse. Chief landscaper Alwin Seifert and his team applied this aesthetic to the Autobahn in an attempt to effect environmental reform, often undergirding their native plant preferences with ecological reasoning based on the climax model. Although this \"bodenstandige\" landscaping exhibited many specifically German influences and may have reinforced Nazi political rhetoric, it should nevertheless be seen as a response to problems characteristic of industrial society in general. As I suggest in the conclusion, the radical conservatism of the native landscape aesthetic serves an important cultural function by countering the economic system's pervasive valorization of environmental transformation.\n      </p>", "Riparian zones are hotspots of wildlife diversity and also particularly attractive for housing development. Landscaping associated with homes contributes to a wide range of lakeshore vegetation structures. Based on calling surveys in Northern Wisconsin, we investigated effects of lakeshore vegetation structure on bird diversity and frog abundance at three spatial scales: parcel (30 m of shoreline), whole-shore (340 m of shoreline) and whole-lake scales. For parcel and whole-shore scales, we selected sites paired by lake: 10 sites with an intact understory vegetation layer and 10 sites with a cleared understory. Green frog (Rana clamitans) abundances were somewhat related to presence of forest understory at the parcel scale. More clearly, we found higher avian species richness at sites with intact understory vegetation than those without, and increasing richness with canopy coverage. Aerial insect abundances, which were also higher at sites with an intact understory, may help explain bird distributions. Our results suggest that riparian understory landscaping at the scale of individual parcels can alter local bird communities.\n      </p>", "The distribution and planting of state-listed endangered and threatened plants is outlawed in most states of the United States, yet listed species are commonly used in landscaping and restorations. There is a need to re-examine policy regarding planting and propagation of endangered and threatened plants outside of planned recovery efforts. Potential advantages associated with increased outplanting of rare species include (1) improved public education and relations; (2) demographic security derived from creation of new populations; (3) provision of new, appropriate gene-flow opportunities; (4) applied research opportunities; and (5) ability to regulate a currently uncontrolled activity. Potential disadvantages are (1) confusion of natural and planted populations; (2) bureaucratic problems with protection of planted populations; (3) potential for inappropriate gene flow between natural and planted populations causing outbreeding depression and loss of genetic purity of natural populations; and (4) extension of the natural geographic and ecological range of the species. Policies, regulations, and nursery practices exist that would maximize the potential advantages and minimize the risks associated with the distribution of endangered and threatened plants. Policy considerations discussed include selection of appropriate species, production of appropriate and high-quality genetic stock, and regulation of outplanting programs. I weigh the risks and benefits of a program that would allow the general public access to some state-listed plants for natural landscaping. I conclude that a less restrictive but enforceable set of policies and regulations may be preferable to the status quo.\n      </p>"], "words": {"essay": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06},
