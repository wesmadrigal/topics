{"total_words": 1008, "documents": ["Key innovations are traits that are associated with the particular evolutionary 'success' of some taxonomic groups. Climbing plants depend on the availability of physical support to reach the canopy and thereby prevent shading by neighbouring plants. The present article shows that the evolution of a climbing habit in flowering plants constitutes a key innovation. A literature survey identified 48 pairs of sister groups from 45 families of flowering plants for which information on phylogenetic relationships, growth habit and species richness was available. In 38 cases, the climbing taxa were more diverse than their non-climbing sister groups. This pattern was highly significant. The same result was found when separate analyses were carried out for herbaceous and woody climbing plants, which differ in their constraints for successfully reaching a support.\n      </p>", "Climbing ability can be a major component of the capability of terrestrial mammals to use vertical habitats. Previous studies suggest that small mammals from central Chile have low climbing capabilities. However, those studies have not disentangled the influence of tree diameter in natural habitats from true climbing ability of different species. We carried out a laboratory experiment by studying the climbing ability of 4 central Chilean small mammals, 2 octodontid rodents (Octodon bridgesi and O. degus), 1 murid rodent (Phyllotis darwini), and 1 marsupial (Thylamys elegans), in situations with different stem diameters. Species showed distinctive climbing abilities. The marsupial T. elegans showed efficient climbing ability independent of stem diameter. P. darwini and O. bridgesi were both influenced by stem diameter, but the former species used smaller-diameter stems less frequently. O. degus showed the lowest climbing ability.\n      </p>", "Although Modern French was originally taken to lack the \"restructuring\" phenomenon altogether, four different \"restructuring\" effects have more recently been claimed to exist in the language: en and y climbing, quantifier climbing, adverb climbing, and long movement in 'easy-to-please' constructions. Evidence discussed in this article shows that only en and y climbing and long movement in 'easy-to-please' constructions are bona fide instances of \"restructuring\" in French.\n      </p>", "\u2022 Successful climbing by vines not only prevents shading by neighbouring vegetation, but also may place the vines beyond ground herbivores. Here we tested the hypothesis that herbivory might enhance climbing in a vine species, and that such induced climbing should be greater in the shade. \u2022 We assessed field herbivory in climbing and prostrate ramets of the twining vine Convolvulus arvensis. We evaluated plant climbing after mechanical damage in a glasshouse under both sun and shade conditions, and determined whether control and damaged plants differed in growth rate or photosynthetic capacity. \u2022 Plants experienced greater herbivory when growing prostrate than when climbing onto companion plants, in both an open habitat and a shaded understorey. Experimental plants increased their twining rate on a stake after suffering leaf damage, in both high- and low-light conditions, and this induced climbing was not coupled to an increase in growth rate. Increased photosynthesis was associated with enhanced twining rate only in the shade. \u2022 Herbivory may be an ecological factor promoting the evolution of a climbing habit in plants.\n      </p>", "We developed a bark-shaving technique to deter rat snakes (Elaphe obsoleta) from climbing red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) trees as an aesthetically pleasing, more cost-effective, and safer alternative to other snake excluder devices. We used a drawknife to carefully shave the bark around the circumference of 4 treatment trees in a 1-m-wide band to eliminate any furrows or rough surfaces, without cutting into the cambium. Four control trees were not altered. We tested our method from April 1997 to August 1997 and found that shaved trees were nearly 100% effective in preventing rat snakes from climbing (n=40 climbing attempts), whereas control trees were successfully climbed (n=20 climbing attempts) on each attempt. One shaved barrier was crossed by one snake 14 weeks after the barrier was initially created. The bark had roughened from tree growth. After we reshaved the barrier, the snake was unable to cross the barrier again. Despite loss of effectiveness over time, the shaved barriers can provide red-cockaded woodpeckers a head-start in developing their own defenses against rat snake predation in a manner that is more natural in appearance than other snake-excluder devices.\n      </p>", "The Robberg peninsula climbing-falling coastal dune system is a possible source of sediment to the peninsula's associated bay (Plettenberg Bay) and beaches. The climbing-falling dune which lies in a south- westerly-north- easterly direction is formed by sand accumulation on the west of the peninsula with transport by the prevailing winds. Progressive dune stabilisation on the climbing-falling dune, by Acacia cyclops, an Australian introduced woody plant, has occurred over the last 54 years curtailing the movement of aeolian sands and thus reducing the potential to supply the bay with beach sediments. The rate at which stabilisation has occurred was determined by measuring and calculating the decrease in exposed surface sands of the dune system from orthophoto maps and aerial photographs. The mobile free sand surface of the dune has decreased its visible surface area by 55% over the last 54 years. Results suggest that sediment input into the Plettenberg Bay has steadily decreased from the time of early Acacia cyclops infestations. Although these aliens, which invade the natural vegetation, are now being removed, there is little change to the open surface of the dune system due to irreversible changes to the vegetation dynamics and soil properties following stabilisation.\n      </p>", "Mechanical properties are investigated in Desmoncus orthacanthos and D. polyacanthos from French Guiana, South America. Differences in size and axis stiffness are related to different trellis requirements and habitats. The leaf sheath surrounds the stem, increasing stiffness of young self-supporting stages and apical parts of older climbing plants. Senescence of the leaf sheath reduces stiffness of older climbing axes of both species. Its eventual loss in D. orthacanthos facilitates deformation into coils and loops when plants slip from their supports following senescence of leaves bearing attachment organs. In smaller climbing axes of D. polyacanthos, the senescent leaf sheath remains attached and axes rarely form loops and coils below attachment. An increase in stiff mechanical properties toward the base of both species is radically different from that of many dicotyledonous lianas. Besides the presence of attachment organs, stem mechanical properties of Desmoncus are similar to those of erect though not fully self-supporting stems of Bactris major, a sympatric species of the sister group genus to Desmoncus. The climbing habit in Desmoncus may have evolved via (1) heterochronic processes including early elongation of internodes relative to increase in stem diameter (reduction of the establishment phase) and (2) increased persistence of leaf sheaths.\n      </p>", "Many researchers report that rock climbing has significant negative effects on cliff biota. Most work on climbing disturbance, however, has not controlled for variation in microsite characteristics when comparing areas with and without climbing presence. Additionally, some researchers do not identify the style or difficulty level of climbing routes sampled or select climbing routes that do not represent current trends in the sport. We solved these problems by sampling climbing areas used by advanced \"sport\" climbers and quantifying differences in microtopography between climbed and control cliffs. We determined whether differences in vegetation existed between pristine and sport-climbed cliff faces when microsite factors were not controlled. We then determined the relative influence of the presence of climbing, cliff-face microtopography, local physical factors, and regional geography on the richness, abundance, and community composition of cliff-face vascular plants, bryophytes, and lichens. When we did not control for microsite differences among cliffs, our results were consistent with the majority of prior work on impacts of climbing (i.e., sport-climbed cliff faces supported a lower mean richness of vascular plants and bryophytes and significantly different frequencies of individual species when compared with pristine cliff faces). When we investigated the relative influences of microtopography and climbing disturbance, however, the differences in vegetation were not related to climbing disturbance but rather to the selection by sport climbers of cliff faces with microsite characteristics that support less vegetation. Climbed sites had not diverged toward a separate vegetation community; instead, they supported a subset of the species found on pristine cliff faces. Prior management recommendations to restrict development of new climbing routes should be reevaluated based on our results.\n      </p>", "The shape of the cams used in rock climbing friends is derived using a linear system of differential equations\n      </p>", "A previous study shows how a twelve-year-old girl discovers angles in her narrative from a climbing trip. Based on this research, the girl's class takes part in one day of climbing and half a day of follow-up work at school. The students mathematise their climbing with respect to angles and they express themselves in texts and drawings. Their written and drawn expressions are categorised into three different levels: recognition, description and contextual tool. In addition, these expressions are interpreted to be narrative or analytical. All the narrative expressions were categorised as level one or below, while some of the analytical expressions were categorised as belonging to higher levels. The research findings point at how to use analytical drawings in work with analytical texts in geometry.\n      </p>", "A new herbaceous lycopsid species, Leclercqia uncinata Xu, Berry, Wang et Marshall, is established on the basis of compression fossils from the Middle Devonian of Xinjiang, NW China. The new species has slender axes and three-dimensional, seven-tipped leaves with a distally hooked central segment conforming to the original diagnosis of the genus, and it is relatively smaller than the type species, L. complexa from New York State. The sporangium contains the spore, which can be assigned to morphotaxon Acinoporites lindlariensis. In our preparation of compressions, iridopteridalean fertile appendages are found trapped between the distally hooked leaves of L. uncinata. A possible climbing habit of the new plant is discussed.\n      </p>", "For some speakers of Italian (reported in Cinque 2004), Italian sembrare 'seem' has dual status. On the one hand, it is a lexical verb, with an experiencer argument; on the other hand, it behaves like a \"restructuring verb.\" In the latter case, sembrare is incompatible with an experiencer argument and it allows clitic climbing. This article identifies several contexts in which clitic climbing is not possible with sembrare and offers an account in terms of Cinque's proposals about the functional hierarchy of the clause. The article also examines sembler, the French cognate of sembrare, and argues, contra Cinque 2002, that it behaves like a lexical verb. Finally, it shows that the two instantiations of Italian sembrare correspond to two verbs in Dutch: schijnen and lijken.\n      </p>", "We studied rock climbing and bird communities associated with cliffs, with and without rock climbing, at Joshua Tree National Park, California. Bird communities differed between sites with different levels of rock climbing. Four bird species were detected only at cliffs where no climbing occurred; 5 species were detected only at cliffs with moderate levels of climbing activity; and 3 species were seen only at cliffs with many popular climbing routes. European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) were seen only at climbed cliffs. Birds at unclimbed cliffs were more likely to be perched at the faces of cliffs, whereas birds at popular climbing cliffs were more likely to be flying. At popular cliffs, birds were usually seen away from cliff faces, whereas at unclimbed cliffs birds were more likely to be detected near cliff faces.\n      </p>", "A large computer-based corpus provides the data for the first comprehensive investigation of clitic climbing (lo debe comprar vs. debe comprarlo) in both written and spoken modern Spanish. The results are based on nearly 15,000 tokens with 32 different main verbs (ir+a, tener+que, desear, etc), extracted (using WordCruncher) from a computer corpus of 3.5 million words of spoken and written Spanish from ten countries. The large amount of data from both registers permits consideration of previously problematic questions. For example, the data suggests that a semantics-based model accounts well for the continuum-like distribution of clitic climbing with different main verbs, and that the nature of the clitic (reflexivity/animacy) is also important. Although the frequency of clitic climbing varies little from country to country, it is much more common in spoken than in written Spanish, which in turn poses major new questions concerning diachronic Spanish clitic climbing.\n      </p>", "The race for reaching mates by the time they are receptive, or sexual selection by scramble competition, has received little attention. We argue that smaller males are favored in species in which the male must climb to reach females located in high habitat patches. This new explanation we term the \"gravity hypothesis\" of sexual size dimorphism (SSD). We show that a simple biomechanical model of animal movement predicts that: (1) selection should favor a comparatively smaller size in the searching sex when searching involves climbing; and (2) this effect should be stronger in larger species than in smaller species. In reaching high habitats, smaller, faster searchers will be favored either through sexual selection by scramble competition and/or by escaping predation easier by running faster on vertical surfaces. Different spider species are found at a wide range of heights. We compiled a dataset of spider taxa and arranged their habitats according to four height categories, ranked from soil surface to trees. We show that, after controlling for phylogeny, both predictions of the gravity hypothesis of SSD are met. Thus, it appears that the constraint imposed by gravity on climbing males is a selective factor in determining male dwarfism.\n      </p>", "In many parts of the vertebrate nervous system, synaptic connections are remodeled during early postnatal life. Neural activity plays an important role in regulating one such rearrangement synapse elimination, in the developing neuromuscular system, but there is little direct evidence on roles of pre-or postsynaptic activity in regulating synapse elimination in the developing brain. To address this issue, we expressed a chloride channel-yellow fluorescent protein fusion in cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) of transgenic mice to decrease their excitability. We then assessed elimination of supernumerary climbing fiber inputs to PCs. Individual PCs are innervated by multiple climbing fibers at birth; all but one are eliminated during the first three postnatal weeks in wild-type mice, but multiple innervation persists for at least three months in the transgenic mice. The normal redistribution of climbing fiber synapses from PC somata to proximal dendrites was also blunted in transgenics. These results show that normal electrical activity of the postsynaptic cell is required for it to attain a mature innervation pattern.\n      </p>", "Geckos are nature's elite climbers. Their remarkable climbing feats have been attributed to specialized feet with hairy toes that uncurl and peel in milliseconds. Here, we report that the secret to the gecko's arboreal acrobatics includes an active tail. We examine the tail's role during rapid climbing, aerial descent, and gliding. We show that a gecko's tail functions as an emergency fifth leg to prevent falling during rapid climbing. A response initiated by slipping causes the tail tip to push against the vertical surface, thereby preventing pitch-back of the head and upper body. When pitch-back cannot be prevented, geckos avoid falling by placing their tail in a posture similar to a bicycle's kickstand. Should a gecko fall with its back to the ground, a swing of its tail induces the most rapid, zero-angular momentum air-righting response yet measured. Once righted to a sprawled gliding posture, circular tail movements control yaw and pitch as the gecko descends. Our results suggest that large, active tails can function as effective control appendages. These results have provided biological inspiration for the design of an active tail on a climbing robot, and we anticipate their use in small, unmanned gliding vehicles and multisegment spacecraft.\n      </p>", "We present the first description of the epidermal anatomy of the late Stephanian (Carboniferous) pteridosperm Blanzyopteris praedentata (Gothan) nov. comb. on the basis of material from central France. This species, characterized by relatively small compact fronds, has historically been assigned to the form\u2010genus Neuropteris. The epidermal anatomy of all parts of the sterile frond can now be documented based on large pieces of cuticle. The cuticles are well preserved, particularly the various types of trichomes. In addition to these cuticles, cuticles of specialized climbing organs with adhesive pads have been found. These structures have never been reported before for fossil plants and unequivocally demonstrate a lianalike growth habit for this species; epidermal features are considered with regard to their ecological significance. The combination of macromorphological (e.g., frond architecture) and epidermal (cell patterns, stomata, trichomes) characters is different from that reported in other neuropterids. Because of these striking differences, the species is transferred to the newly established genus Blanzyopteris.\n      </p>", "The reasons Lutreolina crassicaudata is always captured in close proximity to water are not clear. We investigated locomotory behavior and performance in swimming, running, climbing, and jumping of L. crassicaudata. One adult male was videotaped in the laboratory while swimming, walking on the ground and on a horizontal tube 1.2 m from the ground, climbing a tree trunk angled 45\u00b0, and jumping gaps between supports. The locomotor cycles in these different activities were described by speed, stride length, stroke or stride frequency, time of power and recovery phases or stance and swing phases, and by displacement of points on the animal. L. crassicaudata employed a quadruped paddling gait in swimming. Swimming speed was similar to that of terrestrial didelphids, but stroke frequency and buoyancy ability were more similar to those of the water opossum. Different gaits were used for locomotion in each habitat type and we conclude that L. crassicaudata cannot be considered a specialized species for aquatic locomotion.\n      </p>", "An unattended trap was designed to sample and retain spiders dispersing from agricultural grassland and crops. Traps comprised a removable bottle-trap fixed to the top of a vertical metal rod or \"climbing-stick\" that spiders climbed during normal pre-ballooning behavior. Bottle-traps caught over eight times more spiders than sticks treated with insect trapping adhesive. Draping sticks with nets increased the effective area of the traps and increased the catch size threefold. On average, 9.1% of spiders were lost from traps during the daytime sampling period. No difference in average rate of loss of spiders from the bottle-traps was observed between night and daylight hours. The bottle-trap design is economical and simple to construct, erect and operate. Continuous sampling also allows multiple traps to be used simultaneously in various locations.\n      </p>", "Field observations and a laboratory test indicate that Peromyscus gossypinus is a more active climber than P. floridanus. Subjects conceived and raised in the laboratory tended to perform more poorly on the climbing test than did wild-caught animals. The greater arboreal tendency of gossypinus may contribute to its wider distribution and broader habitat tolerance, as compared to floridanus, by allowing it to exploit more effectively the resources of the environment. Difference in three-dimensional space utilization of the two species also may serve to reduce competition between them in areas of sympatry. The interspecific variation in climbing activity appears to involve both psychological and morphological adaptations, with the former being of relatively greater importance. Tail length is not correlated with climbing ability in these species. The principal morphological adaptation for climbing appears to be relative development of the plantar tubercles. Two isolated populations of floridanus from different habitat types showed greater divergence in climbing activity than gossypinus stocks from the same localities and habitats. The difference in climbing tendency of the two floridanus populations is believed to be related to the accessibility and general abundance of acorns in their respective habitats.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "Given potential growth in outdoor rock climbing and its concentration on public lands, the management of climbing access in wilderness areas is an issue of considerable national controversy in the United States. A proposed rule change by the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) would prohibit the use of fixed climbing protection in wilderness areas-effectively eliminating safe access to many sites. Using a unique data set on rock climbing trips, a repeated-nested logit, random-utility model is used to analyze economic losses to climbers resulting from the USFS proposal. Results indicate that the USFS proposal may constitute a major regulatory change.\n      </p>", "Bradypus does not drag itself along the ground, as has been often reported, except when on a smooth, hard surface. Limb-movement patterns are similar throughout terrestrial and climbing activities, but gaits vary from lateral-sequence, diagonal-couplet modes during terrestrial walking, to trots and diagonal-sequence, diagonal-couplet gaits during climbing of supports of small diameter. Bradypus and Choloepus move similarly when on the ground, and while climbing small caliber supports, but differ in their means of climbing larger supports and descending.\n      </p>", "Biomass allocation to roots, rhizomes, runners and climbing stems (i.e. twining axis and attached leaves) was studied in Calystegia sepium L., a clonal vine. In an experiment which took 2 months, nutrient availability (low and high) and intraspecific competition (none, shoot, root and both shoot and root) were manipulated. Under low nutrients the highest biomass of climbing stems was found in plants with shoot competition; the lowest was found in plants with both shoot and root competition. Total biomass under high nutrients was also greatest in plants with shoot competition. Thus, plants benefited from climbing up a shared stake rather than separate stakes. Larger plants allocated a higher proportion of biomass to runners in the nutrient-poor environment than in the nutrient-rich environment. This behaviour may increase the chance of finding nutrient-rich patches in the neighbourhood of the mother plant in a heterogeneous environment.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "We examined plant climbing by the common striped scorpion Centruroides Vittatus to determine which of two hypotheses (the predation avoidance hypothesis or the increased prey availability hypothesis) best explained this behavior. In the field we observed nocturnal scorpion activity for 16 mo during 1992-1993 to quantify climbing behavior and collected data on potential prey abundance on the ground and in vegetation for 5 mo. We also performed a laboratory experiment examining the effects of hunger level on scorpion climbing and activity. Individuals found up in vegetation accounted for 19.3% and 25.2% of scorpions active in 1992 and 1993, respectively. Juveniles were significantly more likely to be found in vegetation than were adults in both years, although juveniles and adults did not differ in the proportion found carrying prey in vegetation. We found significant seasonal variation in prey abundance, with prey density being greatest in September. Prey density was also significantly greater on the ground than in vegetation when all trapped invertebrates were included; however, when we excluded collembolans because of their small size, this difference was no longer significant. Laboratory results indicated that there were no within-treatment differences among age classes/sexes in any behavior (climbing frequency, activity level or maximum height climbed). When hungry, males (but not females or juveniles) climbed higher and juveniles (but not adults) were more active. Hunger level had no effect on climbing frequency for any age class/sex. In combination, the field and laboratory data are most consistent with the predation avoidance hypothesis as the main reason for plant climbing by scorpions.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The adventitious-root climbers (H. helix and R. radicans) had the lowest maximum photosynthetic rates of all species (5.5 and 6.4 \u03bcmol m-2 s-1, respectively). The twining vine P lobata was the most poorly adapted to the understory with a high light-compensation point (43 \u03bcmol m-2 s-1), low photosynthesis under low light (0.5 \u03bcmol m-2 s-1 at 50 \u03bc mol m-2 s-1), and the highest light requirement for obtaining 90% of maximum photosynthesis (860 \u03bcmol m-2 s-1). Lonicera japonica, another twining vine, was better-adapted to low light conditions, but vines with tendril climbing mechanics were physiologically the best adapted to low light. The adhesive-tendril climber P. quinquefolia was the most highly adapted to shade, with a low light compensation point (20 \u03bc mol m-2 s-1), a high photosynthetic rate under low light (3.5 \u03bcmol m-2 s-1), and a low light saturation point (160 \u03bc mol m-2 s-1). Results suggest that physiological adaptability of vines to low-light environments may be related to climbing mechanics.\n      </p>", "While a number of validity tests exist for contingent valuation data, to date there are very few literature examples for contingent behavior (CB) data. The objective of this study is to test the validity of CB trip data for different levels of rock climbing access using data from surveys implemented before and after a policy restricting recreational access was imposed. Results from generalized Negative Binomial and seemingly unrelated Poisson regression models show significant sensitivity to scope, and suggest that CB data may be a valuable supplement to revealed preference data when policy proposals are outside the range of historical conditions.\n      </p>", "A technique adapted from the aid-climbing methods practiced by rock climbers is described for climbing tall trees. Equipment lists are provided and the technique is illustrated. The technique provides an alternative to climbing with spikes or shooting or throwing a line from the ground over a limb high above. It is simple and easy to learn and, once practiced, can serve as an efficient and safe method to access the canopy of a large tree. The technique is applicable to trunks up to ~ 1.5 m diameter, or to heavy lianas growing on even larger trunks. This method can be used not only to gain access to nearly any large tree, but also provides one with the ability to move about in that tree with relative ease and safety. With practice, a climber using this method can ascend from ground level to 30 to 40 m up in the forest canopy in one hr or less. The advantages over other tree-climbing methods are discussed.\n      </p>", "The climbing Boston ivy (Parthenocissus tricuspidata) achieves permanent attachment through tendrils equipped with adhesive pads. The highly efficient structures secrete an adhesive fluid and were found to attach to a wide variety of substrates, both organic and inorganic. However, information about the attachment process including the ontogenetic development of the attachment pads and the underlying structures is scarce. We investigated the morphology and ontogenetic changes of attachment pads during the attachment process. Attachment structures consist of several pads, and the mean projected attachment pad area was found to be dependent on the substrate. However, the maximum and minimum projected areas were similar on all tested substrates. Attached and nonattached structures were analyzed using different microscopy methods. Ontogenetic variations in the morphology of attached and nonattached structures and structural gradients within the attachment pads were observed: cell size, cell orientation, and grade of lignification vary over the pad cross section normal to the interface. Microscopy revealed a perfect form closure between the attachment pads and the substrate.\n      </p>", "During developmental synaptogenesis, the pre-and postsynaptic cells undergo specific interactions that lead to the establishment of the mature circuit. We have studied the roles of the pre-and postsynaptic cells in establishing this mature innervation by using an in vitro model of synaptic development. We describe climbing fiber (CF)-Purkinje cell (PC) synaptogenesis in cultured mouse hindbrain explants and show that synaptic competition occurs during early development in vitro. By manipulating the maturation stage of each of the synaptic partners in a coculture experimental paradigm, we found that multi-innervation does not occur when both synaptic partners are mature and have already experienced synapse elimination; in contrast mature PCs can be multi-innervated when they have never experienced synapse elimination and/or when CFs are immature. However in these cases, the normal process of synapse elimination is impaired. These results show that CF-synapse elimination occurs only during a PC-dependant critical period and triggers indelible signals that prevent synapse competition in the mature system.\n      </p>", "Late Paleozoic pteridosperms displayed various growth habits, including arborescent, leaning, and scrambling and/or climbing forms. This article reviews information gathered to date on vine- and liana-like forms among these plants, based on impression/compression material and cuticle preparations from the Upper Carboniferous and Lower Permian of Europe and North America. Vine- and liana-like pteridosperms used various modes of attachment for both anchorage and support. Such adaptations are very similar (and perhaps analogous) to those that exist in extant angiosperms and include hooks, leaflet tendrils, tendrils terminating in adhesive pads, and aerial adventitious roots. A number of morphological features of scrambling/climbing pteridosperms (e.g., tiny, deeply sunken stomata, marginal water pits, various types of secretory structures, and heterophylly) are considered as they relate to the autecological significance where they may be related to special physiological requirements necessary in the scrambling/climbing growth habit. We hypothesize that scrambling and/or climbing pteridosperms may have played an important role in some of the late Paleozoic coal-swamp forest ecosystems, perhaps even comparable to the role of angiospermous vines/lianas in tropical and subtropical forest ecosystems today. /// Jungpal\u00e4ozoische Pteridospermen besa\u00dfen unterschiedliche Wuchsformen; einige Taxa waren freistehende B\u00e4ume, andere Formen st\u00fctzten ihre K\u00f6rper durch Anlehnen, wieder andere waren Spreizklimmer oder Kletterpflanzen.

We argue that there are two clitic positions in Italian \"restructured\" clauses: one associated with the (restructured) lexical verb and the other a clausal clitic position located in the functional domain. While restructuring can be recursive, clitics appear either on the restructured infinitive (no clitic climbing) or in the functional domain of the highest verb (full clitic climbing). There is no clitic climbing to an intermediate restructuring verb. We argue that only the lowest restructured verb makes a position for clitics available and that this position is the same as that of infinitive-final [e]. Finally, we show that the functional \u223c lexical dichotomy is too sharp and that a variety of verb classes must be admitted, whose properties correlate with the point in the structure in which they are merged.\n      </p>", "The cliffs of the Niagara Escarpment support unique and diverse plant communities. Although recreational rock climbing has become extremely popular in North America over the past two decades, little is known about the effect of this sport on the natural biota. We examined the ecological effects of rock climbing on vascular plant, bryophyte, and lichen communities along the Niagara Escarpment in southern Ontario. We made comparisons among randomly selected climbed and unclimbed rock outcrops by sampling from three positions: plateau (or cliff edge), cliff face, and talus (or cliff base). Density, percent cover, species richness, and species diversity of vascular plants were lower on climbed outcrops than on unclimbed outcrops. In addition, the proportion of alien plants was three times greater in climbed areas than in unclimbed areas. The frequency and richness of bryophyte species were also significantly lower in climbed areas. The frequency of lichens was the same on climbed and unclimbed cliffs, but species richness was significantly lower in climbed areas, and community composition differed between climbed and unclimbed areas. Our results suggest that rock climbing has significant negative effects on all aspects of the vegetative community on cliffs. Therefore, we recommend that conservation plans be modified to include specific policies regarding recreational rock climbing for lands containing exposed cliffs. For example, we suggest that the establishment of new climbing routes be banned in protected areas along the Niagara Escarpment.\n      </p>", "This paper compares two types of purpose-built recreational space -indoor climbing walls and outdoor fishing ponds - using participant observation and interviews with climbers and anglers in England. We show how these notionally 'indoor'and 'outdoor' spaces have strong similarities in terms of how they are used and perceived. We draw on literature about consumption and technology to demonstrate changing expectations and social norms about using each space. We also compare walls and ponds with supermarkets to highlight how this consumerist interpretation is used in a moral ordering of leisure behaviour. We therefore take a very different approach from research that emphasises sensation, risk and embodiment in outdoor leisure and adventure tourism. Instead, we show how such spaces reflect modernist domestication and control, problematising the indoor/outdoor dualism and emphasising the multiple experiences of environmental leisure.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "The angle of climb of ripples in this wide-spread structure depends theoretically on the net rate of deposition on the bed, the bed-load transport rate in the absence of net deposition, and a deposition rate difference between upstream and downstream ripple faces. Theoretically, too, the local size-sorting in cross-laminated deposits becomes less marked as the angle of climb increases. Again theoretically, with increasing steepness of climb, the internal structure of the deposit changes from cross-laminae filling erosional troughs to laminae that are very continuous laterally. These various predictions are broadly confirmed in a series of laboratory flume experiments covering a 300-fold range of the angle of climb. Additional confirmation of the prediction concerning local size-sorting is obtained from measurements made on cross-laminated sands in the Uppsala esker at L\u00f6fstal\u00f6t. Making use of a further theoretical relationship enabling mean flow velocity to be calculated from sediment mean size, rates of sediment deposition were estimated for beds with climbing-ripple cross-lamination in the Uppsala esker. The calculated rates are mainly of the order 10-3 to 10-2 g cm-2 s-1. The flows depositing the beds appear to have varied in discharge on a time-scale varying between several hours and a few tens of hours. Such a periodicity is consistent with what is known of discharge fluctuations in modern glacial streams. The analysis of climbing-ripple cross-lamination on these lines may in future be helpful in improving our understanding of processes important in geomorphology and geology.\n      </p>", "Whether early hominins were adept tree climbers is unclear. Although some researchers have argued that bipedality maladapts the hominin skeleton for climbing, others have argued that early hominin fossils display an amalgamation of features consistent with both locomotor strategies. Although chimpanzees have featured prominently in these arguments, there are no published data on the kinematics of climbing in wild chimpanzees. Without these biomechanical data describing how chimpanzees actually climb trees, identifying correlates of climbing in modern ape skeletons is difficult, thereby limiting accurate interpretations of the hominin fossil record. Here, the first kinematic data on vertical climbing in wild chimpanzees are presented. These data are used to identify skeletal correlates of climbing in the ankle joint of the African apes to more accurately interpret hominin distal tibiae and tali. This study finds that chimpanzees engage in an extraordinary range of foot dorsiflexion and inversion during vertical climbing bouts. Two skeletal correlates of modern ape-like vertical climbing are identified in the ankle joint and related to positions of dorsif lexion and foot inversion. A study of the 14 distal tibiae and 15 tali identified and published as hominins from 4.12 to 1.53 million years ago finds that the ankles of early hominins were poorly adapted for modern ape-like vertical climbing bouts. This study concludes that if hominins included tree climbing as part of their locomotor repertoire, then they were performing this activity in a manner decidedly unlike modern chimpanzees.\n      </p>", "Obtaining specimens from the forest canopy is a perennial problem for tropical biologists. A safe and easy method that does not require the use of a vertical rope is described suitable for ascending straight young branchless tree boles of 10-35 cm in diameter or large lianas. It uses rope loops attached to foot and waist assemblies, which pass twice about the tree trunk and are cinched off with small ascenders. The climber can ascend to heights of 15-25 m and reach botanical specimens with a saw attached to a long pole, or detach from the loops and move about the canopy using other climbing gear. While on the loops, the climber is firmly attached to the trunk and has both hands free to work.\n      </p>", "This study contributes to our understanding of the phylogenetic significance and major evolutionary trends in the wood of the dogbane family (Apocynaceae), one of the largest and economically most important angiosperm families. Based on LM and SEM observations of 56 Apocynoideae species\u2014representing all currently recognized tribes\u2014and eight Periplocoideae, we found striking differences in vessel grouping patterns (radial multiples vs. large clusters) between the mainly nonclimbing apocynoid tribes (Wrightieae, Malouetieae, Nerieae) and the climbing lineages (remaining Apocynoideae and Periplocoideae). The presence of large vessel clusters in combination with fibers in the ground tissue characterizing the climbing Apocynoideae and Periplocoideae clearly contrasts with the climbing anatomy of the rauvolfioids (solitary vessels plus tracheids in ground tissue), supporting the view that (1) the climbing habit has evolved more than once in Apocynaceae, (2) the three nonclimbing apocynoid tribes are basal compared to the climbing apocynoids, and (3) Periplocoideae belong to the crown clade. The wood anatomy within the nonclimbing and climbing lineages is rather homogeneous, although a combination of specific characters (e.g. presence of septate fibers, axial parenchyma distribution, abundance of uniseriate compared to multiseriate rays, and presence and location of prismatic crystals) may be used to identify several tribes.\n      </p>", "The presence of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in the olivocerebellar system was demonstrated in rats by light- and electron-microscopic immunohistochemistry, as well as by in situ hybridization histochemistry. CRF-like immunoreactivity was present in each portion of the olivocerebellar system: (i) In colchicine-treated rats, CRF-immunostained cells were found in each nuclei and subunit of the inferior olive. After surgical transection of the medullary portion of the olivocerebellar tract, CRF-immunostaining accumulated in inferior olive neurons contralateral to the lesion. In situ hybridization histochemistry indicated that CRF mRNA is transcribed in inferior olive neurons for translation to CRF precursor, whereas CRF mRNA was depleted contralateral to the lesion. (ii) CRF-immunopositive fibers of the olivocerebellar tract were demonstrated ipsilateral to the transection due to an accumulation in the proximal portion of transected axons. (iii) CRF-immunopositivity was demonstrated in climbing fibers in the molecular layer of the cerebellum at both light- and electron-microscopic levels. CRF-immunostained nerve terminals (climbing fiber varicosities) established synaptic contact with dendritic spines of the Purkinje cells. These three observations provide morphological evidence suggesting that CRF might serve as a neurotransmitter in the olivocerebellar system.\n      </p>", "The Imperial Woodpecker (Campephilus imperialis) of Mexico\u2014the largest woodpecker in the world\u2014probably became extinct in the late 20th century, without known documentation of the species in life. We describe a recently discovered 16-mm color film of an Imperial Woodpecker taken in 1956 by William L. Rhein. The film documents climbing strides, launches, flights, and foraging of one female Imperial Woodpecker. For perches and foraging the woodpecker used dead or recently dead Durango Pines (Pinus durangensis). Trunks of perch and foraging trees were of the largest diameters available in this tree species. After allowing for possible inaccuracies in the frame speed of the film, we found that the Imperial Woodpecker had slow climbing strides and a fast wing-flap rate compared with other woodpeckers. Following landmarks documented during the 1956 expedition, we identified and surveyed the film site in 2010. The site was in coniferous forest in lightly undulating terrain at 2,700\u20132,900 m elevation. In 1956, the area was old-growth forest with abundant large and dead trees. By 2010, the area had been logged multiple times. Interviews with local people indicated that Imperial Woodpeckers had disappeared from the region by 1960 and that they were killed by hunting and perhaps through poisoning instigated by logging interests. Human persecution and the logging of large pines for timber and of dead trees for pulp were likely principal factors in the extinction process of the Imperial Woodpecker.\n         La especie mexicana Campephilus imperialis\u2014el carpintero de mayor tama\u00f1o en el mundo\u2014probablemente se extingui\u00f3 a finales del siglo XX, sin que haya documentaci\u00f3n conocida de la especie en vida.

Entrevistas con personas locales indicaron que C. imperialis hab\u00eda desaparecido de la regi\u00f3n para 1960 y que los carpinteros fueron cazados y tal vez envenenados respondiendo a intereses forestales.

Accordingly, vertical spacers (internodes in erect species, petioles in prostrate species) should be more plastic than horizontal spacers (petioles in erect species, internodes in prostrate species). This hypothesis was tested in the climbing plant Convolvulus arvensis. Given their facultative erect or prostrate habit, depending on support availability, climbing plants may be model species to test the relationship between growth habit and spacer plasticity in the absence of the confounding factors that are typical of interspecific comparisons. The phenotypic correlations among traits were also addressed. Three shading treatments (100%, 20%, and 5% of sunlight) and two support conditions (with and without a stake on which plants could twine) provided the experimental setting. Traits evaluated included internode length, petiole length, stem thickness, and biomass as well as area, shape, and specific area of leaves. The hypothesis was not supported. Internodes were more plastic than petioles in supported (\u201cerect\u201d) as well as in nonsupported (\u201cprostrate\u201d) plants, thereby supporting homology, and not analogy, of organs as a factor in explaining plasticity patterns. Most traits were significantly correlated both in supported and nonsupported plants. Internode and petiole length showed a highly significant positive correlation. This is discussed, and trait correlations are considered as possible constraints on the expected pattern of differential spacer plasticity to shading.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "Understanding the processes shaping responses of native species to environmental perturbations, such as the introduction of nonnative species, will allow us to better manage such impacts. The imported Red Fire Ant, Solenopsis invicta, invaded the United States ~70 years ago and co-occurs with Fence Lizards (Sceloporus undulatus) in portions of their range. Lizards from fire ant-invaded populations have longer hind limbs which more effectively remove ants and increase survival following fire ant attack. Prior research on this system suggests that this difference in relative hind limb length (RHL) is fixed at birth; however, RHL is a plastic trait in other lizard species and could help Fence Lizards survive. Lizards from invaded sites are more likely to climb when attacked by fire ants or when stressed (i.e., have elevated levels of corticosterone) than are lizards from uninvaded sites. We tested for climbing-induced plasticity in RHL by manipulating whether or not Fence Lizards had to climb raised platforms to bask. This testing revealed that increased climbing did not affect RHL at maturity (34 weeks of age) or hind limb growth rates. This result was unaffected by initial limb length, differential survival, source population, or ambient or body temperature of the lizards, suggesting that the amount of climbing does not plastically affect the RHL of S. undulatus.\n      </p>", "We evaluated the impacts of the use of French climbing spikes on the growth rate and survival of trees during an interval of 14-28 mo.

Systematic searches were made and epidemiological studies on hip OA and heavy lifting, including farming and construction work and climbing stairs, were reviewed for the period 1966\u20132007 inclusive. The quality of the studies was assessed and best-evidence syntheses of a causal relation between hip OA and physical demanding work have been made using specific criteria of the different degrees of evidence of causality. Limitations of the studies include few participants, use of different diagnostic criteria, and a poor description of the exposure. It is concluded that moderate to strong evidence was found for a relation between heavy lifting and hip OA. The burdens have to be at least 10\u201320 kg and the duration at least 10\u201320 years to give a clearly increased risk of hip OA. For farmers the risk of hip OA seems doubled after approximately 10 years of farming and the evidence is considered as moderate to strong.

Rearing in captivity and radiotagging may impair the takeoff ability of birds. To test this, the takeoff angle, flight speed, and climbing rate of wild and hand-reared gray partridges were measured indoors with an optoelectronic motion analysis system. In addition, we tested the effect of an attached radiotransmitter on the takeoff ability of wild partridges. Wild birds had a steeper takeoff angle (P = 0.001) and greater climbing rate (P &lt; 0.001) than hand-reared birds. The transmitter decreased takeoff angle (P = 0.006) and climbing rate (P = 0.002) of wild partridges.

Systematic searches were made, and epidemiological studies on kneeOA and heavy lifting, kneeling and climbing stairs published in 1966 to 2007 inclusive were reviewed. The quality of the studies was assessed and an overall evaluation of the degree of evidence of a causal relationship between kneeOA and physically demanding work was made, using specific criteria of the different degrees of evidence of causality. Limitations of the studies include few participants, use of different diagnostic criteria and a poor description of the exposure. It is concluded that moderate evidence was found for a relationship between kneeling, heavy lifting and kneeOA. For the combination of kneeling/squatting and heavy lifting the association seemed stronger than for kneeling/squatting or heavy lifting alone, but only a few studies were found concerning this relationship. Therefore the degree of evidence for a causal relationship was considered to be moderate. In the studies on the association between kneeOA and climbing stairs or ladders, there was an increased risk for kneeOA, but only a few studies were found and no dose\u2014response relationship has been investigated. The evidence of a causal relationship is therefore considered to be limited.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Aim: Understanding large scale patterns in trait variation in climbing plants (lianas, vines, scramblers, twiners) is important for the development of a stronger theoretical understanding of climbing plant ecology and for more applied issues such as prediction of community assembly under changing climatic conditions. We compared values of five key functional traits for 388 species of climbing plant from tropical and temperate regions of Australia to quantify variation between these two biogeographic regions. Location: Australia. Methods: Data on dispersal mode, growth habit, leaf form, leaf size and seed mass were compiled from field measurements and published sources. Comparative analyses were performed in three ways: (1) across species where each species was treated as an independent data point, (2) using evolutionary divergence analyses for each trait, and (3) in multidimensional space using a matrix of similarities between species. Results: Tropical climbing plants had 22-fold greater seed mass and four times greater leaf size than did temperate species. Tropical climbers were more likely to be woody (63%) than were temperate species (40%). Surprisingly we found a similar proportion of animal-dispersed seeds in the two regions, although we expected animal-dispersed seeds to be more prevalent in the tropics. We also found similar proportions of simple- and compound-leaved species between the two regions. All of our findings were consistent between cross-species and phylogenetic analyses indicating that patterns in present-day species are reflected in the evolutionary history of Australian climbers. Multivariate analyses suggested that there is a spectrum of variation among climbing plants, with tropical species having greater seed mass, leaf size and woody growth compared with temperate climbing plant species. Main conclusions: Tropical and temperate climbers of Australia exhibit a mixture of similar and contrasting traits and ecological strategies. Understanding strategy variation along latitudinal gradients will be particularly informative for predicting ecosystem and community structure with climate change.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Modern American rock climbing is characterized by (1) a motivation or reward structure that encourages the continual creation of new climbs, and (2) a finite and exhaustible medium in which to create them. These two characteristics provide a theoretical explanation for the pattern of deliberate normative change observed in climbing. The theory can be modeled by a simple differential equation, which is shown to be generally consistent with time series data for a number of American climbing areas. On the basis of the theory, predictions about future normative changes are suggested. It is possible that the theory may be generalized to other social activities sharing the two characteristics mentioned above, such as science.\n      </p>", "Leaf phenology in a population of the climbing fern Lygodium venustum was observed during a 31-month period in Veracruz, Mexico. The study site is located 100-200 m from the Gulf coast in the understory of a semideciduous lowland forest dominated by trees of Enterolobium and Ficus. Four leaf parameters: leaf growth of main and secondary axes, number of living leaves, leaf production and leaf mortality were scored monthly and correlated with two climatic factors: monthly mean temperature and precipitation. Sixty percent of the 37 individuals were supported on lianas, dead wood or shrubs. Smaller, unsupported plants with a height of less than 2.5 m had a mean number of 1.9 \u00b1 0.27 leaves and produced 3.7 \u00b1 0.52 leaves per year and did not become fertile. Over 50 % of the leaves died within the first 3 months, whereas over 10% lived for 12 to 30 months, resulting in a mean leaf life span of 5.6 \u00b1 0.7 months. All leaf parameters were seasonal with the exception of the growth of the main axes. During the rainy season, leaf growth of secondary axes and leaf mortality increased approximately threefold and leaf production rose twofold. Correlations between climatic factors and leaf parameters were strongest within a time lag of one month. The strongest correlation was found between precipitation and the growth of secondary axes, indicating that water is the limiting factor. One to five dormant buds developed on 17.7% of the leaves contributing to 40.3% of the total leaf growth. The potentially long life span of the climbing leaves and the outgrowing dormant buds make this species a successful pioneer in disturbed vegetation and a competitive weed in Mexican vanilla plantations.\n      </p>", "Aim: Climbing plants (lianas, vines, scramblers) are under-represented in many global datasets that underpin knowledge in functional trait biology, important for ecological theory, conservation and predicting forest dynamics under global change. To address this omission, we tested a set of hypotheses about how the traits of climbers vary with latitude and climate and amongst major biogeographical regions of the world using a comprehensive new, global dataset. Location: Global. Methods: Data on seed mass, leaf size, specific leaf area, climbing mechanism, dispersal mode, and growth habit were compiled for 1092 species in 34 countries. For each trait we: (1) quantified the strength of latitudinal gradients using analyses cross species and across evolutionary divergences, (2) examined underlying relationships between trait variation and climate variables, (3) tested for phylogenetic signal in traits (the tendency for closely related species to exhibit similar traits), and (4) compared trait variation and phylogenetic clustering between four major biogeographical regions of the world (Africa, the Americas, Asia and Australasia). Results: We found highly significant relationships between latitude and four traits (growth habit, leaf size, seed mass and specific leaf area, SLA). Leaf size, seed mass and SLA also showed significant relationships with mean annual temperature and precipitation. However, no relationship was found between dispersal mode and latitude or between climbing mechanism and latitude. These results were largely consistent in cross-species and phylogenetic analyses. All traits, except seed mass, exhibited clear differences between biogeographical regions. SLA and seed mass were the only two traits that did not present a significant phylogenetic signal. Phylogenetic clustering was detected in species from the Americas and Africa, indicating that trait conservatism is important in broad biogeographical regions. Main conclusions: The functional traits and phylogenetic patterns of climbers differ between biogeographical regions, and from other better-studied plant growth forms. Species-level trait differences may hold the key to understanding why climbers are increasing in abundance in some regions of the world, but not in others.\n      </p>", "Old World climbing fern is one of the most invasive plants in natural areas of central and southern Florida. The fern spreads across the landscape by wind-blown spores and invades isolated and undisturbed habitats such as interior portions of the Florida Everglades. Land managers in Florida have reported that multiple herbicide treatments are required to control the fern, which could indicate that herbicides do not translocate throughout the plant in long-established populations. We conducted a greenhouse study to determine the absorption and translocation patterns in Old World climbing fern using the three herbicides most commonly used for management of this plant by land managers in Florida.Using \u00b9\u2074C-labeled herbicides, we evaluated absorption and translocation of glyphosate (2.25 kg ai ha\u00b9\u2071 ), metsulfuron (0.10 kg ai ha\u00b9\u2071), and triclopyr (1.68 kg ai ha\u00b9\u2071) in Old World climbing fern using five different application scenarios (cut-and-spray, basal spray, 25% foliar spray, 50% foliar spray, and 100% foliar spray). Triclopyr was absorbed to the greatest extent (60.3%) of applied radioactive compounds compared to glyphosate (31.2%) and metsulfuron (19.8%). The majority of radioactivity remained in treated leaves for all herbicides with only small percentages of the absorbed radioactivity being detected in other plant parts. All three herbicides translocated acropetally and basipitally to some extent.Radioactivity, for the most part, translocated evenly throughout the plants but the greatest amount of radioactivity derived from triclopyr occurred in rhizomes when the cut-and-spray and basal applications were used. The radioactivity in rhizomes derived from glyphosate was greater in those treated using cut-and-spray. Based on autoradiographs, there was limited horizontal movement of any herbicide in the rhizomes of Old World climbing fern which could explain why resprouts are observed several weeks following treatment.\n      </p>", "Lygodium microphyllum is native to wet tropical and subtropical Africa, Asia, Australia, and the Pacific islands. The genus Lygodium is taxonomically isolated and has only one native species in North America. Specialized natural enemies of L. microphyllum are predicted to exist that can be safely employed to control the fern in Florida, where it is a severe problem.\n      </p>", "Question: In a southern temperate rain forest, we addressed three questions: (1) Does the abundance of climbing plants increase with light availability? (2) Do host tree species differ in their susceptibility to vine infestation? (3) How does the relationship between host tree trunk diameter and relative abundance of vines vary with their climbing mechanism? Location: Two sites in the temperate evergreen rain forest of southern Chile: Puyehue (40\u00b039\u0282\u2032S, 72\u00b009\u0282\u2032W; 350 m a. s. 1.) and Pastahue (42\u00b022\u0282\u2032S, 73\u00b049\u0282\u2032W; 285m a. s. 1). Methods: We sampled vines in 60 25-m\u00b2 plots, with 20 plots in each of three light environments: mature forest, forest edges and canopy gaps. In each plot, for every tree \u2265 1.50-m tall of any diameter we counted and identified all climbing plant individuals at a height of 1.30 m. We also counted, measured (trunk diameter at 1.30 m) and identified all these trees, and determined prevalence of vine infestation for each tree species. Results: Light availability in forest plots did not affect vine abundance when the number and size of host trees was taken into account. Overall, vine abundance increased with host tree trunk diameter. Tree species did not differ in the prevalence of vine infestation. The relative abundance of stem twiners and adhesive climbers decreased and increased with trunk diameter, respectively. The densities of stem twiners and adhesive climbers were negatively correlated across the forest. Conclusion: We provide further evidence that the pattern of vine abundance is independent of light availability in southern temperate rain forests, in contrast to results commonly reported for tropical rain forests. We also show that support suitability across the forest varies with the mechanism by which vines climb, probably due in part to biomechanical constraints and in part to vine interspecific competition, a virtually unexplored ecological factor.\n      </p>", "The characteristics of \"climbing\" in the sense of locomotion or posture on three-dimensional substrates are discussed from a biomechanical viewpoint. For this purpose, the mechanical conditions of the most widely spread modes of locomotion or gaits used in arboreal surroundings are reviewed. This allows precise identification of morphological characteristics of traits that are advantageous, and therefore have a positive selective value. Further, at least some of the environmental and substrate characteristics that need to be present for using a specific gait, are noted. It turns out that the extremity which is placed lower on the substrate, has to carry a higher load. If this extremity is consistently the hindlimb \u2014 which actually is the case in primates, because of understandable, though complex reasons \u2014 a division of labor is likely to occur between the limbs: the hindlimb becoming stronger and the forelimb weaker, but more versatile. A very specific, and advantageous feature of the primates is their possession of prehensile hands and feet. That means the autopodia are able (1) to produce by themselves, without the aid of body weight, very high frictional resistance, and (2) to transmit tensile forces as well as torsional moments on the substrate. The above-mentioned division of labor between fore- and hindlimbs implies that the former make the first contacts with and explore the properties of parts of the environment. As a next step, prehensile hands on long arms may easily replace length and mobility of the neck in getting hold of food items. So very characteristic traits of human body shape can be derived to a large extent from the necessities of arboreal locomotion: Prehensile hands, long arms, concentration of body weight on the hindlimbs, shortness of the trunk in comparison to limb length. Die Besonderheiten des \u201eKletterns\u201d, im Sinne eines Aufenthaltes und der Fortbewegung auf dreidimensionalen Substraten werden auf ihre biomechanischen Bedingungen hin untersucht. Zu diesem Ziel wird die Biomechanik derjenigen Bewegungsweisen und der Gangarten revidiert, die h\u00e4ufig auf B\u00e4umen Verwendung finden. Herausgearbeitet werden die Ver\u00e4nderungen, die sich aus den drei Dimensionen des arborealen Biotops gegen\u00fcber dem ebenen Untergrund ergeben. Das erlaubt eine genaue Identifikation derjenigen morphologischen Merkmale, die f\u00fcr baumlebende Tiere vorteilhaft sind und deshalb positiven Selektionswert haben. Schlie\u00dflich werden die wichtigsten Eigenschaften der Substrate vermerkt, die f\u00fcr die Nutzung bestimmter Locomotionsweisen erforderlich sind. Auf diejenigen Gliedma\u00dfen, die auf dem Substrat weiter unten plaziert werden, entf\u00e4llt ein h\u00f6herer Anteil der K\u00f6rperlast. Wenn diese Gliedma\u00dfen regelm\u00e4\u00dfig die hinteren sind \u2014 was bei Primaten aus plausiblen Gr\u00fcnden die Regel darstellt \u2014 liegt eine Arbeitsteilung zwischen den Gliedma\u00dfen nahe: die Hinterbeine werden dann st\u00e4rker und die Vorderbeine schw\u00e4cher, die Vordergliedma\u00dfen k\u00f6nnen aber damit auch vielseitiger einsetzbar werden. Ein sehr spezielles und f\u00fcr das Baumleben vorteilhaftes Merkmal der Primaten sind ihre Greifh\u00e4nde und -f\u00fc\u00dfe. Durch ihre Greiff\u00e4higkeit werden die Autopodien instand gesetzt, 1.) aus sich selbst heraus, ohne Einwirkung des K\u00f6rpergewichts, sehr hohe Reibungswiderst\u00e4nde am Substrat zu erzeugen, und 2.) Zugkr\u00e4fte und vor allem Drehmomente vom Substrat auf den K\u00f6rper zu \u00fcbertragen. Die oben erw\u00e4hnte Arbeitsteilung zwischen Vorder- und Hintergliedma\u00dfen f\u00fchrt dazu, da\u00df die ersten Kontakte zur Umwelt und die ersten Untersuchungen von Teilen derselben mit den H\u00e4nden durchgef\u00fchrt werden. Die Greifh\u00e4nde an langen Armen k\u00f6nnen die gro\u00dfe Reichweite eines langen Halses ersetzen, wenn es darum geht, Nahrungsbestandteile zu erreichen. So sind typisch menschliche Merkmale durch die Notwendigkeiten der Fortbewegung auf B\u00e4umen bedingt: Die Greifh\u00e4nde, die langen Arme, die \u00dcbertragung des K\u00f6rpergewichts auf die Hinterbeine, K\u00fcrze des Rumpfes im Verh\u00e4ltnis zur L\u00e4nge der Gliedma\u00dfen.

By use of spectrally resolved pump-probe measurements, we directly observed the induced absorption lines caused by excited vibrational populations up to v = 6. In some cases, we also observed stimulated emission, providing direct evidence of vibrational population inversion. This study provides important spectroscopic parameters on the CO stretch in the strong-field regime, such as transition frequencies and dephasing times up to the v = 6 to v = 7 vibrational transition. We measured equally spaced vibrational transitions, in agreement with the energy levels of a Morse potential up to v = 6. It is interesting that the integral of the differential absorption spectra was observed to deviate far from zero, in contrast to what one would expect from a simple one-dimensional Morse model assuming a linear dependence of dipole moment with bond length.\n      </p>", "1. Spiders are the most sexually size dimorphic terrestrial animals and the evolution of this dimorphism is controversial. Patterns of sexual size dimorphism (SSD) in spiders have been related to individual performance and size. In 2002 Moya-Lara\u00f1o, Halaj &amp; Wise proposed the ' gravity hypothesis' to explain patterns of sexual size dimorphism in spiders whereby species building webs high in the vegetation are predicted to show greater SSD than those that build lower down. They advocated an advantage in climbing speed in smaller males searching for females in high places. The gravity hypothesis predicts a negative relationship between male size and climbing speed. In 2007 Brandt &amp; Andrade questioned this interpretation and proposed that the pattern of SSD in spiders is better explained by an advantage for larger males of low-dwelling species to run faster along the ground. 2. We induced male spiders to run a standard distance up vertical poles of different diameters to examine the predicted relationship between size and climbing speed. We tested two species of extremely size-dimorphic orb-web spiders, Argiope keyserlingi and Nephila plumipes, that differ in the height at which females tend to build webs, and one species of jumping spider, Jacksonoides queenslandica, with low levels of size dimorphism. We also examined morphological determinants of horizontal motility by inducing males to run along a raceway. 3. Substrate diameter was consistently found to influence climbing performance. In N. plumipes, climbing speed was slowest on the widest diameter substrate. In A. keyserlingi, size-adjusted leg length and substrate diameter interacted to determine climbing speed, while in J. queenslandica, there was an interaction between body size and substrate diameter on climbing speed. In the effect of substrate diameter, we have identified a potential bias in previous tests of the gravity hypothesis. 4. Our results do not support the prediction of the gravity hypothesis. There was no evidence of a negative relationship between body size and climbing speed in the two orb-web species with high levels of SSD. Our results are also not consistent with a recent modification of the gravity hypothesis that suggests a curvilinear relationship between climbing speed and size. 5. Body size was positively associated with maximum running speed only in the cursorial hunter J. queenslandica. For this spider, results are more consistent with Brandt &amp; Andrade's explanation for variation in SSD in spiders, that larger males are selected for superior running ability in low-dwelling species, rather than selection for smaller size for climbing to females in high-dwelling species.\n      </p>", "Autoradiography demonstrated prominent retrograde labeling of olivocerebellar climbing fiber neurons after injection of tritiated D-aspartate into the rat cerebellar cortex or deep nuclei.

The long-term costs of this evasive defense are not fully understood, but prior studies have documented negative consequences for terrestrial locomotion and foraging. In this study, we investigated the impact of leg loss upon locomotion in adult harvestmen (Leiobunum spp.). In southeastern Virginia, these harvestmen regularly climb vegetation and occupy perches on tree trunks, branches, and leaves that are often 1-2 m or more above the ground. In our study, we measured walking and climbing speeds for individuals with 5, 6, 7, and 8 legs. The results of our field surveys conducted over three seasons revealed relatively high frequencies (36-63%) of leg loss. We also found that individuals with six legs occupied perches that were significantly lower in the understory than those with eight legs. In the lab, we observed significantly slower walking speeds for individuals missing one or more legs. We also found that individuals with five legs climb significantly slower than individuals with eight legs. On the bases of the observed frequencies of leg loss in the field, we infer that leg autotomy is a common (and effective) evasive tactic used by harvestmen. However, the reduction in walking and climbing speeds resulting from leg loss may also affect habitat selection, (e.g., perch height) and may ultimately reduce the survivorship of individuals in future encounters with predators.\n      </p>", "Climbing species of New World Piper have often been misidentified in the past because of immature or sterile material.

For reliable information transfer and storage, however, once established, synapses must be maintained stably. We investigated how chronic blockade of neuronal activity or \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors affects excitatory climbing fiber (CF) to Purkinje cell (PC) synapses in adult mouse cerebellum. Both treatments caused reduced glutamate concentration transient at the synaptic cleft, decreased frequency of quantal excitatory postsynaptic current, and diminished CF innervation of PC shaft dendrites but no change in CF's release probability. These results indicate that, in the mature cerebellum, AMPA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic activity maintains CF's functional glutamate-release sites and its innervation of PC shaft dendrites.\n      </p>", "The abundance and diversity of lianas were examined along a tropical forest chronosequence at the Barro Colorado Nature Monument, Panama. Lianas \u2265 0.5 cm diameter were sampled along transects in two replicated stands in secondary (20, 40, 70 and 100 y after abandonment) and old-growth (&gt; 500 y) forests. Ordination of stands based on relative abundance, but not presence-absence, showed a significant separation of stands by age. Lianas were significantly more abundant and diverse (Fisher's \u03b1) in younger forests (20 and 40 y) than in older forests (70 and 100 y, and old-growth). The decline in liana abundance with stand age was offset by increased mean basal area per individual, resulting in a relatively constant total basal area and estimated biomass across stand age. The proportions of tendril climbers decreased and stem twiners increased over stand age. Decline in liana abundance and changes in liana composition may be related to changes in support and light availability. Although lianas are recognized as playing an important role in the early secondary succession of many tropical forests, these results have shown that their important contribution to total basal area and biomass can continue as the forest matures, even as the number of established lianas declines.\n      </p>", "To explore the change from the horizontal quadrupedal walking to the vertical climbing in primates, I designed an experiment on an inclined substratum. The subjects were an adult male Japanese macaque and a 2-year-old female white-handed gibbon. The animals moved on a substratum made of bamboo pipe (8 cm diameter). The inclination of the substratum was changed from 15 degrees to 65 degrees in 5-degree increments for the Japanese macaque and from 20 degrees to 70 degrees with 10-degree increments for the white-handed gibbon. I placed surface electrodes and telemetry transmitters on the subjects to record the activity of the long head of the triceps brachii and the long head of the biceps brachii muscles. The Japanese macaque utilized horizontal quadrupedal walking until the incline was 15 degrees. Vertical climbing began at an inclination of 55 degrees. The intermediate locomotor mode was observed between 20 degrees and 50 degrees. The white-handed gibbon changed the locomotor mode from horizontal quadrupedal walking to vertical climbing at 40 degrees. I believe that the difference observed in locomotor mode between these two species was mainly due to differences in the intermembral index. The white-handed gibbon had a large intermembral index, which meant she had longer forelimbs and could therefore change locomotor mode at a lower inclination of the substratum. Die Ver\u00e4nderungen der Bewegungsabl\u00e4ufe zwischen dem Gehen auf mehr oder weniger horizontaler Unterlage und dem vertikalen Klettern bei Primaten wurden anhand von Versuchen mit geneigten Substraten untersucht.

The utility of such support structures on aboveground biomass accumulation and fruit production was demonstrated using the invasive climber, bridal creeper in three invaded nature reserves near Perth in Western Australia. Mean above-ground plant biomass for plots provided with trellises ranged from 204 \u00b1 38 g/m\u00b2 to 336 \u00b1 31 g/m\u00b2, whereas it ranged from 66 \u00b1 10 g/m\u00b2 to 118 \u00b1 10 g/m\u00b2 in plots with no trellises. The mean number of fruits/m\u00b2 produced on shoots in plots provided with trellises ranged from 424 \u00b1 159 to 3,787 \u00b1 873 and was up to almost four orders of magnitude greater than the number of fruits produced on plants in plots with no trellis (ranging from 0 to 5.25 \u00b1 7.9). The use of standardized trellises also showed that fruit volume and fruit seed number can vary significantly between sites. Standardized trellises have been installed at sites across Australia to assess the long-term impact of biological control agents introduced to manage bridal creeper.\n      </p>", "\"font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold;\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: normal; line-height: 14px; font-size: 12px;\"><a class=\"newWindow\" href=\"http://www.press.uchicago.edu/journals/e-books/processor/an.html\" title=\"This link opens in a new window\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"border: solid thin green\" alt=\"\" src=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1334331794933/AmNat.epub.gif\" /></a></span></p>\n<a href=\"http://www.press.uchicago.edu/journals/e-books/processor/an.html\" target=\"_blank\">Free to ASN Members!</a>\n<br />\n", "\"font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold;\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: normal; line-height: 14px; font-size: 12px;\"><a class=\"newWindow\" href=\"http://www.press.uchicago.edu/journals/e-books/processor/an.html\" title=\"This link opens in a new window\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"border: solid thin green\" alt=\"\" src=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1334331794933/AmNat.epub.gif\" /></a></span></p>\n<a href=\"http://www.press.uchicago.edu/journals/e-books/processor/an.html\" target=\"_blank\">Free to ASN Members!</a>\n<br />\n", "", "\"font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold;\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: normal; line-height: 14px; font-size: 12px;\"><a class=\"newWindow\" href=\"http://www.press.uchicago.edu/journals/e-books/processor/an.html\" title=\"This link opens in a new window\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"border: solid thin green\" alt=\"\" src=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1334331794933/AmNat.epub.gif\" /></a></span></p>\n<a href=\"http://www.press.uchicago.edu/journals/e-books/processor/an.html\" target=\"_blank\">Free to ASN Members!</a>\n<br />\n", "\"font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold;\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: normal; line-height: 14px; font-size: 12px;\"><a class=\"newWindow\" href=\"http://www.press.uchicago.edu/journals/e-books/processor/an.html\" title=\"This link opens in a new window\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"border: solid thin green\" alt=\"\" src=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1334331794933/AmNat.epub.gif\" /></a></span></p>\n<a href=\"http://www.press.uchicago.edu/journals/e-books/processor/an.html\" target=\"_blank\">Free to ASN Members!</a>\n<br />\n", "", "Aim: To examine, at a global scale, patterns in the direction in which climbing plants twine. We tested three hypotheses: (1) that twining direction is determined randomly; (2) that twining direction is determined by apices following the apparent movement of the sun across the sky; and (3) that twining direction is determined by the Coriolis effect. Location: Seventeen sites spanning nine countries, both hemispheres and 650 of latitude. Methods: Twining direction was recorded for the first c. 100 stems encountered along transects through natural vegetation at each site. Results: Ninety-two per cent of the 1485 twining stems we recorded grew in righthanded helices, i.e. they twined in an anticlockwise direction. This is significantly (P &lt; 0.001) different from random. The proportion of stems twining right-handedly (anticlockwise) was independent of both latitude (P = 0.33) and hemisphere (P = 0.63). These data are inconsistent with the idea that twining direction is determined by either the relative passage of the sun through the celestial sphere or by the Coriolis effect. Thus, we reject all three of our hypotheses. Main conclusions: The predominance of right-handed helical growth in climbing plants cannot be explained by hypotheses attempting to link plant growth behaviour and global location. One alternative hypothesis for our findings is that the widespread phenomenon of anticlockwise twining arises as a function of microtubule orientation operating at a subcellular level.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Each hectare was subdivided into 10 m \u00d7 10 m quadrats, in which all lianas \u2265 1 cm d.b.h. were measured, tagged and identified. The total liana density was 11, 200 individuals (373 ha-1) and species richness was 75 species, representing 66 genera and 37 families. The richness estimators employed for species and family accumulation curves after 100 times randomization of sample order, have stabilized the curves at 16th and 15th hectares, respectively. A greater proportion of lianas was twiners (55% of species and 44.4% of density) and root climbers (5% of species and 14% of density), and a few were tendril climbers, reflecting the late successional stage of the forest. In the size-class distribution, 82% of abundance and 97% of species richness fell within 1-3 cm diameter threshold. The dominance of succulent diaspore type signifies the faunal dependence of lianas on vertebrate frugivores for dispersal. The diversity, population density and family composition of lianas of our site is compared with those of other tropical forests. The need for biomonitoring of this synusia in the permanent plot for forest functioning is emphasized.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Corticolous myxomycetes of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park were studied in relation to their association with certain tree species and height of occurrence in the forest canopy. Using the double-rope climbing method, bark was collected at 3 m increments to the tops of trees of five different species. Bark samples from 25 trees were used to prepare 418 moist chamber cultures maintained and observed 4 wk. Eighty-four myxomycete species were identified, including 30 species not known to occur in the park. Tree species, pH, height in tree and water-holding capacity of the bark samples were analyzed to determine the relationships of myxomycete assemblages cultured on the bark. Results suggested that myxomycete community composition among selected tree species were similar, but occurrence and abundance of certain species were related to differences in bark pH. Community similarity values among trees of different species show that trees with the most similar myxomycete communities also have the most similar bark pH. Most myxomycete species in this study have a pH optimum. No variation in species richness was detected at different heights in the trees, and most species were obtained at all heights up to at least 24 m. The water-holding capacity of the bark could not be correlated with species richness or abundance of myxomycetes that inhabit the bark of living trees. This is the first study to characterize myxomycete communities of tree canopies.\n      </p>", "Cerebellar Purkinje cells are known to receive strong excitatory input from two major pathways originating outside the cerebellum and inhibitory input from two types of neurons in the cerebellar cortex. The functions and synaptic strengths of these pathways are only partially known. We have used the patch-clamp technique applied to Purkinje cells in thin slices of rat cerebellum to measure directly the postsynaptic currents arising from the two major excitatory pathways and one of the inhibitory inputs. Inhibitory synaptic currents occur spontaneously with high frequency and are variable in amplitude, ranging, in our recording conditions with high internal Cl-, from less than 100 pA to more than 1 nA. These currents are blocked by the \u03b3-aminobutyrate type A antagonist bicuculline. One of the excitatory inputs is all or none. For threshold stimulation, the synaptic current is either full amplitude, when the presynaptic fiber is successfully stimulated, or completely absent. This synaptic current is often larger than 1 nA and is virtually eliminated by 2 \u03bc M 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, a blocking agent thought to be specific for glutamate receptors that are not of the N-methyl-D-aspartate type. Its all-or-none character identifies it as arising from a climbing-fiber synapse. The other excitatory input produces a synaptic current that is smoothly graded as a function of stimulus intensity. This response we believe arises from the stimulation of mossy fibers or granule cells. The synaptic current associated with this input is also largely eliminated by 2 \u03bc M 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione.\n      </p>", "Climbers have arisen independently in three groups of Ficus. They have specialized leptocaul progress in two ways. The strangling habit has been modified into epiphytic climbing in subgen. Urostigma (5 spp. of climber) and subgen. Ficus sect. Sycidium subsect. Palaeomorphe (4 spp. of climber). The systematic origin of these nine species is fairly clear. F. subulata is a stoloniferous climber building epiphytic thickets. In contrast, ground-based root-climbing with the evolution of bathyphylls distinguishes the whole of subgen. Ficus sect. Rhizocladus (57 spp.) and sect. Kalosyce (20 spp.). Their origin is not clear. The more pachycaul Bornean F. spiralis suggests derivation from the ancestry of sect. Ficus ser. Cariceae and ser. Podosyceae by modification of the pachycaul tree. Stranglers apart, fig-climbers appear to be an Indo-Malesian distinction. F. rhopalosycia Diels is redescribed.\n      </p>", "A recently discovered skeleton of Ptilodus exhibits several specializations for climbing. A survey of postcranial bones of Cretaceous and early Cenozoic multituberculates from North America reveals similar locomotor specializations. Multituberculates possessed distinctive tarsal adaptations for a range of pedal mobility characteristic of arboreal mammals that descend trees headfirst. The divergent hallux could move independently of the other digits. The long robust tail of Ptilodus possessed musculoskeletal features that, among living mammals, are associated with prehensility.\n      </p>", "1. Rock climbing enjoys enormous popularity world-wide. As a consequence, the anthropogenic pressure on the vegetation of formerly undisturbed cliff ecosystems is continuously increasing. 2. The impact of rock climbing on population structure and genetic variation of the rare plant species Draba aizoides was investigated representatively for many other typical central European cliff plants. Populations from eight climbed and from eight pristine cliffs were compared through the use of vertical transect analyses and molecular markers. 3. Population structure differed between climbed and pristine cliffs. Individuals of D. aizoides were significantly smaller and less frequent on climbed compared with pristine cliffs. On plateau sites, the species' occurrence was unaffected by climbing activities; it was significantly less frequent on the faces, but more frequent on the tali of climbed in comparison with pristine cliffs. 4. Genetic variation was greater in populations from climbed compared with pristine cliffs, and genetic differentiation was stronger between subpopulations from pristine cliffs than between subpopulations from climbed cliffs. 5. Synthesis and applications. Rock climbing clearly affects population structure and genetic variation of D. aizoides. Seed dispersal is presumably enhanced by rock climbers but climbers remove and drop plant individuals from cliff faces, which causes a downward shift in population structure. This shift in turn reduces genetic differentiation between upper and lower subpopulations. In mountain regions that attract sport climbing, conservation management plans should therefore always ensure the provision of completely unclimbed cliffs to protect the native vegetation.\n      </p>", "This study investigated the relationship between the abundance and size of D. polyacanthos and measures of forest canopy structure. V\u00e1rzea and terra firme forest were selected for study at the mouth of the Amazon estuary, Par\u00e1, Brazil. The forest canopy characteristics investigated included individual tree height and height to base of the live portion of the crown, forest canopy depth (the distance from the lowest foliage in the understory to the top of the canopy including all free space between top and bottom), forest canopy thickness (the portion of the forest canopy depth occupied only by foliage) and forest canopy density (the sum of lengths of each of the individual crowns that make up forest canopy depth) (see Fig. 2b). The attributes of D. polyacanthos measured included leaf number, stem height and percent coverage within the stands. Results from this study suggest that D. polyacanthos can be encouraged to grow through selective cutting of canopy trees and promotion of regenerating forest stands on terra firme fallow. The protocol used to relate D. polyacanthos abundance and size to kind of forest canopy structure can be used for evaluation of other climbing palms. /// Bot\u00e2nica Econ\u00f4mica.

Os atributos de D. polyacanthos meridos inclu\u00edram n\u00famero de folhas, altura do tronco e percentual de cobertura dentro do povoamento. Os resultados desse estudo sugerem que D. polyacantos pode ser estimulado a crescer atrav\u00e9s do corte seletivo de \u00e1rvores que ocupam o dossel da floresta e da promo\u00e7\u00e3o da regenera\u00e7\u00e3o florestal em \u00e1reas de pousio (resultante de uso agr\u00edcola) na terra firme.
