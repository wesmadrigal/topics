The results of a longitudinal study dealing with this issues will be discussed in this manuscript. The energy conceptions of the Physics students were analyzed by means of a two-part written questionnaire that was presented to the same group on their first day of class for four years running. The most important findings of this study can be summarized as follows. Despite their pre-service training, future physics high school teachers: Hold a number of different alternative conceptual frameworks when describing physical situations, instead or besides the accepted scientific concept. Mostly think that energy is a concrete entity and not an abstract idea. Mostly do not accept the idea of energy degradation.

From 1929 to 1947, this school flourished by the training of some of its members in European research centers, followed by research activity on x-ray spectrography, radioactivity, and nuclear physics at home. This project was supported by grants awarded by the Board for National Education created in 1929, and then the Institute for High Culture, established in 1936 during the period of Salazar's dictatorship. While the success of the Laboratory of Physics as a research school in a so-called peripheral context follows Gerald Geison's criteria, these criteria are unable to account for its dissolution. Its example illuminates how the interactions of a research school with its immediate social, academic, and political environments may be important to take into consideration. We offer a new historiographical interpretation of the events behind the dissolution of the Laboratory of Physics. Contrary to the received view, we argue that these events were not strictly political, and that discussions within the Faculty of Sciences on the role of scientific research, and on scientific policy generally, generated a hostile academic environment which played a leading role in the dissolution. Finally, we highlight the advantages of rethinking the concept of \"periphery\" as a perspective, following the suggestion of Gavroglu and colleagues.\n      </p>", "Minority student attrition and underachievement is a long-standing and widespread concern in higher education. It is especially acute in introductory science courses which are prerequisites for students planning to pursue science-related careers. Poor performance in these courses often results in attrition of minorities from the science fields. This is a particular concern at selective universities where minority students enter with excellent academic credentials but receive lower average grades and have lower retention rates than majority students with similar credentials. This paper reports the first year results of a large scale peerfacilitated workshop program designed to increase performance and retention in Biology, Chemistry, and Physics at a selective research university. After adjusting for grade point average or SAT-Math score, workshop participants earned higher final grades than nonparticipants in Biology and Chemistry, but not in Physics. Similar effects on retention were found. While, positive effects of the program were observed in both majority and minority students, effect sizes were generally largest for minority students.

Although physics majors outperform nonphysics majors significantly in the test, their own performance is by no means satisfactory on criterion referenced terms. Items incorrectly answered by over 40% of the teachers are listed with corrections given.

Contrary to the idea that Francoist policy was indifferent if not hostile to modern science, and that ideology did not go deeper than the rhetorical surface, we discuss the ways in which the physical sciences took advantage of, and in turn were used by, the regime to promote international relations, further the autarkic economy, and ultimately generate power. In order to understand what physics meant within the National Catholic political order, we contrast the situation in the post\u2013Civil War decades with the situation before the war. First we discuss how the war transformed the physicists\u2019 community, molding it around certain key fields. We then turn to the work of right-wing ideologues and conservative scientists and philosophers, who stressed the spiritual dimension of the discipline and argued for the integration of science into the Christian scheme of the world. The cultural realignment of the discipline coincided with the institutional changes that harnessed physics to the military and economic needs of the autarkic state, which we discuss in the final section. To conclude, we reflect upon the demise of autarkic physics in the late 1960s and the overall implications of our argument with regard to the development of physics in Spain.\n      </p>", "In this study, we review the development and application of multi-physics and multiscale coupling in the construction of whole-heart physiological models.

Within these physiological domains, we demonstrate and discuss the importance of model parametrization, imaging-based model anatomy and computational implementation.\n      </p>", "Research has shown that female students cannot profit as much as male students can from cooperative learning in physics, especially in mixed-gender dyads. This study has explored the influence of partner gender on female students' learning achievement, interaction and the problem-solving process during cooperative learning. In Shanghai, a total of 50 students (26 females and 24 males), drawn from two classes of a high school, took part in the study. Students were randomly paired, and there were three research groups: mixed-gender dyads (MG), female-female dyads (FF) and male-male dyads (MM). Analysis of students' pre- and post-test performances revealed that female students in the single-gender condition solved physics problems more effectively than did those in the mixed-gender condition, while the same was not the case for male students. We further explored the differences between female and male communication styles, and content among the three research groups. It showed that the females' interaction content and problem-solving processes were more sensitive to partner gender than were those for males. This might explain why mixed-gender cooperation in physics disadvantages females in high schools.\n      </p>", "1:1 laptop programs, in which every student is provided with a personal computer to use during the school year, permit increased and routine use of powerful, user-friendly computer-based tools. Growing numbers of 1:1 programs are reshaping the roles of teachers and learners in science classrooms. At the Denver School of Science and Technology, a public charter high school where a large percentage of students come from low-income families, 1:1 laptops are used often by teachers and students. This article describes the school's use of laptops, the Internet, and related digital tools, especially for teaching and learning physics. The data are from teacher and student surveys, interviews, classroom observations, and document analyses. Physics students and teachers use an interactive digital textbook; Internet-based simulations (some developed by a Nobel Prize winner); word processors; digital drop boxes; email; formative electronic assessments; computer-based and stand-alone graphing calculators; probes and associated software; and digital video cameras to explore hypotheses, collaborate, engage in scientific inquiry, and to identify strengths and weaknesses of students' understanding of physics.

Novices were ninth-grade students with no background in physics; experts were two postgraduates in physics and two advanced physics graduate students. Problems were multiple choice, with one correct response and three alternative responses representing possible misconceptions. For each conceptual physics problem, an isomorphic material-substance problem was constructed by imagining a materialistic conception of the physics topic and creating the resulting version of the problem. In each physics problem, one of the incorrect choices corresponded to the correct choice in the isomorphic material-substance problem. The empirical question was whether novices would reason about the physics problem as if it were conceptually similar to the substance isomorph. This question was addressed by comparing subjects' responses in the problem pairs, as well as by examining their explanations concerning all problems. A content analysis of subjects' explanations revealed that physics novices were strongly inclined to conceptualize physics concepts as material substances, whereas expert protocols revealed distinctly nonmaterialistic representations. A theory of conceptual change involving ontologically distinct categories is substantiated by these findings.\n      </p>", "Only 750 physics doctorates were awarded to American students during 1990-1991 from a population base of over 248 million people.

Key ingredients include graduate student recruiting, motivational activities to promote the excitement of being a professional scientist, and a reeducation of employers to look more favorably toward hiring students from the basic sciences.

Such research was already, however, largely based on the use of particle accelerators, and to acquire one demanded money and resources on a scale unprecedented in Australian scientific experience. Australian attempts during the period 1935\u20131960 to build accelerators or to acquire them by other means are described. The difficulties that Australian physicists faced in this connection and the strategies by which they sought to overcome them are considered. Three stages of development are identified: an initial period of small-scale initiatives in the 1930s, a postwar period of \u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d accelerator building, and finally a growing practice of buying machines \u201coff the shelf\u201d from commercial suppliers.\n      </p>", "Computing in high-energy physics relied on large computers and dedicated central facilities in the 1960s and 1970s. With the advent of colliding-beam accelerators, minicomputers, and microcomputers in the 1980s, physicists elaborated a new decentralized model of computing in high-energy physics. They restored control to and autonomy of their analysis of physics data, while simultaneously replacing large computers with farms, or clusters of microprocessors custom-built for their tasks. This new division of labor has become dominant in scientific collaborations in other fields and is presented here in the context of the culture of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, which was a crucible for the creative efforts required to disseminate computing power to users. Fermilab, the last National Accelerator Laboratory, came on line as federal expenditures for high-energy physics ebbed in the 1970s and 1980s.\n      </p>", "Several earlier investigations found that teaching standard textbook physics causes only moderate change in qualitative understanding. Many investigations have tried to explain why teaching textbook physics results in so little learning of qualitative physics. In contrast, we examined cases where learning did occur and tried to understand them, hoping that this might help us to understand how to support such learning. We developed computerized simulation models of both qualitative, conceptual problem solving and quantitative problem solving and used them to assess changes in students' qualitative knowledge as they learned textbook physics. In many cases, qualitative knowledge has been acquired on the basis of information explicitly presented in the textbook. We also found cases, however, where learning of qualitative physics took place on the basis of information only implicitly addressed in the instruction. Even more important, in various cases, this newly acquired qualitative knowledge led to a less frequent use of incorrect qualitative preknowledge. This suggests that successful students not only learn what has been explicitly presented in the instruction but also learn by deriving and constructing information left implicit in the instruction, relating this information to their preknowledge and possibly refining and modifying their preknowledge in those cases where conflicts became salient.\n      </p>", "In the 20th century the infiltration of scientific elements into philosophical currents not only reached its maximum, but also science itself became a \"philosophical factor\". We look at these processes in physics starting from the fall of mechanistic philosophy. The advent of relativity theory and quantum mechanics has changed physics as science and raised a host of philosophical questions. Traditionally philosophical questions concerning space, time and causality cannot be any longer considered with no help of these theories. Relativistic cosmology and its observational successes in the last decades of the century, for the first time in the history of human thought, provided a global framework for both science and philosophy. And the current search for the final unifying theory of physics leads directly to the most foundational questions of an ontological character. We argue that the success of the 20th century physics strongly suggests a kind of structuralist ontology. /// No s\u00e9culo XX, a infiltra\u00e7\u00e3o de elementos cient\u00edficos nas correntes filos\u00f3ficas n\u00e3o s\u00f3 alcan\u00e7ou o seu m\u00e1ximo, mas tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 verdade que a pr\u00f3pria ci\u00eancia se tornou um \"factor filos\u00f3fico\".

One issue debated and negotiated by academics, scholarly societies, and research patrons has been whether the journal was a public good, a private commodity, or some combination of the two. In physics, discussion of the economic status of the journal, as explored here for the journals of the American Institute of Physics, occurred in concert with the initial creation of the page-charge pricing mechanism in the 1930s, its enlarged role during the Cold War, and its diminished influence starting in the 1970s. Several factors influenced how much revenue the page charge generated. Some were obvious, such as the generosity of the research patronage; others less so, such as dominant economic metaphors, administrative decisions made by taxing and postal authorities, and changes in intellectual property law. This paper chronicles the use of the page-charge pricing mechanism for physics journals so as to reveal the often hidden, yet heated, pursuit to define the journal as an object that creates benefits for, and deserves financing from, the public at large, scholars, and research patrons.\n      </p>", "This paper looks at the ways in which popular science books, through their explicit insertion of science into the public domain, act to reinforce a distinct demarcation between scientists and their publics. It is argued that these books acquire a distributed media presence by acting as nodal points in an intertextual web. The intertextuality of popular science books causes images of science which are supportive of scientists' interests to continue to circulate in public discourse despite the alternative images thrown up by public scientific controversies reported in the news. The paper looks at examples of popular physics books which, like many other popularizations of physics, draw explicitly on science fiction. Since these texts do not respond to any specific controversy within or around science, they provide examples of 'routine' boundary work. It is argued that by working at multiple boundaries, texts such as these are able to claim potentially contradictory attributes for science at the same time as sustaining its place at the top of a hierarchy of ways of knowing.\n      </p>", "A method of assessment, involving six one-hour tests, with provision to repeat four of them, has been used with favourable student and staff reaction in first year, two semester undergraduate physics courses.

Many hold that his definitive argument is found in the first half of I 7 itself; I argue that this view is mistaken: the considerations raised there do not form the basis of any self-standing argument for Aristotle's doctrine of principles, but rather play a subordinate role in a larger argument begun in earnest in I 5. This larger argument stalls in I 6, which ends in aporta; I argue that the problem lies in the fact that Aristotle's reasoning in I 6 thoroughly undermines his reasoning in I 5 (on which I 6 is ostensibly supposed to build). I further argue that the materials necessary for resolving this problem, and thereby allowing the argument begun in I 5 to reach its proper conclusion, are supplied by the thesis that organizes the first half of I 7. Along the way I offer some remarks about Aristotle's doctrine of principles, arguing that it is about the principles of natural substance (as opposed to coming to be or change). I also offer some remarks about the thesis which organizes the first half of I 7.1 argue negatively that it is not anything like a preliminary statement of Aristotle's doctrine of principles. I argue positively that it reflects Aristotle's idea that there are two distinct kinds of effect change has upon things (one constructive, the other destructive). One of these effects lies behind Aristotle's reasoning in I 5, the other comes to the fore in 16; the achievement of the first half of I 7 is to reconcile these seemingly competing conceptions by finding a place for them both in a unified account of coming to be and its subjects.\n      </p>", "The cytoskeleton provides eukaryotic cells with mechanical support and helps them to perform their biological functions. It is predominantly composed of a network of semiflexible polar protein filaments. In addition, there are many accessory proteins that bind to these filaments, regulate their assembly, link them to organelles and provide the motors that either move the organelles along the filaments or move the filaments themselves. A natural approach to such a multiple particle system is the study of its collective excitations. I review some recent work on the theoretical description of the emergence of a number of particular collective motile behaviours from the interactions between different elements of the cytoskeleton. In order to do this, close analogies have been made to the study of driven soft condensed matter systems. However, it emerges naturally that a description of these soft active motile systems gives rise to new types of collective phenomena not seen in conventional soft systems. I discuss the implications of these results and perspectives for the future.\n      </p>", "Recent research in science education has recognized the importance of history and philosophy of science. The objective of this study is to evaluate the presentation of the Thomson, Rutherford, and Bohr models of the atom in general physics textbooks based on criteria derived from history and philosophy of science. Forty-one general physics textbooks (all published in the United States) were evaluated on two criteria based on Thomson's work, three on Rutherford's work, and three on Bohr's work. Results obtained show that general physics textbooks do not systematically include a history and philosophy of science perspective. Most textbooks present an inductivist perspective in which experimental details are considered to be paramount. On the contrary, a historical reconstruction of the experimental details inevitably includes: the context in which an experiment is conducted, the theoretical framework that guides the scientist, and alternative interpretations of data that lead to conflicts and controversies. Examples are provided to show how historical reconstructions of atomic models can provide students an opportunity to appreciate how scientists work and science progresses. It is plausible to suggest that textbook presentations based on a history and philosophy of science perspective can perhaps arouse students' interest in the subject and hence lead to greater conceptual understanding.\n      </p>", "A methodology is described for probabilistic predictions of future climate. This is based on a set of ensemble simulations of equilibrium and time-dependent changes, carried out by perturbing poorly constrained parameters controlling key physical and biogeochemical processes in the HadCM3 coupled ocean-atmosphere global climate model. These (ongoing) experiments allow quantification of the effects of earth system modelling uncertainties and internal climate variability on feedbacks likely to exert a significant influence on twenty-first century climate at large regional scales. A further ensemble of regional climate simulations at 25 km resolution is being produced for Europe, allowing the specification of probabilistic predictions at spatial scales required for studies of climate impacts. The ensemble simulations are processed using a set of statistical procedures, the centrepiece of which is a Bayesian statistical framework designed for use with complex but imperfect models. This supports the generation of probabilities constrained by a wide range of observational metrics, and also by expert-specified prior distributions defining the model parameter space. The Bayesian framework also accounts for additional uncertainty introduced by structural modelling errors, which are estimated using our ensembles to predict the results of alternative climate models containing different structural assumptions. This facilitates the generation of probabilistic predictions combining information from perturbed physics and multi-model ensemble simulations. The methodology makes extensive use of emulation and scaling techniques trained on climate model results. These are used to sample the equilibrium response to doubled carbon dioxide at any required point in the parameter space of surface and atmospheric processes, to sample time-dependent changes by combining this information with ensembles sampling uncertainties in the transient response of a wider set of earth system processes, and to sample changes at local scales. The methodology is necessarily dependent on a number of expert choices, which are highlighted throughout the paper.\n      </p>", "There is a wide range of problems in geophysics, from earthquake prediction to the driving forces of plate tectonics, where it is necessary to understand how rocks deform. The materials science approach to understanding these geophysical processes is based on the premise that the macroscale behaviour of rock is governed by microscale interactions. Rock, as a material, will deform under an applied stress elastically, plastically, by fracturing and brittle (cataclastic) flow, and frictional sliding on a fault. The magnitude and direction of the applied stress, the rate and duration of loading, ambient pressure and temperature, the presence of fluids and previous deformation history all control the overall mechanical response. Deformation can be remotely monitored by physical measurements such as elastic wave velocities and electrical conductivity. The emerging subject of rock physics seeks to integrate the disciplines of rock mechanics with rock physical property measurements. The challenge for rock physics is to understand through experiments and modelling, microscopic rock behaviour and apply this to large-scale phenomena. The future is in holistic laboratory experiments, where a wide range of physical parameters is measured concurrently during the deformation experiment. This is important not only in a material science sense, but crucially these parameters are monitored by geophysical techniques and so laboratory experiments can be related to crustal processes. This paper reviews how the materials science approach is applied to problems in geophysics (particularly for brittle deformation), the experimental methodologies employed and how the question of scaling from the laboratory to a planetary scale is addressed. This approach is considered in terms of the evolution and dynamics of the Earth's crust and its ice sheets as they represent the components of the solid Earth with which humankind directly interacts.\n      </p>", "General optimization results from physics indicate that maximum efficiency of a process, in the sense of minimum overall entropy production, is achieved when the rate of entropy production is constant over time, however not in ordinary clock time but on an, in general varying, \"eigen time\" scale, intrinsic to the system. We identify the eigen time of a biological system with \"physiological time,\" which generally scales with the 1/4 power of body mass, M&lt;sup&gt;1/4&lt;/sup&gt;, over a vast range of species. Since it is equally well established that metabolic rate scales as M&lt;sup&gt;3/4&lt;/sup&gt;, it follows that organisms produce entropy at the same intrinsic rate, fulfilling a necessary condition for maximum efficiency, and are all, furthermore, equally efficient on the physiological eigen time scale.\n      </p>"], "words": {"essay": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06},
