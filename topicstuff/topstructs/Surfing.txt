A review of research-based surfing literature is undertaken to provide a summary of information available to assist in coastal management decision making around surfing breaks. The different categories of research-based surfing literature are identified as artificial surfing reef (ASR) design, ASR monitoring, ASR construction, ASR sediment dynamics, biomechanics, coastal management, economics and tourism, industry, numerical and physical modeling, surfers and waves, sociology, and physical processes. The majority of this research has been undertaken in the last decade, making it a relatively young research area. As a background for nonsurfing coastal researchers and managers, the characteristics of surfing waves and surfing breaks are described, referring to relevant literature. Wave height, peel angle, breaking intensity, and section length are identified as essential parameters to describe surfing waves. Existing surfer skill and maneuver categorization schemes are presented to show the relationship between surfers and surfing waves. The geomorphic categories of surfing breaks are identified as headland or point breaks, beach breaks, river or estuary entrance bars, reef breaks, and ledge breaks. The literature discusses the various scale bathymetric components that create these surfing breaks. Examples of modeling offshore wave transformations at Mount Maunganui, New Zealand, as well as the measurement microscale wave transformations at \"The Ledge,\" Raglan, New Zealand, are presented to demonstrate surfing wave transformations.\n      </p>", "The impact of coastal protection on surfing resources is poorly understood and rarely quantified prior to construction. There is an increased requirement for surfing resources worldwide as participation levels in the sport grow. There is also an increased requirement for coastal protection as the occupancy in the coastal zone increases. This research paper takes the first steps towards a schematic categorization of the effect of coastal protection on surfing resources. To do this, we sourced the data through the global network of Surfrider Foundations via questionnaires. These questionnaires enquired about wave quality, crowd levels, stakeholder participation, and the economic importance of surfing to the local area before and after the construction of coastal protection. The results show that of the 30 surfing resources surveyed, 18 experienced a reduction in wave quality and 12 showed an enhancement, or no change, in wave quality. The paper provides an explanation of the results by proposing mechanisms of enhancement and reduction of wave quality after the construction of coastal protection. The conclusion states that coastal protection usually has an effect on the surfing resource that may be positive or negative in terms of the outcome on wave quality and crowd levels.\n      </p>", "Despite their large numbers worldwide, surfers as a coastal interest group have largely been ignored during coastal management decision making. Surfers are, however, increasingly being considered in coastal management decisions as the social, economic, and environmental benefits of high-quality surfing breaks are realized. Examples of surfing breaks that have been improved or compromised by coastal engineering are presented here to demonstrate the fragility of surfing breaks. Integrated coastal zone management techniques are suggested as an approach to sustain recreational amenities associated with surfing breaks. Surfers can benefit from integrated coatal zone management practices that balance the coastal space requirements of various coastal user groups. This paper advocates detailed and standardized assessments of the environmental impacts that coastal activities can have on the quality of surfing waves as part of modern integrated coastal zone management practices. Baseline information must also be collected to develop an understanding of the physical processes around a surfing break. To facilitate baseline studies, and ongoing monitoring of surfing breaks, this paper identifies the types of surfing and oceanographic factors that need to be considered. The need for regional and central governments to strategically protect surfing breaks using legislation, reserves, and coastal management plans is explored. It is recommended that further surfing research investigate ideal coastal management techniques for different resource management frameworks.\n      </p>", "Bathymetric measurements on natural world-class surfing breaks around the Pacific Rim and Indonesia revealed the presence of repeating combinations of meso-scale reef components. Several common configurations of large-scale reef components were identified. Numerical modeling was utilized to investigate how the common configurations function and led to the development of their functional descriptions. It was found that the specific combinations of reef components at these surfing sites consistently produce high-quality surfing waves. The reef component combinations have a holistic character; relative sizes and placement of the components determines the overall quality and length of the surfing break. Refraction and wave attenuation on a succession of components maintains surfable wave peel angles. Designs of artificial surfing reefs must apply these holistic principles in order to produce high-quality surfing facilities that optimise the characteristics of specific sites.\n      </p>", "A method for predicting and describing the breaking intensity of plunging surfing waves has been developed. This method uses the orthogonal seabed gradient to predict the wave vortex length to width ratio, which was found to be the best indicator of wave breaking intensity. The subtle differences in the vortex shape of plunging waves on different seabed gradients can now be described much better than with simplistic indicators, such as the Irribarren number. Description of the shape of plunging waves, or the tube-shape, is critical for defining quality surfing waves. These quantitative predictions of tube shape will be incorporated into artificial surfing reef design.\n      </p>", "Bathymetries of world-class surfing breaks were measured in order to understand seabed morphologies that produce high-quality surfing waves. Bathymetry surveys were carried out using a custom-built, portable, surveying system that was developed to enable highly accurate surfing reef surveys at remote sites world-wide. Along with peel angle and wave vortex information, the bathymetric surveys of 34 surfing locations constitute the first international database of world-class surfing breaks. A full geomorphic range was recorded that included coral reefs, rocky reefs, point breaks, rock ledges, river and estuarine deltas and sand beaches. Analysis of these bathymetries revealed meso-scale surfing reef geomorphic components that were classified as ramp, platform, wedge, ledge, focus, ridge and pinnacle, which constitute and account for the quality of world-class surfing reefs. Their function in relation to wave refraction and wave breaking is considered.\n      </p>", "A two-dimensional wave flume investigation was conducted to examine the effect of multiple steps on the form of breaking waves. The study was initiated to gain a better appreciation of the design tolerances for artificial surfing reefs. The geotextile bags used to form an artificial surfing reef create multiple steps in the seabed; reducing the size of these steps improves the quality of waves for recreational surfing but comes at considerable economic cost. Sets of steps were placed on a 1:15 slope, and image analysis methods were used to quantify the effects of increasing step size on the form and intensity of the breaking waves. The vortex area, angle, and length-to-width ratio were quantified for various step sizes. It is shown that breaking intensity decreases with increasing step size. Variations in wave reflection were measured using a three-element surface-piercing wave gauge. Wave reflection coefficients were found to be unchanged for all step sizes implemented in this experiment, and reflection was not found to significantly affect the form of the breaking waves in the current tests. The quality of the surfing waves for recreational surfing was seen to degrade measurably with increasing step size, with a higher degree of variability and irregularity in the vortices of the plunging breakers. A qualitative assessment of the quality of the breaking waves suggests that step size should be limited to approximately 23% of the design wave height.\n      </p>", "The Gold Coast region is home to approximately 500,000 residents and receives over 9 million visitors per year. Gold Coast beaches are exposed to a high wave energy and are regularly subjected to storms and large waves. For almost 100 years, these beaches have been modified in one way or another in order to deliver maximum utility. Altered coastlines can affect surf quality positively and negatively. This paper presents the results of a study to estimate the socio-economic importance of recreational surfing on the Gold Coast. The study reported that between 65,000 - 120,000 individuals surf on the Gold Coast and it was estimated that there were between 6 - 15 million person visits or individual surf sessions on the Gold Coast in 2007. The total reported annual expenditure by recreational surfers on the Gold Coast in 2007 was estimated to range from $AUD126 \u2013 $233 million. Incorporating non-market values, multipiers and externalities is likely to substantially increase the total worth of surfing to the region. Expenditure per session for recreational surfing was estimated to range from $AUD18.67 - $30.36, with a mid-point of approximately $AUD24.50. The findings demonstrate the significant economic and social importance of surfing amenity for both local residents and visitors along this managed coastline, the need to clearly articulate and measure changes in recreational amenity and the need to consider any negative impacts on surf breaks and the natural environment that may occur as a result of development, coastal planning and protection works.\n      </p>", "The first offshore reef developed to amalgamate world-class surfing, public amenity and coastal protection is described. The reef is at Narrowneck Beach on the Gold Coast, Australia, a long, sandy coast experiencing large cyclone waves and high net longshore transport. The reef design was based on bathymetric and wave breaking studies of world-class surfing breaks and numerical model predictions. A broad range of different shapes was numerically tested using refraction, Boussinesq refraction/diffraction and sediment transport models. The shape that met the design criteria, for both the surfing and shoreline protection characteristics, was found to be a submerged double-sided headland. The designed reef is 400 m long and extends from the natural 2 m isobath to a toe in 10.4 m depth, with the crest at 0.4 m below the Lowest Astronomical Tide. The shape allowed both 'left' and 'right' surfing waves to be included. Peel angles are rarely less than 40\u00b0 (in predominant small waves) and seabed gradients of up to 1:12 produce steep plunging wave faces, making the surfing wave 'fast' and 'hollow'. In small swell, a large, focussing underwater segment will more than double the deep water wave height at the breakpoint. A slower 100 m long segment at the shoreward end is designed for surfing begineers and casual tourists. Because the adjacent beaches experience close-out conditions in big swells, a padding channel has been placed at the offshore tip of the reef to give surfers access during large swell. A lagoon shoreward of the reef provides sheltered padding and, at low tide, sheltered swimming for beach-goers. Wave interference patterns inshore of the reef are expected to provide challenging 'wedgey' waves for body boarders, while the offshore placement of the reef provides ideal wave jumping conditions for the sailboarder.\n      </p>", "Peel angles and wave height are two of the key variables determining the level of skill needed to surf a wave. For artificial surfing reefs, the degree of surfing difficulty needs to be rated numerically in order to accurately specify design criteria. Peel angles were collected and examined in relation to the level of skill required to surf waves of different heights, and a classification scheme was developed which defines the boundaries between waves that can be successfully ridden by beginner to expert surfers. The classification scheme places emphasis on peel angle and considers a wave height range of 0\u20134 m, making it applicable to artificial surf break development. The data came from previously published values (Mead and Black, 1999) and new measurements from sites worldwide. Highly detailed studies of aerial photographs and bathymetry at Burleigh Heads and Kirra Point (Australia) and five surfing breaks at Raglan (New Zealand) were made. Comparing the rankings of surf breaks to the surfer skill required to successfully surf each break validated the scheme.\n      </p>", "A new model for the joint probability density function (pdf) of surfer board-speed and wave break-rate is developed for use in making quantitative assessments of surfing wave climate. Maximum sustainable board speed is modeled upon the results of a companion study (Dally, 2001) that relates board speed directly to breaker height. Starting from a Rayleigh distribution for wave height in deep water, the distribution of breaker heights is developed by a rigorous transformation of random variable. A strictly empirical, yet utilitarian, pdf for the sine of the peel angle is fashioned from the Beta Distribution. Assuming that breaker height and peel angle are independent random variables, the product of the two pdf's is analytically transformed into the joint distribution of board speed and break rate. The proportion of surfable waves is determined by integrating the joint pdf in the domain where the board speed is greater than the break rate, for the largest 10% of breakers. Results of exercising the model indicate that it is the distribution of peel angle, as opposed to the breaker height or wave period, that most affects the proportion of surfable waves.\n      </p>", "During the study for the viability of the implementation of an Artificial Surf Reef in S\u00e3o Pedro's beach, Estoril, Portugal, contracted by the Municipality of Cascais, we developed at Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico a novel orientation to the Environmental Evaluation of Coastal Projects. We present our novel approach, improving the Socio-Economic Factor and the Morphology and Coastal Dynamic Factor of Environmental Evaluation Studies of Coastal Projects. In the Socio-Economic Factor we address the impact of surfing in the, local and national, sports, tourism and industry. We show that surfing, a natural sport, has been growing at a nearly constant rate for the last three decades in Portugal, also as an economic activity, and it maintains the potential to continue its development in the next decades. We also show that the entire Portuguese West coast provides excellent conditions, in the European Continent, for the development of surfing. In the Morphology and Coastal Dynamic Factor, we address the parameters that quantify the quality of waves for surfing, and the parameters that quantify the rip currents. While rip currents affect surfing, they also affect sediment transport and the safety of bathers. We describe the parameters that coastal projects and environmental studies should evaluate, to maintain the quality of surfing, and also to assess the impact of coastal works on beach morphology and on bathers. The present orientation may be proposed to the \"Ag\u00eancia Portuguesa do Ambiente\" (Portuguese Environment Agency) in order to protect and develop Surfing in the Portuguese Coast.\n      </p>", "Surfing is increasingly capturing the minds and emotions of people, especially youth, all over the world. Its culture extends beyond the actual act of surfing the waves. Clothing, surfboards, posters, films, and magazines, along with language, music, and aesthetic experience are all wrapped up in surfing culture. This article presents an overview of surfing culture, focusing on youth, and discusses ways that it has become part of the economy. Ways that the art teacher can incorporate surfing culture and aesthetics into the classroom are suggested.\n      </p>", "We investigate neutral evolution during range shifts in a strategic model of a metapopulation occupying a climate gradient. Using heritable, neutral markers, we track the spatio-temporal fate of lineages. Owing to iterated founder effects ('mutation surfing'), survival of lineages derived from the leading range limit is enhanced. At trailing limits, where habitat suitability decreases, survival is reduced (mutations 'wipe out'). These processes alter (i) the spatial spread of mutations, (ii) origins of persisting mutations and (iii) the generation of diversity. We show that large changes in neutral evolution can be a direct consequence of range shifting.\n      </p>", "This note presents a concise mathematical model that accounts for the physics of surfing. The equilibrium of surfing and its stability is discussed. Analysis reveals the fact that surfing is possible only on a lower part of the front side of the concave surface of a wave. The angle of the wave slope suited for surfing is confined in (-35&lt;sup&gt;\u26ac&lt;/sup&gt;, 0&lt;sup&gt;\u26ac&lt;/sup&gt;).\n      </p>", "Surfers face a common-pool resource problem, similar to that faced by fishers. Although the ocean shore is a common-pool resource, each wave is a private good. Coordination is essential if a surfers' dilemma is to be avoided. I model this situation as a two-person, two stage game. I show that for many cases the subgame perfect equilibrium is socially optimal. In other cases, the equilibrium is not optimal. I argue that for these cases a surfers' etiquette has evolved in response to this dilemma. A first-to-the curl, first-in-right rule ameliorates but does not fully resolve the dilemma. In addition, a locals-only policy, a policy in violation of the surfers' etiquette, may be a rational response to a growth of inexperienced surfers on the waves.\n      </p>", "Strong wave-driven currents occur over reefs when the reef is: (i) narrow; (ii) detached from the shoreline; (iii) fully submerged; and (iv) smooth with low frictional resistance. Artificial surfing reefs exhibit many of these characteristics so that wave-driven currents may adversely affect surfing conditions. Numerical solutions are validated using a 1-dimensional analytic solution and then tested against measurements made across the reef flat at John Brewer Reef on Australia's Great Barrier Reef. Wave-driven flows predicted over the more complex Narrowneck Reef on Australia's Gold Coast are discussed.\n      </p>", "In this article, based on work which he undertook for the degree of M.A. at the University of Hawaii, Mr. Finney traces the decline and subsequent revival of surfing in modern Hawaii and discusses the diffusion of the sport to other countries in and bordering the Pacific. In the December 1959 issue of this Journal Mr. Finney published an account of surfing in ancient Hawaii.\n      </p>", "One of the most common modes of accessing information in the World Wide Web is surfing from one document to another along hyperlinks. Several large empirical studies have revealed common patterns of surfing behavior. A model that assumes that users make a sequence of decisions to proceed to another page, continuing as long as the value of the current page exceeds some threshold, yields the probability distribution for the number of pages that a user visits within a given Web site. This model was verified by comparing its predictions with detailed measurements of surfing patterns. The model also explains the observed Zipf-like distributions in page hits observed at Web sites.\n      </p>", "Construction of artificial surfing reefs requires methods and materials that are different from those used traditionally for conventional breakwaters. In particular, the need to address safety and increased volume requires materials to be user-friendly and economical. This requirement has led to furthering the development of technology to manufacture and place large, sand-filled geotextile containers for projects such as Narrowneck Reef on Australia's Gold Coast.\n      </p>", "This paper develops a political-economic interaction model for India for the 1960-91 sample period. India presents an ideal case for testing the political business cycle theory in the context of a parliamentary democracy with endogenous election timing. Using a mixed qualitative and continuous variable simultaneous equation estimation procedure, the paper considers the two-way interaction that results from the control by the cabinet over election timing. Several conclusions can be derived from this study. First, the results indicate the presence of business cycle-electoral interaction in India. Second, there is strong support for the surfing hypothesis, implying that the Indian cabinet tends to ride on natural business waves. Third, no support is found for the manipulative hypothesis.\n      </p>", "The logic and benefits of offshore, multi-purpose, coastal protection structures are addressed through example, theory and application. From a series of basic principles, the offshore reef philosophy is explored. The benefits are emphasised by summarising relevant NZ coastal research and by using a series of natural examples, case studies and numerical model simulations, including the large Gold Coast Reef designed for coastal protection and surfing. Offshore reefs with recreational amenity are shown to have three important \"MOA\" qualities (Multi-purpose, Offshore and Adjustable), which makes these structures more versatile and adaptable than sea walls, breakwaters or groynes. However, with the amalgamation of multiple purposes, the designed reef needs more sophistication than that required for coastal protection only. High-quality computer modelling, field datasets on surfing reef behaviour and advances in construction technology make these elegant and scientifically complex coastal protection solutions achievable.\n      </p>", "This study contends that certain personality traits of e-consumers have an affect on their shopping, surfing and information seeking behaviors on the Web. Specifically, it is proposed that e-consumers who are low on interpersonal trust are less likely to shop on the Web due to their heightened concerns with Web security. Similarly, an argument is made that e-consumers who enjoy cognitively demanding processing tasks are more likely to use the Web for information search. Finally, it is posited that social loners will be selectively drawn to Web surfing. Findings from an empirical study are presented which support these assertions. Implications of this study for marketers and future researchers are discussed.\n      </p>", "This article is a qualitative examination of the effects of modernity on the lives and identities of a group of surfers in Southern California. The men studied feel that newcomers are changing the nature of the surfing in their area. The surfers attribute the negative changes in surfing to the gentrification of their community and the importation of new values by newcomers. Using the theoretical approach of modernity as discussed by Giddens, the act of surfing is conceptualized as being \"disembedded\" from the traditional local context established and maintained by the surfers for more than two decades. It is being figuratively transplanted into a more generic context reflecting the competitive, materialistic, and individual-orientated order typifying postindustrial American society.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

They generally agree on where surfing initially developed, that it assumed a religious character, was suppressed for religious reasons, has been undergoing a revival, and enjoins reverence for and protection of nature. This subset of the global surfing community should be understood as a new religious movement--a globalizing, hybridized, and increasingly influential example of what I call aquatic nature religion. For these individuals, surfing is a religious form in which a specific sensual practice constitutes its sacred center, and the corresponding experiences are constructed in a way that leads to a belief in nature as powerful, transformative, healing, and sacred. I advance this argument by analyzing these experiences, as well as the myths, rites, symbols, terminology, technology, material culture, and ethical mores that are found within surfing subcultures.\n      </p>", "The forage-maturation hypothesis (FMH) states that herbivores migrate along a phenological gradient of plant development in order to maximize energy intake. Despite strong support for the FMH, the actual relationship between plant phenology and ungulate movement has remained enigmatic. We linked plant phenology (MODIS\u2013normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI] data) and space use of 167 migratory and 78 resident red deer (Cervus elaphus), using a space-time-time matrix of \u201cspringness,\u201d defined as the instantaneous rate of green-up. Consistent with the FMH, migrants experienced substantially greater access to early plant phenology than did residents. Deer were also more likely to migrate in areas where migration led to greater gains in springness. Rather than \u201csurfing the green wave\u201d during migration, migratory red deer moved rapidly from the winter to the summer range, thereby \u201cjumping the green wave.\u201d However, migrants and, to a lesser degree, residents did track phenological green-up through parts of the growing season by making smaller-scale adjustments in habitat use. Despite pronounced differences in their life histories, we found only marginal differences between male and female red deer in this study. Those differences that we did detect pointed toward additional constraints on female space-use tactics, such as those posed by calving and caring for dependent offspring. We conclude that whereas in some systems migration itself is a way to surf the green wave, in others it may simply be a means to reconnect with phenological spring at the summer range. In the light of ubiquitous anthropogenic environmental change, understanding the relationship between the green wave and ungulate space use has important consequences for the management and conservation of migratory ungulates and the phenomenon of migration itself.\n      </p>", "Viruses have often been observed in association with the dense microvilli of polarized epithelia as well as the filopodia of nonpolarized cells, yet whether interactions with these structures contribute to infection has remained unknown. Here we show that virus binding to filopodia induces a rapid and highly ordered lateral movement, \"surfing\" toward the cell body before cell entry. Virus cell surfing along filopodia is mediated by the underlying actin cytoskeleton and depends on functional myosin II. Any disruption of virus cell surfing significantly reduces viral infection. Our results reveal another example of viruses hijacking host machineries for efficient infection by using the inherent ability of filopodia to transport ligands to the cell body.\n      </p>", "This article examines the ways in which a group of London webloggers or on-line journal keepers constitute their city.

Eulerian measurements of wave height recorded by three wave buoys in intermediate water depths (8-45 m relative to the lowest astronomical tide), over a 7-year period were analysed in a search for evidence of this semidiurnal variability in incident wave heights. The study site (Perranporth, U.K.) was a highly macrotidal environment with a maximum spring tidal range of approximately 7.5 m. Autospectra of wave height time series displayed a significant peak at semidiurnal frequencies that was coherently coupled to the tidal displacement. At this site maximum wave power was seen to occur on the rising tide, on average 1 hour 6 minutes before high water. The observed semidiurnal variability in wave height increases in magnitude toward the shoreline. This contribution presents field evidence for tidal modulation of incident wave power by the tide and suggests a possible explanation for the observations in terms of an analytical model for attenuation of wave power by contratidal flows.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Laura Molina's http://www.Nakeddave.com and Bianca Ortiz's http://www.messtiza.com are the focal point of this essay. Through their work I address the following questions: I) should the mestiza consciousness be an \"ideological football\" (Nakamura, 102) used to explain racial experiences online for everyone; 2) does the Web provide Xican@s a place to write their bodies, minds, and identity while opening up a critical discussion about embodiment; and 3) how does the language in which Xican@s write affect the perception of a racialized and gendered body on the World Wide Web in reference to the off-line world? This essay focuses on the way Molina and Ortiz offer a fuller understanding of the mestiza consciousness online because of the way their bodies and ideologies are often seen as \"outsiders\" of the World Wide Web.\n      </p>", "Introgression from a resident species into an invading one is predicted to occur through the demographic process of \"allele surfing,\" and to particularly affect genomic regions transmitted by the lower migrating sex, such as mtDNA. This could explain that northern Iberian populations of Lepus granatensis harbor high frequencies of mtDNA from L timidus, an arctic hare it replaced there after d\u00e9glaciation. We report that variation of introgressed timidus-like mtDNA reflects several predicted effects of this process: increasing frequency and diversity in the direction of expansion, strong perpendicular phylogeographic structure and signs of postglacial demographic growth. However, demographic inferences for the granatensis and timidus-like mtDNA lineages suggest the latter may have outcompeted the former in northern Iberia. Autosomal introgression occurs at low frequencies and species-wide rather than only in the north. If this difference with mtDNA resulted from sex-biased migration, an intermediate pattern should prevail for the X-chromosome, but we report species-wide and high-frequency introgression of an X-fragment. Either selection favored this ubiquitous X-introgression, or more complex postglacial expansion patterns prevailed, with different consequences depending on the genomic and geographic region. This illustrates the difficulty of distinguishing demographic and selective effects and the need for genome and species-wide based demographic models.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "The Internet is enabling scientists and clinicians in areas with endemic malaria to transfer information to scientists and clinicians in other countries. This should allow changes in therapy to follow the rapid changes in the disease that have posed such difficulties in the past. This article reviews Internet resources that focus on malaria. This includes 90 Web sites in 12 sections. Authoritative multinational organizational sites and regional sites, such as those in Africa, Asia (including Thailand and India), and South America (in Venezuela and Brazil), are described. Basic research-oriented databases, such as those that deal with plasmodia genomics, biochemistry, and vaccine development, as well as vector information and geographic satellite information systems, are reviewed.

Systematic reviews and practice guidelines help to focus that evidence with in-depth literature analysis of a specific question. These reviews are typically rigidly structured, often periodically updated, and include critical evaluation of available data. In this article, Web sites of organizations that publish systematic reviews and practice guidelines for infectious diseases are identified and reviewed with regard to ease of use, comprehensiveness, quality of information, and cost. Examples of information available in databases of practice guidelines and systematic reviews are provided.

In this paper we report on the extent to which schools are already buying into information and communications technology (ICT) and in particular the Internet, effectively examining the foundations upon which the Learning Grid is being constructed. Via an empirical study of 150 current school websites we will argue that schools adopt a variety of approaches to the Internet and Worldwide Web depending upon the technological and institutional capital of the school, and that far from being utilised solely for educational purposes, the Internet provides an additional tool through which schools seek to reaffirm or reconstruct their existing institutional identities with varying levels of success. The paper concludes by adopting a semiotic framework for analysing the differential use of the Internet by educational institutions.\n      </p>", "Internet resources that focus on Legionella and legionnaires disease are presented.

It describes cell movement induced by an adhesion gradient. In this work, we present evidence for self-induced haptotaxis using negatively charged giant vesicles interacting with positively charged supported lipid bilayers, which has not been previously described. Depending on the charge of the vesicle, we observed different behaviors. At low charge, no adhesion occurs. At high charge, the vesicle adheres but does not move. In a restricted range of intermediate charge densities, we found that the vesicle moves spontaneously with velocities of the order of a few micrometers per second over distances of &gt;100 \u03bcm. We show that a local lipid transfer between the giant vesicle and the supported lipid bilayer takes place during the adhesion, breaking the symmetry and inducing a lateral charge gradient. This charge gradient polarizes the giant vesicle and induces its motion. To explain our observations, we propose a scaling model that relates the adhesion energy to the velocity of vesicle motion and to the characteristic lipid transfer time. Our measurements indicate that the effective adhesion energy is strongly reduced by counterions, which are dynamically trapped between the vesicle and the supported bilayer.\n      </p>", "I explore the practice of offering subscribers enticements to switch suppliers. This type of competition is natural in subscription markets for homogeneous goods and services. Efficiency is impaired because subscribers are induced to expend resources changing suppliers. Subscription markets are fully competitive only when three or more firms serve the industry. In this case, the price offered to switchers is below cost, while nonswitchers pay a premium. Each firm earns rent on its customer base, but zero expected profit on each new subscriber it attracts. When firms can track switching behavior, consumers may change suppliers in order to establish reputations.\n      </p>", "The bacterium Bacillus subtilis produces the molecule surfactin, which is known to enhance the spreading of multicellular colonies on nutrient substrates by lowering the surface tension of the surrounding fluid, and to aid in the formation of aerial structures. Here we present experiments and a mathematical model that demonstrate how the differential accumulation rates induced by the geometry of the bacterial film give rise to surfactant waves. The spreading flux increases with increasing biofilm viscosity. Community associations are known to protect bacterial populations from environmental challenges such as predation, heat, or chemical stresses, and enable digestion of a broader range of nutritive sources. This study provides evidence of enhanced dispersal through cooperative motility, and points to nonintuitive methods for controlling the spread of biofilms.\n      </p>", "Paris provides a perfect context for cultural projects using the multimedia capabilities of the World Wide Web.

Insofar as possible, the projects simulate the way native speakers would interact with Web materials and allow room for developing student interests and using language creatively.\n      </p>", "As the peel angle of a breaking wave becomes more acute, a surfer must travel faster in order to stay ahead of the break point. At the critical limit of surfing, the board can go no faster, and the wave 'closes out'. In order to study the maximum speed that can be sustained on different waves, sequences of surfing recorded on videotape are subjected to kinematic analyses. Selecting twenty-nine sequences in which the surfer is judged to be moving as fast as possible, board speed is computed by dividing a visually estimated travel distance by an elapsed time, determined by counting frames of video. Breaker height is also estimated visually, and breaker type noted. An empirical, yet physically justified formula for the board speed is developed based upon breaker height (R\u00b2 = 0.91). The video-derived model is verified against the limited amount of data collected by other means that are available in the literature. Breaker type is not found to have a direct influence on board speed.\n      </p>", "L'analyse des compositions pour guitare dans le rock'n'roll se heurte \u00e0 divers obstacles : la partition, quand elle existe, ne peut rendre pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment compte de ce qui fait la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 de la pi\u00e8ce analys\u00e9e.

When analysing rock'n'roll pieces for guitar, one encounters many difficulties. The score, when there is one, cannot give a realistic idea of what is the most specific to the analysed work. It is not precise about the effects or the ornemental, technical and instrumental devices. It often simply does not mention them at all. Even when it does, it is useless, because each performance of the same work is different. Though, these characteristics are very important, because they have an impact on other aspects of the piece, such as the harmonic or melodic material. To achieve an efficient analysis of a guitar piece, one has therefore to use a specific way of writing the music, and must also know very closely how to play the instrument.\n      </p>", "Antimicrobe.org (http://www.antimicrobe.org) is a World Wide Web-based version of the textbook Antimicrobial Therapy and Vaccines, volumes I and II.

We searched the Internet for the most useful English-language Web sites on sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), with annotations, in 4 tables: sites for patients, for clinicians and teachers, and for researchers, and sites dedicated to a single STD. In the process, we found that government-sponsored sites tended to have the most reliable information. This held true regardless of the kind of information we were seeking. Several university-sponsored sites contained information that was outdated or erroneous. Commercial and nonprofit sites sometimes evinced a bias that could mislead some readers. Both health care professionals and laypersons seeking information about STDs on the World Wide Web should generally start their search at government-sponsored sites.\n      </p>"], "words": {"essay":
