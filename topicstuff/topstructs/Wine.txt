The terminology invented by the Ottomans to denote the taxes levied on viticulture reveals their highly sophisticated rationalistic approach, by which they settled the contradiction between the Islamic prohibition of wine and their practical interest in such a lucrative business, while tax rates developed on this basis granted a significant tax break to Muslim viticulturers. The data of two extant Ottoman tax-registers for the Crimea show that such ingenious fiscal policy stimulated both Muslim investment in this business and conversion of local Christian peasants to Islam. Also, through data on the taxation of wine commerce, estimations of prices and tax rates for marketed wine were suggested. /// Cet essai d'estimer la quantit\u00e9 de vin produit en Crim\u00e9e du sud au XVIe si\u00e8cle ouvre en fait des perspectives sur l'adaptation de la viticulture, de la production et du commerce du vin par les Ottomans dans une province ayant une population principalement chretienne.

The result has been a patchwork of direct shipment regulations across states. We examine how various economic and public interest factors affect the likelihood that a state adopts a change in its direct shipment regulation and the nature of that change. Our results suggest that private and public sector economic considerations lie at the root of direct shipment regulations in the wine industry.\n      </p>", "The market for \"primeur\" wine in the Bordeaux region allows producers to sell wine that is still in barrels. As with all experience goods, producers send quality signals to uninformed buyers. Using original data on Bordeaux wines, we show that the pricing behavior of producers depends to a large extent on their reputation, and much less on short-term changes in quality (as measured by experts' grades). We also find that the primeur price has an informative role, since a 10% increase in primeur price leads to a 3% increase in prices on the market for bottled wine.\n      </p>", "This paper seeks to examine how value chains impinge upon firms within the Chilean wine sector. The value chain analysis will further link the production and export of wine in Chile with the import and retailing of this wine in one key core economy market, namely that of the UK. The analysis is divided into three sections. First, the political economy of value chains in agro-industry is discussed, particularly in relation to the distinction between network or quasi-hierarchical relationships. Then the paper examines the theme of retail concentration in the UK and the impacts that this has on global value chains which incorporate Chilean wine firms. The focus then moves to value chains and the nature of upgrading within Chilean wine firms by examining the strategic example of the lead firm and firm upgrading as a response to demands of UK retailers and through the flying winemaker model. Broad conclusions on the comparative nature of value chains and the scramble for value within them are finally made.\n      </p>", "The human diet contains industrial-derived, endocrine-active chemicals and higher levels of naturally occurring compounds that modulate multiple endocrine pathways. Hazard and risk assessment of these mixtures is complicated by nonadditive interactions between different endocrine-mediated responses. This study focused on estrogenic chemicals in the diet and compared the relative potencies or estrogen equivalents (EQs) of the daily consumption of xenoestrogenic organochlorine pesticides in food (2.44 \u00b5g/day) with the EQs in a single 200-ml glass of red cabernet wine. The reconstituted organochlorine mixture contained 1,1,1-trichloro-2-(p-chlorophenyl)-2-(ochlorophenyl)ethane, 1,1,1 -trichloro-2,2-bis(p- 1,1 -dichloro-2,2-bis (pchlorophenyl)ethylene, endosulfan-1, endosulfan-2, p,p'-methoxychlor, and toxaphene; the relative proportion of each chemical in the mixture resembled the composition reported in a recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration market basket survey. The following battery of in vitro 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2)-responsive bioassays were utilized in this study: competitive binding to mouse uterine estrogen receptor (ER); proliferation in T47D human breast cancer cells; luciferase (Luc) induction in human HepG2 cells transiently cotransfected with C3-Luc and the human ER, rat ER-\u03b1, or rat ER-\u03b2; induction of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells transfected with E2-responsive cathepsin D-CAT or creatine kinase B-CAT plasmids. For these seven in vitro assays, the calculated EQs in extracts from 200 ml of red cabernet wine varied from 0.15 to 3.68 \u00b5g/day. In contrast, EQs for consumption of organochlorine pesticides (2.44 \u00b5g/day) varied from nondetectable to 1.24 ng/day. Based on results of the in vitro bioassays, organochlorine pesticides in food contribute minimally to dietary EQ intake.\n      </p>", "This study advances the sociological inquiry on social categories by synthesizing two lines of research in economic and organizational sociology\u2014studies of industrial categories in market dynamics and neo-institutional analyses of social categories. It compares the classificatory schemes and structures in the California and French wine industries and investigates the impact of institutionalized categories on social evaluation via the lens of determinants of wine price. Empirical findings show that under distinct classification systems, similar categories and wine attributes have different significances and affect wine price differently. These findings shed light on the profound consequences of the organizations and structures of categories in classification systems. They also enrich the institutional analyses by demonstrating that institutional categories systematically differentiate market products and create social differences and hierarchies.\n      </p>", "Conventional explanations of the distribution of winemaking regions emphasize the influence of edaphic and atmospheric environments of the vine. This paper argues that legislation that reflects the political power of the prestigious winemaking areas has had a major impact, especially in France. The appellation legislation of France, and the assumptions underlying it, are established. It is conceptualized as a form of territorialization devised to regulate and capture advantages to some of the participants in the industry. I analyze the influence of the French principles and assumptions in devising the European Community and California legislation. In particular, I consider the manner in which the underlying environmental determinism is used both to explain the distribution of prestigious wines and as criteria to establish wine regions. The distribution of vine varieties in France and California illustrates the tight control evident in France compared with the laissez-faire policies in California. Some evidence of converging patterns in the two territories is apparent.\n      </p>", "A widely-held theory amongst wine professionals says that premium quality winegrowing is impossible closer to the equator than 30\u00b0 latitude North and South. However, since 1995 a small group of Thai entrepreneurs and Thai winemakers have proved that impressive reds can be produced from the Syrah/Shiraz grape and dry whites from Chenin Blanc between 12\u00b0 and 18\u00b0 North in regions with a monsoon climate. Tropical viticulture requires a completely different approach to winegrowing in regions with temperate and Mediterranean climates. The mastering of this technique in Thailand, India and Tanzania during recent years opens a new era in global winegrowing. More radical still are the premium quality wines being produced in Thailand from local fruits, herbs, hone and even roots. Stuart Pigott takes the reader with him on a roller-coaster journey through the genuinely \"new world\" of tropical winegrowing and winemaking.\n      </p>", "A 66-year-old man suffered the symptoms of severe lead poisoning for 2 years before diagnosis. The man had a blood lead level (PbB) on admission to hospital of 98 \u03bcg/dL. A detailed investigation revealed that the poisoning occurred as a result of drinking a homemade red wine, for which analyses showed a lead concentration up to 14 mg/L-70 times the Australian maximum limit for lead in wine. The source of the lead was a highly corroded enamel bathtub in which grape crushings and juice were stored for a week prior to bottling. The corrosion of the enamel surface of the bathtub had resulted in pitted patches up to 1 mm in depth along the side of the bathtub. Powdering of the tub surface was evident below a level where wine had been in contact with the sides of the tub. The homemade wine had a pH of 3.8, which would have greatly contributed to the solubilization of metals from the glaze. We conducted a test in which commercial red wine of similar pH and containing &lt; 0.2 mg/L lead was placed in this tub for 7 days. Subsequent testing revealed a lead level of 310 mg/L. This high lead concentration is consistent with the surface area of enamel on the bathtub being in contact with a small liquid volume as in the case of the leaching test using commerical red wine. This case study highlights the importance of the use of food-grade materials for the preparation and storage of homemade beverages or food.\n      </p>", "Sales in Fairtrade wine have been growing rapidly worldwide, and the UK is the most important market. This paper reports on an action research project undertaken with different economic actors along the value chain of a Chilean Fairtrade wine. The aim of the interdisciplinary project was to explore how the internet and tracking and tracing technologies could be used to render value chains more transparent for consumers and producers. An internet interface combined with a barcode-based data retrieval system could allow actors in the value chain to call up economic, social and environmental information about a product. Early findings from the action research process show that while supermarkets are the lead firms in the Fairtrade wine chain in terms of economic power, the producers and the Fairtrade certification body wield 'moral power' over other actors in the value chain. Fairtrade producers and the Fairtrade certification body relate to each other in cycles of mutual recognition, thus underpinning each others' legitimacy and moral power. The paper argues that action research, in particular the positionality of the researcher team as a collaboration partner, can lead to a better understanding of the nature of linkages and power relations between the economic actors in value chains.\n      </p>", "Palm wine tapped from Elaeis guineensis provides high incomes to certain groups such as Limba tribe members and women while creating social networks among tappers, traders, and retail vendors. Income levels from palm-wine tapping were several-fold higher than the minimum daily wage in Sierra Leone during 1998. Gender differences were particularly important in the marketing of palm wine, with women dominating the retail sector whereas men served as producers and middleman. An estimated 90% of palm wine middlemen are males, whereas kiosk vendors are mostly females. A formalized gift-giving culture has developed to ensure the continuous flow of palm wine from tapper to consumer.\n      </p>", "The rapid expansion of the New Zealand wine industry has rested largely on a specific wine commodity form, Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc. Global demand for a specialised product has provided the impetus for substantial development at the regional level, an increasingly complex industry structure, and for the intrusion of international capital. This paper explores the contests and relations within the industry through attention to the commodity's value-added chain, wherein recent developments are interpreted as a contest over the brand rents. The contemporary situation therefore may be explained through overlapping organisational and geographic framings of these relations: producer versus buyer-driven dynamics; regional-national and global interests; and inter- and intra-corporate strategies. The commercial contest for control of the region-varietal commodity reveals some paradoxical outcomes in which the region is reaffirmed as a site of investment in an evidently globalised industry, and the significance of who controls what fraction of the value chain is re-asserted.\n      </p>", "The interests of anthropologists, focused on using the \"meaning\" of words and expressions as an entr\u00e9e into understanding cultures, and of linguists, focused on the grammatically relevant sense components of abstract lexical forms, can be differentiated. A multicomponential lexicography is outlined for investigating various oinoglossic (\"wine-talk\") registers of language, adequate to exploring this sociologically complex field of discourse spanning wine production, marketing, consumption, and connoisseurship. This approach builds on developments of the past 30 years in linguistic anthropology and related areas that have clarified the relations of structural sense, stereotypy (cultural concepts), and indexicality in language, and how and where to investigate these very different semiotic partials of language use.\n      </p>", "Portugal has port, Spain has sherry, Sicily has Marsala \u2013 and California has angelica. Angelica is California's original wine: The intensely sweet, fortified dessert cordial has been made in the state for more than two centuries \u2013 primarily made from Mission grapes, first brought to California by the Spanish friars. Angelica was once drunk in vast quantities, but now fewer than a dozen vintners make angelica today. These holdouts from an earlier age are each following a personal quest for the real. For unlike port and sherry, which have strict rules about their production, angelica never gelled into something so distinct that connoisseurs can say, \u201cThis is angelica. This is not.\u201d This piece looks at the history of the drink, its foggy origins in the Mission period and on through angelica's heyday and down to its degeneration into a staple of the back-alley wino set. Several current vintners are profiled, and they suggest an uncertain future for this cordial.\n      </p>", "This paper argues that conventional archaeological approaches to food need a new and sophisticated theoretical framework which acknowledges that food is culturally defined and acquires immense significance in all societies because it involves the human body. It is (through consumption) an act of incorporation involving senses, feelings and emotions. Away from the nutritionist paradigm and the subsistence discourse, this study re-examines the issue of wine and olive oil production and consumption in Bronze Age Crete and suggests that they are related to broader social and political developments rather than to environmental conditions or micro-economic concerns on the part of Bronze Age Cretan farmers.\n      </p>", "On 1 January 1989 the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement went into effect. The agreement reduced the restrictions on the importation and marketing of wine produced in the United States. This article analyzes the impact of this lessening on United States wine exports to Canada. A demand relation for United States exports to Canada is estimated and then used to decompose the effects into their proximate causes. These causes are (a) own-price and exchange rate effects, (b) substitute price and exchange rate effects, (c) changes in real income in Canada, (d) tariff removal effects, and (e) removal of nontariff trade barriers by Canada.\n      </p>", "Research into learning, innovation, and clustering suggests that local socioeconomic practices, or conventions, are critical to economic growth and regional development. Yet when it comes to the wine industry, explanations of economic success often focus on natural advantages. This article seeks to address this issue, presenting findings on the local practices of wine producers in northern California. The argument is that there are important local social and industrial linkages that bolster the competitiveness of California's wine industry and serve to upgrade production practices. This article highlights the career histories and perceptions of several key informants who are offered as exemplars of more commonly shared industrial experience and practice.\n      </p>", "The role of alcohol consumption (alcoholic calories, alcoholic beverages) on breast cancer risk was investigated in a case-control study of 154 premenopausal female patients diagnosed with primary breast carcinoma. For each case, one control was matched for age (\u00b1 3 years) and socio-economic status. The survey was carried out in Northeastern France (Lorraine) between 1986 and 1989. While taking into account total caloric intakes and various breast cancer factors, breast cancer risk was shown to increase as consumption of alcohol increased (p value for trend = 0.007). A significant relative risk (RR = 2.69; 95% CI: 1.40-5.17) was shown above 60 kcal per day (approximately 9 g of alcohol per day). Breast cancer risk appeared to be restricted to red wine consumption among these premenopausal women, for monthly consumption (p value for trend = 0.003) as well as for duration of consumption (p value for trend = 0.01). A relative risk of 3.96 (95% CI: 1.59-9.84) was found for a monthly consumption higher than 4 liters per month. This reinforces the notion of a particular sensitivity of young women to breast cancer in relation to alcohol consumption.\n      </p>", "The paper examines the historical and literary characteristics of mul \"wine\" in Persian poetry. Unlike may, which is a wide-spread term denoting \"wine\" in New Persian, mul is never employed in the writings of many outstanding representatives of Persian poetry-from the early period until R\u016bdak\u012b and Daq\u012bq\u012b. The first occurrences of this lexeme are attested in the Shahnameh by Firdous\u012b.\n      </p>", "When new liquor laws allowed British supermarkets to sell wine in the 1970s, Australian winemakers seized the business opportunity of a lifetime. The story of how a trickle of New World wines became a worldwide flood is also a case study in globalization, starring disgruntled French winemakers, desperate EU bureaucrats, worried Napa Valley tycoons, and Chinese and Japanese arrivistes acquiring a taste for the finer things in life.\n      </p>", "Many French wines, and now other kinds of agricultural products, manifest the process of \"patrimonialization\" as a counterforce to the homogenizing trends in the globalization of world food systems. The appellation contr\u00f4l\u00e9e (AOC) concept, which dates from 1935, is the oldest expression of that patrimonial process. In it, the characteristics of a place-the terroir-are used to gloss its legally protected, territorial definition on which hinge claims to a place-based product authenticity and, by extension, quality. AOC implementation, now with almost seven decades of experience in France, serves as the model to understand how the application of terroir to place has focused on land-use practice, wine definition, vinicultural tradition, and landscape preservation. A complementary process at work is product salience that establishes its individuality in an interactive expectation between producer and consumer. Fieldwork in the commune of Cassis (Department of Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne) in the South of France sorted the set of historical, environmental, and economic conditions to reveal the actual functioning of these two processes at a local level. Appellation Cassis contr\u00f4l\u00e9e, the third oldest and one of the smallest AOC in French viniculture, comprises 180 ha of vineyards and fourteen wine growers. In this case, establishment of product authenticity has been a continuous process. Wine types have evolved in spite of the absence of real innovation; political territory has been used to define terroir; the discourse of quality depends heavily on the historic past; vineyards have acquired a community value beyond any productivity; and producers have defined and defended their territory to boost its prestige to themselves and their consumers. The key entity in the appellation is the lower winegrowers syndicate. Presumptive statements, promotional rhetoric, consumer desire, and the politics of local decision making have shaped this wine region far beyond its environmental associations.\n      </p>", "To coincide with the 150th anniversary of the famous Bordeaux Wine Classification of 1855, the Centre for Policy Evaluation at the University of Nottingham sponsored a special session at the 2005 RES Annual Conference on the economics of wine. The 1855 classification was completed as part of the Paris Exhibition of the same year as a temporary means to determine which Bordeaux wines would be exhibited. The classification took hold, and is still in use today. In celebration, this Feature explores how economics can add to an understanding of wine production and wine markets.\n      </p>", "Chemical analyses of ancient organics absorbed into pottery jars from the beginning of advanced ancient Egyptian culture, ca. 3150 B.C., and continuing for millennia have revealed that a range of natural products\u2014specifically, herbs and tree resins\u2014were dispensed by grape wine. These findings provide chemical evidence for ancient Egyptian organic medicinal remedies, previously only ambiguously documented in medical papyri dating back to ca. 1850 B.C. They illustrate how humans around the world, probably for millions of years, have exploited their natural environments for effective plant remedies, whose active compounds have recently begun to be isolated by modern analytical techniques.\n      </p>", "Far away from the shining poles of France's two major wine regions, Bordeaux and Burgundy, Chinon is hidden away in the Loire Valley. Its wines are just as secret. Are they intellectuals' wines, as Jules Romains wrote, rife with unexpected savors, or are they simple country quaffers? However the wines of Chinon are seen, they must first be seen at all. And once they are on the oenophile's horizon, they require a certain type of gaze. In a world that is witnessing an increasingly technical approach to wine, both in wine tasting and wine making, Chinon's Cabernet Franc charms are atavistic rather than \"Parker friendly.\" Chinon is a bumpy path rather than a streamlined highway, and for those sensitive to its treasures, that is worth its weight in famous names, critics' points and high-alcohol \"fruit-bombs.\"\n      </p>", "The literature on winegrowing in the southwest of France, or Aquitaine, has largely recounted the past of the Bordeaux merchants and winegrowers who developed the celebrated grand crus. While the developers of quality wines did control the production and marketing of wine in the Aquitaine as a whole, missing from the literature are accounts of small growers of the interior who produced table wines and who forged the wine cooperative movement in the early twentieth century. This omission is attributable to a historical conjuncture that subordinated the producers of table wines to those who produced the grand crus while elevating these quality wines as the quintessential representative of the French wine industry. An ethnographic perspective, or one of critical historiography, on the wine cooperative movement can help to restore a plurality of winegrowing pasts.\n      </p>", "The U.S. wine market experienced rapid growth in all facets--production, consumption, exports, and imports--over the past decade. Red wine imports more than tripled while consumption of domestically produced red wines doubled. This research estimates demand elasticities of U.S. red wine imports from five countries accounting for over 90% of imports--Italy, France, Spain, Australia, and Chile--using the first-difference version of the almost ideal demand system (AIDS). These elasticities are compared with those for domestically produced red wine. Results for conditional expenditure elasticities indicate that the U.S. red wine industry gains over imports when U.S. consumers' total expenditures on red wine increase. However, comparing own- and cross-price elasticities reveals an increase in the price of U.S. red wine results in a decline in quantity demanded six times greater than for French and Italian red wines and over 20 times greater than other import countries, thus harming the U.S. red wine industry. Empirical results suggest that U.S. red-wine producers could increase their total revenue by decreasing prices, while Italian and French producers can increase total revenues by increasing them.\n      </p>", "The reputation of the city of Gaza as producer of a vintage of export quality to the west has long been known. However, the factors that made the name of Gaza synonymous with its wine in the 5th and 6th centuries are not so well known. Recent archaeological work, in conjunction with citations from literary sources, bear on the social and economic causes for the increased production and popularity of Gazan wine. With the advent of Palestinian monasticism, Gaza and its far-reaching environs experienced a fast-growing population of consumers and producers of wine. The appearance of extraordinarily large wine presses in the hinterland (the Negev) is evidence that the region was a major producer. Gaza, port of call for merchants and pilgrims to the Holy Land from the western provinces, was also the port for shipment of products to the west. Undoubtedly the ships that carried pilgrims to their home ports also carried cargoes of the same Gaza wine that pilgrims savored during their stay in Palestine and Sinai.\n      </p>", "In a rescue excavation at Knossos in 1977, a building dating to the last years of the hellenistic period was discovered. In it were an area with a stone tub and lid, the use of which was unknown, a well, and a wine press. The wine press had a treading-floor with remains of flooring composed of flagstones and plaster, which sloped towards a hole in a low barrier wall. The hole gave onto a stone spout, set above a tank coated in waterproof plaster. Adjacent was part of a store building, which was probably used as a cellar: it contained one pithos and there were indications that there had been others.

The VQA program aimed at improving the quality of British Columbia-produced wines by outlining standards and regulations for wine produced 100 percent from grown grapes. Wine sales in British Columbia are rapidly increasing, with domestically produced Canadian wines having the largest market share. This research examines consumers' valuation of VQA certification through a hedonic price analysis. Results show that consumers are willing to pay a premium for VQA red and white wines.

Design\u2014Red and white wine, bismuth salicylate, two solutions containing ethanol (diluted absolute ethanol and tequila), and sterilised water were tested against suspensions of salmonella, shigella, and Escherichia coli to determine relative antibacterial activity. Suspensions of 10\u2077 colony forming units of shigella, salmonella, and E coli were added to the test solutions and plated on standard nutrient agar at 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, and 120 minutes and 24 hours. Dilutions of wine and bismuth salicylate were then tested with E coli as the test bacterium, and the experiment repeated. Main outcome measures\u2014Exposure times necessary for eradication of organisms for the different solutions; decreases in colony counts at the different exposure times for dilutions of wine and bismuth salicylates. Results\u2014Undiluted wine and bismuth salicylate were both effective in reducing the number of viable organisms (by 10\u2075-10\u2076 colony forming units) after 20-30 minutes. Dilutions of wine were much more effective in decreasing colony counts than were similar dilutions of bismuth salicylate.

Two centuries later a Richmond physician finally found a grape hearty enough to sustain the region's tough climate. The result, Dr. Daniel Norton's \u201cVirginia Seedling\u201d\u2014what one grower calls \u201cbulletproof\u201d\u2014is naturally resistant to the American-born plagues that still haunt European grapes.\n         The grape grew in popularity not only in Virginia, but also in Missouri, where German immigrants made the state the country's leading winemaker. By the early twentieth century, however, the thriving viticulture in both states fell victim to a sweeping wave of prohibition. The wine industries vanished, taking Norton with them.\n         Norton returned to Missouri in 1965 when a vintner found the grape growing wild in a bootlegger's back yard. It didn't reappear in significant quantity in Virginia until fifty-six years after the repeal of Prohibition, reintroduced to its native land by a Missourian. In the decades since, the grape's production has grown partially as a result of the state's blossoming wine industry, but Norton still remains a little known varietal, championed by a handful of passionate growers.\n      </p>", "For several decades prior to the Pinochet regime Chile's wine industry was both restricted and protected by national laws. It offered a low-quality product to a captive, thirsty, national market and change was minimal. The majority of the wine grapes were mainly dry farmed in the Coast Range south of Cauquenes and on adjacent pieces of the Central Valley. With a dramatic drop in consumption after 1982 and the disappearance of half the wine grape vineyards in the following decade, wineries adopted the technology of the wine revolution in order to survive. By emphasizing premium varietal and directing a substantial proportion of production to export, Chilean wineries gained international acclaim. The wine industry's new orientation has resulted in the appearance of a number of new wineries with a corresponding change in the country's wine geography. Despite the changes, the wine industry continues to center on Santiago in many ways, exhibiting the attribute of capital city centralization typical of much economic activity in Latin America. En las d\u00e9cadas antes de la dictadura de Pinochet, la industria vitivin\u00edcola de Chile estaba a la vez restringuida y protegida por leyes nacionales. La industria casi no cambiaba y presentaba al mercado nacional un producto de calidad inferior. La mayor\u00eda de las uvas para vino estaban desarolladas en vi\u00f1edos sin riego en la Cordillera de la Costa al sur de Cauquenes y en tierras pr\u00f3ximas a la Cordillera en el Valle Central.

A quite different picture emerges from Britain where finds of the Italian Dressel 1 amphora peak at the very end of the form c. 10 B.C. The discrepancy between Gaul and Britain is explained by the export of commodities from Britain to supply the Roman army on the Rhine, and is the expression of a direct interest in the island by the Roman state. Afterwards, the number of wine amphoras reaching Britain declined sharply: in the 50 years before the Roman invasion the volume of amphora-borne wine imported by Britons fell by between two-thirds and three-quarters. This decline is apparent from both rich graves and settlement sites. The fall in the number of wine amphoras cannot be accounted for by the replacement of the amphora by the barrel as the standard commercial wine-container: we are dealing with a real decline in the volume of wine traded. In Gaul there was a similar slump in wine imports from Italy, and the same pattern is repeated in Mediterranean shipwrecks. It can be explained by growing demand for wine in Italy itself: wine that had hitherto been exported was now consumed in the peninsula.\n      </p>", "Objective To investigate whether people who buy wine buy healthier food items than those who buy beer.

Conclusions Wine buyers made more purchases of healthy food items than people who buy beer.\n      </p>", "At the end of the nineteenth century some of the less developed countries of Southern Europe often faced major problems when they sought to increase their exports of primary products. Such problems were a consequence of the tariff policies implemented by a number of their trading partners. In this article we analyse the case of the Spanish exports of ordinary table wine during the period 1890-1935. The expansion of wine production outside Europe meant that some countries in the American continent raised their tariffs to protect national production, which caused serious damage to exporters. Much more serious was the discriminatory trade policy initiated by France in 1891 which gave priority to the tariff-free importing of Algerian wine, as against the high tariffs that had to be paid by other exporters. This policy, as well as protecting French production, aimed to support her colonial policy in Algeria and seriously affected Spanish exports, as shown by our data and the econometric analysis we have carried out. The Spanish response resulted in a greater penetration of other European markets, thanks to the competitiveness of Spanish wine, but this did not prevent a serious crisis in the sector.\n      </p>", "Production of \"vino de coyol\" (palm sap wine) from Acrocomia mexicana (Arecaceae) was observed in Honduras.

Supply volatility, together with difficulties in establishing impersonal exchange mechanisms in place of those based on the personal reputation of economic agents, made it difficult to create a mass market. Not only did consumers receive insufficient information to identify quality prior to purchase, but the high price of some wines also encouraged cheap imitations, some of which were prejudicial to the health of the drinker.\n      </p>", "At the start of the twenty-first century, California wineries entered a new vinti-business (vertical integration of grape farming, wine production, and wine distribution) era based on the needs of a global wine economy by adapting historic survival lessons learned from their past. This agricultural success story illuminates the entrepreneurial energy and able instincts of California farmers who replicated, with modern twists, the big business canons of Gilded Age agricultural capitalism. Whether it be the Phyloxera outbreak in the 1880s Los Angeles region of Southern California, World War I, Prohibition, the Great Depression, the Second World War, and finally neoprohibition, wine entrepreneurs rebuilt each time by returning to nineteenth-century capitalist tenets intrinsic in a market economy. Successful wineries found ways to achieve the most efficient economy-of-scale operations through their use of science, promotion of sustainable agriculture, aggressive marketing, protection of wine's image from attacks by neoprohibitionists, and courtship of government agencies for money and favorable policies. After managing domestic production and sales, forward-thinking viticultural entrepreneurs then expanded their operations into the twenty-first century global market-place much like their predecessors from the century before.\n      </p>", "Two wine presses were discovered at Khirbet Yajuz, each consisting of the following: storage and treading basins, treading floor with remnants of mechanical pressing systems, and vats for sedimentation and collecting. Considering the architectural elements, the technological evidence of pressing, the parallel examples from various sites in the region, and the date of pottery from both presses, three stages of use can be suggested. (1) The construction of the southern press dated to the second century A. D. or slightly later; (2) at a later date the northern press was built while the southern press continued in use, and both presses lasted into the Byzantine period; (3) the southern press and part of the northern press were abandoned during the Umayyad period. Both presses were no longer in use by the end of the Umayyad period. The elaborate methods of pressing and the large size of the presses indicate that large vineyards were cultivated in the surrounding area in order to support the intensive production of wine.

We compared population characteristics of woodland caribou of the Red Wine Mountains Herd (RWMH) in central Labrador before (1981-88) and during a population decline (1993-97). During the 1980s, population estimates were 751 (no error estimation) animals in 1981, 736 \u00b1 172 (x\u0304 \u00b1 SE) in 1983, 610 \u00b1 9 in 1987, and 741 \u00b1 165 in 1989. By 1997, the herd declined to 151 animals (95% CI = 65-251). The decline was not associated with changes in parturition rate or in mean age of &gt;1-year-old females, but the decline was associated with significantly lower recruitment, a greater proportion of females in the &gt;1-year-old population, increased mortality of &gt;1-year-old females, and emigration to the parapatric George River Caribou Herd. Throughout the study, predation by gray wolves (Canis lupus) remained the most frequent cause of mortality of &gt;1-year-old caribou. We hypothesize that wolves may mediate the population dynamics of sedentary woodland caribou when associated with high densities of moose (Alces alces) and migratory caribou, but that the management implications of such a triad remain unclear.\n      </p>", "For the last decade, Libera Terra has been operating in Italy as a cooperative that turns land once used by the mafia into organic farms and undulating vineyards.

The effects of the internationalization of this industry for the importance and the quality of governance of intra-cluster cooperation involving firms and other actors are analysed. Two questions stand central. First, what has been the relative importance of external and internal factors in improving the export performance of the Chilean wine industry over the past 20 years? Second, to what extent have collective actions and investments played a part in this growth, and what has been the quality of the various governance regimes dealing with the associated collective action problems? Empirical evidence suggests that world-market developments and upgrading efforts by individual wineries largely explain the good export performance of the Chilean wine industry until the year 2000. The evidence also shows that the industry's success in world markets is stimulating cooperation between firms and other actors in areas where the industry needs to improve: marketing and promotion, internationalization, innovation and training. The enhanced cooperation has not only stimulated cluster development, but has also turned the quality of cluster governance into a central variable for future export growth. Nevertheless, several collective action problems await resolution before essential intra-cluster cooperation can develop. Overall, the evidence suggests that, in the case of the Chilean wine industry, industrial and cluster development do not automatically follow enhanced integration in world markets, but depend on the strategic skills of actors within the industry, in particular their ability to identify, prioritize, and realize collective investments while effectively managing the associated collective action problems. Internationalization stimulates firms to consider such investments, however, and provides them with an incentive to upgrade strategic skills at the local level as new opportunities arise and the pressure is there to exploit them in world markets.\n      </p>", "Chile's Colchagua Valley is both a geographical cluster of wineries and a dynamic learning network of wine-making professionals. A principal-agent problem arises in that the latter knowledge network is frowned upon by owners and top managers. Whereas experts aim at maximising quality, firms are interested in profits. Individual, personal success as a world-class expert is worth more to each professional, than to the respective winery. This conflict is compounded by traditional, authoritarian industrial relations. Multiple regression results confirm that expert network activity is a very poor predictor of award-winning international performance, or profits.\n      </p>", "China has produced wine from grapes since the second century, B.C., but interest in Western wines did not begin until the late nineteenth century. Professor Godley describes the origins of the modern industry, which he traces back to an overseas Chinese entrepreneur from Southeast Asia who, despite the obvious advantages held by foreign competitors, began the construction of the country's first modern winery in 1892. One of the more unusual capitalist ventures in the late Qing and early Republican periods, the company ran into financial difficulties, but not before it had established a precedent for what is now a rapidly expanding business. Although the vicissitudes of the grape wine industry illustrate some important points about modern Chinese economic development, the author offers this case study in business history as something of an allegory: wine as a symbol for the meeting of East and West, yesterday and today.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "World patterns of the consumption of wine, spirits and beer can be obtained using data collected by the Food and Agriculture Organization [sic]. About half the world's consumption of absolute alcohol comes from spirits, one third from beer, the rest from wine. Spirits are the leading drink in Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, Central and Northern America and most of Asia; wine in southern Europe, parts of South America and Central Asia; beer in northern Europe, North America and Australasia. The production of grapes from which wine is made is climatically limited and consumption is high only in the regions of production, i.e. mainly areas of Mediterraneantype climate. Beer production is much more widely distributed, and only a very small amount is exported. Spirits, unlike beer and wine, can be made from a wide variety of plants, and so their consumption is not limited to areas of production. Income per capita, religion, migration and several other factors influence the relative importance of the beverages in different parts of the world.\n      </p>", "Many substances in the plant kingdom and in man's diet occur as glycosides. Recent studies have indicated that many glycosides that are not mutagenic in tests such as the Salmonella test become mutagenic upon hydrolysis of the glycosidic linkages. The Salmonella test utilizes a liver homogenate to approximate mammalian metabolism but does not provide a source of the enzymes present in intestinal bacterial flora that hydrolyze the wide variety of glycosides present in nature. We describe a stable cell-free extract of human feces, fecalase, which is shown to contain various glycosidases that allow the in vitro activation of many natural glycosides to mutagens in the Salmonella/liver homogenate test. Many beverages, such as red wine (but apparently not white wine) and tea, contain glycosides of the mutagen quercetin. Red wine, red grape juice, and tea were mutagenic in the test when fecalase was added, and red wine contained considerable direct mutagenic activity in the absence of fecalase. The implications of quercetin mutagenicity and carcinogenicity are discussed.\n      </p>", "The 1863rd Stated Meeting was hosted by the Academy's Western Center in Napa, California, on November 2, 2002.

Electrocardiogram, blood pressure, serum total cholesterol, and \u03b3-glutamyltransferase level were routinely measured. Seventy-seven per cent of the subjects drank wine; there was little difference between social classes in this proportion. We evaluated mortality over 10-15 years of follow-up.

Most of the ostraca and all of the reference samples form a tight chemical group, indicating that they were most likely made of a Theban marl clay and thus produced locally, perhaps in a royal workshop. Although the contents of amphoras were generally stated to have been produced elsewhere, they were evidently imported, 'rebottled', and then sealed and registered at a central facility in Thebes. The uniform procedures that were followed and the fact that most vessels were used only once may reflect the special circumstances for which they were intended--the heb-sed.

Comparative analysis with other well-studied European regions is conducted within the general frame of the socio-cultural context of climate and other impacts on a pre-industrial society. Secondly, a significant cultural change is evaluated: the beginning of raki (brandy or Brandtwein) production and consumption in the Central Balkans. This change is first recorded in Bosnia and Serbia in the late sixteenth century, at the same time as wine-growing began to diminish, and by the nineteenth century raki had replaced the popular consumption of wine. The results of the historical analysis show which adaptive strategies farmers in Ottoman Bosnia applied as they faced the challenges of climate deterioration and harvest failures, as well as those of war, famine and epidemics. The survival strategies included crop pattern changes, abandonment of viticulture, intensification of pig rearing and itinerant trade and population migrations, which all correspond well to the situation observed in other European states and the Ottoman Empire.

We sequenced the complete genome of the diploid commercial wine yeast EC1118, resulting in an assembly of 31 scaffolds covering 97% of the S288c reference genome. The wine yeast differed strikingly from the other 5. cerevisiae isolates in possessing 3 unique large regions, 2 of which were subtelomeric, the other being inserted within an EC1118 chromosome. These regions encompass 34 genes involved in key wine fermentation functions. Phytogeny and synteny analyses showed that 1 of these regions originated from a species closely related to the Saccharomyces genus, whereas the 2 other regions were of non-Saccharomyces origin. We identified Zygosaccharomyces bailii, a major contaminant of wine fermentations, as the donor species for 1 of these 2 regions. Although natural hybridization between Saccharomyces strains has been described, this report provides evidence that gene transfer may occur between Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces species. We show that the regions identified are frequent and differentially distributed among 5. cerevisiae clades, being found almost exclusively in wine strains, suggesting acquisition through recent transfer events. Overall, these data show that the wine yeast genome is subject to constant remodeling through the contribution of exogenous genes. Our results suggest that these processes are favored by \u00e9cologie proximity and are involved in the molecular adaptation of wine yeasts to conditions of high sugar, low nitrogen, and high ethanol concentrations.\n      </p>", "Von Mises' wine/water paradox has long served as an argument against the Principle of Indifference.

Moreover, little is known about the effects of long-term alcohol intake on life expectancy. Methods: The impact of long-term alcohol intake and types of alcoholic beverages consumed on cardiovascular mortality and life expectancy at age 50 was investigated in the Zutphen Study, a cohort of 1373 men born between 1900 and 1920 and examined repeatedly between 1960 and 2000. Hazard ratios (HRs) for total alcohol intake and alcohol from wine, beer and spirits were obtained from time-dependent Cox regression models. Life expectancy at age 50 was calculated from areas under survival curves. Results: Long-term light alcohol intake, that is \u226420 g per day, compared with no alcohol, was strongly and inversely associated with cerebrovascular (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.70), total cardiovascular (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.89) and all-cause mortality (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.91). Independent of total alcohol intake, long-term wine consumption of, on average, less than half a glass per day was strongly and inversely associated with coronary heart disease (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.89), total cardiovascular (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.86) and all-cause mortality (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.87). These results could not be explained by differences in socioeconomic status. Life expectancy was about 5 years longer in men who consumed wine compared with those who did not use alcoholic beverages.

Hence, Alsace wine is the ideal locus to sense and understand \u201cterroir\u201d in wine. The author examines whether and how subsoil flavor can be sensed in wine flavor. In particular, he assesses what could account for \u201cmineral\u201d smells and tastes in wine. Most Alsace wines are composed of one grape variety. Until recently all Grand Cru wines had to be composed of only one of the four varietals: Riesling, Gewurztraminer, Pinot Gris, and Muscat d'Alsace. Recent changes in wine legislation allow other vine varieties or blends of varieties in Grand Cru wines. The author examines the relationship of these legal changes to the terroir issue and to the marketability of Alsace wine. The author substantiates his theses by comparing and contrasting the opinions of various Alsace winemakers whom he interviewed in November of 2007.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "An approach is developed to examine the impact of product characteristics on choice using a quantity-dependent hedonic model with retail panel data. Since panel data for individual products from retail settings can include a large number of zero sales, a modification of the zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression model is proposed for estimation. Results for this model compare favorably to results for alternative hurdle and negative binomial models. An application of this methodology to restaurant wine sales produces useful results regarding sensory characteristics, price, and originvarietal information.\n      </p>", "On a crisp fall day in April 1936, Delia Larrive Escudero was picking grapes for the family's table at the small vineyard her father kept at the back of their house when she received a visit from her brother, who bore good news. Her father had given his consent\u2014she was only sixteen-years-old\u2014for Delia to enter the first official Queen of the Grape Harvest (reina de la vendimia) competition, in the province of Mendoza, in western Argentina. She would represent Godoy Cruz, one of Mendoza's seventeen departments, each with its own particular terrain, from the lush creeks shaded by pine forests of Tunuyan to the vast barren valleys of clay soil of Tupungato. Like many others in the province, Delia was from an immigrant family. Over hundreds of years, immigrants\u2014principally from Italy and Spain\u2014had transformed the desert at the feet of the Andes into vineyards that bear a bounty of fruit to this day.\n         Mendoza has been celebrating the harvest in one way or another since Spanish colonists, and Jesuits introduced grapes to Argentina (via Chile) in the late 1500s as a source for sweet Mass wine.\n      </p>", "The theory of niche construction suggests that organisms may engineer environments via their activities. Despite the potential of this phenomenon being realized by Darwin, the capability of niche construction to generally unite ecological and evolutionary biology has never been empirically quantified. Here I quantify the fitness effects of Saccharomyces cerevisiae's ecosystem engineering in a natural ferment in order to understand the interaction between ecological and evolutionary processes. I show that S. cerevisiae eventually dominates in fruit niches, where it is naturally initially rare, by modifying the environment through fermentation (the Crabtree effect) in ways which extend beyond just considering ethanol production. These data show that an additional cause of S. cerevisiae's competitive advantage over the other yeasts in the community is due to the production of heat via fermentation. Even though fermentation is less energetically efficient than respiration, it seems that this trait has been selected for because its net effect provides roughly a 7% fitness advantage over the other members of the community. These data provide an elegant example of niche construction because this trait clearly modifies the environment and therefore the selection pressures to which S. cerevisiae, and other organisms that access the fruit resource, including humans, are exposed to.\n      </p>", "In Quevedo's sonnet #531 the mosquito functions as a supplement, disrupting the perfection of the wine and the formal order of the poem, transgressing the strict thematic divisions in the work. Through metaphor, vocabulary, and neologism, the mosquito is portrayed as one link in a potentially infinite chain of supplementation. But the term \"mosquito\" also serves to create a play between links in the chain, which is dissolved altogether as the wine is ingested. This consumption, by both mosquito and persona, reveals the wine as a pharmakon. Related works are also explored.\n      </p>", "Objectives: To determine the association between postmenopausal breast cancer and prior consumption of alcoholic beverages. Methods: This case-control study, conducted in all Montreal hospitals between 1996 and 1997, included 556 postmenopausal women (age 50-75 years) who had a new histologically confirmed diagnosis of primary, malignant breast cancer. Control subjects (577) were selected from other histologically confirmed sites of cancer. A detailed history of alcohol consumption and other risk factors was obtained by interview. Indices reflecting alcohol consumption were developed and unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Current regular drinkers of any type of alcohol were at an increased risk of breast cancer (OR = 1.5; 95% CI 1.0-2.2). For all beverages considered, current regular drinkers showed higher risks than ever regular drinkers. The risk of breast cancer was highest among women who reported exclusive drinking of wine on a weekly or daily basis (e.g. current regular drinking: OR = 2.3; 95% CI 1.2-4.3). Women who started to drink wine on or before the age of 40 were at a 2.5 times increased risk (95% CI 1.4-4.4). Conclusions: Our findings provide further support for a positive association between the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer and alcohol consumption.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Regional leaders, cultural intermediaries and the wine industry collaborated to overcome overproduction, prohibition and foreign as well as regional competition by exploiting the concept of terroir to develop a repertoire of popular festivals such as the Gastronomic Fair of Dijon, the Paul\u00e9e of Meursault, Saint Vincent parades, an annual wine auction at the Hospice in Beaune and a Burgundian Pavilion at the 1937 World's Fair in Paris. These drew attention to the unique qualities of their wines and suggested how they might be best consumed. This aggressive marketing strategy was so successful that it became a model for French agricultural products promoted through the syst\u00e8me d'appelation d'origine control\u00e9e. The result united natural resources, historical memory, marketing strategies and cultural performance into an imaginative and enduring form of commercial regionalism. /// Durant la p\u00e9riode de l'entre-deux-guerres, les Bourguignons ont d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 de nouvelles strat\u00e9gies culturelles pour commercialiser leurs vins.

In Experiment 1, tasters described a set of wines. Experts described the wines using more specific features than did intermediates, who, in turn, used more specific features than did novices. Specificity in describing wines was not related to discrimination performance on a psychophysical test. A regression analysis indicated that the features identified by the expert as well as those identified by the nonexpert tasters covaried with grape type, such that wines of the same grape were described more similarly than were wines of different grapes. In Experiment 2, the same tasters sorted the wines into clusters. Experts, unlike nonexperts, tended to sort the wines explicitly by grape type. Moreover, the features of the wines (described by the tasters in Experiment 1) covaried significantly better by the experts' clusters than they did by the nonexperts' clusters. Indeed, the features identified by the nonexperts covaried significantly worse when the wines were clustered by their own sortings than they did when the wines were clustered by actual grape type. It is suggested that the acquisition of wine expertise, a domain that is at once conceptual and perceptual, entails not only a greater differentiation of features but also a restructuring of the explicit schemes of classification.\n      </p>"], "words": {"all": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "dynamic": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "farms": {"number": 1,
