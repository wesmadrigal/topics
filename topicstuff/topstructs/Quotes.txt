{"total_words": 145, "documents": ["This study examines two public hearings on a zoning proposal that would allow the construction of a Super Wal-Mart Center on a field over the town's aquifer. Many citizens speak out against the zoning change because of the risk to drinking water, as well as other issues. Citizens face the speaker's problem of how to make their presentations convincing, given the technical matters involved and the fact that Town Board members have likely already heard about these issues. Some speakers draw on the words of others in their presentations. Using another's words allows the speaker to cite an authoritative source or to respond to what another has said, to evaluate it, and often to challenge it. Speakers use other devices in addition to quotes, such as formulations, repetition, and membership categorizations to develop their evaluative stances in the reporting context. The study's focus is the discursive construction and rhetoric of using others' words for the speaker's own purposes.\n      </p>", "On May 26 and 27, 1994 several national newspapers reported the findings of Christie and Schultz (1994) who cannot reject the hypothesis that market makers of active NASDAQ stocks implicitly colluded to maintain spreads of at least $0.25 by avoiding odd-eighth quotes. On May 27, dealers in Amgen, Cisco Systems, and Microsoft sharply increased their use of odd-eighth quotes, and mean inside and effective spreads fell nearly 50 percent. This pattern was repeated for Apple Computer the following trading day. Using individual dealer quotes for Apple and Microsoft, we find that virtually all dealers moved in unison to adopt odd-eighth quotes.\n      </p>", "This paper compares the quality of quotes submitted by electronic communication networks (ECNs) and by traditional market makers to the Nasdaq quote montage. An analysis of the most active Nasdaq stocks shows that ECNs not only post informative quotes, but also, compared to market makers, ECNs post quotes rapidly and are more often at the inside. Additionally, ECN quoted spreads are smaller than dealer quoted spreads. The evidence suggests that the proliferation of alternative trading venues, such as ECNs, may promote quote quality rather than fragmenting markets. Moreover, the results suggest that a more open book contributes to quote quality.\n      </p>", "Endophasia, phenomenologically speaking, is speech without a signal. While its activity was at first noticed in pathology and in dreams as an effect of the intrusion of the unconscious, its everyday existence presents just as much of an enigma for linguistic analysis, which is used to approaching its sequences in scriptural form. Writing being founded on a conventional, and partial, correspondence between graphs and certain properties inherent in phonetic utterances, internal speech by contrast offers only a temporal dimension to acoustic apprehension. This temporal dimension operates on two levels: in the breakdown of phonemes and in their reduction via processes skin to anaphora: quotes. Thus it is on both phonological and semantic levels that endophasia provides the touchstone of theories of language.\n      </p>", "The NASDAQ multiple dealer market is designed to produce narrow bid-ask spreads through the competition for order flow among individual dealers. However, we find that odd-eighth quotes are virtually nonexistent for 70 of 100 actively traded NASDAQ securities, including Apple Computer and Lotus Development. The lack of odd-eighth quotes cannot be explained by the negotiation hypothesis of Harris (1991), trading activity, or other variables thought to impact spreads. This result implies that the inside spread for a large number of NASDAQ stocks is at least $0.25 and raises the question of whether NASDAQ dealers implicitly collude to maintain wide spreads.\n      </p>", "This paper presents an empirical microstructure model of bid and ask quotes that features discreteness, random costs of market making, and ARCH volatility effects. Applied to intraday quotes at 15-minute intervals for Alcoa (a randomly chosen Dow stock), the results show that quote exposure costs contain stochastic components that are persistent and large relative to the deterministic intraday \"U\" components. Analysis of the filtered estimates of the system suggest that bid and ask costs contain common components, and that these costs reflect risk as proxied by ARCH variance forecasts.\n      </p>", "This study examines the behavior of laboratory markets in which two uninformed market makers compete to trade with heterogeneously informed investors. The data provide three main results. First, market makers set quotes to protect against adverse selection and to control inventory. Second, when investors are less well-informed, their trades are less reliable measures of their information, and market makers respond to those trades with greater skepticism. Third, errors in market makers' reactions to trades cause the time-series behavior of quotes and prices to depend on the information environment in ways beyond those captured in extant theory.\n      </p>", "A test for lead-lag relationships between daily beef carcass price quotes from two privately owned wholesale meat price reporting services is reported in this article. The method used is the residual cross correlation technique of the Granger causality approach. The results suggest strong evidence of instantaneous price movements but indicate that \"The Yellow Sheet\" price quotes tend to lead \"The Meat Sheet\" price quotes by one or two days.\n      </p>", "Urner Barry quotes are used to price about 500 trailer loads of shell eggs daily. Price changes are based on market \"tone\" and are more reflective of short term projections than historical prices. The prices were found to be determined largely by inventory levels, a feasible if suboptimal means of maintaining equilibrium. The principal practical limitation of Urner Barry prices is the tendency toward excessive stability, particularly in the downward direction. Excessive stability can encourage retail specialing of eggs, at lower prices, and increases the need for negotiations between sellers and buyers.\n      </p>", "The main aim of this paper is that of providing a unified analysis for some interesting uses of quotation marks, including so-called scare quotes. The phenomena exemplified by the cases I discuss have remained relatively unexplored, notwithstanding a growing interest in the behavior of quotation marks. They are, however, of no lesser interest than other, more widely studied effects achieved with the help of quotation $\\text{marks}.^{1}$ In particular, as I argue in what follows, scare quotes and other similar instances bear interesting relations with some important themes in the study of natural languages, such as questions regarding alleged devices of conventional implicature, cases of so-called metalinguistic negation, and, more generally, problems pertaining to the distinction between semantic and pragmatic fields of inquiry. In Section 1, I begin with a description of some examples involving the uses of quotation marks I intend to discuss, and I hint at some desiderata for their analysis. In Section 2, I temporarily abandon quotation marks, and, inspired by the recent work of Stephen Neale and Kent Bach on alleged devices of conventional implicature, I present what I call the theory of message and attachment. In Sections 3 and 4, I return to my initial examples, I employ the theory of message and attachment in their analysis, and I discuss certain features regarding the behavior of negation in some related cases.\n      </p>", "This study employs a non-parametric approach to investigate the volatility risk premium in the over-the-counter currency option market. Using a large database of daily delta-neutral straddle quotes in four major currencies\u2014the British pound, the euro, the Japanese yen, and the Swiss franc\u2014we find that volatility risk is priced in all four currencies across different option maturities. We find that the volatility risk premium is negative, with the premium decreasing in maturity. Finally, we also find evidence that jump risk may be priced in the currency option market.\n      </p>", "This paper, utilizing dealer's \"trading book\" information, presents some empirical evidence supporting the validity of a dealer pricing model. It shows that much of the transaction prices variation may be explained by the specialist's optimal determination of his bid and ask quotes. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the dealer's bid-ask spread is an important explanatory variable in the observed transaction return. Finally, it indicates that the dealer's inventory level may affect his quotes and thus the transaction prices and order arrivals. The paper provides insights into the relationship between transaction prices and equilibrium prices, which will permit more extensive use of transaction data in empirical investigations. It also provides a better understanding of optimal dealer pricing strategies, suggesting that the proposed empirical model may be used to evaluate a dealer's trading performance.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
