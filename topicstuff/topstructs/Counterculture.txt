{"total_words": 205, "documents": ["In the 1950s, exotica was a genre of pop music that specialized in depicting imaginary exotic paradises and conventionalized natives. By the late 1960s, exotica pop had disappeared, but its tropes of temporal and spatial disjuncture persisted, structuring the music, visual art, and social theory of the utopian counterculture. While 1950s and 1960s kinds of exotica differ in their preferred imaginary destinations, both raise the question of what intermediate shades between belief and disbelief are demanded by aestheticized representations of human life. This essay theorizes exotica as a mode of representation governed by a peculiar mode of reception\u2014one of willed credulity enabled by submission to its spectacle. What exotica demands is what intellectuals are least likely to give, though, and the peculiar pleasures of exotica spectacle are denigrated or rendered invisible in the hermeneutic regime.\n      </p>", "Conventional and counterculture families are discussed as ideal types in eight activity areas ranging from childrearing and economics to religious and leisure time use. Counterculture forms show either promise or hypothetical superiority in meeting needs in five of the areas. Characteristics of both family forms are discussed in terms of social control and personal growth implications. Research, based on an awareness of goals, is suggested.\n      </p>", "The Cultural Revolution provided a unique environment for children of the political elite to develop a new kind of hooliganism and a youth counterculture that contradicted Mao's aim to empower them for making revolution. The author challenges a view commonly held by Western commentators and scholars that Wang Shuo is a writer of \"common man\" fiction by highlighting the aristocratic background of his Cultural Revolution-era hooligan characters. In the post-Mao era, these former aristocratic youth hooligans tried to adapt to the new environment of growing commercialism and materialism. Some successfully joined the new elite through legal or illegal means, while those who failed to do so became marginalized and even impoverished. The author argues that it was the latter who felt the need to develop to perfection the skill of fast talk and an irreverent, knowing, and playful attitude, which helped them to maintain a sense of superiority. Glorified by Wang Shuo in his stories and commentary, the hooligan characters captured the imagination of many Chinese, especially the younger generations who feel marginalized and alienated, by legitimizing their desires and frustrations and by subverting the dominant ideology and culture.\n      </p>", "The primary purpose of this study was to compare and contrast an organization's official culture and its subcultures. The proposition that soft bureaucracies project a rigid exterior appearance, symbolizing what key stakeholders expect, while masking a loosely-coupled set of interior practices, guided this analysis of a police organization. The official culture (crime-fighting command bureaucracy) was examined as an arbitrary set of symbols and meaning structures arranged according to top management preferences. Using qualitative and quantitative data, the organization's subcultures were profiled. It was demonstrated that top management was unable to impose organization-wide conformance with the official culture. There was close conformance to the official culture in only one of five distinct clusters of officers (\"crime-fighting commandoes,\" 21 percent of the sample). Officers in the other clusters (\"crime-fighting street professionals,\" \"peace-keeping moral entrepreneurs,\" \"ass-covering legalists,\" and \"anti-military social workers\") substantially modified or rejected top management's dictates. They represented resistance subcultures, similar in their opposition to official culture, but unique in form. It was concluded that other organizations, not known for their monolithic image and solidarity, also encompass subcultures.\n      </p>", "This paper examines the mechanism of charismatic authority and the nature of religious life as advocated by two genres of charismatic religion: Hasidism and The Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity. Both the Jewish and Neo-Christian examples achieved prominence in the counterculture during the seventies. The paper argues that: (1) Weber's notions of the inherent precariousness of charismatic leadership and its requirement for empirical verification need modification; (2) charismatic authority appears more intimately related to a fixed norm than Weber suggested; (3) the twin processes of infantilization (the overconcretizing of a symbol) and scientism (truth comes only from the scientific method) have resulted in an apparent confusion of divine and human roles; and (4) the lack of clarity concerning transcendence as a referent has yielded a vulgarized form of homo religious.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "The Bread and Puppet's \"Domestic Resurrection Circus\" emerged within the counterculture of the 1960s and '70s and continued through 1998. Bell places this long-running event within the cultural ecology of Vermont and the U. S. A.\n      </p>", "The purpose of this essay is threefold: (1) methodological, to clarify a basic distinction in Max Weber's work, and historical analysis in general, between socio-historical models and developmental or \"secular\" theories; (2) theoretical, to examine two neglected aspects of Weber's analysis of charisma, the community of ideological virtuosi (a model), and the charisma of reason as a revolutionary legitimation founded on natural rights (a developmental theory); (3) substantive, to apply model and theory to the counterculture in order to provide a novel theoretical framework for its further study. Socio-historical models are generalizations which emphasize the repetitive side of history; developmental theories describe and explain particular historical phenomena. The model of the charismatic community of ideological virtuosi comprises an emotional consociation with a distinct pattern of ideology, membership and want satisfaction. Historically, the charisma of reason and natural rights, which infused its principles into the French Revolution and later into ethical socialism, was destroyed by the advent of evolutionary and deterministic Marxism. The recent youth and student rebellions are viewed as the charismatic eruption of a new moral mood reviving the charisma of reason, and the contemporary peaceful communes and warlike groups are interpreted as the counterculture's charismatic core.\n      </p>", "The presumed attractiveness of countercultural orientations to young, educated, baby boomers led many scholars to proclaim the 1960s counterculture as the driving force behind declining religious participation, and a supposed growing distaste for biblical religion. In contrast, theories of religious behavior predict substantial continuity in religious orientations and commitments. Social ties and life course events influence religious beliefs and rates of participation, yet these ties and transitions often support traditional religious expressions. I integrate insights from studies of baby boomer religion with more general theories of religious commitment, merging theories of the dual nature of social structures with rational choice perspectives on religious behavior. Using data from the 1965-1982 Youth Parent Socialization Panel Study, I analyze the relative influence of three factors on baby boomers' religious orientations and participation: (1) traditional agents of socialization (denominations, parents, and schools); (2) life course factors (marriage, divorce, and childrearing); and, (3) participation in the protest movements of the 1960s and early 1970s - a widely cited countercultural protagonist of religious change. I also demonstrate how prior religious orientations directed participation in the counterculture. My analyses show that traditional socialization agents, life course factors, and countercultural participation all play a role in directing future religious orientations and commitments. However, traditional socialization factors have a dominant influence on future religious beliefs and participation.\n      </p>", "\"Cowboys\" and \"Hippies\" are not as different as one might think. This article explores the connections between cowboys and hippies portrayed by 1960s and 1970s countercultural musicians, moviemakers, and novelists who stressed themes of the Myth of the West and the Cowboy Code. These portrayals of \"Cosmic Cowboys\" show that many scholars' generalizations about the \"radical\" and \"leftist\" nature of the 1960s \"counterculture\" break down under close inspection.\n      </p>", "A content analysis of values in dominant culture magazines in the United States, Canada and Great Britain during 1957-59, 1967-69 and 1970-72 indicated a priority on instrumentalism and little shifting in overall value preference over time. This appears to be contrary to predictions made by counterculture observers that Western society was changing rapidly toward a countercultural ideology. A similar analysis of the underground press in the same countries during 1967-69 and 1970-72 revealed a marked shift from expressive priorities during the earlier period to political priorities during the later period. These findings and their implications are discussed.\n      </p>", "           ", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

This article reframes the protest through the lens of movement culture and analyzes the ties between different social movements. Activists at Columbia were a motley coalition of Harlemites and students, political and cultural radicals, black and white. This article argues that the establishment of five communes in occupied campus buildings facilitated the temporary reconciliation of political and social difference that accounts for the formation of the Columbia coalition. The tight confines within each commune sparked intense political and cultural debate but also forced activists to recognize the legitimacy of other views in the name of commune solidarity. The creation of multiple communes, however, allowed for several protest factions-including a black separatist group-to coexist under a single banner. The Columbia coalition provided a fleeting moment of unity during a period characterized by black separatism, white student radicalization, and counterculture flight to rural communes.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Early in the morning of May 12,1971, workmen armed with chainsaws arrived at the Kungstradgarden, a park in central Stockholm, to remove a group of elm trees on the site of a planned subway entrance and shopping mall. The timing was chosen to outmanuever protesters, who for several weeks had camped on the site in a final attempt to stop the trees being felled. However, on the night in question, thousands of people quickly gathered and the protest turned violent. In the history of modern Swedish planning, the \"Almstriden\" (The elm war) can be seen as a turning point. The action of saving a group of symbolically significant trees came to mark an end of the general support for modernization that had marked Swedish culture since 1930 during the years of socialist government, and also marked an end to the nation's trust in the welfare state's planning system under socialist government. This article traces the peculiar amalgamation of conservative and radical movements engaged in the \"saving\" of Stockholm's historic core, arguing that the turn away from \"the modern\" represents a fundamental shift in Swedish preservation culture that would lead finally to a redefinition and expansion of what constituted a historic object.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
