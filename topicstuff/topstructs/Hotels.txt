Yield management research and systems have been designed for transient business in which the group forecast is taken as a given. In this research, forecast data from approximately 90 hotels of a large North American hotel chain were used to determine the accuracy of group forecasts and to identify factors associated with accurate forecasts. Forecasts showed a positive bias and had a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 40% at two months before arrival; 30% at one month before arrival; and 10-15% on the day of arrival. Larger hotels, hotels with a higher dependence on group business, and hotels that updated their forecasts frequently during the month before arrival had more accurate forecasts.\n      </p>", "Immigrant entrepreneurs often rely on their group's local social capital in their new home market to establish and maintain their businesses. In particular, immigrant entrepreneurs with few resources of their own receive help from those possessing more resources. Supporting these arguments using the empirical setting of Gujarati immigrant entrepreneurs in the lodging industry, we find that the likelihood of survival of an immigrant entrepreneur's hotel increases when surrounded by higher counts of branded hotels (representing high-resource establishments) owned by individuals from their ethnic group but is unaffected by unbranded motels (representing low-resource establishments) owned by members of their ethnic group or by branded hotels owned by individuals from other ethnic groups. These results isolate and reinforce the importance of social capital not only for immigrant entrepreneurs but also more generally for any entrepreneurs belonging to ethnic, professional, religious, or social groups.\n      </p>", "The authors analyze data from a service guarantee program implemented by a midpriced hotel chain. Using a multisite regression discontinuity quasi-experimental design developed over 16 months, they control for unobserved heterogeneity among guests and treatments across hotels and develop Bayesian posterior estimates of the varying program effect for each hotel. The results contribute to theory and practice. First, they provide new insights into how service guarantee programs operate in the field. Specifically, the guarantee was more effective at hotels with a better prior service history and an easier-to-serve guest population, which is consistent with signaling arguments but does not comport with the incentive argument that guarantees actually improve service quality. Second, the results offer managers better decision rules. Specifically, the authors devise program continuation rules that are sensitive to both observed and unobserved differences across sites. In addition, they devise policies to reward hotels that exceed site-specific expectations. By controlling for observed and unobserved differences across sites, the authors show that these policies potentially reward even hotels with negative net program effects, which is useful in reducing the organizational stigma of failure. Finally, the authors identify sites that should be targeted for future program rollout by computing the odds of succeeding.\n      </p>", "This article is about the social and cultural significance of hotels in the Nepal Himalaya. Through a socio-semiotic approach, I analyse how the hotel in Himalayan tourism functions as an architectural form that mediates different social domains, and through the process embeds the ideology of 'development' in everyday life, producing the power relations that would in turn generate their very contestations. By treating the materiality of the hotel as an anthropological tool, we are thus able more fully to understand how a community's pursuit of development and intensive engagement with tourism have resulted in the creation of new forms of subjectivity as well as social and political relationships. / Le pr\u00e9sent article est consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 la signification sociale et culturelle des h\u00f4tels dans l'Himalaya n\u00e9palais.

Design Follow-up study. Setting Canada 1991-2001. Participants 15 100 homeless and marginally housed people enumerated in 1991 census. Main outcome measures Age specific and age standardised mortality rates, remaining life expectancies at age 25, and probabilities of survival from age 25 to 75. Data were compared with data from the poorest and richest income fifths as well as with data for the entire cohort Results Of the homeless and marginally housed people, 3280 died. Mortality rates among these people were substantially higher than rates in the poorest income fifth, with the highest rate ratios seen at younger ages. Among those who were homeless or marginally housed, the probability of survival to age 75 was 32% (95% confidence interval 30% to 34%) in men and 60% (56% to 63%) in women. Remaining life expectancy at age 25 was 42 years (42 to 43) and 52 years (50 to 53), respectively. Compared with the entire cohort, mortality rate ratios for men and women, respectively, were 11.5 (8.8 to 15.0) and 9.2 (5.5 to 15.2) for drug related deaths, 6.4 (5.3 to 7.7) and 8.2 (5.0 to 13.4) for alcohol related deaths, 4.8 (3.9 to 5.9) and 3.8 (2.7 to 5.4) for mental disorders, and 2.3 (1.8 to 3.1) and 5.6 (3.2 to 9.6) for suicide. For both sexes, the largest differences in mortality rates were for smoking related diseases, ischaemic heart disease, and respiratory diseases. Conclusions Living in shelters, rooming houses, and hotels is associated with much higher mortality than expected on the basis of low income alone. Reducing the excessively high rates of premature mortality in this population would require interventions to address deaths related to smoking, alcohol, and drugs, and mental disorders and suicide, among other causes.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Consideration of the commitment problem indicates that hotel chains are better off naming their units the same, so as to create the potential for future business from customers. However, some hoteliers believed units should be named differently so they are not identified with the chain. These two strategies illustrate a powerful tension between strategies that allow the organization to be more consistent, and strategies that facilitate adaptation to local conditions.

It then seeks to explain the locational geographies of airport hotel development, in response to these new trends. Finally, the article describes how the business traveller is conceived of and (speculatively) catered for by airport hotel operators and designers within a discourse of connectivity, before providing some counter-examples of how such claims fail to address the hotel's place within the complexity of airport spatial organization.\n      </p>", "This study uses the hybrid DEA model, in which the proportionate inputs are evaluated with a radial measure and the non-proportionate inputs are evaluated with a non-radial measure in order to evaluate the impact of marketing expense on the efficiency of Taiwan's international tourist hotels. We further introduce the hybrid DEA into the technology gap measurement to evaluate the technology gaps of marketing expense utilization between different operating types. The empirical results indicate that the inefficiency caused from excess marketing expense is the main reason for lower efficiency in many tourist hotels, especially to chain-operated hotels and hotels that cater to domestic clients. Through the hybrid technology gap measurement, we find that the utilization of marketing resources is more effective for independent, city type hotels, as well as those that cater to international clients.\n      </p>", "Twenty water samples collected from 6 hotels situated in various areas of Greece were examined for the presence of Legionella pneumophila and Legionella-like organisms.

The price optimization module determines optimal room rates based on occupancy, price elasticity, and competitive prices. The approach used is a major advancement over existing revenue management systems, which assume that demands by rate segments are independent of price and of each other. As of this writing, over 2,000 Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG) hotels use the price optimization module; all IHG properties will eventually use it. To date, price optimization has achieved $145 million in incremental revenue for IHG. At full rollout, we anticipate that this capability will generate approximately $400 million per year.\n      </p>", "While competition decreases rents for firms, the presence of competitors may create benefits. Competitors that agglomerate, that are physically proximate, may create externalities-production efficiencies or heightened demand that increases rents. When such externalities exist, then who gains from and who contributes to them? We examine how other competitors' traits affect performance in Texas's lodging industry. In rural markets, we find that chain hotels and larger hotels contribute to positive externalities. While expecting those hotels similar to the establishments creating these externalities to gain, we find the opposite. Independent hotels and smaller hotels gain the most. Interestingly, some establishments are harmed.\n      </p>", "Odnosi s javno\u0161\u0107u je disciplina usmjerena na stvaranje pozitivnih uzajamnih odnosa i razumijevanja izme\u0111u organizacije i javnosti.

Public relations is a discipline aimed to create positive mutual relations and understanding between an organization and its public. It appeared at the beginning of the century and has gradually developed on all social, economic, technologic and scientific levels. It is a separate working position of importance in deluxe hotels in the world. The job is characterized by exceptionally high criteria and diversity of tasks with specific problems. Dealing for many years with public relations, the author realized the lack of scientific approach to interpretation of the meaning of public relations in hotel.

This paper raises the question of the impact of service guarantees on firm-client interactions : what kind of competitive advantages a firm can expect from ? Our contribution is based upon a case study : the Accor group, i. e. one of the world leaders among hotels and resorts companies. More precisely, well analyze the ibis (one of the Accor group brands, mainly located in Europe and northern Africa) \"15 mn contract\", which aims to build a trusty climate between the company and its clients through a strong engagement : resolve any problem a client could meet during his stay within 15 mn, or invite him. Services marketing will be our theoretical framework. Strategic goals, costs and benefits will be studied.\n      </p>", "This paper develops the idea of the 'building biography' in order to examine the ontology of large city hotels as they undergo redevelopment. The paper draws on archival research on one of Sydney's most famed hotels, The Australia, exploring how it was periodically repositioned by management and shareholders within the changing time-spaces of Sydney's urban economy between its opening in 1891 and its demolition in 1971. We highlight the importance of American hotel management principles, standards and techniques, and internal debates surrounding maintenance and refurbishment. We consider the importance of 'demolition narratives' and their links to the collective memory of guests, Sydney residents and hotel workers, and stress the importance of local property markets in the construction of the hotel as an anachronism.\n      </p>", "The growth of tourism has affected other sectors of the economy both supplying goods to the industry and competing for resources. This can be seen in three basic ways: 1) attraction of labor out of agriculture; 2) inflation of land values and land use changes; 3) creation of incentives for local producers to expand and diversify production. This study focuses on the role of agriculture as both a supplier of goods to tourism and in competition with tourism for the resources of land and labor. It was expected that due to constraints such as unsuitable soils and climate and lack of knowledge or funds, local subsistence farmers would not be strongly affected by tourism demand. Instead, the relatively fixed supply of foodstuffs would be re-distributed, with hotels having the greater buying power. Larger hotels in Puerto Plata were found to have different buying patterns than the smaller hotels of Sos\u00faa. Land value and land use changes were studied in the municipality of Sos\u00faa. There, land once zoned agricultural in sugarcane and cattle production has been zoned for tourism.Cattle farmers in the area are finding difficulty in hiring and keeping labor.

However, current product search engines fail to effectively leverage information created across diverse social media platforms. Moreover, current ranking algorithms in these product search engines tend to induce consumers to focus on one single product characteristic dimension (e.g., price, star rating). This approach largely ignores consumers' multidimensional preferences for products. In this paper, we propose to generate a ranking system that recommends products that provide, on average, the best value for the consumer's money. The key idea is that products that provide a higher surplus should be ranked higher on the screen in response to consumer queries. We use a unique data set of U.S. hotel reservations made over a three-month period through Travelocity, which we supplement with data from various social media sources using techniques from text mining, image classification, social geotagging, human annotations, and geomapping. We propose a random coefficient hybrid structural model, taking into consideration the two sources of consumer heterogeneity the different travel occasions and different hotel characteristics introduce. Based on the estimates from the model, we infer the economic impact of various location and service characteristics of hotels. We then propose a new hotel ranking system based on the average utility gain a consumer receives from staying in a particular hotel. By doing so, we can provide customers with the \"best-value\" hotels early on. Our user studies, using ranking comparisons from several thousand users, validate the superiority of our ranking system relative to existing systems on several travel search engines. On a broader note, this paper illustrates how social media can be mined and incorporated into a demand estimation model in order to generate a new ranking system in product search engines. We thus highlight the tight linkages between user behavior on social media and search engines. Our interdisciplinary approach provides several insights for using machine learning techniques in economics and marketing research.\n      </p>", "Many towns are attempting to develop the conference and exhibition business.

Compared to travelers' lodgings previously available in the colonies, such hotels offered higher standards of comfort, and the possibility for their patrons to relive the metropolitan lifestyle, thus acting as localizers of modernity in the colonial milieu. Conversely, as sites of foreign capital accumulation that exploited indigenous labor, and as spaces of social definition where Westerners asserted their superiority over locals as much as class and national distinctions among themselves, hotels represented a microcosm of the colonial society. Colonial hotels were thus \"comfort zones\" as much as \"contact zones\" where different social, ethnic, and national groups interacted. Their history affords thus critical insights into not only the habits of consumption of a privileged colonial elite, but also the global circulation of consumer commodities and socio-cultural practices, as well as the daily interactions between colonizer and colonized, and between the different strata of the colonial society.\n      </p>", "           ", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Ill persons had been exposed to the hotel's whirlpool spa and swimming pool. Symptoms included headache, fever, chills, myalgia, shortness of breath, and fatigue. A diagnosis of Pontiac fever was made, based on serologic evidence of acute infection with Legionella micdadei. High concentrations of heterotrophic bacteria were recovered from the spa, despite apparently high disinfectant levels. L. micdadei was isolated from the swimming pool filter and water from the spa after heat enrichment but not from pools and spas at nearby hotels. Water from hotel pools and spas was tested to determine endotoxin levels; water from the spa of the implicated hotel contained the highest concentration of endotoxin (14,400 endotoxin units/mL). Additional studies are needed to determine the role of endotoxin from legionellae or other bacteria in the pathogenesis of Pontiac fever.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "Guest registers for six commercial hotels are analyzed to reveal everyday, nonmigratory travel patterns associated with small towns and villages in the upper Susquehanna valleys of New York and Pennsylvania at the turn of the twentieth century.

Census and directory data identify many repeat visitors, such as hucksters and peddlers extending the reach of rural stores and merchants traveling circuits as agents of metropolitan manufacturing centers. In addition to commercial travelers, the presence of traveling entertainments, such as vaudeville acts and circuses, in hotel guest registers reveals shifts in American popular culture and entertainments on small-town Main Streets. These registers offer a fixed window onto a mobile world, and the signatures hint at the types of connections between these settlements and the outside world.\n      </p>", "The strong growth experienced by tourism in Cyprus in the course of the last five years has been accompanied by an incisive change in its structure. Up to the end of the British colonial period, tourism was largely limited to a few Greek mountain villages in the Troodos Mountains used as summer resorts by the British who lived on Cyprus or in the Near East. After independence had been achieved, the Cyprus Government took steps to expand tourism, a goal which has been achieved thanks to the enterprise and enthusiasm of a group of local entrepreneurs. The hotel capacity which, up till then, had been very modest was not only quantitatively increased but also qualitatively altered in favour of luxury hotels and was spatially relocated from the mountains to the coast, especially Famagusta. These changes on the supply side have been matched by changes in the composition of hotel guests, in which central and north Europeans with relatively strong purchasing power are especially important. While the summer resorts of the Troodos Mountains continue to lose importance, the mountains are gaining new functions as local recreation areas for the Cypriot population.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

We investigated outbreaks of ocular and respiratory symptoms associated with chlorinated indoor swimming pools at two hotels. Measurements: We interviewed registered guests and companions who stayed at hotels X and Y within 2 days of outbreak onset. We performed bivariate and stratified analyses, calculated relative risks (RR), and conducted environmental investigations of indoor pool areas. Results: Of 77 guests at hotel X, 47 (61%) completed questionnaires. Among persons exposed to the indoor pool area, 22 (71%) of 31 developed ocular symptoms [RR = 24; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.5-370], and 14 (45%) developed respiratory symptoms (RR = 6.8; 95% CI, 1.0-47) with a median duration of 10 hr (0.25-24 hr). We interviewed 30 (39%) of 77 registered persons and 59 unregistered companions at hotel Y. Among persons exposed to the indoor pool area, 41 (59%) of 69 developed ocular symptoms (RR = 24; 95% CI, 1.5-370), and 28 (41%) developed respiratory symptoms (RR = 17; 95% CI, 1.1-260) with a median duration of 2.5 hr (2 min-14 days). Four persons sought medical care. During the outbreak, the hotel X's ventilation system malfunctioned. Appropriate water and air samples were not available for laboratory analysis. Conclusions and Relevance to Professional Practice: Indoor pool areas were associated with illness in these outbreaks. A large proportion of bathers were affected; symptoms were consistent with chloramine exposure and were sometimes severe. Improved staff training, pool maintenance, and pool area ventilation could prevent future outbreaks.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

It argues that industries, as mediating institutions, crucially shape the extent and meaning of inter-group differences at work, and thus their consequences for the generation of working class solidarity. Utilizing an in-depth case study of union organizing in the San Francisco hotel industry, the article demonstrates that three industry facets are especially consequential: their occupational structures, labor processes, and class-based organizations. The analysis shows how the ideology, practices, and structure of a local union can utilize and overcome sociocultural and economic divisions in the workforce to build a viable, democratic class-based organization.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
