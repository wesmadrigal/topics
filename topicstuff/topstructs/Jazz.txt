The results are as follows: (a) A significant difference was found between jazz and free improvisation achievement; (b) extensive jazz experience, especially study and listening, was found to be significantly correlated with vocal improvisation achievement; (c) 3 factors were found to underlie jazz improvisation: jazz syntax, vocal creativity, and tonal musicianship; and (d) 3 factors were found to underlie free improvisation: musical syntax, vocal creativity, and scat syllable creativity.\n      </p>", "The purpose of this study was to construct and validate a rating scale for collegiate wind jazz improvisation performance. The 14-item Wind Jazz Improvisation Evaluation Scale (WJIES) was constructed and refined through a facet-rational approach to scale development. Five wind jazz students and one professional jazz educator were asked to record two improvisations accompanied by an Aebersold play-along compact disc. Sixty-three adjudicators evaluated the 12 improvisations using the WJIES and the Instrumental Jazz Improvisation Evaluation Measure. Reliability was good, with alpha values ranging from .87 to .95. Construct validity for the WJIES was confirmed through the analysis of a multitrait-multimethod matrix.

On the contrary, the characteristics of each style overlap when different generations of musicians meet and as their music lingers on in the memory and performance of younger musicians. True, jazz is, nowadays, a set of established codes mainly based on morphological and syntactical rules that, laid down since be-bop and hard bop, are relatively old. But jazzmen can still work out an identity as musicians in this context, and even reconsider this music's tradition (through assimilation, stratification, conciliation, reinterpretation) with neither nostalgia nor an overbearing allegiance to past models.\n      </p>", "Applying unfettered but disciplined imagination to last night's Academy of Management 1995 session on the jazz metaphor, I asked: How would I design an organization as if it were a medium for improvisational jazz?

His aloofness notwithstanding, modern tenets such as meditations on reality, debates about culture, and experimentation with music occur in Stevens's poetry. Critics often, and rightly, align the musical qualities of Stevens's verse with classical motifs. This article places the musicality of Stevens's poetry in a jazz context, and contends that poems from throughout his career - especially in Harmonium (1923) and Ideas of Order (1936) - contain jazz elements and can be read as jazz texts. Stevens employs linguistic repetitions, thematic variations, improvisatory flourishes, allusions, and wordplay that indicate the influence and presence of jazz, without ever mentioning the music by name. Ultimately, Stevens can be considered a poet who experimented with jazz, giving his work additional sonic and contextual resonance.\n      </p>", "This paper examines the past in music metaphorized as the \"spirit within you\" in the jazz composition and performance of Cape Town-born, New York-based jazz singer, Sathima Bea Benjamin. This \"spirit within you\" encompasses a particular approach to jazz that invokes both a personal past and collective memory of bygone eras of popular music and jazz performance that are freshly conceived by a woman living in the new African diaspora. The \"spirit\" contained in, and then emerging from, the body suggests that the past in music is relevant for the present, invoking the idea of living history, a usable past that continues into the present through reiteration in contemporary jazz performance. This view is contrasted with the idea of the past conceptualized in the older African diaspora as \"cultural memory\" and the past in jazz as contained on the recorded object, and the conventional ways in which jazz history has been narrated. With these contrasts in mind, I compare jazz performance as a particular kind of lived experience, or \"walking in the city\" (de Certeau), with jazz historiography, considered as a panoptical view of the city/jazz from above. I argue that representations of the past in jazz might benefit from greater dialogue between these two perspectives by introducing the notion of a usable past or living history -- a way of thinking about jazz performance that characterizes a new African diasporic sensibility in jazz performance.\n      </p>", "From the mid-1960s to the early 1970s, free jazz was the subject of considerable public interest in France. The present article examines the conditions that fueled enthusiasm for American avant-garde jazz, focusing on the politicization of discourse surrounding the \u2018new thing.\u2019 Critics hostile to the movement felt that it undermined jazz's claim to universality, a cornerstone of postwar attempts to valorize the genre in the French cultural sphere. Yet the tendency to identify free jazz with various forms of African American political radicalism presented no less of a challenge for the movement's advocates. By constructing an image of free jazz that stressed its irremediable difference from the norms and values of European culture, writers were compelled to find alternative ways of relating it to contemporary French concerns. A reading of Philippe Carles and Jean-Louis Comolli's text Free Jazz Black Power shows how the authors' attempt to reinscribe African American cultural nationalism as an expression of transnational anticolonial struggle not only helped bring free jazz closer to the French experience, but also served as a way of working through the unresolved legacies of colonialism.\n      </p>", "L'ouvrage d'Andr\u00e9 Schaeffner constitue la premi\u00e8re analyse savante du jazz (1926).

C\u0153uroy and Schaeffner referred to sorts of music that jazz criticism would have throw out of its pantheon, but their analyses would form the major grids for interpreting jazz in France: the improvisation-personalized sound- \" swing \" threesome; and the relation between a \" logic of essence \" and a \" logic of progress \" through a kind of dialectical evolutionism (Black, African or Afro-American, vs. White, European; simple vs. complex; popular vs. learned).

This selective snapshot of Wilson\u2019s career inserts him more fully into jazz\u2014and California\u2014history, while analyzing the influence of Latin music and Mexican culture on his creations. Tracing the black-brown connections in his Alta California art demonstrates an often-overlooked aspect of Wilson\u2019s musical legacy: the fact that he wrote, arranged, recorded, and performed Latin-tinged tunes, especially several brassy homages to Mexican bullfighters, as well as Latin jazz originals. Wilson\u2019s singular soul jazz reveals the drive and dedication of a disciplined artist\u2014both student and teacher\u2014who continually honed his craft and expanded his talents as part of his educational and musical philosophy. Wilson\u2019s California story is that of an African American migrant who moves out west, where he meets a Chicana Angelena and starts a family\u2014in the tradition of Cali-mestizaje\u2014then stays for the higher quality of life, for the freedom to raise his children and live as an artist, further developing and fully expressing his style. However, because he never moved to New York, Wilson remains under-researched and underappreciated by academic jazz experts. Using cultural history and cultural studies research methods, this essay makes the case that Gerald Wilson should be more widely recognized and honored for his genius, greatness, and outstanding achievements in the field of modern jazz, from San Francisco to Monterey, Hollywood, and Hermosa Beach.\n      </p>", "Swing refers to a characteristic long-short subdivision of the beat that is generally considered a crucial aspect that contributes to the quality of a jazz or pop performance. The current study measures this pattern (referred to as the 'swing ratio') at different tempi in jazz drumming. The experimental setup differs from earlier studies in a number of ways. First, swing ratios were systematically measured at different beat durations in a musically realistic range. Second, repeated performances were collected to check for consistency. Third, drummers were asked to perform on a full MIDI drum kit. The results show that professional jazz drummers have enormous control over their timing. Nevertheless, the swing ratio is not kept constant, but it is systematically adapted to a global tempo. As such, this study provides further support for the hypothesis that expressive timing generally does not scale with tempo.\n      </p>", "The Dave Brubeck Quartet's 1958 tour on behalf of the U.S. State Department, part of the grand Cold War project of propagating American-style democracy in opposition to communism, did not advance in an orderly and self-evident manner. Rather it was an extremely contingent enterprise enacted through countless individual actions and statements by a motley assortment of bureaucrats and businessmen, and frequently teetered on the brink of chaos. The story of Brubeck's tour, including its evolution and impact, is complex and multifaceted, involving overlapping and conflicting agendas, governmental secrecy, high-minded idealism, and hard-nosed business. The narrative also raises issues of race and race relations in the context of the Cold War struggle against communism and brings into focus the increasing cultural prestige of jazz and other popular genres worldwide during the period when the ideological premises of the Cold War were being formulated.\n         Thirty years later\u2014in 1988, as the Cold War was waning\u2014the Quartet performed in Moscow at the reciprocal state dinner hosted by President Ronald Reagan for General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev during their fourth summit meeting. The sequence of events leading up to this occasion, including the Quartet's long-anticipated tour of the Soviet Union during the previous year, reveals Brubeck to have been not only a talented musician but a canny entrepreneur as well. By the late 1980s the cultural and political landscape had shifted so dramatically as to be virtually unrecognizable to the Cold Warriors of the 1950s.\n         By all accounts, Brubeck's tours in the 1950s and 1980s were among the most successful of their kind. Though Brubeck attributes their efficacy primarily to the power of an influential idea that came into its own toward the beginning of the Cold War\u2014namely, jazz as democracy\u2014the documentary record makes clear that the impact of his travels involved a multifarious nexus of other factors as well, including reputation, personality, and marketability.\n      </p>", "Expressive timing can be viewed as a process whereby a rhythmic template is transformed into a new rhythm that departs from the underlying metric grid. In this paper I examine two types of transformation within the context of 1920s jazz. The Flux (F) transformation distorts the original rhythmic template by molding it into an acceleration, a deceleration, or a combination of these. The Shift (S) transformation changes the global tempo of the template. At the heart of these operations lies the concept of an anchor, an on-the-beat synchronization point between soloist and accompaniment that metrically grounds the transformation. Soloists use F and S\u2014often in conjunction\u2014to shape their rhythms and to control the level of tension/resolution in relation to the underlying beat.\n      </p>", "L'enseignement du jazz vocal appara\u00eet en premier lieu comme un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne d\u00e9concertant: r\u00e9cent, h\u00e9t\u00e9rog\u00e8ne et paradoxal, il semble ne se plier \u00e0 aucune cat\u00e9gorie.

For the sake of convenience, this analysis is organized in two phases: the setting and what is performed in it.

The \"push and pull\" between these instruments purportedly generates a \"productive tension\" thought to drive the groove with energy. This paper presents the results of two experiments on the perception of PDs. Experiment 1 employed synthetic recordings of a conventional swing groove in which the onset asynchronies between bass and drums were varied. Participants used three listening strategies to perceive the asynchrony and its purported effects. Experiment 2 employed recordings of professional jazz musicians and tested for the effects of learning in the perception of PDs. Little evidence emerged from either experiment in support of the PD framework. An alternative proposal drawn from metric entrainment theory explains the effects of PDs as more limited and local than previously thought.\n      </p>", "Vibration de l'air, la musique est sans contenu, signifiant pur.

The stage was thus set for hip-hop groups in the late-1980s and early 90s (such as Gang Starr, A Tribe Called Quest, and Digable Planets) to engage in a relationship with jazz as art and heritage. \"Jazz codes\" in the music, said to signify sophistication, helped create a rap-music subgenre commonly branded \"jazz rap.\" Connections may be identified between the status of jazz, as linked to a high art ideology in the 1980s, and the media reception of jazz rap as an elite rap subgenre (in opposition to \"gangsta\" rap and other subgenres).

The results indicated that attitudes toward participation are influenced by both gender and jazz experience. Women and men were found to differ in their stated reasons for quitting jazz.

Pour le jazz, le blues s'est construit sur la cadence tonale de l'harmonie classique, mais en en isolant l'accord de septi\u00e8me de dominante, porteur d'une des \" notes bleues \" traditionnellement rep\u00e9r\u00e9es. \u00c0 partir de l\u00e0, le jazz a syst\u00e9matis\u00e9 l'utilisation d'accords dissonants et donc de passages chromatiques en ouvrant la cadence tonale et en \" d\u00e9tr\u00f4nant \" progressivement l'accord de septi\u00e8me.

Blues builds on classical harmony's tonal cadence but by isolating the seventh dominant chord, which contains one of the traditionally identified \" blue notes \". Jazz took up from this point by systematizing the use of dissonant chords and thus of chromatic passages, as the tonal cadence was opened and the seventh chord, gradually \" dethroned \". This opening was implied by the use of the three \" blue notes \" in the blues. However, neither chromaticism nor syncopation nor dissonance is specific to jazz, since classical music shares all of these. Though using these elements only occasionally, jazz did lay them down as principles. Jazz forms a specific musical corpus, but taps the resources of music in general.

This article examines the seemingly antithetical relationship between using the telephone and conducting fieldwork, using as an example some of the experiences and conundrums I encountered while conducting fieldwork among women of New York's mainstream jazz community. I argue that to understand the antithetical relationship that exists between fieldwork and the phone we need to examine both the cultural notions that surround telephone use as well as our notions and ideals of anthropological practice. I further argue that as we recognize the telephone as an important medium of contemporary social life and incorporate it into our ethnographic toolkit, we open the door to a kind of fieldwork that can help move us beyond our localizing tendencies and lingering adherence to face-to-face interactions as the \"real\" stuff of social life.\n      </p>", "Dans ses applications au domaine musical, la notion de forme est le plus souvent envisag\u00e9e sous son aspect architectonique.

Wise is an Afro-Modernist epic that is unique in several respects: the epic shifts from the individual hero traditionally seen in the epic form to the collective, and displays a transnational, diasporic worldview opposed to a unitary national consciousness. Baraka uses the genre of the epic that at foundation coalesces national identity to question those very foundations. Wise does not follow the traditional narrative of the epic journey; the African American collective is unable to return to a physical location called \u201chome.\u201d Instead, Wise improvises a home for the African American collective through the act of performance, creating a jazz text combining poetry, music and visual art.\n      </p>", "Ici, je ne parle pas en sp\u00e9cialiste du jazz, je prends appui sur le jazz pour questionner l'anthropologie et l'usage qu'elle fait de la notion de croyance.

Comparisons were also made with data on the statistical distribution of the 12 chromatic tones in actual European art music. It was found that the chorus- level hierarchies (measured over a whole chorus) are remarkably similar to the rating profiles obtained in empirical tests and to the relative frequencies of the tones in European art music. The chord- level hierarchies (measured over single chords) suggest that in the chord progression the improvisers have certain cognitive reference points that are outlined more carefully than the rest of the chords (strong local hierarchy vs. weak local hierarchy).

In this setting, pseudonyms (where a recording is reissued under a fictitious name) were used deceptively as a way to preserve a firm's identity while selling profitable but identity-threatening products to the mass market. Firms founded in the Victorian Era actively sought alignment with the cultural elite and used pseudonyms to deceive observers into believing that their production of cultural products was consistent with their Victorian Era identity. In effect, pseudonyms allowed these firms to decouple their position in identity space from their position in product space by inflating production of identity-preserving products.

Adorno's arguments are discussed in the context of his wider theoretical commitment to a model of structuration-in both musical and social relations-that establishes a dividing line between a moral aesthetic praxis that can be approved as having \"truth-value\" and one that betrays and subverts the truth. In Adorno's analysis, jazz finds itself positioned on the wrong side of that line and, accordingly, is condemned. It is argued that it is Adorno's commitment to a formalist model of art works that has been superseded by modern aesthetic practice in both so-called \"serious\" art as well as in the works of the culture industries that binds him to a regressive model of aesthetic praxis. An alternative theory of the culture industry is outlined that explores its positive functions in enhancing the resources available for culture creation through its transmission of aesthetic codes, and in mediating relations between so-called high and low art.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "When the Civil War ended and slaves became - in theory at least - free black Americans, they were hardly prepared to cope with a society that had for the most part prevented them from acquiring more than the most menial skills. Among those who \"were\" allowed to exercise their individuality, however, were some relatively few slaves who had been encouraged to take up instruments because it was to the advantage of slave owners to have resident ensembles to perform for entertainment and dancing. Blacks participated willingly because it was one of the few professions not dominated by white society, and because it offered them a possible vehicle for upward mobility and professional success. As a result, these black musicians became the fountainhead for what many view as America's most original contribution to music: instrumental jazz.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Age controls on the findings suggest that jazz musicians are becoming less hostile toward audiences and the larger society, that in-group norms promoting cohesiveness are weakening, and that jazz musicians are becoming less inclined to interact only with their own kind. These major attitudinal shifts are attributed to an increased positive valuation of jazz music by the general public. Implications drawn from the study include a criticism of a priori assumptions of homogeneity in the study of occupational or deviant groups and some further comments suggesting the value of a focus on occupational ideologies in the study of occupational change.\n      </p>"], "words": {"essay": {"number": 3, "prob": 2.4843794641193497e-05}, "rating": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06},
