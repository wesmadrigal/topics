{"total_words": 317, "documents": ["In this article, I illustrate how bodybuilding, a popular U.S. cultural practice concerned with aesthetics and self-development, productively engages with social and cultural struggles facing late-modern subjects, including how humans might connect with the world, each other, and ourselves. Ethnographic details are based on discourse analysis of bodybuilding media, interviews with amateur and professional bodybuilders, and participant-observation in bodybuilding contests and gym training throughout the United States. My arguments and shifting narrative presentations draw on work on critique and postcritique in and beyond academic anthropology and suggest how seeing bodybuilding in a potentially positive light requires perceptual-ethical habits not currently fostered in the discipline.\n      </p>", "Le bodybuilding \u00ab extr\u00eame \u00bb est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 ici comme source d'un important travail sur soi-m\u00eame, en d\u00e9crivant les normes gymniques qui lui sont associ\u00e9es. L'interpr\u00e9tation repose sur le recours \u00e0 la notion de sacr\u00e9, et les approches constructivistes et ph\u00e9nom\u00e9nologiques du corps. Pour devenir un \u00ab vrai \u00bb bodybuilder, le pratiquant sacralise en effet son identit\u00e9 en respectant certaines r\u00e8gles de puret\u00e9. Par ailleurs, ce style de vie moralement \u00ab propre \u00bb est source de profonde satisfaction dans la mesure o\u00f9 il fait d\u00e9couvrir au bodybuilder ce qu'on pourrait appeler sa \u00ab sph\u00e8re sociale int\u00e9rieure \u00bb. Rejoignant les th\u00e9ories de Michel Maffesoli, l'auteur montre que le narcissisme, l'individualisme et la solitude sont, dans le bodybuilding, paradoxalement immerg\u00e9s dans leur contraire : le corps collectif. Ils d\u00e9finissent le style, partag\u00e9, d'une sous-culture dont ils forment le centre. The authorin analyses \u00ab extreme \u00bb bodybuilding as a source of important work on oneself and describes its associated gymnastic norms. Her interpretation is based on the notion of sacred and on constructivist and phenomenological approaches to the body. Becoming a \u00ab true \u00bb bodybuilder implies regarding one's identity as sacred by observing certain rules of purity. Moreover, this morally \u00ab clean \u00bb lifestyle brings about a deep satisfaction insofar as it enables the bodybuilder to discover his/her \u00ab inside \u00bb social sphere. Following Michel Maffesoli's views the authorin shows that in bodybuilding narcissism, individualism and loneliness are paradoxically mingled with their opposite : the collective body. They define the shared style of a subculture of which they are the centre. Die Autorin analysiert das \u00ab extreme \u00bb Bodybuilding als die Quelle einer wichtigen Arbeit auf sich selbst und beschreibt dessen gymnastische Normen. Ihre Interpretation gr\u00fcndet sich auf den Begriff des Heiligen und auf konstruktivistische und ph\u00e4nomenologische Ann\u00e4herungen an dem K\u00f6rper. Um ein echter Bodybuilder zu werden, soll man seine Identit\u00e4t als heilig verehren, indem man gewisse Reinheitsregeln befolgt. \u00dcberdies ist diese Lebensart moralisch \u00ab rein \u00bb und sie verschafft dem Bodybuilder eine tiefe Zufriedenheit insoweit, als sie ihm seine \u00ab innere soziale Sphere \u00bb endecken l\u00e4sst. Michel Maffesolis Theorien folgend zeigt die Autorin, dass sich im Bodybuilding Narzissmus, Individualismus und Einsamkeit paradoxerweise mit ihrem Gegenteil, dem kollektiven K\u00f6rper, vermischen. Sie bestimmen eine geteilte Art Subkultur in deren Zentrum sie stehen.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Blood substitutes are under development for transfusion in place of donor blood during emergencies and lengthy surgeries.

These dragonflies approximately double their body mass during adult maturation. This is due primarily to growth of flight muscle in males and growth of ovaries in females. Males attain one of the highest FMRs of any animal; up to 60% of their body mass is flight muscle. During observations of relative mating success among groups of two to five individually marked males, there was a significant decline in mating success with decreasing FMR rank. Relative mating success was measured by the proportion of total daily oviposition time spent by females mated last by each male. Males that had their FMRs reduced experimentally by attachment of small weights had poor territorial and mating success when they were competing with unweighted males. These results suggest that a high FMR enhances ability to compete in aerial contests, which enables greater short-term mating success. Mature males with the highest FMRs had the least gut contents and fat reserves; thus, there is a trade-off made between flight ability and nutritional state that may affect longevity and long-term mating success. A trade-off between benefits derived from enhanced flight performance and costs incurred by reducing the mass of tissues other than flight muscle is probably widespread among flying animals.\n      </p>", "A number of research groups are developing electrical implants that can be attached directly to the retina in an attempt to restore vision to patients suffering from retinal degeneration.

The effect of boron supplementation was investigated in male bodybuilders. Ten male bodybuilders (aged 20 to 26) were given a 2.5-mg boron supplement, while nine male bodybuilders (aged 21 to 27) were given a placebo for 7 weeks. Plasma total and free testosterone, plasma boron, lean body mass, and strength measurements were determined on day 1 and day 49 of the study. A microwave digestion procedure followed by inductively coupled argon plasma spectroscopy was used for boron determination. Twelve subjects had boron values at or above the detection limit with median value of 25 ng/ml (16 ng/ml lower quartile and 33 ng/ml upper quartile). Of the ten subjects receiving boron supplements, six had an increase in their plasma boron. Analysis of variance indicated no significant effect of boron supplementation on any of the other dependent variables. Both groups demonstrated significant increases in total testosterone (p&lt;0.01), lean body mass (p&lt;0.01), and one repetition maximum (RM) squat (p&lt;0.001) and one RM bench press (p&lt;0.01). The findings suggest that 7 weeks of bodybuilding can increase total testosterone, lean body mass, and strength in lesser-trained bodybuilders, but boron supplementation affects these variables not at all.\n      </p>", "This paper presents a gender analysis of the language component of role stereotypes as they are generated by the media. The attitudes of media presenters, journalists and public figures from all walks of community and political life demonstrate a lack of gender awareness, prejudices, limited knowledge of both the history and the current achievements of the female movement, as well as of its intents and objectives, and their disparaging of female emancipation and feminism borders on mockery. The sample of media statements the author has collected within the past four years testifies to the gender-incorrectness encountered in speech; both in the stock of words and in the stock of phrases such patriarchal expressions like 'man the hunter', sexist terms like 'sexual harassment', or negatively loaded words like 'feminist' are quite common. Questions like, \"Is bodybuilding good for women?\", are instrumental in ingraining the traditionally split perception of male/female roles. An obviously conservative attitude to male and female qualities taints personal statements, opinions expressed in interviews, and entire TV/radio programmes. Starting in the late 1960s feminist linguistics began justifiably to criticise the sexist use of language. In continuation of feminist linguistics the post-feminist period has introduced gender linguistics. Speech, and communication through speech are the kinds of social behaviour that may generate role stereotypes, or, conversely, when properly gender sensitive, they may play a decisive role in suppressing these stereotypes, thus contributing to the equal chances of both sexes.\n      </p>", "           ", "           ", "           ", "Because the female bodybuilder in \"Pumping Iron II: The Women\" is constituted by being posed, she is the subject par excellence.

Taking as an instance of the renewed image of Hollywood masculinity the popular star Arnold Schwarzenegger, this paper analyses the roots of his appeal and shows that they are not as evident as they might seem at first sight with his public persona. Arnie \u2014as he is known by his fans\u2014 connotes health, heroism and ideal fatherhood, but these are aspects (especially the last one) that he does not always perform as a triumphant man. As this paper shows, feminism and men's studies are useful to criticise cultural icons that deviate from the political correctness they propose but are limited theoretical tools when it comes to assessing why and how a star like Arnold Schwarzenegger can base his appeal on contradicting rather than respecting established images of masculinity.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

In the context of state schools it is a contradiction in terms; and we should beware the political ambition to extend it into that context. Spiritual awareness is a sensitivity to sheer contingency inappropriate to secular institutionalisation. The adequacy of equating spirituality with a sense of the transcendent, as argued recently by David Carr, is questioned. This equation marries the spiritual to the rationally knowable and to a concept of 'a spirit', elisions which each dictate too tendentious an account of spirituality to justify spiritual education. Spiritual awareness of contingency concerns radically general aspects of human existence. Consideration of the mediation of experience through language supports the claim that spirituality is as much concerned with immanence as transcendence; and that awareness of contingency is the more fundamental issue. The sacrifice and intensity which can attend heightened exercises of awareness of corporeality may also betoken spirituality, even in trivial and vulgar physical practices. The suspicion of vulgarity necessarily attends claims to spirituality in all their forms. Spirituality puts in question the fundamentals which underpin education outside religion; and is thus incompatible with it.\n      </p>", "This paper explores the problem of designing a Web site that meets the needs of both an evolving community and an evolving business. It reports a case study of a business that introduced an e-tail site and an associated on-line community. The site development used an existing community-centered development method. The study found that participants had different motivations for visiting the site\u2014some only wanted product information and purchase, some were seeking social support and information, others sought a more intense experience and greater social involvement. Failure to recognize the separate needs of these clusters resulted in not fully achieving business- and community-building goals. The analysis of the relationship between Web site design, cluster needs, and business goals offers a conceptual framework for co-evolving community and business.\n      </p>", "ith <a
