{"total_words": 1385, "documents": ["This study investigates the real output losses associated with modern banking crises. We find a remarkable diversity of experience. In a number of instances banking crises have not been associated with any significant reduction in the growth of real, per capita GDP. Often, this has been the case in mature and developed economies. On the other hand, estimated output losses are extremely large for some other countries-amounting to several years of lost GDP. Interestingly, such large losses can be associated with banking crises that were designated as non-systemic. Our sample mean and median output loss estimates are also big. For the average sample country, the estimated present discounted value of crisis-related output losses is bounded between 63% and 302% of real, per capita GDP in the last year before the crisis onset. Average loss estimates are this large primarily because we find evidence that post-crisis economic slowdowns often persist long after the crisis is officially over. Such delayed costs have been largely overlooked in previous empirical work and resultantly our loss estimates are much larger than those that have appeared elsewhere.\n      </p>", "Many service firms are pursuing electronic distribution strategies to augment existing physical infrastructure for product and service delivery. But little systematic study has been made for whether and how characteristics or behaviors might differ between customers who use electronic delivery systems and those who use traditional channels. We explore these differences by comparing customers who utilize personal-computer-based home banking (PC banking) to other bank customers. Case studies and detailed customer data from four institutions suggest that PC banking customers are apparently more profitable, principally due to unobservable characteristics extant before the adoption of PC banking. Demographic characteristics and changes in customer behavior following adoption of PC banking account for only a small fraction of overall differences. It also appears that retention is marginally higher for customers of the online channel.\n      </p>", "In every industry, E-commerce is revolutionizing the way business is conducted. New business models are replacing outdated ones and organizations are rethinking business process designs and customer relationship management strategies. Banks are no exception to this transformation. This study examines bankers' views on providing banking services to customers using the web. Specifically, it addresses issues such as the strategic need for Internet banking, its effect on customer-bank relationships, and customers' experiences in Internet banking. Data collected from 75 banks show that most banks do not yet offer full-fledged Internet banking. However, most have plans to do so. Furthermore, bankers see Internet banking as a strategic opportunity that can reduce transaction costs, enhance customer service, increase the customer base and improve cross-selling opportunities. Also, Internet banking is perceived more favorably by banks that offer it compared to those that do not.\n      </p>", "This article develops an index of money market pressure to identify banking crises. We define bank crises as periods in which there is excessive demand for liquidity in the money market. We begin with the theoretical foundation of this new method. With the newly defined crisis episodes, we examine the determinants of banking crises using data complied from 47 countries. We find that slowdown of real GDP, lower real interest rates, extremely high inflation, large fiscal deficits, and over-valued exchange rates tend to precede banking crises. The effects of monetary base growth on the probability of banking crises are negligible.\n      </p>", "It is often argued that branching stabilizes banking systems by facilitating diversification of bank portfolios; however, previous empirical research on the Great Depression offers mixed support for this view. Using data on national banks from the 1920s and 1930s, we show that branch banking raises the level of competition and increases exit from the banking system. This consolidation strengthens the system as a whole without necessarily strengthening the branch banks themselves. Our empirical results suggest that the effects that branching had on competition were quantitatively more important than geographical diversification for bank stability in the 1920s and 1930s.\n      </p>", "We investigate the output effects of banking and currency crises in emerging markets, focusing on whether \"twin crises\" entail especially large losses. Recent literature emphasizes the costs of financial crises, and suggests that twin crises are particularly damaging to the real economy. Using a panel data set for 1975-97, we find that currency (banking) crises are very costly, reducing output by about 5%-8% (8%-10%) over a 2-4 year period. The cumulative loss of both types of crises is therefore very large. We do not find, however, additional feedbacks or interactive effects associated with twin crises further damaging the economy.\n      </p>", "The objective of this paper is to bridge an important gap between academic literature and the lessons of recent financial crises in Latin America. Although standard economic theory holds that banking crises are a singular phenomenon that should be treated in a uniform fashion, the banking crises of Mexico, Argentina, and Uruguay, and the responses of local authorities, convincingly demonstrate that there are in fact two distinct types of banking crisis that require equally distinct resolution measures. Taking into account these historical episodes, this paper presents a conceptual framework that both accommodates the possibility of two types of banking crisis and offers the analytical framework necessary to examine benefits and disadvantages of different resolution strategies when applied to distinct types of crisis.\n      </p>", "Design of a retail banking distribution strategy is an important issue in that industry. This paper shows the effect of new electronic distribution technologies such as PC banking on the choice of a bank's distribution strategy. We present a competitive model of distribution strategy choice, including heterogeneous consumers and banks, that allows a rich variety of customer preference and technology cost parameters. Sensitivity analysis shows how several parameters affect the competitive outcome. This analysis suggests that changing consumer behavior and attitudes, instead of banks' cost structure with new technologies significantly affects the bank's distribution strategy choice. If the segment of consumers that prefers PC banking remains small relative to the segment that prefers branches, then there will still be a market for specialized branch banks. Branch banking without PC banking services will be a viable strategy until the segment that prefers PC banking grows larger (amounting to about 40 percent of all transactions). Banks offering both branch and PC banking services can prevent successful and profitable entry by virtual banks (Internet banks offering only PC banking services) as long as the segment of customers that prefer PC banking remains relatively small (less than two-thirds of all transactions). Beyond this fraction, virtual banks will be profitable. This analysis suggests that it may be a long time (if ever) before virtual banks turn a profit.\n      </p>", "A cross-demand schedule approach is modified to develop a procedure for delineating product and service markets. Firms are classified as either rivals or nonrivals based on a statistical examination of response times to price adjustments. A test of the approach is made for the delineation of banking markets. Preliminary results indicate that the procedure may have potential for assisting policy makers in decisions regarding the competitive environment of the banking industry.\n      </p>", "A significant trend in global finance over the last 15 years has been the rapid growth of Islamic banking and finance (IBF), which has gathered momentum to become a significant feature of the financial landscape in the twenty-first century. This paper explores the increasingly 'Western' character of IBF and has two key aims. First, we address the remarkably under-theorized status of IBF by considering how various economic geographical and social theories might conceptualize its development. Second, and emerging from our reservations with these literatures, we argue that IBF exposes some of the limits of Western-centred readings of economic geographies and we chart a path towards a postcolonial political-economic geography. Postcolonial critiques are useful in two senses. First they provide a different set of lenses for understanding IBF as a self-consciously 'other' set of economic and social practices and second, they push us to reconsider or 'provincialize' our understandings of normative, hegemonic economic practices and knowledges, including 'conventional' banking and finance. In essence, the growth of IBF is a stimulus for economic geographers to consider how, for what purposes and from where they theorize - a task that is long overdue.\n      </p>", "Seed dormancy is assumed to be unimportant for population dynamics of temperate woody species, because seeds occur at low densities and are short lived in forest soils. However, low soil seed densities may result from low seed production, and even modest seed longevity can buffer against fluctuating seed production, potentially limiting density-dependent mortality and ensuring that seeds are available for germination when recruitment success is likely. To investigate whether seed banking affects woody seedling dynamics in the southern Appalachians, we monitored seed rain, seed bank, and seedling densities to (1) determine the prevalence of seed banking among southern Appalachian woody species, (2) quantify annual seed mortality rates for three seed-banking species using a Bayesian statistical approach, and (3) assess whether or not the ability to seed bank affects recruitment rates. We found that the seeds of eight woody taxa (Acer rubrum, Betula spp., Liriodendron tulipifera, Nyssa sylvatica, Robinia pseudoacacia, Rubus spp., Sassafras albidum, and Vitis sp.) remain viable in the soil for more than one year. Seeds of six taxa (Amelanchier spp., Acer pennsylvanicum, Carya spp., Quercus prinus, Quercus rubra, and Tsuga canadensis) were never found in the soil seed bank, despite high seed production and germination. For three species, a substantial proportion of seeds available for germination came from dispersal events two or more years in the past (Acer rubrum 12-37%, Betula spp. 59-73%, Liriodendron tulipifera 40-76%), even though annual seed mortality was high (Acer rubrum 70-98%, Betula spp. 21-81%, Liriodendron tulipifera 12-59%). In years when no seeds fall in local microsites (approximately one in five years), seed banks are the only source of seedling recruitment for these species. Comparing our results to those of previous studies led to valuable insights: first, that seeds of Acer rubrum and Betula spp. suffer high mortality while being incorporated into the seed bank; and second, that seed decay varies greatly over relatively small spatial scales (i.e., within a watershed). Taken together, these results demonstrate that seed banking may play a critical role during woody seedling recruitment in temperate forests.\n      </p>", "We study a monetary, general equilibrium economy in which banks exist because they provide inter-temporal insurance to risk-averse depositors. A \"banking crisis\" is defined as a case in which banks exhaust their reserve assets. This may (but need not) be associated with liquidation of a storage asset. When such liquidation does occur, the result is a real resource loss to the economy and we label this a \"costly banking crisis.\" There is a monetary authority whose only policy choice is the long-run, constant rate of growth of the money supply, and thus the rate of inflation. Under different model specifications, the banking industry is either a monopoly bank or a competitive banking industry. It is shown that the probability of a banking crisis may be higher either under competition or under monopoly. This is shown to depend on the rate of inflation. In particular, if the nominal rate of interest (rate of inflation) is below (above) some threshold, a monopolistic banking system will always result in a higher (lower) crisis probability. Thus, the relative crisis probabilities under the two banking systems cannot be determined independently of the conduct of monetary policy. We further show that the probability of a costly banking crisis is always higher under competition than under monopoly. However, this apparent advantage of the monopoly banking is strictly due to the fact that it provides relatively less valuable inter-temporal insurance.\n      </p>", "The aim of this research is to investigate information systems security in the context of Internet banking. In doing so, it adopts a socio-organizational approach to the subject matter by investigating the interrelationship between trust and risk communication within information technology groups and their possible effect on the level of security goal setting. The research explores and describes different socio-organizational issues and seeks to demonstrate the importance of trust and risk communication in setting efficiently Internet banking goals within the broader context of information systems security management. To this end, it gives also an overview of different goal setting procedures within the IT departments of three financial institutions.\n      </p>", "The purpose of this article is to describe some ethical considerations that have arisen during the design and implementation of the health examination surveys conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Three major areas of concern are discussed: sharing information from the study, banking and using banked tissue samples, and obligations for future testing of subjects. Specific concerns of sharing information include: when to inform, whom to inform, maintaining confidentiality, and how to inform individuals. Specific concerns of determining when sera will be banked and using banked samples include: depletion of samples for quality control, obtaining informed consent for unanticipated uses, access by others, and requests for batches of samples. Finally, specific concerns regarding future testing of subjects include: retesting for verification, retesting for interpretation, testing for different risk factors, and follow-up. Although existing surveys can provide experience or even suggest guidelines, the uniqueness of any new survey will generate unique ethical problems, requiring the careful formulation of unique solutions.\n      </p>", "Arguing that GAAP is ill suited for estimating the future profitability of intangibles, the accounting literature (e.g., Kaplan and Norton 1996, Lev 2001) has recently proposed alternative measurement models. These models view intangibles as composed of a set of fundamental business activities and use multiple financial and nonfinancial metrics causally interlinked to profits to represent this view. Using a unique and proprietary cross-sectional data set of the retail banking industry, we provide some of the first tests on the empirical validity of such measurement models. We characterize the core deposit intangible, an important retail banking intangible representing a bank's relationships with its customers, using financial and nonfinancial metrics on price, service, customer usage, and customer satisfaction. We find that the metrics do not individually predict future earnings, but gain individual significance in a collective setting, increasing the predictive power substantially. We argue that this result occurs because the activities underlying the measures are causally interlinked to profits and explicitly illustrate these linkages with a structural path model. Our measurement model also predicts significant interactive effects in the way our measures are informative about future profits, and we document such effects, not just among the individual measures, but also across the measures and environmental factors such as the bank's strategy. In sum, our measurement model illustrates the key drivers, measures, and interactions in retail banking customer relationships.\n      </p>", "The pioneering study highlights the online banking customers' satisfaction and investigates the demographic factors that are significant predictors in assessing online banking customers' satisfaction in Brunei Darussalam. The study uses a survey approach methodology of four hundred customers of the four major banks in Brunei Darussalam. Data from the individual customers confirms that 31% of them are using Internet banking and 46% of the respondents are satisfied with Internet banking. Factors such as income level, Internet experience, age and educational level are significant determinants of overall satisfaction with online banking. However, gender has no impact in determining the overall satisfaction. The model tested with hierarchical regression analysis has a good fit with 66% of variance being explained by all the independent variables towards the customers' satisfaction. Based upon the results some recommendations were made.\n      </p>", "This study examines the adoption of new products and processes in the Australian retail banking industry over the 1981 to 1995 period. Our analysis demonstrates that the vast majority of observed innovative activity was based on ideas sourced from outside the focal firm, and that innovations diffused very quickly across competing banks. As such, there were no periods during which any bank had proprietary possession of a major product or process innovation. We therefore ask how the banks' innovative activity could affect their relative financial performance positions. We answer this question by developing a set of hypotheses that relate specific features of their histories of innovative activity to their current financial performance. These hypotheses are tested using a detailed data set describing 1,297 modifications made to products and services, distribution technologies, and back-office processes within a sample of Australian retail banks over the sample period. Our results provide support for the general position that establishing an attractive competitive position depends on the specific history of a firm's innovative activity. Banks that undertook more innovative activity, that were more consistent in that activity, and whose composition of activity was somewhat differentiated from the industry norm tended to display superior financial performance. Rather than looking solely for internally generated, inimitable innovations to deliver competitive advantage, these results suggest that active and consistent innovative activity that is somewhat differentiated from competitors can also deliver superior financial performance.\n      </p>", "In a dynamic framework, commercial banks compete for customers by setting acceptance criteria for granting loans, while taking into account regulatory requirements. By easing its acceptance criteria a bank faces a trade-off between attracting more demand for loans, thus making higher per-period profits, and deterioration in the quality of its loan portfolio, thus tolerating a higher risk of failure. Our main results state that more stringent capital adequacy requirements lead banks to set stricter acceptance criteria, and that increased competition in the banking industry leads to riskier bank behaviour. It is shown that risk-adjusted regulation is effective. In an extension of our basic model, we show that it may be beneficial for a bank to hold more equity than prescribed by the regulator, even though issuing equity is more expensive than attracting deposits.\n      </p>", "Responsible risk management is central to banking ethics. With the 1999 publication of the Basel Committee's proposal, Basel II, for a New Capital Accord to replace the 1988 agreement, Basel I, an attempt has been made to address the problem of correlating banks' risk management with their capital requirements. The Basel II framework, finalised in June 2004, is designed to improve risk management by using models based on past performance to help set the amount of capital banks are required to hold by regulators, with the purpose of improving the efficiency of capital allocation. The objectives of this study are to investigate how banks generally, but particularly those located in China, could improve their risk management systems and what the implications of these new regulations are for them. Three relevant propositions were formulated, namely, Basel II will improve risk management; Basel II will improve capital allocation efficiency; and compliance with advanced risk management systems is biased in favour of the large banks. Evidence was assembled with which to evaluate these three propositions by gathering relevant primary data by means of a representative survey of Chinese banking executives involved in risk management. The findings strongly support the first two of the above propositions and partly support the third proposition.\n      </p>", "When a company operates outside of its home country, it may suffer a 'liability of foreignness.' Does this a priori theoretical expectation hold in the global banking industry? Banks increasingly compete outside of their home countries, and operating environments often differ sharply across countries, both in terms of financial markets and credit risk. In this paper, we report the results of an empirical test of the liability of foreignness in the global banking industry, using Fitch-IBCA BankScope data for the period 1989-96. Our findings strongly support the liability of foreignness hypothesis. Further, the data show some evidence that the X-efficiency of a foreign-owned bank is strongly influenced by the competitiveness of its home country and the host country in which it operates. Lastly, we find that in some environments U.S.-owned banks are more X-efficient than other foreign-owned banks in some environments, but less X-efficient in others.\n      </p>", "This paper empirically explores the major considerations associated with Internet-enabled e-banking systems and systematically measures the determinants of customer interactions with e-banking services. The results suggest that perceived usefulness, ease of use, security, convenience and responsiveness to service requests significantly explain the variation in customer interactions. Exploratory factor analysis and reliability test indicate that these constructs are relevant and reliable. Confirmatory factor analysis confirms that they possess significant convergent and discriminatory validities. Both perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use have significant impacts on customer interactions with Internet e-banking services. Perceived security, responsiveness and convenience also represent the primary avenues influencing customer interactions. In particular, stringent security control is critical to Internet e-banking operations. Prompt responses to service requests can encourage customers to use Internet e-banking services. The findings have managerial implications for enhancing extant Internet e-banking operations and developing viable Internet e-banking services.\n      </p>", "We construct an analytically tractable endogenous growth model of money and banking where money provides \"liquidity services\" to facilitate transactions and banks convert non-reserve deposits into productive capital. We examine both the long- and short-run effects of changes in the money growth rate or the reserve requirement ratio. In response to a change in the required reserve ratio, the inflation rate and the growth rates of capital, real balances, and consumption need not adjust monotonically along the transition path. While the balanced growth equilibrium may be either a saddle or a source locally, the global dynamical system exhibits flip bifurcation.\n      </p>", "How does information sharing between lenders affect borrowers repayment behavior? We show-in a laboratory credit market-that information sharing increases repayment rates, as borrowers anticipate that a good credit record improves their access to credit. This incentive effect of information sharing is substantial when repayment is not third-party enforceable and lending is dominated by one-shot transactions. If, however, repeat interaction between borrowers and lenders is feasible, the incentive effect of credit reporting is negligible, as bilateral banking relationships discipline borrowers. Information sharing nevertheless affects market outcome by weakening lenders' ability to extract rents from relationships.\n      </p>", "In the design of a new urban retail network, the size of each office can be determined - once the number and the location of outlets have been fixed - by means of a location-allocation model. In order to carry out this task, two different solutions have been considered: the best solution in the opinion of the firm's managers and the solution obtained by maximizing the outlets' accessibility, based on a spatial interaction model. Our biobjective program bridges the gap between both solutions by enabling the generation of a finite set of non-inferior points, and constitutes, therefore, a valuable decision-support tool. The paper closes with a case study in the banking sector.\n      </p>", "This paper describes the changing pattern of risk in the banking sector, along with the response of both regulators and supervisors to the problems posed by this change. A major issue is the emergence of 'other risks', a category of risk that is not currently adequately catered for under current international banking supervision agreements. New proposals are outlined to deal with such risks, building on the strengths of existing agreements and taking into account a number of barriers to the adoption of this new regulatory framework. We conclude that, whilst these proposals are themselves rooted in change, they will result in a significant shift in terminology and behaviours.\n      </p>", "This paper explores the relation between retail banks' branch-based processes and financial performance. There are 11 processes included in this study, which represent the bulk of the activities performed in a typical retail branch (e.g., opening checking accounts). The first finding of this study is that the financial performance of banks that perform better across these processes tend to be better than that of other banks. In addition to the variation in process performance across banks, there is also substantial variation across processes within banks. That is, banks that performed well in one process often performed quite badly in another. We present an analytical model that shows that improvement in process variation can be more important than improvement in aggregate process performance when dealing with certain customer segments. Empirical evidence from the Wharton Financial Institution Center Retail Banking Study of bank holding companies in the United States provides support.\n      </p>", "This paper explores the implications of studying industry competitive patterns at the level of resource accumulation and the relationship between resource endowments and firm performance outcomes in the U.S. banking industry It uses the strategic group framework to evaluate two models of rivalry and performance and concludes by discussing the implications of the findings for competitive analysis, strategic group theory and the banking industry\n      </p>", "This study examines the impact of the recent surge in Internet banking activities on competition in Texas community bank markets. The results show that the competition from large national banks has substantially increased in recent years. In general, national banks are the major competitors in residential mortgage, commercial credit, electronic banking, trust services, and cash management services. However, in terms of Internet based competition, national banks are not the sole factor in the market. While national banks are the major competitor in residential mortgages, trust services, and cash management services, other community banks are active rivals in the markets for transaction deposits and CDs. This change in competitive structure is challenging the traditional community banking model that was primarily based on relationship banking. Community banks are responding to this challenge by offering Internet based products and services. A wide variety of transactional, informational and strategic offerings may be used to enhance the relationship building competitive status of community banks in the future.\n      </p>", "Financial stability in Europe has received renewed attention with the advent of EMU. This paper examines whether EU country banking systems are particularly vulnerable to systemic risk. Our approach is to explore episodes of banking sector distress for a large sample of countries, highlighting the experience of the EU. We estimate multivariate probit models linking the likelihood of banking problems to a set of macroeconomic variables and institutional characteristics such as aspects of bank supervision and regulation, restrictions on bank portfolios, and development of the banking system. Given these characteristics, the model predicts a low probability of banking sector distress in EMU countries.\n      </p>", "The causes and consequences of financial exclusion have become a policy concern in Britain in recent years. This paper analyses policy discourses around financial exclusion and considers the (social and economic) geographical issues surrounding one particular policy response -- universal banking services. It examines the policy background which led to the introduction of these services, and the institutional role of the Post Office, before discussing their potential social and spatial consequences.\n      </p>", "A symposium on Human Tissue Monitoring and Specimen Banking: Opportunities for Exposure Assessment, Risk Assessment, and Epidemiologic Research was held from 30 March to 1 April 1993 in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. There were 117 registered participants from 18 states and 5 foreign countries. The first 2 days featured 21 invited speakers from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, various other government agencies, and universities in the United States, Canada, Germany, and Norway. The speakers provided a state-of-the-art overview of human exposure assessment techniques (especially applications of biological markers) and their relevance to human tissue specimen banking. Issues relevant to large-scale specimen banking were discussed, including program design, sample design, data collection, tissue collection, and ethical ramifications. The final group of presentations concerned practical experiences of major specimen banking and human tissue monitoring programs in the United States and Europe. The symposium addressed the utility and research opportunities afforded by specimen banking programs for future research needs in the areas of human exposure assessment, risk assessment, and environmental epidemiology. The third day of the symposium consisted of a small workshop convened to discuss and develop recommendations to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regarding applications and utility of large-scale specimen banking, biological monitoring, and biological markers for risk assessment activities.\n      </p>", "Service organizations need to consider in depth the human resource management (HRM) strategies that will enable them to achieve sustained competitive advantage in the e-commerce era. This paper analyzes the HRM strategies developed to accommodate the changing customer service practices associated with B2C e-commerce in the retail banking sector. Based on case study data, it describes how two banks in Australia, one large, the other small, have linked their e-commerce strategies with their overall business strategy, and the extent to which their HRM strategies have helped them to utilize their e-commerce capability to achieve sustained competitive advantage.\n      </p>", "In each of the asset and liability markets in which the banking firm is an intermediary, typically there are instruments with differing maturities. The bank matching book problem is to manage the term structures of assets and liabilities. In our first model, the bank borrows and lends only short run. In our second model, the bank borrows only short run but can lend short run and long run. The criterion in both models is the expected value of the present value of dividends issued. Both models yield dynamic programming problems. Broad aspects of optimal policies are indicated.\n      </p>", "Islamic banking is a financial phenomenon that has taken many specialists by surprise. In this respect, the uniqueness of Islamic banks comes from their ability to grow fast and extend to non-Muslim financial markets. Therefore, it is crucial to examine the elements that have led to this development, taking into account the differences between the experience of Muslim countries and that of non-Muslim countries, particularly the UK. In addition, it is very important to address how both experiences have interacted with each other.\n      </p>", "Reliable information on small-and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) is rare and costly for financial intermediaries. Therefore relationship banking is often considered as the appropriate lending technique. In this paper we offer a theoretical model to analyze relationship banking and the pricing behavior of banks in a Bertrand competition framework with monitoring costs. We show that the lack of reliable information leads to comparable high interest rates even if a long-term relationship between borrower and bank exists. The paper offers a theoretical explanation why SMEs often are faced with borrowing constraints.\n      </p>", "The application of real options analysis to information technology investment evaluation problems recently has been proposed in the IS literature (Chalasani et al. 1997; Dos Santos 1991; Kambil et al. 1993; Kumar 1996; Taudes 1998). The research reported on in this paper illustrates the value of applying real options analysis in the context of a case study involving the deployment of point-of-sale (POS) debit services by the Yankee 24 shared electronic banking network of New England. In the course of so doing, the paper also attempts to operationalize real options analysis concepts by examining claimed strengths of this analysis approach and balancing them against methodological difficulties that this approach is believed to involve. The research employs a version of the Black-Scholes option pricing model that is adjusted for riskaverse investors, showing how it is possible to obtain reliable values for Yankee 24's \"investment timing option,\" even in the absence of a market to price it. To gather evidence for the existence of the timing option, basic scenario assumptions, and the parameters of the adjusted Black-Scholes model, a structured interview format was developed. The results obtained using real options analysis enabled the network's senior management to identify conditions for which entry into the POS debit market would be profitable. These results also indicated that, in the absence of formal evaluation of the timing option, traditional approaches for evaluating information technology investments would have produced the wrong recommendations.\n      </p>", "We offer and test two competing hypotheses for the consolidation trend in banking using U.S. banking industry data over the period 1982-2000. Under the efficiency hypothesis, technological progress improved the performance of large, multimarket firms relative to small, single-market firms, whereas under the hubris hypothesis, consolidation was largely driven by corporate hubris. Our results are consistent with an empirical dominance of the efficiency hypothesis over the hubris hypothesis-on net, technological progress allowed large, multimarket banks to compete more effectively against small, single-market banks in the 1990s than in the 1980s. We also isolate the extent to which technological progress occurred through scale versus geographic effects and how they affected the performance of small, single-market banks through revenues versus costs. The results may shed light as well on some of the research and policy issues related to community banking.\n      </p>", "This paper uses a large sample of individual banking organizations, observed from 1996 to 2005, to investigate the characteristics that made them more likely to be acquired. We use a definition of acquisition that we consider preferable to that used in much of the previous literature, and we employ a competing-risk hazard model that reveals important differences that depend on the type of acquirer. Since interstate acquisitions became more numerous during this period, we also investigate differences in the determinants of acquisition between in-state and out-of-state acquirers. We also employ a subsample of publicly traded banking organizations to investigate the role of managerial ownership in explaining the likelihood of acquisition. The hypothesis that acquisitions serve to transfer resources from less efficient to more efficient uses receives substantial support from our results, as do a number of other relevant hypotheses.\n      </p>", "This paper recognizes the challenges faced by the People's Bank of China in its central banking endeavor. The fundamental problem lies with the entrenchment of party politics within the government, which compromises its operations. We conclude that it needs to make a paradigm shift from its current controlled disposition to one that calls the shots in all central banking decisions, especially now that more is expected of it with China becoming a member of the World Trade Organization. However, the relationship between the government and the party has to be changed before it can enjoy the manifestations of a truly independent central bank.\n      </p>", "Competition policy in the banking sector is complicated by the necessity of maintaining financial stability. Greater competition may be good for (static) efficiency, but bad for financial stability. From the point of view of welfare economics, the relevant question is: what are the efficient levels of competition and financial stability? We use a variety of models to address this question and find that different models provide different answers. The relationship between competition and stability is complex: sometimes competition increases stability. In addition, in a second-best world, concentration may be socially preferable to perfect competition and perfect stability may be socially undesirable.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "Given the rapid increase of immigrant populations and ethnic communities in the U.S., it is surprising that so little attention has been paid to the role of ethnically owned banks in community development. Analyses of banking usually focus on developments such as mergers and consolidations within the mainstream financial sector. The academic literature on financial geography and the ethnic economy has established that the discriminatory and exclusionary practices of mainstream banks and other financial institutions play a significant role in impoverishing urban, low-income ghettos. Research on minority financial services largely focuses on the dynamics of informal financial establishments in ethnic neighborhoods. With the exception of research on African-American banks, there has been remarkably little scholarship on or even acknowledgement of ethnically owned formal financial institutions in minority communities. This article examines the parallel, co-respective growth of Chinese-American residents, businesses, and bank branches in Los Angeles, with special attention to spatial and temporal correlation. In particular, we explore the role of Chinese ethnic banks in altering commercial infrastructures and residential landscapes in Los Angeles County's Chinatown and the San Gabriel Valley ethnoburb area. This article is based on extensive quantitative data and on twenty-seven multilingual interviews conducted in 1999 with officers of Chinese-American banks.\n      </p>", "It is proposed that Islamic banking does not merely imply the interest-free banking system; rather, it is the banking in consonance with the ethos and value system of Islam and governed by the principles and rules laid down by Islamic Shariah. The question arises as to why the Islamic financing system has not been fully realised in Pakistan. And what directions should the Government take for establishing a sustainable Islamic banking system? The study is conducted according to the strategic management approach, exploring a practical route for developing growth-oriented Islamic banking system in Pakistan. Critical questions are raised to analyse the dynamics of Islamic banks in Pakistan. Then using a questionnaire, senior bankers are interviewed to add their insight. The study finally recommends strategic directions for developing a growth-oriented Islamic banking system in the country.\n      </p>", "The paper analyzes the financial crisis of the late 1990s in East Asia by trying to explain the predominant role played by the credit institutions in the intermediation process and in the creation of endogenous financial fragility and instability at a system level. This view is in contrast with \"third-generation\" models of financial crisis, which hold that the principal causes of financial instability are to be found in corruption cum moral hazard aspects of \"crony capitalism.\" The paper follows Minsky's financial instability hypothesis in a contest of imperfect and asymmetric information in order to gain a more thorough understanding both of the persistence phenomenon and the contagion and propagation effects.\n      </p>", "This paper studies the apparent contradiction between two strands of the literature on the effects of financial intermediation on economic activity. On the one hand, the empirical growth literature finds a positive effect of financial depth as measured by, for instance, private domestic credit and liquid liabilities (e.g., Levine, Loayza, and Beck 2000). On the other hand, the banking and currency crisis literature finds that monetary aggregates, such as domestic credit, are among the best predictors of crises and their related economic downturns (e.g., Kaminsky and Reinhart 1999). The paper accounts for these contrasting effects based on the distinction between the short- and long-run impacts of financial intermediation. Working with a panel of cross-country and time-series observations, the paper estimates an encompassing model of short- and long-run effects using the Pooled Mean Group estimator developed by Pesaran, Shin, and Smith (1999). The conclusion from this analysis is that a positive long-run relationship between financial intermediation and output growth co-exists with a mostly negative short-run relationship. The paper further develops an explanation for these contrasting effects by relating them to recent theoretical models by linking the estimated short-run effects to measures of financial fragility (namely, banking crises and financial volatility) and by jointly analyzing the effects of financial depth and fragility in classic panel growth regressions.\n      </p>", "This paper analyzes the effect of inflation on banking crises in a model in which money and banks play essential roles. The model's equilibrium replicates some key features of actual banking crises, namely, the partial suspension of payments and the desire to hold cash even in the absence of pressing liquidity needs. When banks have access to a stable foreign currency, inflation has a threshold effect on banking crises: higher inflation reduces the likelihood of crises when inflation is below the threshold; the reverse happens when inflation exceeds the threshold. This result appears to be broadly consistent with available evidence. /// Ce m\u00e9moire analyse les effets de l'inflation sur les crises bancaires dans un mod\u00e8le o\u00f9 monnaie et banques jouent des r\u00f4les essentiels.

Expenditures on quality improvement efforts and the impact of service quality on financial outcomes have long intrigued researchers. Banks have traditionally focused on how to transform their physical resources to generate financial performance, and they inadvertently ignored the mediating intangible factor of service quality. A theoretical framework on the optimization triad of resource, service quality and performance is proposed here, thereby linking the marketing variables to the financial metrics. A measure for the return on quality is developed as the ratio of the potential improvements in financial performance by enhancement of service quality to the observed performance figures. Empirical results obtained from a study of 27 Indian public sector banks and their customers allow us to measure the impact of service quality on financial performance, optimal level of service quality that can be generated using existing resources and the opportunity cost for sub-optimal service delivery. Banks delivering better service are shown to have better transformation of resource to performance using superior service delivery as the medium. Our results confirm the linkage between resource, service quality and performance for services.\n      </p>", "The Bank of Ireland undertakes financial modelling for strategic planning purposes.

Following deregulation, banks are less willing to bail out poorly performing firms and firms in the more bank-dependent sectors are more likely to undertake restructuring activities. At the industry level, we observe an increase in asset and job reallocation, an improvement in allocative efficiency across firms, and a decline in concentration. Overall, these findings support the view that a more efficient banking sector helps foster a Schumpeterian process of \"creative destruction.\"\n      </p>", "Human tissue banking could provide a tool to address a number of public health concerns. We can potentially use it to monitor trends in human exposures, serve as an early warning system for new environmental exposures, assess low-level exposures around hazardous waste and other point sources of pollutants, evaluate the effectiveness of regulatory programs, and study etiologies of diseases (e.g., childhood cancer and birth defects) that are likely to be related to the environment. This article discusses opportunities to establish human tissue banks in connection with pre-existing public health surveillance programs for cancer and adverse reproductive outcomes. This is a cost-effective way to conduct surveillance and enhances the ability to carry out epidemiologic studies. The article also discusses ethical issues that are particularly important for public health practice. One is the issue of risk communication and the need to explain risks in a way that provides people with the information they need to determine appropriate action on the individual and community levels. Second is the issue of environmental justice. We recommend early involvement of communities that are likely to be involved in tissue-banking projects and full explanation of individual and group social risks from their participation.\n      </p>", "The Nigerian Banking Industry responded favourably at first to the economy-wide institutional and policy reforms enunciated in the Structural Adjustment Programme, recording unprecedented numerical growth and exponential profit performance. By 1989, however, the industry was experiencing one of the worst crisis ever, reflected in an increasing number of distress cases. To be sure, the number of distressed banks which stood at 9 in 1990 rose steadily to 16 in 1992. By 1993, 38 banks were distressed. The number leapt to 55 in 1994 and 60 in 1995. This paper examines the distress phenomenon in the Nigerian Banking Industry, specifically focusing on the role played by the macroeconomy in triggering and perpetuating the crisis. The empirical analysis is in two parts. The first part analyses trends in relevant macroeconomic variables to determine the extent to which anomalous macroeconomic developments provided early warning signals of an impending danger. The second part uses a logistic regression model to isolate the specific macroeconomic variables that played significant roles in occasioning the crisis. The results are quite revealing: persistent deficit financing increases the probability of a banking crisis in Nigeria, strong per capita real GDP growth reduces the chances of a banking crisis occurring, accelerating inflation and negative real interest rates exacerbate Nigerian banking sector fragility and precipitous and unmanaged depreciation of the exchange rate impinges negatively on banking sector soundness. The paper recommends, among others, the institution of policies to stem the astronomical jump in price that often attend the implementation of adjustment policies. This could be in form of provoking robust output growth which calls for a comprehensive appraisal and remedy of constraints posed by infrastructure, inconsistent policies and weak effective demand.\n      </p>", "Financial services were intimately associated with the 1980s British economic boom, and retail banking was one of the fastest growing areas of this sector, with employment growth concentrated in South East England and especially in Greater London. Since 1989, however, retail banking has experienced rapid employment decline and extensive restructuring. This paper outlines the nature, and discusses possible causes, of three aspects of recent employment change in retail banking - job loss, rising flexibility and geographical restructuring. Massive job losses are argued to have resulted from the interaction of deregulation, technological advancement and increased competition with rising corporate pressure to maximize profits. It is shown that while work organization in retail banks is becoming more flexible, individual jobs are more rigidly defined and constrained than previously. Job losses are shown to have been heavily concentrated in South East England, with changing work practices and the decreasing advantages of Greater London motivating the decentralization of headquarter employment to other southern regions, often outside the South East. Evidence presented here supports and reinforces recent claims that there has been a diminishing of the British 'north-south divide' in economic development which was observed by many geographers over the 1980s.\n      </p>", "Using bank-level data, we apply the Panzar and Rosse (1987) methodology to estimate the extent to which changes in input prices are reflected in revenues earned by specific banks in 50 countries' banking systems. We then relate this competitiveness measure to indicators of countries' banking system structures and regulatory regimes. We find systems with greater foreign bank entry and fewer entry and activity restrictions to be more competitive. We find no evidence that our competitiveness measure negatively relates to banking system concentration. Our findings confirm that contestability determines effective competition especially by allowing (foreign) bank entry and reducing activity restrictions on banks.\n      </p>", "The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is developing, with the American Type Culture Collection, a central facility for the acquisition, maintenance, and distribution of hybridoma cell lines. This effort finds its principal justification in the great activity in this field and in the large variety of hybridoma lines that are produced because of the intrinsic immense diversity of antibodies the immune system is capable of generating. Thus there clearly needs to exist a mechanism both to facilitate exchange of these cell lines and to assure the preservation of the ones of greatest interest. The burgeoning involvement of commercial interests in the production and marketing of monoclonal antibodies complicates, but in no way vitiates the institute's efforts.\n      </p>", "Credit shortages are widely thought to explain the output contraction in former Soviet Union (FSU) countries during the 1990s. It is argued here that these shortages were the result of an ahistorical approach to policymaking which ignored the time needed for the establishment and further development of money, banking, and nonbanking financial institutions. Starting from Chick's stages-of-banking-development framework, we examine the experience of FSU economies in transition from central planning. We then develop a five-phase framework to characterize the process of banking development required for them to reach stage two of Chick's framework, where liabilities are accepted as money.\n      </p>", "The risk assessment process is described with a focus on the hazard identification and dose-response components.

Biomarker applications to address high-to-low dose extrapolation and interindividual variability are covered under dose-response assessment.

In general, for Vietnam to achieve its goal of becoming a modern industrialized economy by 2020, it needs to have world-class public institutions to complement a flexible and entrepreneurial private sector.

These functions are: i) the provision of financial resources to meet borrowing needs of individuals and households, enterprises and governments. ii) the provision of facilities to collect and invest savings funds; and iii) the provision of a sound payments mechanism. These functions are translated into payments mechanism delivery functions, intermediation or allocative function and operational function. We also examined the impact of regulation in the performance of these functions. The Gambia, a small open country of West Africa, has an oligopolistic banking market. There are six commercial banks in the system with two of them controlling more than 50 percent of the market. Evidence from our analysis indicates that the Gambia's banking system has not performed the functions as efficiently as it ought to. The causes of inefficiencies in the performance of the various functions include the heavy regulatory framework, the oligopolistic market structure and the small banking market.\n      </p>", "This paper studies the impact of liberalizing the trade of banking services in Tunisia, in the sense that Tunisia would adopt the EU regulations and open its market to competing banks especially form the EU. To this end, a restrictiveness index and a tariff equivalent rate, reflecting the current level of protection of the Tunisian domestic market, are calculated. In a preliminary section, an overview of the Tunisian banking system and its recent evolution and the conditions for achieving the greatest benefits from liberalization are presented. The same section briefly describes the basic EU directives and regulations organizing the EU banking systems. The paper argues that although important reforms have been achieved leading to a more modern Tunisian banking system, important weaknesses persist and basic preconditions are not yet fulfilled, and crucial reforms are yet to be implemented before or along the liberalization process in order to allow the Tunisian economy to reap the expected benefits and to maximize the net gains from liberalization. The calculations show that these gains are positive and significant in terms of direct effect on banking service prices, but modest in terms of welfare and impact on other prices. The methodology for estimating the tariff equivalent is based on the work of McGuire and Schuele (2000). The information needed for the calculation is obtained from a questionnaire on the Tunisian banking system filled for this study. The work by Kalirajan, et al. (2000) is used to convert the restrictiveness index into the tariff equivalent.\n      </p>", "The paper offers a survey of the historical literature on the 19th and 20th century development of universal banking. It is basically a country-by-country survey with strong emphasis on Europe and the era of industrialization up to 1914.

Using a sample of Venezuelan banks during a systemic crisis, we find that the outside directorships of chief executive officers (CEOs) are negatively affected by banks' performances, measured by their default risk. Our results suggest that a CEOs' personal monitoring talents are what is being purchased when CEOs are appointed as outside directors. In addition, the negative effect of firms' performances on their CEOs' reputations is significantly stronger in an emerging market, suggesting that CEO reputation helps to control for managerial agency costs when other governance mechanisms are absent. The size of the bank has a positive effect on CEO reputation, which partially offsets the negative reputation effect of the bank risk.\n      </p>", "Elevator service in multistory buildings has been improved by the concept of banking. A building is split into two or more groups of contiguous floors, and each group of floors is served by a different set of elevators. This paper presents an optimization procedure based on dynamic programming for determining good banking arrangements. The algorithm has solved the combinatorial problem of deciding on the number of banks and cars, floor splits, and car speeds that has up to now faced the elevator industry. The algorithm has been reduced to a FORTRAN computer program that requires very little computer time.\n      </p>", "A general method is provided for evaluating how an expected-utility-maximizing choice is changed in response to factors shifting the mean-variance (EV) efficient set and changes in the decision maker's level of risk aversion. Substitution and income effects under uncertainty are defined, related to those existing under certainty, and analyzed graphically and in a quadratic programming model of a rural bank. The bank application includes risk and liquidity components and indicates that the magnitude of the portfolio response may not be trivial. Evidence is also provided indicating the consistency between bank behavior and the EV decision criterion.\n      </p>", "This paper investigates how the choice between single or multiple banking relationships affects credit availability for a complete panel of small and medium-sized Spanish firms. The results seem to indicate the existence of rationing, since a substitution relation has been found between trade and bank credit. We also analyse the relationship between the level of indebtedness and the interest rate for each group of firms. The results show that those SMEs that work with fewer financial intermediaries obtain fewer funds for the same increase in the interest rate, which indicates that these companies have more financial restraints.\n      </p>", "Increasing globalisation of trade under the WTO has provided India with a new opportunity as well as a necessity to strengthen her efforts at reforming her domestic financial sector. The real issue before India is how to obtain the best deal for herself in the current round of negotiations while seeking to reform her financial sector. In this paper the authors have identified six major issues that will come up for consideration in this round of WTO negotiations and made recommendations for India's response strategy by appropriately drawing lessons from the global experience in the opening up of the banking sector.\n      </p>", "Using the Panzar and Rosse H-statistic as a measure of competition in 45 countries, we find that more competitive banking systems are less prone to experience a systemic crisis and exhibit increased time to crisis. This result holds even when we control for banking system concentration, which is associated with higher probability of a crisis and shorter time to crisis. Our results indicate that competition and concentration capture different characteristics of banking systems, meaning that concentration is an inappropriate proxy for competition. The findings suggest that policies promoting competition among banks, if well executed, have the potential to improve systemic stability.\n      </p>", "The article discusses different approaches to the study of British banking history. There is a brief consideration of the case study approach which has traditionally been prominent; the studies of the Midland Bank, by Homes and Green, and of Barclays Bank, by Ackrill and Hannah, illustrate some of the strengths and weaknesses associated with this form of historical methodology. However, the authors argue that the study of banking history can benefit from the more explicit use of theoretical concepts and empirical methodology developed in Economics, Finance and Management Sciences. Baker and Collins draw on their own work on the provision of corporate finance by the British commercial banks before 1914 to demonstrate the application of concepts from principal-agent theory to help explain bank behaviour within an imperfect market. They discuss data and methods of analysis used to establish the nature and effectiveness of bank lending to industrial clients, and offer an explanation for that behaviour based on concepts of transaction banking. /// L'article discute des diff\u00e9rentes approches de l'histoire bancaire britannique.

We apply our model to a unique data set of all Austrian banks. We find that correlation in banks' asset portfolios dominates contagion as the main source of systemic risk. Contagion is rare but can nonetheless wipe out a major part of the banking system. Low bankruptcy costs and an efficient crisis resolution policy are crucial to limit the systemwide impact of contagious default events. We compute the \"value at risk\" for a lender of last resort and find that the funds necessary to prevent contagion are surprisingly small.\n      </p>", "In this paper, we expand previous models with banks and money and explore the consequences of seasonals in the banking system. We find that, when bank failures occur, not all of them have associated large output losses and currency premiums exist. We show that the most important sources of seasonal fluctuations for the banking system are those related to the return on farming activities and the scrapping value of the initial investment. Finally, this model is consistent with the notion that the Treasury is more likely to accommodate the money market in periods where the liquidity needs are higher.\n      </p>", "In this study we consider the linkage between productivity change and profit change. We develop an analytical framework in which profit change between one period and the next is decomposed into three sources: (i) a productivity change effect (which includes a technical change effect and an operating efficiency effect), (ii) an activity effect (which includes a product mix effect, a resource mix effect, and a scale effect), and (iii) a price effect. We then show how to quantify the contribution of each effect, using only observed prices and quantities of products and resources in the two periods. We illustrate our analytical decomposition of profit change with an empirical application to Spanish banking during the period 1987-1994.\n      </p>", "The increasing competion, despite the rigid regulatory structure of banking in India, coupled with institutional customers' fast changing modes in the acquisition of finance, has been leading to decreasing market shares of those banks who do not respond to the fast changing market place. Despite the growing interest and obvious importance of the area, there has been a lack of published research in the bankig behaviour of institutional customers. This article attempts to study the banking behaviour of institutional customers by different segments in terms of awareness and usage of financial assets and financial institutions and reasons behind these preferences, and the quality of banking services as perceived by the customers. This study is based on a multistage stratified sample survey of 9,000 urban institutional customers, from the portfolio of current account holders and cash credit account holders of 28 public sector banks in 60 towns including 12 metropolis. The empirical findings of this study would enable bankers to identify marketing strategies by which they can retain their existing customers' business as well as generate more revenues from this segment.\n      </p>", "We estimate the effects of deregulation of U.S. banking restrictions on interstate personal income insurance for the period 1970 to 2001. Interstate income insurance occurs when personal income reacts less than one-to-one to state-specific output shocks. We find that insurance improved after banking deregulation, with a larger effect in states where small businesses are more important and on proprietors' income than on other components of personal income. Our explanation centers on the role of banks as a prime source of small business finance and on the close intertwining of the personal and business finances of small business owners.\n      </p>", "Internationalisation of Estonian banking sector has mainly been driven by market-seeking argument, but also competition about the strategic advantage of first entry in Latvian and Lithuanian markets played important role. The most successful example is Hansapank, which has developed from a small Estonian bank into a leading commercial bank in the Baltic States. The success of Hansapank is the result of several mutually reinforcing activities: rapid creation of ownership specific assets - professional skills, specialised know-how and customised service combined with confidence building. Die Internationalisierung des estnischen Bankensektors liegt vor allem in der Suche nach M\u00e4rkten begr\u00fcndet, aber auch der Wettkampf um einen strategischen Vorteil durch den Ersteintritt in den lettischen und litauischen Markt spielte eine wichtige Rolle. Das erfolgreichste Beispiel hierf\u00fcr ist Hansapank, das sich von einer kleinen estnischen Bank in die f\u00fchrende Handelsbank in den baltischen Staaten entwickelt hat.

What we find is an interesting evidence that only stock market development has positive effects on growth and that banking development has an unfavorable, if not negative, effect on growth. We examine whether or not these impacts are a product of various financial and economic conditional variables. Our conditional variables consist of financial liberalization, two sets of country development dummies, crises in banking and currency dummies, the creditor protection index as well as the anti-director and corruption indices. Our results clearly show that the conditional variables of financial liberalization, high-income level, and good shareholder protection mitigate the negative impacts of banking development on growth. In contrast, the conditional variables of middle-income level, regional Latin American, Sub-Saharan African and East Asian dummies, banking and currency crises, good creditor protection, and higher corruption strengthen the negative impacts of banking development on growth. Next, the conditional variables of middle-income level, Latin American, Sub-Saharan African, and East Asian dummies strengthen the positive impacts of stock market development on growth, whereas the conditional variables of financial liberalization mitigate the positive impacts of stock market development on growth. Last, we find that the relationship between growth and bank development is better described as a weak inverse U-shape. This inverse U-shape becomes stronger when additional stock market variables are squared. Thus, financial development and growth may, in fact, be in a nonlinear form.\n      </p>", "The focus of this paper is the construction of subjectivity at work.

While the days of the ungendered worker and of labor as an undifferentiated \"location factor\" are long past in economic geography, economic geographers in their work on occupational segregation have tended to neglect the significance of the social construction of gendered identities in the labor market and the reproduction of gender relations in everyday social interactions in the workplace. The paper draws on case studies from other disciplines, suggesting their geographic significance, and then reports initial results of an ongoing study of the gendering of a range of occupations in the financial services sector in the City of London in order to argue for an expansion of the type of questions geographers address in their work on gender and occupational segregation.\n      </p>", "We develop a framework for combining strategic benchmarking with efficiency bench-marking of the services offered by bank branches. In particular, a cascade of efficiency benchmarking models is developed guided by the service-profit chain. Three models-based on the nonparametric technique of Data Envelopment Analysis-are developed in order to implement the framework in a practical setting: (i) an operational efficiency model, (ii) a service quality efficiency model, and (iii) a profitability efficiency model. The use of the models is illustrated using data from the branches of a commercial bank. Empirical results indicate that we gain superior insights by analyzing simultaneously the design of operations together with the quality of the provided services and profitability, rather than by bench-marking these three dimensions separately. Relationships are also established between operational efficiency and profitability, and between operational efficiency and service quality.\n      </p>", "This paper explores the impact of internationalization on the financial services policy subsystem in Canada. It uses subsystem adjustment as a concept to bring some analytical clarity to how exogenous factors like globalisation and international crises may impact existing policy regimes. Based on examination of globalisation-induced banking deregulation (1987-1991) and the current crisis of securitized banking, the paper argues that the strength of this approach is that it integrates endogenous effects of the existing subsystem in explaining policy changes in response to what are normally treated as exogenous shocks. Careful effort needs to be made to differentiate the processes of external systemic perturbations from subsystem spillovers as these two processes of adjustment and policy change can lead to different policymaking dynamics over the long term.\n      </p>", "American banks have spent the past decade shifting away from relationship banking toward product strategies based on high turnover. They have invested heavily in information technology and embraced an unstable, part-time labor force as a means of reducing costs. In the process, they moved away from many of their traditional sources of competitive advantage and encouraged customers in both the retail and wholesale banking segments to turn to other financial providers and other financial instruments to meet their banking needs. Banking institutions in Germany, in contrast, have been able to maintain a stable share of that country's financial services market by investing in the human resources and organizational capabilities necessary to pursue business strategies based on relationship banking. American depository institutions can realize the benefits of relationship banking if they commit themselves to creating stronger internal labor markets and reducing employee turnover.\n      </p>", "The ongoing financial turmoil has brought into sharp relief the importance of financial services regulation. Yet, we still know relatively little about how financial regulation is negotiated within the EU, in particular which policy actors are most influential and what are the mechanisms that allow them to exercise influence. This paper addresses these questions using Social Network Analysis (SNA), focusing on the banking regulation network and one core piece of legislation: the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD). Of particular interest is the flow of influence among the key actors. Triangulating an in-depth case study with qualitative interview data and social network analysis, this work investigates a number of hypotheses, associating brokerage roles and extroversion with relative influence in the policy making process. We find that influential actors are those that hold key structural positions in this network and by implication appear to have a better understanding of network topography.\n      </p>", "The paper analyses the hypothesis that economic performance of a banking system is a function of its market structure, policy and demand variables with particular reference to the Nigerian banking system. Economic performance here refers to the profit and profitability performance of the banks. Although there are other objectives that bank management may pursue, profitability performance goal stands out head and shoulder above the other if the bank is to be viable in the long-run. The paper therefore identified and discussed the following factors as the determinants of bank profitability performance: i. Market structure variables which comprise total assets, deposit concentration ratio and number of bank offices ii. Policy variables which include time plus savings deposits to total deposit ratio, loans and advances to total deposits ratio iii. Demand variables which is proxied here by per capita income. The study reveals that market structure as measured by the number of bank offices matters for bank profitability performance in Nigeria. This notwithstanding, however, on the balance, the impact of market structure on the profitability performance of the Nigerian banking system is not strong. The policy and demand factors are found to be important determinants of profit ability performance of the Nigerian banking system. These findings have implications for the banks as well as for the regulatory authorities. For the banks, there is the need to minimize their total resource cost by a clever combination of cost-effective source of deposits. This is very important because expense control is the most important factor in achieving high bank profits. The regulatory authorities, on the other hand, should continue with the policy of expansion of bank offices as long as it leads to greater incremental revenue to the banks than incremental expenses. Furthermore, regulatory emphasis should be more on policy factors. The monetary authorities should, to a great extent, release their firm control on interest rates structure.\n      </p>", "This paper investigates the effects of pre-IPO banking relationships on a firm's IPO. Using a new and unique data set, which compares the firm's pre-IPO banking relationships to the underwriters managing the firm's new issue, I test whether banking relationships established before the firm's IPO ameliorate asymmetric information problems behind high IPO underpricing. The results show that firms with a pre-IPO banking relationship with a prospective underwriter face about 17% lower underpricing than firms without such banking relationships. These results are robust to controlling for the firm's endogenous selection of the pre-IPO banking institution.\n      </p>", "A conception of money as a 'neutral veil' masking a 'real' economy was adopted by orthodox economic theory after the Methodenstreit, and is also to be found, in a different form, in Marxian political economy. Both derive from an erroneous functionalist and anachronistic 'commodity' theory of money which, as Post-Keynesian economists argue, cannot explain the distinctive form of capitalist credit-money. Orthodox economic theory and classic Marxism have tacitly informed and flawed historical sociology's understanding of money's role in capitalist development. Mann and Runciman, for example, consider the 'economy' exclusively in terms of the social relations of production and imply that money is epiphenomenal and is to be explained as a response to the needs of the 'real' economy. They do not recognize the structural specificity of capitalist money and banking nor its importance. An alternative account of the autonomous historical conditions of existence of the specifically capitalist form of bank and state credit-money and its role in capitalist development is outlined.\n      </p>", "The paper investigates the operating efficiency differences of a sample of commercial banks across 10 European countries. First, the paper analyzes the technical efficiency of each country sample following the \"basic\" Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model incorporating only banking variables. Then, a \"complete\" DEA model is introduced, incorporating environmental factors together with the banking variables of the basic model. The comparison between the two models shows that country-specific environmental conditions exercise a strong influence over the behavior of each country's banking industry.\n      </p>", "This paper examines technological progress and its effects in the banking industry. Banks are intensive users of both IT and financial technologies, and have a wealth of data available that may be helpful for the general understanding of the effects of technological change. The research suggests improvements in costs and lending capacity due to improvements in \"back-office\" technologies, as well as consumer benefits from improved \"front-office\" technologies. The research also suggests significant overall productivity increases in terms of improved quality and variety of banking services. In addition, the research indicates that technological progress likely helped facilitate consolidation of the industry.\n      </p>", "Previous researchers argue that the legal and regulatory environment helped shape the German financial system in the nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, with particular emphasis on the damaging effects of the stock exchange law of 1896. This article finds that the stock exchange law of 1896 exerted little measurable impact on the growth and concentration of the universal banking system or on the business turnover of universal banks relative to securities markets. The article also shows that the English commercial banking sector and the German universal banking sector underwent similar movements toward concentration between 1884 and 1920 (both accelerating after 1912), despite no corresponding regulatory changes in England-further suggesting that consolidation of universal banking resulted from factors other than the 1896 law.\n      </p>", "Using a large loan sample from 1990 to 2006, we examine why firms form new banking relationships. Small public firms that do not have existing relationships with large banks are more likely to form new banking relationships. On average, firms obtain higher loan amounts when they form new banking relationships, while small firms also experience an increase in sales growth, capital expenditure, leverage, analyst coverage, and public debt issuance subsequently. Our findings suggest that firms form new banking relationships to expand their access to credit and capital market services, and highlight an important cost of exclusive banking relationships.\n      </p>", "The criteria for an efficient system for data-banking are reviewed. The efficiency is seen in the light of the problems of modest computer facilities, reducing the time for data capture, and having the simplest operating procedures that can meet most of the likely demands of the user. A program-package developed to meet these criteria is described. The data are primarily those associated with specimen labels. Several directory files are used for abbreviated codings to give record compression. A simple system of instructions is used to retrieve records with desired characteristics and from them to give results in a variety of forms, including ordered listings with frequencies and geographical distribution maps. Full checking and editing facilities, with corrective error-messages, are available for all critical operations. Experience with the system suggests a favourable cost/benefit relationship for work with special collections.\n      </p>", "This paper analyses the effects of investment in information technologies (IT) in the banking sector using bank-level data from a panel of 68 US banks over the period 1986-2005. Although IT can improve bank's performance by reducing operational cost (supply side), it can bring in competition among banks in order to embrace new technology (demand side). Since most empirical studies have adopted the production function approach, it is difficult to identify which effect has dominated. In a differentiated model with network effects, this paper characterizes the conditions to identify these two effects. The results suggest that (at individual firm levels) the bank profits can decline due to adoption and diffusion of IT investment, reflecting negative network competition effects in this industry. Using panel cointegration tests, we confirm that the estimated profit equation is indeed a long-run equilibrium relation.\n      </p>", "The West German cooperative banking group evolved during the second half of the 19th Century to become one of the country's most important banking groups. It derives its strength from combining the advantages of very small local banks with those of a large group. Its very success, however, tends to curtail the property rights of the owners and to impair the group's inherited control mechanisms. Institutional devices that served to protect sensitive quasirents in the past became obsolete over the years, but were not replaced with more appropriate new ones. Institutional change is thus long overdue, but nevertheless hard to achieve. Das genossenschaftliche Bankensystem hat sich aus seinen Anfangen in der zweiten H\u00e4lfte des 19. Jahrhunderts zu einer der bedeutendsten Bankengruppen der Bundesrepublik entwickelt. Seine St\u00e4rke beruht auf der Kombination von Vorteilen kleiner Ortsbanken mit denen einer gro\u00dfen Bankengruppe. Gerade der Erfolg dieser Gruppe tendiert jedoch dazu, Eigentumsrechte der Mitglieder auszuh\u00f6hlen und \u00fcberkommene Kontrollmechanismen zu schw\u00e4chen. Institutionelle Arrangements, die urspr\u00fcnglich der Absicherung verletzlicher Quasirenten dienten, wurden allm\u00e4hlich obsolet, ohne durch passendere neue ersetzt zu werden. Institutioneller Wandel ist \u00fcberf\u00e4llig, jedoch schwer zu bewirken.\n      </p>", "This paper examines the banking efficiency in a pre- and post-liberalization environment by drawing on the Turkish experience by using DEA. The paper also investigates the scale effect on efficiency. Our findings suggest that liberalization programs were followed by an observable decline in efficiency. Another finding of the study is that the Turkish banking system had a serious scale problem during the study period. The second part of our analysis relied on econometric methods and found that one major reason for such system-wide efficiency decline has been the growing macroeconomic instability of the Turkish economy in general and financial sector in particular.\n      </p>", "Information technology (IT) value remains a serious concern of management today, especially how it should be measured and how it is created. Although we have made significant progress at the firm and aggregate levels of analysis, processlevel analysis is still in its infancy, and there is a need for a systematic basis for identifying IT effects. We provide such an approach by developing two models: a process performance model of how system characteristics enhance process output and quality and an economic performance model linking process performance to the economic performance of the firm. We apply these models to global trade services in international banking. We obtained estimates for key variables in both models and general support for the approach. We interpret our results and discuss the merits of the process-level approach for the assessment of IT-reliant work systems.\n      </p>", "Banking theory is used to develop a static, certainty model for evaluating profitability of farm loan participations for rural banks. Techniques are developed and applied to measure empirically the effects of participations on rural bank earnings attributed to farmer customer relationships and costs associated with demand balances required by correspondent banks. Model results show a decline in optimal levels and profits of loan participations for rural banks as correspondent balance requirements increase and as other parameters adjust to levels reflecting tighter monetary conditions. Participation strategies that may enhance the flow of funds into rural areas are also considered.\n      </p>", "This paper estimates a two equation model of market entry and profits, utilizing data on entry into over 2,000 banking markets over the period 1977-88. The entry equations measure whether entry depends on incumbent firms' profits and other market attributes that reflect the long-term attractiveness of markets for entry. Market profits, assumed to follow a partial-adjustment process, are affected by entry directly and indirectly through market structure. The model also corrects for an unavoidable source of error in market-level profits for the banking industry. The estimates suggest that a competitive process is at work in banking markets that limits the ability of supra-normal profits to persist. Entry is more likely in markets that have high profits, consistent with previous empirical results that market structure adjusts more quickly when profits are supra-normal. Population and population growth are also strong determinants of entry. Entry, in turn, reduces profits in rural markets.\n      </p>", "The implications of diversification by firms for risk has been raised particularly in connection with conglomerate mergers. This issue is of special interest in banking now because of a recently implemented policy - risk-based capital guidelines. This study presents results of an empirical investigation into the relationship between diversification of a bank's financial assets and indicators of the risk of insolvency. Results indicate that financial asset diversification, as well as geographic diversification, are related to lower risk.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img
