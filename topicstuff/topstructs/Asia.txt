Using a comparative analysis of locations in Penang (Malaysia), Batam (Indonesia) and Cavite/Laguna (the Philippines), it is argued that the construction and control of space has been used to enhance control over the working body, and, in particular, to contain labour organization, unionization and collective bargaining. Three broader arguments are made. First, that labour geographies need to be cognizant of the spatialized politics of labour beyond a narrow focus on the trade union movement. Second, that space is a potent tool in labour control and must be explicitly considered alongside the identity-based control strategies and institutional structures that have usually informed studies of labour regimes in newly industrializing contexts. Finally, a comparative perspective on local labour markets, and control regimes in particular, shows that the ways in which space is constructed and controlled differs between contexts, implying that universal judgements on the relevance or importance of particular arenas or spaces for labour politics should be reserved.\n      </p>", "For centuries swidden was an important farming practice found across the girth of Southeast Asia. Today, however, these systems are changing and sometimes disappearing at a pace never before experienced. In order to explain the demise or transitioning of swidden we need to understand the rapid and massive changes that have and are occurring in the political and economic environment in which these farmers operate. Swidden farming has always been characterized by change, but since the onset of modern independent nation states, governments and markets in Southeast Asia have transformed the terms of swiddeners' everyday lives to a degree that is significantly different from that ever experienced before. In this paper we identified six factors that have contributed to the demise or transformation of swidden systems, and support these arguments with examples from China (Xishuangbanna), Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. These trends include classifying swiddeners as ethnic minorities within nation-states, dividing the landscape into forest and permanent agriculture, expansion of forest departments and the rise of conservation, resettlement, privatization and commoditization of land and land-based production, and expansion of market infrastructure and the promotion of industrial agriculture. In addition we note a growing trend toward a transition from rural to urban livelihoods and expanding urban-labor markets.\n      </p>", "The word tumbaga is commonly employed in discussions of New World metallurgy to designate a copper-gold alloy used in the manufacture of predominantly decorative objects on which a gold surface is attained through depletion gilding or electrochemical replacement plating. An identical word with an apparently identical referent is found in Tagalog of the Philippines. Related forms of the word with different referents occur in other Austronesian languages, as in Malay tembaga \"copper, brass,\" and Malagasy t\u00f3mbaka \"silver currency.\" The traditional etymology for this word derives it from Sanskrit t\u00e4mra, through a suffixed form that become Middle Indie (Prakrit) tambaka, tambaga \"copper.\" Yet the alloying of copper with gold appears to have originated in the Moche culture of northern Peru around A. D. 100. Although the antiquity of the semantic shift from \"copper\" to \"copper-gold alloy\" has not yet been dated directly for the Tagalog word, historical records of the Age of Exploration indicate that cognates of Tagalog tumbaga referred to a copper-gold alloy in other parts of the Philippines and elsewhere in Southeast Asia by at least the beginning of the seventeenth century. This paper discusses how an indigenous South American alloy and a Prakrit loanword in Austronesian languages came to be paired both in Southeast Asia and in South America, and cautions against the temptation to assume prehistoric transpacific contact.\n      </p>", "'Geographical imaginations' constitute an important aspect in geographic research, enriching our understanding of places and societies as well as the contested meanings people have towards spaces. The marketing and development of tourist destinations offers a fertile ground for the exercise of geographical imagination. This paper explores how tourism marketing distils the essence of a place, and imagines' an identity that is attractive to tourists and residents alike. Such spatial identities, however, are seldom hegemonic and are often highly contested. Using the case of the 'New Asia-Singapore' (NAS) campaign launched by the Singapore Tourism Board, we explore the geographical imaginations involved in tourism marketing, and its consequent effects on people and place. Specifically we discuss the role and rationale of tourism planners in formulating the NAS campaign; the actions of tourism entrepreneurs in creating NAS commodities; and the reactions from tourists and local residents towards the NAS images. We argue that the nexus of policy intent, entrepreneurial actions and popular opinions yields invaluable insights into the highly contested processes of tourism development and identity formation.\n      </p>", "I present in this paper a framework of description for pottery and textile manufacturing in Roman Asia Minor.

The relationship between these two sources of data (and data sources that cross the boundaries of these categories) has varied over time, depending on the availability of data, changing interpretive strategies and scholarly trends and influences. The wealth of documentary sources relevant to Island Southeast Asia's past, and the increasing availability of detailed archaeological data have increased the potential to understand the past in this region from a variety of points of view. While this potential has not yet been fully realized, in part due to an unsophisticated use of these separate lines of evidence, recent scholarship has pushed the boundaries and revealed new information and insights into this history. /// Cet article passe en revue l'utilisation de sources documentaires et arch\u00e9ologiques dans la connaissance du pass\u00e9 des \u00eeles du Sud-Est asiatique.

In each comparison, land area and latitude range were adjusted to a comparable level between the two continental regions. East Asia is significantly more diverse than North America. In general, differences in taxonomic diversity arise at and below the genus level. At the continental scale, East Asia has 1.3 and 1.5 times as many genera and species, respectively, as North America. The northern part of East Asia has 1.1 times as many species as the northern part of North America. At the genus level, the northern part of East Asia is less diverse than the northern part of North America by a factor of 0.94. This pattern indicates that the diversity bias between the two continental regions results from the flora of southern East Asia. The diversity differences between East Asia and North America are not homogenously distributed across different plant groups. At the species level, East Asia had significantly more species than expected in magnoliids, alismatids, Liliidae, ranunculids, and rosids and had significantly less species in the Commelinidae, Caryophyllidae, and euasterids than North America.\n      </p>", "Swidden cultivators are often found as a distinct category of farmers in the literature, but rarely appear in population censuses or other national and regional classifications. This has led to a worldwide confusion on how many people are dependent on this form of agriculture. The most often cited number of 200-300 million dates back to the early 1970s, but the source is obscure. We assess available, published data from nine countries in Southeast Asia and conclude that on this basis it is not possible to provide a firm estimate of the number of swidden cultivators in the region. A conservative range of 14-34 million people engaged in swidden cultivation in the region is suggested, however.

Despite this data collection of migrant stocks and flows remains very limited in most Asian countries. Accordingly, policy making on migration in the region lacks an evidence base and is influenced by interest groups, anecdotal evidence and prejudice. This paper argues that the heightened security consciousness since 911 together with the development of efficient computer based collection and analysis of migration data systems has created a propitious environment for bringing about a parametric improvement in data collection on international migration in Asia. A number of suggestions are made in this regard, especially the inclusion of relevant international migration questions in the 2010 round of population censuses. /// Au cours de la derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cennie, la migration internationale a atteint en Asie un niveau sans pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent en ce qui concerne son ampleur et sa diversit\u00e9, ainsi que son importance politique, \u00e9conomique, sociale et d\u00e9mographique.

The objective of this report is to provide a series of maps that estimate the areas of exposed land in the Indo-Australian region during periods of the Pleistocene when sea levels were below present day levels. Location The maps presented here cover tropical Southeast Asia and Austral-Asia. The east-west coverage extends 8000 km from Australia to Sri Lanka. The north-south coverage extends 5000 km from Taiwan to Australia. Methods Present-day bathymetric depth contours were used to estimate past shore lines and the locations of the major drowned river systems of the Sunda and Sahul shelves. The timing of sea level changes associated with glaciation over the past 250,000 years was taken from multiple sources that, in some cases, account for tectonic uplift and subsidence during the period in question. Results This report provides a series of maps that estimate the areas of exposed land in the Indo-Australian region during periods of 17,000, 150,000 and 250,000 years before present. The ancient shorelines are based on present day depth contours of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 75, 100 and 120 m. On the maps depicting shorelines at 75, 100 and 120 m below present levels the major Pleistocene river systems of the Sunda and Sahul shelves are depicted. Estimates of the number of major sea level fluctuation events and the duration of time that sea levels were at or below the illustrated level are provided. Main conclusions Previous reconstructions of sea-level change during the Pleistocene have emphasized the maximum lows. The perspective provided here emphasizes that sea levels were at their maximum lows for relatively short periods of time but were at or below intermediate levels (e.g. at or below 40 m below present-day levels) for more than half of each of the time periods considered.\n      </p>", "Food is the most basic of the needs of the urban poor in developing countries, and yet relatively little is known about the supply systems through which such needs are met. This is in great contrast to research undertaken on shelter. The urban food supply system is a complex network of production, distribution and consumption linkages, but three main sources of food for the poor may be identified. First, there is the conventional retail sector which has become increasingly dominated by imported commodities and retailing methods, much of which is the consequence of changing dietary preferences and has led to growing food dependency. Not surprisingly, given the cost of food retailed through the conventional sector, the poor have sought alternative sources. The most obvious is through the operations of the petty-commodity or informal sector, but in addition a surprising amount of urban subsistence food is still produced within the cities of Asia and Africa. It would appear that, in general, many authorities still hold repressive attitudes towards the informal or subsistence sectors, largely because their activities spoil the image of the modernizing, Westernized city that the planners wish to convey to the outside world. Clearly, however, these sectors are performing a useful function, but the ways in which and the extent to which their activities benefit the poor is still largely undocumented. It is the argument of this paper that much more information is required on the complexities of the urban food supply system in order to bring about more effective planning to meet the needs of the poor.\n      </p>", "Southeast Asia is an ideal location in which to study the modernization of sugar production, given that the presence of six colonial powers makes comparisons possible. The Dutch took the lead in modernizing the region's sugar industry by breeding new varieties of sugarcane and by introducing central sugar factories. The article takes these two innovations as indexes of modernization and traces their diffusion through the region. It demonstrates that colonial policy largely determined the speed of acceptance of these innovations. Modernization made the sugar industry dependent on the continuing success of scientific research, restructured the relations between worker and factory, and, by supplanting the previous system of sugar production, Chinese in origin, changed the human geography of the region.\n      </p>", "Previous classification systems of the subalpine coniferous forests, belonging to the class Vaccinio-Piceetea Br.-Bl. 1939, in northeastern Asia were reviewed based on phytosociological data of Korea and Japan.

This is partly due to the fact that swidden is a diverse and dynamic land use system that is difficult to map and partly because of the practice of grouping land covers associated with swidden systems into land use or land cover categories that are not self-evidently linked to swiddening. Additionally, in many parts of Southeast Asia swidden systems have changed or are in the process of changing into other land use systems. This paper assesses the extent of swidden on the basis of regional and national sources for nine countries, and determines the pattern of changes of swidden on the basis of 151 cases culled from 67 articles. Findings include (1) a majority of the cases document swidden being replaced by other forms of agriculture or by other livelihood systems; (2) in cases where swiddening is still practiced, fallow lengths are usually, but not always, shorter; and (3) shortened fallow length does not necessarily indicate a trend away from swidden since it is observed that short fallow swidden is sometimes maintained along with other more intensive farming practices and not completely abandoned. The paper concludes that there is a surprising lack of conclusive data on the extent of swidden in Southeast Asia. In order to remedy this, methods are reviewed that may lead to more precise future assessments.\n      </p>", "Asia is the world's most rapidly developing region.

The tragic and costly earthquake disasters that have recently occurred in Central Asia have spurred important questions among local, regional, and international policymakers, scientists, and social activists regarding the root causes of earthquake vulnerability. Drawing on an analysis of recent earthquake disasters in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, this article explores the concept of \"seismic culture\" (Degg and Homan 2005) in relation to vulnerability. Specifically, it argues that diminishing levels of indigenous hazard knowledge, demographic shifts, gendered livelihood transformations, and the lack of public access to science-based earthquake information have contributed to overall low levels of seismic cultures of prevention in the region. A major finding of the study points to the particular role of women in helping to redress the erosion of seismic culture, thereby bolstering local resilience, earthquake preparedness, and disaster risk reduction.\n      </p>", "The distribution of Phlebotomus papatasi in Southwest Asia is thought to be highly dependent on temperature and relative humidity. A discriminant analysis model based on weather data and reported vector surveys was developed to predict the seasonal and geographic distribution of P. papatasi in this region. To simulate global warming, temperature values for 115 weather stations were increased by 1\u00b0C, 3\u00b0C, and 5\u00b0C, and the outcome variable coded as unknown in the model. Probability of occurrence values were then predicted for each location with a weather station. Stations with positive probability of occurrence values for May, June, July, and August were considered locations where two or more life cycles of P. papatasi could occur and which could support endemic transmission of leishmaniasis and sandfly fever. Among 115 weather stations, 71 (62%) would be considered endemic with current temperature conditions; 14 (12%) additional stations could become endemic with an increase of 1\u00b0C; 17 (15%) more with a 3\u00b0C increase; and 12 (10%) more (all but one station) with a 5\u00b0C increase. In addition to increased geographic distribution, seasonality of disease transmission could be extended throughout 12 months of the year in 7 (6%) locations with at least a 3\u00b0C rise in temperature and in 29 (25%) locations with a 5\u00b0C rise.\n      </p>", "Economic geographies of Asia are highly fascinating, not the least because Asia has increasingly emerged as a significant economic player in all spheres of global competition: production, consumption, and circulation. This dynamic mosaic of economic landscapes in Asia was further complicated during the 1997-1998 economic crisis and thereafter. While some aspects of these economic geographies of Asia have already received research attention, many complex economic geographic processes in Asia have been undertheorized in the literature. This agenda-setting article makes two critical observations. First, the theorization of dynamic economic changes in Asia needs to be more critical of economic geography theories developed elsewhere in the Anglo-American context. The Asian case may significantly challenge existing theories in economic geography. Second, certain geographic processes in Asia require fundamentally new approaches to theorization that may contribute to the development of broader theories in economic geography. The economic dynamism of Asia has provided a useful site for the development of theory and empirical understanding in contemporary economic geography. To support our arguments and observations, we discuss the situatedness and specificity of influential theories of economic geography and offer some constructive suggestions for an intellectual agenda for developing new theories in economic geography.\n      </p>", "The study of the historic past, through material evidence and texts, was an integral component of colonial practice in India, and remains a highly visible governmental and public focus in contemporary South Asia.

In this paper, I examine the shape and nature of Asia Pacific regionalism. I show how countries here favour a process of regime building that is centred on network building among state and private actors without any goal towards institution building. Asia Pacific regionalism is less concerned with the production and governance of regional space than the assertion of a collective Asian political culture that preserves state sovereignty.\n      </p>", "Southeast Asia's earliest states emerged during the first millennium A.D. from the Irawaddy River of Myanmar to the Red River delta of northern Vietnam. Developments during this time laid the groundwork for the florescence of the region's later and better-known civilizations such as Angkor and Pagan. Yet disciplinary and language barriers have thus far precluded an anthropological synthesis of cultural developments during this time. This review uses a landscape focus to synthesize current knowledge of mainland Southeast Asia's earliest states, which emerged in the first millennium A.D. Research from archaeology and history illuminates articulations between physical and social factors in several kinds of Early Southeast Asian landscapes: economic, urban, and political. Social and ideological forces that shaped these first-millennium-A.D. landscapes are discussed as integral aspects of early state formation.\n      </p>", "Empirical results using time-series and cross-sectional data indicate that rice in Asia is becoming an inferior good. Income elasticities declined and in some cases became negative between 1961 and 1985 in most of the fourteen Asian countries studied. Accordingly, domestic demand for rice in these countries is not likely to grow as rapidly as it has in the past. As a consequence, there is a potential for excess supplies of rice to develop in Asia, putting downward pressure on rice prices. While governments in Asian countries may need to adjust their rice policies in the future, world rice suppliers may need to develop new markets for rice.\n      </p>", "The ship is the dominant element in the visual culture of the South Scandinavian Bronze Age, appearing in several different media, including rock carvings, decorated metalwork and above-ground monuments.

Recognition of the interconnections and the discontinuities is important to understand the economic and political dynamics of a region that will play a prominent role in the global order of the twenty-first century.\n      </p>", "This study examines molecular and morphological differentiation in Phryma L., which has only one species with a well-known classic intercontinental disjunct distribution between eastern Asia (EA) and eastern North America (ENA). Phylogenetic analysis of nuclear ribosomal ITS and chloroplast rpsl6 and trnL-F sequences revealed two highly distinct clades corresponding to EA and ENA. The divergence time between the intercontinental populations was estimated to be 3.68 \u00b1 2.25 to 5.23 \u00b1 1.37 million years ago (mya) based on combined chloroplast data using Bayesian and penalized likelihood methods. Phylogeographic and dispersal-vicariance (DIVA) analysis suggest a North American origin of Phryma and its migration into EA via the Bering land bridge. Multivariate analysis based on 23 quantitative morphological characters detected no geographic groups at the intercontinental level. The intercontinental populations of Phryma thus show distinct molecular divergence with little morphological differentiation. The discordance of the molecular and morphological patterns may be explained by morphological stasis due to ecological similarity in both continents. The divergence of Phryma from its close relatives in the Phrymaceae was estimated to be at least 32.32 \u00b1 4.46 to 49.35 \u00b13.18 mya.\n      </p>", "Dramatic economic growth in the Asia Pacific has given rise to a both a scholarly and policy oriented debate about the most appropriate organizational form within which any dialogue over the nature economic policy coordination in the region might take place. The most visible exercise in regional economic dialogue over the last few years has been via the evolution of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC). APEC's increasing international profile does not, however, pass uncontested. Some states, and most vocally Malaysia, exhibit a preference for a more 'Asian' and less 'Pacific' form of regional economic dialogue via the putative East Asian Economic Caucus (EAEC). This paper examines APEC and the EAEC as exemplars of two competing conceptions of regional economic cooperation. The paper demonstrates that enhanced economic dialogue in the Asia Pacific cannot be understood simply in rationalistic, utility maximizing terms. Questions of politics, culture and identity are also shaping up to be extremely important. The outcome of this contest over how an understanding of 'region' in the Asia Pacific will be constituted over the long term is yet to be determined.\n      </p>", "Since 1997, cooperation initiatives involving Asian countries have become more visible and ambitious. These initiatives reflect incentives for regional cooperation in Asia that are the product of prior levels of regional integration and international developments. While many countries in the region stand to gain from more substantive cooperation, they are likely to find certain cooperative goals difficult to achieve. This difficulty cannot be ascribed to the commonly cited obstacles to cooperation in Asia: economic diversity, inter-state political rivalry and the influence exercised by the US. Rather, parts of the new regional agenda are complicated by the kind of government organizations that exist in some countries. Government organizations that lack domestic regulatory capacity are poorly equipped to participate in some regional initiatives.\n      </p>", "Temperate deciduous forests in Monsoon Asia are classified into three forest types which differ in floristic composition, dynamics and disturbance regime. The cool temperate mixed deciduous broadleaf/conifer forest, dominated by Quercus spp. (mainly Q. mongolica or Q. crispula) and conifers, is distributed in northern parts of the temperate zone. The cool temperate deciduous forest, dominated by Fagus crenata, is distributed in Honshu, Japan under a humid climate through the year. The warm temperate deciduous forest dominated by Quercus spp. (mainly Q. acutissima or Q. serrata) occurs in the continental areas, the Korean Peninsula, and the Pacific Ocean side of Japan. The species diversity of cool temperate deciduous forest was lower than the other two types because of the intensive dominance of Fagus crenata. The disturbance regimes also varies among the three types; small scale treefall gaps are prevailing in the cool temperate deciduous forest, while larger scaled disturbances are important in the other two forest types. Fire seems to be important in the warm temperate deciduous forest, and both fire and large scale blowdowm seems important in the cool temperate mixed broadleaf/conifer forest. These differences in forest composition and disturbance regimes associated with climatic conditions and ancient human impacts have a close analogy with the Northeastern Hardwood forests in North America.\n      </p>", "Against China's attempts at cultivating multilateral forums to augment and institutionalize its influence in Central, Northeast, and Southeast Asia, Japan's major foreign policy challenge now is how to secure its own interests in these forums while balancing its relations with China and the United States.\n      </p>", "The economic crisis in Asia has been analyzed by neoliberal and neo-Weberian scholars as a financial crisis, with the neoliberals asserting that its causes are internal to the countries in question, the neo-Weberians asserting the causes to be external. This paper offers an alternative, Marxian explanation of the crisis, focusing on the outbreak of the crisis in Thailand. Using Harvey's ideas about capitalist crises and capital switching, along with conceptions of crisis dynamics in peripheral societies based in the works of economic geographers and dependent development theorists, I argue that the crisis in Thailand was a fully economic crisis involving all circuits of the economy, linking domestic and international accumulation processes, and stemming in part from struggles over appropriation of the surplus. In order to demonstrate this, I analyze the crisis in Thailand at both national and international scales and show that it was rooted in declining profitability of manufacturing in a context of increased global export competition and overcapacity. This context created the strong likelihood of economic downturn throughout the region, with Thailand falling first because of its specific liabilities, and other countries being pulled into the maelstrom of devaluation through financial contagion effects.\n      </p>", "Numerous lessons have been learned so far in controlling H5N1 avian influenza in Asia. Early detection of incursions of virus prevented establishment of the disease in several countries, notably Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia. In countries where detection of early cases was delayed, infection is endemic and has been for three or more years. Control measures implemented in these countries need to reflect this finding. Vaccination will continue to be one of the key measures used in these endemically infected countries. Used alone, vaccination will not result in elimination of H5N1 viruses from a country, but, if used correctly, it will markedly reduce the prevalence of and susceptibility to infection. Vaccination has already played a valuable role in reducing the adverse effects of H5N1 viruses. Mass culling also reduces the level of infection in infected areas. However, the long-term benefits are limited in endemically infected countries owing to the high probability of reinfection on restocking unless other measures are used in parallel. Full epidemiological studies have not been conducted in many infected countries. Nevertheless, it is recognized that the number of clinical cases does not truly reflect the levels of infection. Domestic ducks and large live poultry markets have played a key role in the persistence of infection, because they can be infected silently. In tackling this disease, countries should adopt integrated control programs using the combination of measures best suited to the local environment. All surveillance data should be shared, both positive and negative, and should include information on cases of infection and disease. Socioeconomic and ecological implications of all control measures should be assessed before implementation, especially the impact on the rural poor. /// Se han aprendido numerosas lecciones en el control del brote de influenza aviar H5N1 en Asia.

It is therefore important to examine the diversity of environments and resources that the earliest inhabitants encountered, and to identify adaptations and technologies that may have shaped subsequent exploitations of Asian environments.

The calculation of critical loads to assess the sensitivity of ecosystems to acidic deposition was made using a biogeochemical approach, which took into consideration both rates of biogeochemical cycling and temperature responses. On the basis of these data the soil-biogeochemical mapping has been carried out for the area of East Asia and the CL values for acid-forming compounds have been calculated using modified steady-state mass balance (SSMB) equations. In the north-eastern ecosystems of the Asian part of Russia these values of critical loads for N [CL(N)] and S [CL(S)] compounds are shown to be less than in Europe due to peculiarities of climate, soil and vegetation. The minimum values of both CL(N) and CL(S) are &lt;50 eq/ha/yr (which occur in 8.3% and 40.5% of this area for N and S, correspondingly) and the maximum values are &gt;300 eq/ha/yr. These values are occasionally lower than for corresponding European ecosystems. For the south-eastern ecosystems of the northern part of Thailand the minimum values are &lt;200 eq/ha/yr and maximum values are &gt;700 eq/ha/yr.

Recognizing the opportunity to earn valuable foreign currency, developing countries have catered to these desires by encouraging tourism development. The interplay between \"hosts\" and \"guests\" and the impact of tourism on host communities have been recurring themes in the anthropological literature on tourism, but scholars recognize that these categories have several limitations. The terms gloss over the wide variation that exists in the tourist experience for both guests and hosts, and ignore the important actors known as mediators. This article examines the role of mediators in two post-Soviet Central Asia states: Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. Mediators there are particularly important because neither country is well known in Western countries, and neither country inherited a well-developed tourist infrastructure from the Soviet state. These mediators are cultivating a positive image of Central Asia as a new tourist destination, developing tourist accommodations, and lobbying government institutions to support and regulate tourism.

Initial developments have their roots in the Pleistocene. The developmental history of arboreal-based economies (often called arboriculture) in Southeast Asia and the Pacific is not well understood. A framework of subsistence system diversification in relation to unexploited ecological opportunities is useful for subsistence system model building. The emergence of arboreal-based economies in Island Southeast Asia and Near Oceania has significant implications concerning Pacific prehistory, as Austronesian descendants probably incorporated arboriculture and arboreal resources into their economies and subsequently translocated these to the more distant Pacific islands.

The traditional village 'community' is often paraded as a paragon of virtue, and the modern village as a corrupted version of the original. Yet the notion of the traditional village as egalitarian, self-sufficient, autonomous, subsistence-oriented, corporate, peaceful and moral is often at odds with the historic evidence. As such, it presents difficulties when the image is used to construct visions of what 'development' is doing, and should be doing, in rural areas of the developing world.

This is mainly based on evidence from America, where maize was the staple crop. On the basis of evidence from prehistoric skeletal samples from a series of prehistoric sites in Southeast Asia, this correlation does not appear to apply in areas of the world where the staple crop is rice. Although we have looked only at dental caries, we suggest that caution be applied in the drawing of inferences about subsistence changes from dental health.

The genus occupies a unique position in plant evolution as the closest relatives of the famous tree lycopods. Hybridization and allopolyploid speciation as well as habitat preference are regarded as having played an important role in the evolution of the genus Isoetes. However, it is still uncertain what factors have impacted upon hybridization and allopolyploid speciation of the genus Isoetes. Our understanding of the origin, evolution and modern distribution pattern of Isoetes in East Asia would benefit from investigations into the relationship between the unique geographical location and topographic features and the existing fossil record in the region. Methods The chromosome number was determined from known 81 populations of 10 species of Isoetes in East Asia. The altitude was obtained in location of every population. T-test was used to evaluate the altitude difference between diploid and polyploid populations. Data of Japanese Isoetes from Takamiya et al. was used in the study. Results There are 10 known species of Isoetes with four diploids and six polyploids in East Asia. The four diploid species (2n = 22) are found at high altitudes (mean altitude = 2649.67 \u00b1 1396.16 m, n = 18) and isolated from each other. In contrast, the six polyploid species widely occur in low altitude regions (mean altitude = 182.62 \u00b1 181.44 m, n = 63) and are partially sympatric. Highly significant differences (P &lt; 0.001) were observed between the mean altitude of locations of populations of diploids and polyploids. Main conclusions The polyploidy speciations of Isoetes in East Asia might originate and develop from Holocene (Quaternary). The present pattern of distribution of Isoetes in East Asia is the result of allopatric speciation derived from vicariance, dispersal and combinations of both, and significantly correlative with the geological history and geographical changes. The change of altitude might have played an important role in allopolyploid speciation and the pattern of distribution of the genus Isoetes in East Asia by exerting a considerable influence on dispersal and hybridization opportunities of Isoetes species.\n      </p>", "Background: Cardiovascular risk equations are traditionally derived from the Framingham Study. The accuracy of this approach in Asian populations, where resources for risk factor measurement may be limited, is unclear. Objective: To compare \"low-information\" equations (derived using only age, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol and smoking status) derived from the Framingham Study with those derived from the Asian cohorts, on the accuracy of cardiovascular risk prediction. Design: Separate equations to predict the 8-year risk of a cardiovascular event were derived from Asian and Framingham cohorts. The performance of these equations, and a subsequently \"recalibrated\" Framingham equation, were evaluated among participants from independent Chinese cohorts. Setting: Six cohort studies from Japan, Korea and Singapore (Asian cohorts); six cohort studies from China; the Framingham Study from the US. Participants: 172 077 participants from the Asian cohorts; 25 682 participants from Chinese cohorts and 6053 participants from the Framingham Study. Main results: In the Chinese cohorts, 542 cardiovascular events occurred during 8 years of follow-up. Both the Asian cohorts and the Framingham equations discriminated cardiovascular risk well in the Chinese cohorts; the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve was at least 0.75 for men and women. However, the Framingham risk equation systematically overestimated risk in the Chinese cohorts by an average of 276% among men and 102% among women. The corresponding average overestimation using the Asian cohorts equation was 11% and 10%, respectively. Recalibrating the Framingham risk equation using cardiovascular disease incidence from the non-Chinese Asian cohorts led to an overestimation of risk by an average of 4% in women and underestimation of risk by an average of 2% in men. Interpretation: A low-information Framingham cardiovascular risk prediction tool, which, when recalibrated with contemporary data, is likely to estimate future cardiovascular risk with similar accuracy in Asian populations as tools developed from data on local cohorts.\n      </p>", "The main purpose of this paper is to determine empirically whether currency depreciation is expansionary or contractionary in Asian countries.

No properly dated Pleistocene pebble complexes are however known in the area. In the Early Holocene new cultural traditions are referred to as Mesolithic or Holocene (relict) Palaeolithic. The major criterion for separating these epochs is the disappearance of wedge-shaped cores and the appearance of conical and prismatic ones.

The diversity of endemic genera of vascular plants in different phylogenetic groups was compared between East Asia and North America. North America has a significantly higher diversity of endemic genera of vascular plants than East Asia (987 vs. 754 genera). However, East Asia holds greater diversity of endemic genera than North America in pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and ranunculids, which are in general evolutionarily old taxa. The two areas do not significantly differ in the numbers of endemic genera in magnoliids and monocots. The overall diversity bias of endemic genera in favor of North America primarily results from caryophyllids, rosids, and asterids, which are relatively advanced lineages. As a result, numbers of endemic genera within phylogenetic groups do not vary in parallel between East Asia and North America. Compared with the world total flora with respect to proportions of numbers of taxa among phylogenetic groups, East Asia and North America both have excesses of endemic genera in asterids and have deficits in magnoliids, monocots, and rosids. The most noticeable differences in diversity of endemic genera between the two continents were found in pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and ranunculids, for which East Asia shows a striking excess compared with the world flora; North America shows a conspicuous deficit in the first two groups with respect to the world flora. Caryophyllids exhibit a reversed pattern with disproportionately more genera in North America and fewer genera in East Asia compared with the world flora. Differences in diversity of endemic genera between the two continents have resulted from different rates of speciation, immigration, and extinction, which have been primarily influenced by land connection, continental drift, geological history, geomorphologic configuration, and climate in the past.\n      </p>", "Aim Our aim was to produce a uniform 'regional' land-cover map of South and Southeast Asia based on 'sub-regional' mapping results generated in the context of the Global Land Cover 2000 project. Location The 'region' of tropical and sub-tropical South and Southeast Asia stretches from the Himalayas and the southern border of China in the north, to Sri Lanka and Indonesia in the south, and from Pakistan in the west to the islands of New Guinea in the far east. Methods The regional land-cover map is based on sub-regional digital mapping results derived from SPOT-VEGETATION satellite data for the years 1998-2000. Image processing, digital classification and thematic mapping were performed separately for the three sub-regions of South Asia, continental Southeast Asia, and insular Southeast Asia. Landsat TM images, field data and existing national maps served as references. We used the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) for coding the sub-regional land-cover classes and for aggregating the latter to a uniform regional legend. A validation was performed based on a systematic grid of sample points, referring to visual interpretation from high-resolution Landsat imagery. Regional land-cover area estimates were obtained and compared with FAO statistics for the categories 'forest' and 'cropland'. Results The regional map displays 26 land-cover classes. The LCCS coding provided a standardized class description, independent from local class names; it also allowed us to maintain the link to the detailed sub-regional land-cover classes. The validation of the map displayed a mapping accuracy of 72% for the dominant classes of 'forest' and 'cropland'; regional area estimates for these classes correspond reasonably well to existing regional statistics. Main conclusions The land-cover map of South and Southeast Asia provides a synoptic view of the distribution of land cover of tropical and sub-tropical Asia, and it delivers reasonable thematic detail and quantitative estimates of the main land-cover proportions. The map may therefore serve for regional stratification or modelling of vegetation cover, but could also support the implementation of forest policies, watershed management or conservation strategies at regional scales.\n      </p>", "Levnesovia transoxiana gen. et sp. nov., from the Late Cretaceous (Middle-Late Turonian) of Uzbekistan, is the oldest well-documented taxon referable to Hadrosauroidea sensu Godefroit et al. It differs from a somewhat younger and closely related Bactrosaurus from Inner Mongolia (China) by a tall sagittal crest on the parietals and the absence of club-shaped dorsal neural spines in adult specimens. Levnesovia, Bactrosaurus and possibly Gilmoreosaurus represent the earliest radiation of Hadrosauroidea, which took place during the Cenomanian-Turonian and possibly in North America. The second, Santonian-age radiation of Hadrosauroidea included Aralosaurus, Hadrosauridae and lineages leading to Tanius (Campanian) and Telmatosaurus (Maastrichtian). Hadrosauridae appears to be monophyletic, but Hadrosaurinae and Lambeosaurinae originated in North America and Asia, respectively.\n      </p>", "In 2003, a highly pathogenic version of an avian influenza virus\u2014H5N1\u2014began to emerge in a number of countries in Southeast Asia.

This article explores how the virus spread and the policy implications for regional states.\n      </p>", "Aim Unrooted area networks are perhaps a general way in which different historical biogeographical patterns may be combined. Location Southeast Asia up to the West Pacific, Australia, South America. Methods Unrooted area networks based on Primary Brooks Parsimony Analysis of different data sets of Southeast Asian-West Pacific, Australian and South American clades. Results A large Brooks Parsimony historical (cladistic) biogeographic analysis of Southeast Asia and the West Pacific gave a meaningful result when all clades (representing different historical biogeographic patterns) were united into one matrix and an unrooted area network was produced. This network showed geographically adjacent areas as neighbours, which is interpreted as clades dispersing and speciating as soon as areas rafted towards each other. This pseudo-vicariance mechanism, together with the very limited, mainly linear dispersal possibilities, a few large, widespread clades with many endemic species, and the large overlap in distributions displayed by different patterns, may explain the peculiar result. When applied to examples from other areas (bird data from Australia and South America), unrooted area networks for all data perform very poorly. Main conclusions Unrooted historical general area networks are not universally applicable. In general, it is better to split historical patterns a priori and analyse them separately.\n      </p>", "Mites use the leaf domatia of many woody plant species in Australasia and North America. Different types of leaf domatia, including pits, pockets and tuft domatia, are present among plant species in disturbed forests, plantations and gardens of Bangladesh in South Asia. These structures are frequently occupied by mites. Pooling across all species, domatia were often (66%) occupied by mites and used by them for shelter, egg-laying and development. On average, 70% of all mites on leaves were found in domatia, and over three-quarters of these were potentially beneficial (i.e. of predaceous or microbivorous taxa) to the plant. Further, when species were pooled across sites, leaves of domatia-bearing plants had significantly more predaceous mites than those of plants without domatia. These results are consistent with the patterns of mite-domatia association reported in Australasia, North America and North Asia and with predictions of mutualism between plants and mites.\n      </p>", "There is a growing interest in understanding the influence of plant traits on their ability to spread in non-native regions. Many studies addressing this issue have been based on relatively small areas or restricted taxonomic groups. Here, we analyse a large data base involving 1567 plant species introduced between Eastern Asia and North America or from elsewhere to both regions. We related the extent of species distributions in each region to growth form and the distinction between upland and wetland habitats. We identified significant relationships between geographical distribution and plant traits in both native and exotic ranges as well as regional differences in the relationships. Range size was larger for herbaceous graminoids and forbs, especially annuals compared to perennials, than for woody species, and range size also was larger for plants of wetland compared to upland habitats. Distributions were more extensive in North America than in Eastern Asia, although native plants from both regions had broader distributions than non-natives, with exotics from elsewhere intermediate. Growth form and environment explained more of the variance in distribution of plants in North America than in Eastern Asia. The influence of growth form and habitat on distribution suggests that these traits might be related to tolerance of ecological conditions. In addition, the smaller extents of species in non-native compared to native areas suggest roles for dispersal limitation and adaptation to region-specific ecological conditions in determining distribution.\n      </p>", "The genus Doronicum (Asteraceae: Senecioneae) comprises perennial herbs distributed in Europe, North Africa, and Asia.

The enforced secularization of the Inner Asian states led to the abandonment of the Arabic script which is fundamentally linked to Islam. The introduction of Latin and Cyrillic scripts led to phonological changes that are mirrored in the musical changes to intonation and intervals which accompanied the introduction of Western musical theory. The development of the concept of nation accentuated the separation, along linguistic lines, of repertories which were originally shared. On the principle that each nation required musical forms not less imposing than those of the West, the cultural authorities imposed the formation of large-scale ensembles whose impact on the aesthetics of performance is analysed here in detail. Such large-scale ensembles or orchestras are typically the product of authoritarian decisions, and do not appear spontaneously from purely aesthetic motives. In the contemporary Central Asian states, in spite of the weakening of the cultural authorities, the prestige of these large ensembles is preserved and, although they offer scant financial rewards, they continue to attract musicians.\n      </p>", "The study explores the traits and influences on global business ethics practiced by Taiwanese enterprises in East Asia in order to provide those enterprises with a ready guide to contemporaneous standards of ethical management overseas and, in particular, in East Asia. The study randomly sampled 1496 Taiwanese enterprises in Mainland China, Vietnam and Indonesia. One questionnaire per enterprise was answered by Taiwanese owners or senior administrators. Some 375 valid responses, or 25% of the sample, were returned. Taiwanese enterprises in East Asia were found to be ethically inclined in respect of their local environments and generic human rights, though one-third of participants identified themselves as \"ethically lax\". The study identified various influences on global business ethics viz. personnel localization, employment partnership, marketing ethics and the competitiveness of Taiwanese enterprises.\n      </p>", "The advertising of controversial products/services and the use of controversial images to \"cut through the clutter\" in the marketplace appears to be increasing around the world. However, apart from the general ethical issue regarding the deliberate use of controversial/offensive images for public viewing that may offend some people, it is important to determine what makes a controversial advertisement offensive? A questionnaire was distributed to 1014 students across four different countries in the Asia Pacific region to determine what type of products are seen as offensive and the reasons they are offensive. The results present some important implications for international marketers.\n      </p>", "Iron Age agate and carnelian beads found in Southeast Asia have long been assumed to be Indian imports, often featuring in diffusion-orientated theories of Southeast Asian state development that cite Indian influence as a major causal factor. The origin of these beads is tested here, through a pioneering non-destructive geochemical sourcing study of carnelian beads and potential source material. Our results suggest that many of these beads do not derive from India. Instead, a complex multi-source origin, involving some local Southeast Asian manufacture, appears likely. This finding further erodes the already crumbling foundation of diffusion-based theories of Southeast Asian state development. An alternative, regionally focused, approach to the study of these beads is recommended using geochemical analysis to help trace their trade within Southeast Asia. This will enable a better understanding of their role in, and impact upon, existing prestige goods exchange networks within the region.\n      </p>", "An analysis of the elevational distributions of Southeast Asian birds over a 28-year period provides evidence for a potential upward shift for 94 common resident species. These species might have shifted their lower, upper, or both lower and upper boundaries toward a higher elevation in response to climate warming. These upward shifts occurred regardless of habitat specificity, further implicating climate warming, in addition to habitat loss, as a potentially important factor affecting the already imperiled biotas of Southeast Asia. /// Un an\u00e1lisis de la distribuci\u00f3n altitudinal de las aves del sudeste asi\u00e1tico a lo largo de un per\u00edodo de 28 a\u00f1os evidencia un desplazamiento potencial hacia arriba de 94 especies residentes comunes.

In this article, floristic relationships based on genera shared among EAS, ENA, and WNA were examined at different spatial scales for different phylogenetic groups using complete floras. Floristic similarity between EAS and ENA is higher than that between EAS and WNA, and the floras of ENA and WNA are more closely related to each other than are the floras of EAS and ENA. Compared with ENA and WNA, the number of genera common to EAS and ENA is significantly higher in basal angiosperms and significantly lower in asterids. Floristic similarities tend to decrease from more basal to more modern lineages between EAS and ENA and between EAS and WNA but not between ENA and WNA. Similarly, from more basal to more modern divisions, the fraction of shared genera decreases between EAS and ENA and between EAS and WNA, whereas the floristic similarity between ENA and WNA tends to increase. Furthermore, floristic similarity between EAS and ENA increases with latitude. The causes of the observed patterns of floristic similarity between EAS, ENA, and WNA are discussed.\n      </p>", "Freshwater finfish species richness and level of endemism in East, and South and South-East Asia that included 17 nations were studied using available databases, and included nation-wise distribution, habitat types, and conservation status. The number of endemic finfish species in the region was 559, belonging to 47 families. Families Cyprinidae and Balitoridae accounted for 43.5% and 16.2% of the total number of endemic species in the region, respectively, followed by Sisoridae (25), Gobiidae (20), Melanotaeniidae (19), and Bagridae (16), and the other 41 families had at least one endemic species. Nation-wise the most number of endemic freshwater finfish species occur in India (191), followed by China (88), Indonesia (84), and Myanmar (60). In India, the endemic species accounted for 26.4% of the native freshwater fish fauna, followed by South Korea (16.9%), the Philippines, (16.3%) and Myanmar (15.7%). Statistically significant relationships discerned between the number of indigenous and endemic species richness to land area ( $X_{la}$ in 103 km2) of the nations in the region were, $Y_{in} = 218.961 Ln(X_{la}) - 843.1$ ( $R^2 = 0.735$ ; P &lt; 0.001) and $Y_e = 28.445 Ln X_{la} - 134.47$ ( $R^2 - 0.534$ ; P &lt; 0.01), respectively, and between indigenous and endemic species richness was $Y_e = 0.079X_n - 1.558$ ( $R^2 = 0.235$ ; P &lt; 0.05). The overall conservation status of endemic finfish in Asia was satisfactory in that only 92 species were in some state of vulnerability, of which 37 species (6.6%) are endangered or critically endangered. However, the bulk of these species (83.7%) were cave- and or lake-dwelling fish. However, nation-wise, the endemic freshwater finfish fauna of the Philippines and Sri Lanka, based on the imperilment index, were found to be in a highly vulnerable state. Among river basins, the Mekong Basin had the highest number of endemic species (31.3%). The discrepancies between databases are highlighted and the need to consolidate information among databases is discussed. It is suggested that the Mekong Basin be considered as a biodiversity hotspot, and appropriate management strategies be introduced in this regard.\n      </p>", "Development is a project of hope, guided by the aspiration for greater social justice and emancipation of the poor and disadvantaged in the world. Over the past decade postdevelopment critics have argued that this project of hope has failed, and, instead of creating a fairer world, development can only serve to perpetuate uneven power relationships. Emerging work by postdevelopment authors reinvigorates the positive promise of development as a project toward emancipation and social justice. Discursive practices of development professionals in northern Thailand illustrate how one might conceive of a postdevelopment practice in which aspirations toward social justice and emancipation can coexist alongside the messy realities of development work. Drawing on contemporary discourse theory, Ernesto Laclau's conceptualization of hegemonic struggle provides conceptual tools for thinking beyond the bind of development-as-power. Using hegemony to reimagine development as first and foremost a form of political engagement it becomes possible to imagine viable postdevelopment approaches and strategies.\n      </p>", "The ecological significance of fire is reviewed, particularly in relation to the savanna forest of mainland South East Asia, a community, in which dry season burns occur annually or at least every 2-3 years. It is argued that this tropical deciduous formation is basically an edaphic climax which is well adapted physiognomically, physiologically and phenologically to fire and which in consequence has been gradually spread into the more fire-sensitive adjacent associations, such as tropical semi-evergreen rain forest, by cutting and burning. A careful examination is made of the forest fire environment, of the fuels involved, of the life forms and their adaptive capacity, and of the origins and characteristics of the fires themselves. A case is presented for the prescribed application of fire in this type of habitat and suggestions for appropriate future work are given.\n      </p>", "Asian tarsiid and sivaladapid primates maintained relictual distributions in southern Asia long after the extirpation of their close Holarctic relatives near the Eocene-Oligocene boundary.

These fossils provide data on temporal and paleobiogeographic aspects of early anthropoid evolution and significantly expand the record of stem anthropoid evolution in the Paleogene of South Asia.\n      </p>", "The close floristic affinities between eastern Asia and North America have long been recognized and intensively studied, however, the ecological and biogeographical consequences of such a floristic relationship between these two remotely separated regions has been largely neglected until recently. Quantitative investigations of such relationships could greatly improve our understanding of many global and historical aspects of species diversity, vegetation dynamics, and biogeography, especially with the rapid developments of cladistic methods of phylogenetic reconstruction. All comparisons and predictions will depend on understanding past and present physical and biological processes (i.e. geological history of the continents and the evolutionary history of organisms), as well as human impacts in both regions. Both species level (life history characteristics, distribution, ecological functions) and community level (species composition, structure, endemism) variables should be investigated. Comparisons should be conducted spatially across vegetation zones and temporally through geological episodes. Emphases on the phylogeny and geological history of component taxa by analysing and synthesizing multidisciplinary data would be helpful, especially with regard to the current trends in global climate change.

Previous models depict agricultural development as a singular, relatively rapid response to various stimuli such as climate change and population growth. In contrast, the Southeast Asian data indicate that the development of tropical agro-ecosystems are the result of stresses separated in time and not part of a unitary developmental process. Two phases are evident: At the end of the Pleistocene, environmental data indicate a significant climatic change that would have affected the distribution of food resources. In some areas, this encouraged food production as previous food resources decreased or disappeared. In the second phase, during the mid-Holocene, increased cultural and social risks led to shifts in strategies that created agro-ecosystems - a more fundamental transformation of landscape ecology. This distinct two-phase pattern suggests groups were responding to very different challenges in each period. These findings underscore the need to reexamine agricultural models that conflate separate and distinct processes of cultural change.\n      </p>", "The adjective \"authoritarian\" to describe political regimes obscures much variety.

Top predators are seen as keystone species of ecosystems. Knowledge of their habitat requirements is important for their conservation and the stability of the wildlife communities that depend on them. The goal of our study was to model the habitat of leopard Panthera pardus in west and central Asia, where it is endangered, and analyse the connectivity between different known populations in the Caucasus to enable more effective conservation management strategies to be implemented. 2. Presence and absence data for the species were evaluated from the Caucasus, Middle East and central Asia. Habitat variables related to climate, terrain, land cover and human disturbance were used to construct a predictive model of leopard habitat selection by employing a geographic information system (GIS) and logistic regression. 3. Our model suggested that leopards in west and central Asia avoid deserts, areas with long-duration snow cover and areas that are near urban development. Our research also provides an algorithm for sample data management, which could be used in modelling habitats for similar species. 4. Synthesis and applications. This model provides a tool to improve search effectiveness for leopard in the Caucasus, Middle East and central Asia as well as for the conservation and management of the species. The model can predict the probable distribution of leopards and the corridors between various known populations. Connectivity patterns can be used to facilitate corridor planning for leopard conservation, especially in the Caucasus, where the leopard is a top priority conservation species. Also, as top predators are often associated with high biodiversity, the leopard habitat model could help to identify biodiversity hotspots. The protection of biodiversity hotspots is seen as the most effective way to conserve biodiversity globally.\n      </p>", "Trichocoleopsis S. Okamura and Neotrichocolea S. Hatt. are two water saccate liverwort genera endemic to East Asia whose systematic positions have been controversial. To address their phylogenetic positions and relationships within liverworts, two data sets were analyzed using maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods: (1) four genes (psbA, rps4, 26S, and nad5) of 57 taxa, and (2) nine genes (chloroplast small subunit [SSU], large subunit [LSU], atpB, rbcL, psbA, and rps4; nuclear ribosomal 18S and 26S; mitochondrial nad5) of 24 taxa. All of our analyses suggested the sister relationship between Trichocoleopsis and Neotrichocolea, which is also supported by morphological characters, such as a lobed leaf with ciliate margins, water sacs, coelocaules, and interior capsule wall cells with thin walls. Traditional classifications usually considered Trichocoleopsis and Neotrichocolea as members of Lepidolaenaceae or Trichocoleaceae, whereas our results strongly suggested that the Trichocoleopsis-Neotrichocolea clade allied with Ptilidiaceae, which is supported by the similar ciliate and lobed leaves. However, considering many differences between them, such as in the perianth, sporeling type, water sacs, and rhizoids, we support a family rank for the Neotrichocoleaceae, containing Trichocoleopsis and Neotrichocolea, as previously suggested by Inoue in 1974.\n      </p>", "The tribe Ocimeae subtribe Ociminae is fully revised for continental South East Asia (Burma, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam).

We investigated the effect of these Pleistocene events on genetic divergence in Cerberus rynchops, the Bockdam, an Asian water snake (Homalopsinae) associated with tidal mudflats and coastal mangrove forests in Southeast Asia. Location Localities for the Cerberus included the Andaman sea coast of Thailand, Sumatra, and Borneo (Sunda Shelf localities), the Philippines and Sulawesi, and from northern Australia (Sahul Shelf). Methods We analysed mtDNA sequences (12 s, 16 s, and cyt b) from seven C. rynchops populations (twenty-six specimens), from two specimens of Cerberus microlepis (a fresh-water species known only from Lake Buhi in the Philippines), and from one Enhydris enhyris (Schneider), another homalopsine used as an outgroup. Results We found a strong correlation between genetic divergence and geographical distance (r = 0.922, P &lt; 0.001) and the biogeographic history of the region. Cerberus rynchops populations from the Sunda Shelf localities, the Philippines, Sulawesi and C. microlepis from the Philippines were genetically similar (mean divergence = 2.1%, range = 0.7-2.8%) compared to the C. rynchops population from northern Australia (mean divergence from all other Cerberus populations = 6.6%, range = 6.0-7.3%). This divergence was comparable to that observed between the E. enhydris outgroup and all Cerberus populations (mean distance = 7.3%, range = 6.8-8.6%). Main conclusions These findings suggest a relatively high degree of movement and gene flow among Sunda Shelf localities, the Philippines, and Sulawesi (biogeographic region west of Weber's Line) and isolation of the northern Australian (Sunda Shelf) Cerberus. Taxa will be differentially affected by these Pleistocene sea level changes dependent on their physiology and ecology.

A recently constructed supertree including 1724 oscine taxa forms the basis for this study, in which we present a more detailed hypothesis of this out-of-Australia scenario. Location Australia, Africa, Southeast Asia, Western Pacific Ocean. Methods We used the computer program DIVA to identity putative ancestral areas for each node. We also applied a molecular clock calibrated with three recently conducted studies of passerines to estimate the ages of basal nodes. Although these time estimates are rough they give some indication that, together with the putative ancestral areas, they can be compared with known events of plate tectonic movements in the Australian, Southeast Asian and western Pacific regions. Results The DIVA analysis shows that Basal Corvida and Crown Corvida originated in Australia. Ancestral nodes for Picathartes/Chaetops and Passerida originated in Africa, and the basal nodes of Sylvioidea also originated in Africa. For Muscicapoidea and Passeroidea we were unable to establish ancestral patterns. The molecular clock showed that Crown Corvida radiated between 20 and 30 Ma whereas Basal Corvida and the Passerida clade radiated from c. 45 to 50 Ma. Main conclusions Both approaches agree that: (1) Crown Corvida spread from Australia to Southeast Asia, with several dispersal events around the time when the terranes of Australian and Indomalayan origin came close together some 15 Ma, and (2) a single dispersal event went from Australia across the Indian Ocean to Africa c. 45-50 Ma, leading to the very large radiation of the parvorder Passerida.

Evolutionary history of Ammopiptanthus was examined by means of phylogenetic and molecular dating analyses with a more extensive sampling than ever to shed light on the origin of the genus and the eastern central Asian flora. MatK and nrITS sequences were analyzed using parsimony and Bayesian methods. Divergence time of Ammopiptanthus was estimated using Bayesian dating analyses with relaxed clock model. Both the nrITS-based phylogeny and the matK-based phylogeny gave similar results that Ammopiptanthus is monophyletic and sister to a clade including Sophora and Ammodendron. Low levels of molecular variation were detected in both the plastid and the nuclear DNA regions within Ammopiptanthus. The two species of the genus cannot be distinguished by the analyses. The stem age of Ammopiptanthus was estimated to be 19.6 million years (Myr; 95% highest posterior density [HPD]: 11.2\u201328.2 Myr) by the matK data and 21.8 Myr (95% HPD: 13.8\u201330.0 Myr) by nrITS analysis. The estimated divergence time favors the hypothesis that Ammopiptanthus is a Tertiary relic genus descended from the broad-leaved evergreen Tethyan flora. With increasingly intensified aridification of the region, Ammopiptanthus, together with other characteristic genera in the modern desert flora of eastern central Asia, was able to successfully establish themselves because of high ecological capacities in adaptation to local environments and have persisted for a long time.\n      </p>", "Kelloggia Torrey ex Bentham (Rubiaceae) consists of two species disjunctly distributed in western North America (K. galioides Torrey) and the western part of eastern Asia (K. chinensis Franch.). The two species exhibit a high level of morphological divergence. To test its monophyly and to infer its biogeographic history, we estimated the phylogeny of Kelloggia and its relatives from sequences of three chloroplast DNA regions (rbcL gene, atpB-rbcL spacer, and rps16 intron). The monophyly of Kelloggia was strongly supported, and it forms a sister relationship with the tribe Rubieae. The divergence time between the two disjunct species of Kelloggia was estimated to be 5.42 \u00b1 2.32 million years ago (mya) using the penalized likelihood method based on rbcL sequence data with fossil calibration. Our result does not support the Madrean-Tethyan hypothesis, which assumes an earlier divergence time of 20-25 mya. Ancestral area analysis, as well as dispersal-vicariance (DIVA) analysis, suggests the Asian origin of Kelloggia and the importance of Eurasia in the diversification of its close relatives in the Rubieae-Theligoneae-Paederieae group. The intercontinental disjunction in Kelloggia is suggested to have evolved via long-distance dispersal from Asia into western North America.\n      </p>", "This study marks a significant increase in the number of species and genetic loci used in reconstructing the phylogeny of Viburnum. In particular, we expanded sampling of the morphologically heterogeneous section Megalotinus of Southeast Asia, which to date has been represented by only one species. Our results provide increased support for the monophyly of most of the previously named clades and for relationships within them. However, the four subsections of Megalotinus are placed with confidence in widely separate places in the phylogeny, and their disparate relationships are supported by morphological characters including branching patterns, inflorescence types, and trichomes. These findings, along with the phylogenetic placement of several additional Southeast Asian species, are critical in assessing the ancestral condition of Viburnum inflorescence architecture and endocarp shape. Our results also highlight a new biogeographic possibility, namely that Viburnum may have originated and initially diversified in montane subtropical forests in Southeast Asia and later moved into northern temperate forests, which most of them are associated with today. This study provides a clear-cut example of the importance of including in phylogenetic studies rare and difficult-to-obtain species from outside the main centers of diversity and of the value of dismantling nonmonophyletic taxonomic groups.\n      </p>", "Investigations of land management impacts on hydrology are well developed in South-East Asia, having been greatly extended by national organizations in the last two decades. Regional collaborative efforts, such as the ASEAN-US watershed programme, have helped develop skills and long-running monitoring programmes. Work in different countries is significant for particular aspects: the powerful effects of both cyclones and landsliding in Taiwan, the significance of lahars in Java, of small-scale agriculture in Thailand and plantation establishment in Malaysia. Different aid programmes have contributed specialist knowledge such as British work on reservoir sedimentation, Dutch, Swedish and British work on softwood plantations and US work in hill-tribe agriculture. Much has been achieved through individual university research projects, including PhD and MSc theses. The net result is that for most countries there is now good information on changes in the rainfall-run-off relationship due to forest disturbance or conversion, some information on the impacts on sediment delivery and erosion of hillslopes, but relatively little about the dynamics and magnitude of nutrient losses. Improvements have been made in the ability to model the consequences of forest conversion and of selective logging and exciting prospects exist for the development of better predictions of transfer of water from the hillslopes to the stream channels using techniques such as multilevel modelling. Understanding of the processes involved has advanced through the detailed monitoring made possible at permanent field stations such as that at Danum Valley, Sabah.\n      </p>", "This paper reviews some uniquely male sexual health concerns in Southeast Asia, with particular attention to Indonesia. These include various forms of male circumcision, different types of 'penis enhancement' carried out across the region and the use of dry sex by women. These practices appear to be motivated by specific notions of sexual pleasure, based on indigenous gender constructs. Although they may or may not pose a serious public health problem, as markers of misguided or exploitative gender relations they do reveal important aspects of social psychology related to sexuality and sexual health. Male circumcision provides an ideal opportunity to consider male reproductive health needs and risks in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. Practices that involve cutting the male genitals need to be addressed in ways that stress the importance of sexual relationships based on mutual respect and open communication. Penis implants and inserts and other penis augmentation devices, as well as dry sex practices, are potentially dangerous to both men and women, and of questionable value in bringing pleasure to either, and should be discouraged. /// Cet article examine quelques pr\u00e9occupations masculines de sant\u00e9 sexuelle en Asie du Sud-Est, en particulier en Indon\u00e9sie.

The theories and concepts often are biased because they are derived from a selective and uneven reading of evidence from the two regions. This paper outlines the perceptions and misconceptions of a variety of theoretical perspectives on development, and then presents cross-regional evidence from East Asia and Latin America that suggests the need for a reformulation and synthesis of some of these earlier approaches. This theoretical synthesis focuses on three related themes: (1) the declining significance of industrialization; (2) the position of core and peripheral capital in commodity chains and export/marketing networks, which are becoming key units of analysis in the contemporary global manufacturing system; and (3) a new framework for differentiating the roles of the newly industrializing countries in the world economy.\n      </p>", "This study helps to clarify the debate on the Western and Eastern genetic influences in Central Asia. Thirty-six skeletal remains from Kazakhstan (Central Asia)., excavated from different sites dating between the fifteenth century BC to the fifth century AD, have been analysed for the hypervariable control region (HVR-I) and haplogroup diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the mitochondrial DNA genome. Standard authentication criteria for ancient DNA studies, including multiple extractions, cloning of PCR products and independent replication, have been followed. The distribution of east and west Eurasian lineages through time in the region is concordant with the available archaeological information: prior to the thirteenth-seventh century BC, all Kazakh samples belong to European lineages; while later an arrival of east Eurasian sequences that coexisted with the previous west Eurasian genetic substratum can be detected. The presence of an ancient genetic substratum of European origin in West Asia may be related to the discovery of ancient mummies with European features in Xinjiang and to the existence of an extinct Indo-European language, Tocharian. This study demonstrates the usefulness of the ancient DNA in unravelling complex patterns of past human migrations so as to help decipher the origin of present-day admixed populations.\n      </p>", "Despite calls over the years for the Asia-Pacific region, or some subset of it, to develop a regional security regime, no deliberate action to achieve this has been taken. This paper considers the possible ends of a regional security regime and the means towards achieving them. The ends themselves would differ according to whether any regime focused on security traditionally and narrowly conceived, on comprehensive security or on human security No matter which approach is taken, if the regime is to be successful in any sense beyond that of rhetoric, some of the region's cherished norms such as non-intervention as that is currently interpreted will have to be at least modified, if not completely scrapped. Even if the region collectively decides it needs a security regime and can agree on its ends, there are many alternative ways of achieving the ends and the processes of working out detailed rules will be difficult and time-consuming. None of this is to say that establishing a regional security regime will be impossible. It is to say that it will involve a lot of work, and a lot of compromise by state policy-makers.\n      </p>", "The process by which different ecological conditions and historical trajectories interacted to create different social and cultural systems resulted in major differences in economic development performance within Southeast Asia. In the late 19th century, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand commonly experienced vent-for-surplus development through exploitation of unused lands. Nevertheless, different agrarian structures were created. Indonesia's development was mainly based on the exploitation of tropical rain forest under Dutch colonialism. It resulted in the bifurcation of the rural sector between rice-farming peasant proprietors and large plantations for tropical export crops based on hired labor. In the Philippines, exploitation of the same resource base under Spanish rule resulted in pervasive landlessness among the rural population. Relatively homogeneous landowning peasants continued to dominate in Thailand, where delta plains that were suitable only for rice production formed the resource base for development. These different agrarian structures associated with different social value systems have accounted for differential development performance across the three economies in the recent three decades.\n
