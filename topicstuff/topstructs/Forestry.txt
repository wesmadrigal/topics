{"total_words": 753, "documents": ["This article investigates the role of capital formation in contributing to the sustainability of community forestry in Nepal, using a case study approach based on 23 forest user groups (FUGs). FUGs were classified in 3 categories on the basis of cluster analysis: (1) successful, (2) moderately successful, and (3) unsuccessful clusters. The results show that the elements of capital accumulation in a successful FUG were manageable mature forest, high prices for forest products, a system of charging for all forest products, and sales of surplus forest products outside the FUG. The results also suggest that the benefits of funds, community development, and forest improvement changed people's vision and behavior, as well as their attitude toward and understanding of community forestry. This change in attitude has increased interest in and awareness of community forestry and has stimulated thinking about the sustainability of community forestry. Local initiative of this sort makes community forests more secure, protected, and wisely managed for sustainable development.\n      </p>", "Over the past two decades forestry in the United States has diverged into two approaches with quite different objectives and scientific priorities. The management focus of most industrial lands is on increasing productivity of wood fiber via plantations and various cultural tools, especially genetic selection, fertilization, and control of noncrop vegetation. Federal forest management has shifted from a similar focus to greater emphasis on protecting diversity and water. Issues of long-term sustainability are important regardless of ownership. Science has played and continues to play a fundamental role in all aspects. Selection for fast-growing genotypes has increased yields on the order of 10% to 20% depending on species. Fertilization often increases growth significantly but responses are variable and difficult to predict. Significant questions remain concerning the sustainability of intensive forestry, particularly when practiced over wide areas. Soils are heavily impacted by some harvesting practices, and the degree to which damage can be repaired by fertilizers is an important scientific issue. Intensive forestry often results in increased pest problems. In at least one case (fusiform rust in southern pines), a pest has been contained by selecting resistant cultivars, a situation that may or may not be evolutionarily stable. Species diversity is clearly reduced under intensive management, raising questions about the functional role of species with no commercial value. Many of the questions facing forestry science--particularly those dealing with the relation between complexity and function--are precisely the ones confronting basic ecology. Over the past decade scientists have labored to develop ecosystem-based management approaches that maintain system complexity and function, and scientists have increasingly played nontraditional roles at the interface between biology, sociology, and policy.\n      </p>", "The majority of the world\u2019s forests are used for multiple purposes, which often include the potentially conflicting goals of timber production and biodiversity conservation. A scientifically validated management approach that can reduce such conflicts is retention forestry, an approach modeled on natural processes, which emerged in the last 25 years as an alternative to clearcutting. A portion of the original stand is left unlogged to maintain the continuity of structural and compositional diversity. We detail retention forestry\u2019s ecological role, review its current practices, and summarize the large research base on the subject. Retention forestry is applicable to all forest biomes, complements conservation in reserves, and represents bottom-up conservation through forest manager involvement. A research challenge is to identify thresholds for retention amounts to achieve desired outcomes. We define key issues for future development and link retention forestry with land-zoning allocation at various scales, expanding its uses to forest restoration and the management of uneven-age forests.\n      </p>", "Changing temperature and precipitation pattern and increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO\u2082 are likely to drive significant modifications in natural and modified forests. Our review is focused on recent publications that discuss the changes in commercial forestry, excluding the ecosystem functions of forests and nontimber forest products. We concentrate on potential direct and indirect impacts of climate change on forest industry, the projections of future trends in commercial forestry, the possible role of biofuels, and changes in supply and demand.\n      </p>", "Recent research in political ecology highlights the central role played by the colonial state in tropical forest management, but little attention has been given as yet to the discursive representation of that role. This paper thus investigates the ways in which colonial foresters represented their work through books, articles and official reports. Using colonial Burma as a case study, the key elements of a discourse of 'forestry as progress' are delineated. In emphasizing the pre-eminence of teak extraction, forest revenue and forest conservation measures, however, colonial foresters failed to address in their writing other themes which would have called into question the 'progressive' image of colonial forestry. By way of illustration, the neglected dimension of political conflict between colonizer and colonized over forest management is briefly reviewed. Both the illegal 'everyday resistance' of peasants and the legal political opposition of Burmese politicians underscored that the colonial discourse of forestry as progress - in part or in whole - was unacceptable to the vast majority of the Burmese population. Yet the attractiveness of this discourse to states in the tropics persists even today as foresters continue to extoll the 'non-political' commercialized nature of contemporary forestry as part of a broader attempt to counter growing popular opposition to state forest control.\n      </p>", "The most important advantage of cloning conifers by somatic embryogenesis (SE) is that the embryogenic tissue can be cryopreserved without changing its genetic make-up and without loss of juvenility. This offers an opportunity to develop high-value clonal varieties by defrosting and repropagating cryopreserved clones after genetic testing has shown which clones are the best performers. In the current absence of cost-effective automated embling handling systems or artificial seed technology, the deployment of the high-value clones in clonal forestry can be achieved inexpensively by mass serial rooting of cuttings from juvenile donor plants produced from cryopreserved embryogenic cultures. In a genetic analysis of the SE process in white spruce Picea glauca, we found that induction of SE was under strong genetic control. Although the dominance variance diminished rapidly as the zygotic embryos matured, the additive variance remained relatively large during the induction phase. The genetic effects in the subsequent maturation and germination phases were less strong. Furthermore, genetic variation at the different phases of SE was not correlated. Thus, it is the induction phase of SE that can be manipulated by breeding. Most of the embryogenic clones were cryopreserved easily, i.e., there was no apparent genotype effect. To determine stability of cryopreserved clones, a set of 12 clones was retrieved after 3 and 4 years, respectively, from cryopreservation and repropagated by SE. An assessment of morphological in vitro development and ex vitro survival and growth characters demonstrated general stability of the cryopreserved clones of white spruce.\n      </p>", "Assisted migration (AM) is often presented as a strategy to save species that are imminently threatened by rapid climate change. This conception of AM, which has generated considerable controversy, typically proposes the movement of narrowly distributed, threatened species to suitable sites beyond their current range limits. However, existing North American forestry operations present an opportunity to practice AM on a larger scale, across millions of hectares, with a focus on moving populations of widely distributed, nonthreatened tree species within their current range limits. Despite these differences (and many others detailed herein), these two conceptions of AM have not been clearly distinguished in the literature, which has added confusion to recent dialogue and debate. Here, we aim to facilitate clearer communication on this topic by detailing this distinction and encouraging a more nuanced view of AM.\n      </p>", "Ideally, social forestry programmes and philosophies are intended to involve local people in the management and distribution of forest resources. In practice, the structures of social forestry programmes are influenced by political, economic and cultural factors at national and local levels. When social forestry programmes entail the reallocation of access to forest resources on state lands, power relations are particularly influential. As the case of the Java Social Forestry Program illustrates, powerful social forces that have shaped historically the national forest management agency and the social structures of forest-based villages have distorted social forestry ideals. When their traditional management tools are unable to curb deforestation and the social processes causing deforestation, forestry agencies may be persuaded to implement social forestry policies. Changes in forestry programmes and the orientation of social forestry are inevitably subject to local negotiation and renegotiation. The outcomes of negotiation, however, are dependent on the structures of power relations both before and after implementation of new policies.\n      </p>", "\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n         For individual subscriptions, please contact the <a href=\"https://aibs.site-ym.com/?page=IndMem\">AIBS</a>\r\n         .\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p />    \r\n         To buy individual copies, please contact <a\thref=\"http://www.ucpressjournals.com/journalBuy.asp?j=bio\">University of California Press</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n         .\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n         For individual subscriptions, please contact the <a href=\"https://aibs.site-ym.com/?page=IndMem\">AIBS</a>\r\n         .\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p />    \r\n         To buy individual copies, please contact <a\thref=\"http://www.ucpressjournals.com/journalBuy.asp?j=bio\">University of California Press</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n         .\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n         For individual subscriptions, please contact the <a href=\"https://aibs.site-ym.com/?page=IndMem\">AIBS</a>\r\n         .\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p />    \r\n         To buy individual copies, please contact <a\thref=\"http://www.ucpressjournals.com/journalBuy.asp?j=bio\">University of California Press</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n         .\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "Calls for community forestry on public forests grew in strength in both British Columbia and the United States during the 1990s, as part of a global movement touting the advantages of community control over centralized state administration of forests. Despite structural similarities, the trajectories of community forestry in the two locations diverged sharply, with community forests rapidly becoming a reality in British Columbia while similar proposals in the United States were blocked. This article explains these divergent trajectories by examining the differences in property relations, state institutions, stakeholder interests, and environmental social-movement strategies that led to nearly opposite outcomes in initially similar situations. It also analyzes community forestry in British Columbia relative to current debates over neoliberalism and alternative economies, arguing that detailed examination of such empirical examples demonstrates the utility of neoliberalism as an analytical concept.\n      </p>", "This paper provides an assessment of the conceptual basis of community forestry from around the world, based on case studies presented in the literature, mainly over the last decade. More than 400 documents were examined for this comprehensive qualitative meta-study (meta-theory, meta-analysis, meta-method, and meta-synthesis) of community forestry. An overall conclusion is offered regarding the extent to which community forestry can be adapted to foster practices that enhance livelihoods, particularly for poverty populations, in rural United States communities. Special attention is paid to signifiers of community empowerment and reflexivity as well as other elements of success suggested in the literature.\n      </p>", "On the island of Hainan, China, the provincial government has recently committed itself to sustainable development, which requires the integration of social, environmental, and economic factors in decision making. However, while Hainan's recent Eco-province designation establishes environmental and economic factors as the basis of policy development, it overlooks the equally important social component of sustainability, in which social needs and values are key considerations. This paper presents the results of a study on Hainan in 2002, with government officials, forestry workers, and the Li, an indigenous minority group, and places the province's situation within the context of both the larger changes underway in China, and the theory and practice of sustainable forestry. The research results show that the government of Hainan has not yet been able to manage both social welfare and environmental and economic issues, demonstrating the difficulty of implementing sustainable forestry and of balancing short- with long-term goals. The inclusion of Li communities in forestry-related decision making could reduce tensions between local communities and forestry management and also improve the sustainability of the government's forestry practices.\n      </p>", "After tracing the present administration and economic aspects of the forestry sector in India, the author suggests if the forestry sector is given, as in the case of agricultural sector, heavy inputs involving the introduction of modern and scientific ideas, organizational and institutional innovations, and fertilizers, it will be able to achieve self-sufficiency and also to provide employment to an extra 51 million people by 1990. It is estimated that about one-third of the projected increase in the work force could be absorbed by forestry sector.\n      </p>", "At independence, Tanzanian foresters believed that state-led forestry could provide a lasting contribution to the development aspirations of the newly independent country. Yet they were gradually marginalized within Julius Nyerere's project of socio-economic transformation. By exploring the spatial dimensions of competing land use discourses of the time, I hope to offer an interpretation as to how and why forestry's marginalization happened. I argue that at least some of this marginal ization was the result of differences inherent in the scale of focus between forestry and the larger, contemporaneous socio-economic and political discourses dominant in the period. At independence, Nyerere positioned development efforts more squarely within the national political institutions of the state and for the nation, writ whole. With its professional and discursive ties to an international forestry order and its spatial biases, Tanzanian foresters were poorly placed to respond or adapt to changes in the political discourse and in the economic conditions of resource extraction. In short, they were unable to adjust to changes in the scale of development praxis in Tanzania. I conclude by suggesting two points. First, that the history of land use and natural resource management choices in post-colonial Tanzania can be better understood through a historical-geographical, or spatialized, theoretical framework. Second, that current historical-geographical theory could be fine tuned through reflection on its utility in describing and explaining land use politics in post-colonial developing contexts.\n      </p>", "A program of forestry surveys and reform conducted in France during the 17th century has been accused of rationalizing the landscape and suppressing peasant culture; tools of cartography were said to have made rural lands both more legible to the state and alien to locals. On closer inspection, it seems that the surveys did not produce abstract rationalizations of the forests that made them 'readable' at a distance or more orderly on the ground; mainly the reformers developed databases or archives of misuses of the forests by nobles who were supposed to be managing them for the crown. This paper follows one reformer, Louis de Froidour, as he moved through the Midi-Pyrenees, using a set of letters he wrote while doing forest surveys for the reform. He described and explained noble opposition to his entering 'their forests', and how he nonetheless conducted the required surveys and acquired the necessary documents. Froidour not only did not target peasant villages, but also sometimes even protected forests that he said locals needed more than the crown. He had no romantic affection for mountain inhabitants (quite the opposite). He protected their interests because villagers rather than nobles paid taxes, and so disrupting their economies would not benefit the state. This case study, while only focusing on a small area of France, provides valuable insight into the logic of the reform, and its political consequences.\n      </p>", "Making information and decision-making processes accessible to disadvantaged and nonliterate people is a challenge for community forestry in Nepal. In studies jointly conducted by the Nepal-UK Community Forestry Project (NUKCFP) and His Majesty's Government (HMG) of Nepal Department of Forest, aerial photographs and participatory photomapping (tracing maps over aerial photographs) were evaluated with a view to supporting participatory processes of community forestry in Parbat District of the Middle Hill Region. Results indicate that, regardless of educational status, most people accurately interpreted forest condition and profiles of community use from photographs. Photographs were appreciated because they presented authentic information, allowed consistency of interpretation between groups, and made it possible to calibrate perceptions of resources. District Forest Officers and Community Forestry Officers valued aerial photographs as robust instruments that naturally directed discussions toward community and resource issues. Results of a pilot study of the use of aerial images for surveys indicated that orthorectified aerial images may substantially reduce time spent by District Forest Office (DFO) staff in chain-and-compass surveys of community forests. Surveys based on aerial images encourage the participation of users, and boundaries drawn over survey photomaps are represented in the context of important reference information contained in the photographic image. The development of a service for low-cost printing of high-resolution and geographically correct photomaps is described.\n      </p>", "Forestry management policies in China have changed direction to encourage sustainability while balancing land-use, economic growth, and demand for forest products.\n      </p>", "Managing forests to meet both production and conservation goals is a growing challenge around the world, particularly as forest areas devoid of human intervention continue to shrink in area. There is a general lack of information about the response of long-lived vertebrates to silvicultural treatments due to the difficulty of carrying out long-term studies that can disentangle the effects of forestry from other factors influencing the distribution and numbers of large organisms. We examined the responses of the Cinereous Vulture, Aegypius monachus, to two divergent forestry practices in two colonies where ~10% of the European population breeds: (1) long-term exploitation of mature forest in high mountains (highland colony), and (2) clear-cutting and regeneration in lower altitude mountain areas (lowland colony). Distribution patterns of Cinereous Vultures were determined mainly by forestry and human-related activities, as well as by orographic variables, whereas forest structure had a lesser influence. Ecological factors such as orography and forest structure had a greater influence in the distribution and abundance of vultures in the highland area, whereas the influence of variables associated with human disturbance was stronger in the lowland area. Vultures in the lowland area consistently selected areas with a low incidence of forestry activity to breed. A major fraction of the variability of breeding success was not explained by the factors considered, although human-caused disturbance and rainfall during the nestling period had negative effects on breeding success in the lowland colony. The negative effects of forestry activities may persist for a long time, even after the direct impacts of these activities have diminished. In order to effectively conserve breeding areas, it may be necessary to protect suitable habitat from human activity near nests. In addition, halting illegal poisoning is a strict necessity to guarantee the conservation of colonies. Social conflict between conservationists and forest managers who employ local people in nonproductive forestry tasks could easily be resolved by conducting silviculture-related practices in areas that are unimportant for conservation and directing employment toward activities related to nature conservation.\n      </p>", "Capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and arbitrage pricing theory (APT) are used to assess the financial performance of eight forestry-related investment vehicles. Although results from APT support previous findings from CAPM about timberland investments, three bodies of evidence show that APT findings are more robust. The major conclusions are (a) institutional timberland investments and timberland limited partnerships have a low risk level and excess returns; (b) forestry industry companies have not earned risk-adjusted returns, and the performance of medium forest industry firms is worse than that of large firms; (c) stumpage price does not resemble the return generation process of timberland investments; and (d) lumber futures have little excess return.\n      </p>", "Conceptual issues of gender equity in development are examined and analyzed with respect to the Social forestry project (Village and Farm Forestry Project; VFFP) as a means to redistribute access to productive resources and household benefits. A random sample of 120 VFFP participants, both men and women, was interviewed regarding their division of labor and their access to resources and benefits in relation to the project. The survey suggests that women and men produce different quantities and types of labor for the VFFP. Although women supply more labor than men, it is possible that women's overall labor burden is reduced in relation to the national average. For VFFP participants called \"core farmers,\" women enjoy the same access to productive resources and services as men, with the important exception that women do not generally have land rights. Yet 100% of interviewed women \"core farmers\" answered positively to six indicators of sociocultural advancement because of their participation in the VFFP. Among a second tier of VFFP participants called \"participating farmers,\" a large majority of women respondents claim rights on most resources and services important in the VFFP, although these proportions are less than among men respondents. Most women \"participating farmers\" answered affirmatively to the six indicators of sociocultural advancement, but in lesser proportions than among women \"core farmers.\"\n      </p>", "Women are important stakeholders in natural resource policies since rural women in developing countries are responsible for most of the collection of food, fuel, and firewood for commercial and domestic use. When it comes to the management of these natural resources, gender inequality due to societal traditions could limit the ability of women to participate in policy-making, even when they are not formally excluded. This paper analyzes the effect of gender stratification on women's participation by undertaking an empirical study of a participatory environmental policy program in Indian villages. It endeavors to answer the question of how gender stratification affects participatory environmental policy-making. Using the case study of a community forestry program, it finds that women are still marginalized in decision-making, even in participatory environmental policies. Gender stratification continues to impinge upon forms of democratic decision-making in developing societies. Using facilitating policy tools that seek to empower such marginalized groups would be one way of making participation meaningful for all groups in society.\n      </p>", "Lyme borreliosis (LymeB), Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HemoFRS), Lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LymphoCM), Tick-borne encephalitis (TickBE), Q Fever (QFever), and Weil's leptospirosis (Lepto) are known to be occupational diseases for rural outdoor workers. We investigated the occupational infection risks for these diseases in greater detail. Antibodies to these agents were assessed in 312 forestry workers and muskrat catchers, and in 356 matched office workers. Three levels of occupational exposure were distinguished: high for active forestry workers, low for supervisory forestry staff and muskrat catchers and zero for office workers. At high exposure the prevalence odds ratios (with 95% CI between brackets) were: LymeB 15 (5.5-42), HemoFRS 11 (1.3-501), LymphoCM 5.4 (1.0-50), TickBE 1.0 (0.3-3.0), QFever 1.0 (0.4-2.1), and Lepto 0 (0.0-33). No significant risk of infection was found at low exposure. Part of the present group had also been studied in 1989 and 1990. Within this cohort the conversion rates to Borrelia burgdorferi have been estimated for the periods 1989-1990 and 1990-1993 as 0.23 and $0.066\\ \\text{year}^{-1}$ , respectively, and the reversion rate as $0.44\\ \\text{year}^{-1}$ . The corresponding values for HemoFRS were 0.031, 0.018 and $1.42\\ \\text{year}^{-1}$ . Active forestry workers in the Netherlands are at high risk of infection by LymeB, HemoFRS and LymphoCM. Prevalence of antibodies to LymeB and HemoFRS appeared to reflect the levels of these infection hazards in recent history.\n      </p>", "The ability to model the suspended sediment flux (SSflux) and associated water flow from terrain affected by selective logging is important to the establishment of credible measures to improve the ecological sustainability of forestry practices. Recent appreciation of the impact of parameter uncertainty on the statistical credibility of complex models with little internal state validation supports the use of more parsimonious approaches such as data-based mechanistic (DBM) modelling. The DBM approach combines physically based understanding with model structure identification based on transfer functions and objective statistical inference. Within this study, these approaches have been newly applied to rainfall-SSflux response. The dynamics of the sediment system, together with the rainfall-river flow system, were monitored at five nested contributory areas within a 44 ha headwater region in Malaysian Borneo. The data series analysed covered a whole year at a 5 min resolution, and were collected during a period some five to six years after selective timber harvesting had ceased. Physically based and statistical interpretation of these data was possible given the wealth of contemporary and past hydrogeomorphic data collected within the same region. The results indicated that parsimonious, three-parameter models of rainfall-river flow and rainfall-SSflux for the whole catchment describe 80 and 90% of the variance, respectively, and that parameter changes between scales could be explained in physically meaningful terms. Indeed, the modelling indicated some new conceptual descriptions of the river flow and sediment-generation systems. An extreme rainstorm having a 10-20 year return period was present within the data series and was shown to generate new mass movements along the forestry roads that had a differential impact on the monitored contributory areas. Critically, this spatially discrete behaviour was captured by the modelling and may indicate the potential use of DBM approaches for (i) predicting the differential effect of alternative forestry practices, (ii) estimating uncertainty in the behaviour of ungauged areas and (iii) forecasting river flow and SSflux in terrain with temporal changes in rainfall regime and forestry impacts.\n      </p>", "The location and operation of harvest machinery, along with the design and construction of access roads, are important problems faced by foresty planners, making up about 55% of total production costs. One of the main challenges consists of finding a design that will minimize the cost of installation and operation of harvest machinery, road construction, and timber transport, while complying with the technical restrictions that apply to the operation of harvesting equipment and road construction. We can model the network design problem as a mixed-integer linear programming problem. This model is fed with cartographic information, provided by a geographic information system (GIS), along with technical and economic parameters determined by the planner. We developed a specialized heuristic for the problem to obtain solutions that enable harvesting economically profitable volumes at a low cost. This methodology was programmed into a computer system known as PLANEX and is being applied in nine forestry companies that report important benefits from its use.\n      </p>", "The problems of community forestry are not related to technical-production questions, but to issues of distribution and equity. To date most studies have emphasized strategies for halting deforestation and planting more trees, often to the exclusion of strategies for maintaining the plantations and meeting the needs of the poor. A classification of forestry programs will help to clarify objectives, strategies, and project concepts. Community-forestry programs need to stress different actors, activities, and level of analysis when comparing these programs with those of farm forestry and social forestry. The form such strategies take will depend on local conditions. However, it is possible to lay down some broad rules for relating patterns of organization to performance, and to conceptualize alternatives to existing bureaucratic arrangements.\n      </p>", "One hundred and fifty-one forestry workers and 151 matched office clerks were compared as to the presence of antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Puumalavirus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Their occupational risks of being infected by Borrelia was fourfold and significant, by Puumalavirus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus was increased but not significant. No seropositivity has been established against tick-borne encephalitis virus.\n      </p>", "This paper analyses participatory forest policy and the ways it has influenced the relationships between people as it relates to the forest resource management. This case study was conducted in the middle hills of Nepal, and information was collected through direct observation, individual interviews, group discussion and secondary information analysis. It substantiates a few examples of how the community forestry programme can be used as a means to promote the participation of the women, the poor and dalit (untouchables) in forest resource management, as well as enhancing social justice and improving the forest resources in their locality. However, it also demonstrates that though the community forestry programme has a positive impact, it faces several constraints and challenges. The local Forest User Group is controlled by a few \u00e9lites making the poor and disadvantaged vulnerable to further marginalization. The results of the case study strongly indicate that community forestry processes must address the political, economic and social needs of the forest users, and also provide a neutral platform on which the poor can present their cases.\n      </p>", "The prime aims of social-forestry programs, which include agroforestry and forestry components, are to provide the basic consumption needs, i.e. staple food, fuelwood, fodder and small timber for construction and agricultural implements, and employment for the poor in order to generate income and to raise living standards. Although the concept of social forestry was formally proposed as early as 1893, real progress was made only from the early 1980s. It is argued that the differing socioeconomic environment, in which social forestry is being implemented in various states of India, has resulted in differential uptake by villagers. The socioeconomic variables affecting social forestry uptake are identified and it is suggested that for social forestry to be successful these variables must be incorporated in social-forestry planning.\n      </p>", "In view of rising energy costs, and of ongoing discussions on ensuring future world supplies, an investigation of Swedish conditions was carried out with the following aims: 1. to outline methods for analyzing the energy flow in forestry and agriculture; 2. to described the flow of various resources in physical, monetary and energetic terms for the years 1956 and 1972; and 3. to provide a basis for selecting branches of great importance for energy supply and consumption, where further investigation could be valuable. The input of auxiliary energy doubled during the period investigated, while the labour input decreased by 75%. The total cost of auxiliary energy in 1972 correspond to 10% of the total income. The total growth of the forest tree biomass represented 0.17% of the solar radiation.\n      </p>", "Community Forestry, as an appropriate technology, has become an integral part of the rural development effort of the Sahelian country of Niger, West Africa. Unfortunately, many of these community projects have failed or have showed results far less than expected. The paper explores a number of social factors which could help to explain the lack of success. The social factors discussed include: (1) endemic problems of community forestry projects, (2) the social implications of environmental constraints, (3) technical understanding, (4) political/legal structure, (5) village level sociological barriers, (6) project management, and (7) the local history of development effort. The paper concludes by suggesting the need for change within the existing institutional structures through re-training of governmental officials. \"Bureaucratic reorientation\" could significantly improve the opportunity for successful implementation of community forestry projects in Niger and elsewhere.\n      </p>", "Near-to-nature forestry is an attractive concept, but it is difficult to apply in a landscape where (i) the remaining fragments of original-natural forests are small and far apart; (ii) most large forests are secondary and very artificial; (iii) long-naturalized trees and other forest species are present throughout the country, and; (iv) natural disturbance regimes and their consequences cannot readily be observed. This paper summarizes the issues and problems relating to ancient seminatural woods and conifer plantation forests in Britain. Measures are indicated that would bring their management nearer to nature. Natural elements can be incorporated into stand composition, stand structure, processes and patterns, provided general principles are interpreted in a pragmatic and flexible manner.\n      </p>", "Deforestation has been a serious ecological problem in Bangladesh for the past four decades. Illegal logging, demand for fuelwood and farmland encroachment are the principal causes of dwindling biomass resource. About 17.8% of the total area of the country are under forest cover (BBS 1993), but less than half of that area are under real \"tree formations\". It is estimated that Bangladesh loses its forest lands by about 3.3% every year (World Bank 1994). This paper attempts to present a review of a newer strategy to meet this challenge; a strategy, not merely of halting deforestation, but of reforestation on a national scale and through people's participation in the process. In response to the crisis in the forestry sector, traditional government forest management programs have been replaced by participatory forestry in recent years as the principal strategy for reforestation. This change in strategy has two goals (1) encourage new plantations, and (2) generate income and create jobs for the rural poor. Participatory forestry is a benefit sharing scheme in which the landless and the marginal farmers are employed in tree plantation work.\n      </p>", "This study analyzed the spatial and temporal changes in land use between 1978 and 1992 in a typical watershed covering &lt;tex-math&gt;$543\\ km^{2}$&lt;/tex-math&gt; in the Middle Hills of Nepal and used GIS to compare land use changes between village development committees (VDCs) with and without formally handed-over community forests during this period. The forest handover procedure followed the specifications of the national community forestry policy of Nepal. In the watershed, the total area of forested land (defined as high forest plus shrubland) declined by about 8% during the period. However, high forest increased over the study period, whereas shrubland cover declined. Between VDCs with community forests and those without, there were large differences in the rate of total forested area loss, with community forest VDCs losing less total forested area over the 14-year period. Moreover, in the group of VDCs with community forests, high forest area increased by 77%, in comparison with 13% for VDCs without community forests. Higher shrub loss in community forest VDCs was attributable to conversion into high forest via plantation establishment and natural succession. The results of this study indicate the positive impacts of Nepal's community forestry activities on the extent of forest cover.\n      </p>", "Plantations of rapidly growing trees are becoming increasingly common because the high productivity can enhance local economies, support improvements in educational systems, and generally improve the quality of life in rural communities. Landowners frequently choose to plant nonindigenous species; one rationalization has been that silvicultural productivity is enhanced when trees are separated from their native herbivores and pathogens. The expectation of enemy reduction in nonindigenous species has theoretical and empirical support from studies of the enemy release hypothesis (ERH) in the context of invasion ecology, but its relevance to forestry has not been evaluated. We evaluated ERH in the productive forests of Galicia, Spain, where there has been a profusion of pine plantations, some with the indigenous Pinus pinaster, but increasingly with the nonindigenous P. radiata. Here, one of the most important pests of pines is the indigenous bark beetle, Tomicus piniperda. In support of ERH, attacks by T. piniperda were more than twice as great in stands of P. pinaster compared to P. radiata. This differential held across a range of tree ages and beetle abundance. However, this extension of ERH to forestry failed in the broader sense because beetle attacks, although fewer on P. radiata, reduced productivity of P. radiata more than that of P. pinaster (probably because more photosynthetic tissue is lost per beetle attack in P. radiata). Productivity of the nonindigenous pine was further reduced by the pathogen, Sphaeropsis sapinea, which infected up to 28% of P. radiata but was absent in P. pinaster. This was consistent with the forestry axiom (antithetical to ERH) that trees planted \"off-site\" are more susceptible to pathogens. Fungal infections were positively correlated with beetle attacks; apparently T. piniperda facilitates S. sapinea infections by creating wounds and by carrying fungal propagules. A globally important component in the diminution of indigenous flora has been the deliberate large-scale propagation of nonnative trees for silviculture. At least for Pinus forestry in Spain, reduced losses to pests did not rationalize the planting of nonindigenous trees. There would be value in further exploration of relations between invasion ecology and the forestry of nonindigenous trees.\n      </p>", "The preservation of key habitats is included in modern forest-management practices as one of the main means to preserve biodiversity in northern European production forests. I examined the distribution patterns and persistence of occurrence of rare epiphytic macrolichens in a predominantly unprotected forest landscape with an area of $278 km^2$ in southern Finland. Occurrence data of macrolichens in two key habitats, rock outcrops and mires, were compared with data from production forests. The density of populations of rare macrolichens was 50-fold higher on rock outcrops and 25-fold higher on mires than in production forests. Most rare species of epiphytic macrolichens were found only in key habitats. In modern, intensively managed forest landscapes, rock outcrops appeared to represent the main habitats for rare macrolichens as a result of the long-term continuity of old trees. Most macrolichen occurrences represented very small populations with a high extinction risk. Of the populations found in 1989-1995 in key habitats, 51% had disappeared, by 2000-2001, mainly as a result of forestry activities. The disappearance of populations significantly exceeded the rate of establishment of new populations. My results emphasize the importance of key habitats for declining forest species. There is also a need to improve and sharpen the guidelines for delimiting and managing key habitats in order to halt the continued decline of epiphytic macrolichens.\n      </p>", "The forces that started formal forestry education in Australia and New Zealand from 1910 and 1924 respectively are traced. The controversies and difficulties experienced by the forestry schools that were started are examined and the links between the two countries in forestry education are noted. Forestry education arose amidst inter-state jealousies, class divisions and personal animosities. It emerged in the 1960s as a truly university education that melded some of the ethos of imperial forestry with other philosophies in ways that could be applied in Dominion realities.\n      </p>", "Recent amendments to provincial legislation, the implementation of the Forest Practices Code of British Columbia, and the increased recognition and participation of First Nations has resulted in a need to incorporate archaeological resource management into forestry planning practices.

Foresters claim the chemicals used are safe, both for human health and for the environment. Opposition groups deny this and point to medical studies suggesting carcinogenic properties associated with some of the chemicals being used. The recent evolution of these debates is discussed, and the opposing points of view are presented. Much more research is needed before either side can realistically defend their position.\n      </p>", "Farm forestry was promoted in India in the late 1970s to produce fuelwood for rural consumption. The program was immensely successful in the green revolution regions in the early 1980s, but farmers produced wood for markets, and not to meet local needs. This market orientation of farmers was recognized in the new National Forest Policy of 1988. Lately, two serious problems have been noted. First, the program remained confined only to the commercialized and monetized regions, and elsewhere made little impact. Second, even in regions where it was successful in the early 1980s, it could not be sustained after 1986. This paper analyzes the likely causes for its limited success, and suggests that while market-led farm forestry may continue without subsides on a reduced scale, government attention should shift to strengthening the traditional agroforestry practices based on indigenous species.\n      </p>", "Officials in the Mexican environmental protection agency, the Secretaria de Medio Ambiente, Recursos Naturales y de Pesca (SEMARNAP), deploy representations of agropastoral fires set by rural people to find urban allies, whereas officials and rural people in Oaxaca avoid mentioning fire and firewood cutting. Rigorous fire and firewood regulations are largely unenforced, producing official ignorance of burning and firewood cutting, partially because of the absence of fire and firewood forms within SEMARNAP and partially because of collusion and collaboration at the state level. This is compared with official knowledge of logging in indigenous forest communities in the state of Oaxaca to argue that official knowledge can be the product not of state-imposed projects of legibility but, rather, of alliances and entanglements between the state and politically powerful interlocutors. Practices of silencing and concealment are not the result of inadequate Mexican forestry institutions but are inherent to the process of knowledge production.\n      </p>", "Forestry as an important industry has both direct as well as indirect effects on the Estonian economy. It is therefore essential that it is sustainably managed so that it can continue to contribute to the economy in the future. The first aim of this article is to establish the situation regarding felling and regeneration in Estonia. As the available forestry statistics display discrepancies and lack consistency, it was as a necessary first step to gather information about and analyze the validity and reliability of the prime data to make the data sets useful for comparison over time and establish the current trends in Estonian forestry. However, with the help of interviews we are able to show that economic instability in Estonia brings with it increased logging rates and hinders investments into regeneration and maintenance. The problems are particularly pronounced in private forestry. Second, the article seeks to explain the socioeconomic reasons behind this situation. Economic problems among private owners, a liberal forestry policy, together with rapid land reform and weak enforcement of forestry legislation are some of the reasons that can explain the forestry trends in Estonia.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "In this paper the causes of the destruction of the tropical forests are analyzed. We propose remedies and we give the specific actions which have been proposed by the World Resources Institute for the years 1987-1991 and by the Silva Conference held in Paris in February 1986. Deforestation can be arrested if the developing and the developed countries change their current behavior. Research in tropical forestry can make contributions of major significance, even if research alone cannot solve all the problems. There is a requirement for research in forest production, in the economic use of wood and in the elimination of the use of what is treated as waste. It is an important duty of the International Foundation for Science to encourage increased applications in forestry.\n      </p>", "Recent analyses of timber exploitation in Amazonia conclude that a variety of socioeconomic and ecological factors in the region make a stable and profitable logging industry virtually impossible. Most of these studies focus on large-scale timber industries and their dependence on over-exploitation of a small number of high-value timbers. In this article we discuss the economic, ecological, and social aspects of Amazonian logging in a region where the timber industry appeared to have collapsed after stocks of high-value timber were exhausted. We show that forestry in a post-boom phase, currently found in many areas of Amazonia, differs from the better-described \"boom\" period in its scale of operations, in the range of timbers cut, in management practices employed, and in the costs and benefits of production. Results of a seven-year study show that when sawtimber, poles and firewood are produced in a management system that combines forestry and agriculture they can provide significant additional income for Amazonian smallholders.\n      </p>"], "words": {"code": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "four": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "controversial": {"number": 1, "prob":
