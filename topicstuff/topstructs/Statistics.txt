Similar results from Neeman and Chang are also given when X and $theta_0$ are constrained to lie on the sphere in Rp. Results from Ko and Chang on M estimation for spatial models in Euclidean space and the sphere are also discussed. Finally we discuss a regression type model: the image registration problem. We have landmarks ui on one image and corresponding landmarks Vi on a second image. It is desired to bring the two images into closest coincidence through a translation, rotation and scale change. The techniques and principles of this paper are summarized through extensive discussion of an example in three-dimensional image registration and a comparison of the L1 and L2 registrations. Two principles are important when working with spatial statistics: (1) Assumptions, such as that the distribution of X depends only on its distance to \u03b80, introduce symmetries to spatial models which, if properly used, greatly simplify statistical calculations. These symmetries can be expressed in a more general setting by using the notion of statistical group models. (2) When working with a non-Euclidean parameter space \u0398 such as the sphere, techniques of elementary differential geometry can be used to minimize the distortions caused by using a coordinate system to reexpress \u0398 in Euclidean parameters.\n      </p>", "Every five years since 1965 the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences (CBMS), with the support of the National Science Foundation, has conducted a national survey of undergraduate education in the mathematical sciences in the United States.

The statistic is straightforward to compute and equals a quadratic form of the score of the concentrated log-likelihood. It therefore attains its minimal value equal to zero at the maximum likelihood estimator. The statistic has a \u03c7&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; limiting distribution with a degrees of freedom parameter equal to the number of structural parameters. The limiting distribution does not depend on nuisance parameters. The statistic overcomes the deficiencies of the Anderson-Rubin statistic, whose limiting distribution has a degrees of freedom parameter equal to the number of instruments, and the likelihood based, Wald, likelihood ratio, and Lagrange multiplier statistics, whose limiting distributions depend on nuisance parameters. Size and power comparisons reveal that the statistic is a (asymptotic) size-corrected likelihood ratio statistic.

Key developments are: the changing needs of data-users, growing competition, pressure to reduce the survey burden on enterprises, emerging new technologies and methodologies and, first and foremost, the need for more efficiency because of budget cuts. This paper describes how SN, and especially its business statistics, can adapt to these new circumstances. We envisage an optimum situation as one with a single standardised production line for all statistics and a central data repository at its core. This single production line is supported by generic and standardised tools, metadata and workflow management. However, it is clear that such an optimum situation cannot be realised in just a few years. It should be seen as the point on the horizon. Therefore, we also describe the first transformation steps from the product-based stovepipe-oriented statistical process of the past to a more integrated process of the future. A similar modernisation process exists in the area of social statistics. In the near future both systems of business and social statistics are expected to connect at pivotal points and eventually converge on one overall business architecture for SN.

Surprisingly, the statistical education literature offers little guidance on how these evaluations should be conducted.

Normalization of the measured intensities is a prerequisite of such comparisons. However, a fundamental problem in cDNA microarray analysis is the lack of a common standard to compare the expression levels of different samples. Several normalization protocols have been proposed to overcome the variabilities inherent in this technology. We have developed a normalization procedure based on within-array replications via a semilinear in-slide model, which adjusts objectively experimental variations without making critical biological assumptions. The significant analysis of gene expressions is based on a weighted t statistic, which accounts for the heteroscedasticity of the observed log ratios of expressions, and a balanced sign permutation test. We illustrated the use of the techniques in a comparison of the expression profiles of neuroblastoma cells that were stimulated with a growth factor, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). The analysis of expression changes at mRNA levels showed that \u224899 genes were up-regulated and 24 were reduced significantly (P &lt;0.001) in MIF-stimulated neuroblastoma cells. The regulated genes included several oncogenes, growth-related genes, tumor metastatic genes, and immuno-related genes. The findings provide clues as to the molecular mechanisms of MIF-mediated tumor progression and supply therapeutic targets for neuroblastoma treatment.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Mathematics uses precise language and precise statements.

In this paper we derive a class of incomplete generalized L-statistics (IGL-statistics) by taking linear combinations of the ordered elements from a subset of {h(Xi1 , ..., Xim )} with size N(n). A special case is the class of incomplete U-statistics, introduced by Blom. Under very general conditions, the IGL-statistic is asymptotically equivalent to the GL-statistic as soon as N(n)/n \u2192 \u221e as n \u2192 \u221e, which makes the IGL much more computationally feasible. We also discuss various ways of selecting the subset of {h(Xi1 , ..., Xim )}. Several examples are discussed.

Change, however, is not an option; if we do not change, then technology may force change on us in detrimental ways. Understanding how to change requires a broader view of statistics as a human activity with a human purpose that must evolve within a social, or human, system. Considered as a technology, statistics is a fundamental and invaluable part of the infrastructure of other sciences. Statistics advances discoveries in other sciences. Universities and foundations must encourage interdisciplinary research as a primary contribution to our field. Our curricula must reflect modern approaches that other sciences require, and students with quantitative talents must be attracted from other disciplines. Statistics should permeate the mathematics curricula at all elementary and secondary levels, and all children should understand variability and uncertainty, how to make sense from data, and the elements involved in making decisions. In industry, we must capitalize on the importance of quality improvement programs to further contributions of statistics. From government, we need timely and accurate statistics that are relevant to the world of the future as well as to today.

Although this concept has been extensively studied within the domain of low-level sensory coding, there has been limited focus on efficient coding in the field of visual attention. Here we show that spatial patterns of orientation information (\"spatial ensemble statistics\") can be efficiently encoded under conditions of reduced attention. In our task, observers monitored for changes to the spatial pattern of background elements while they were attentively tracking moving objects in the foreground. By using stimuli that enable us to dissociate changes in local structure from changes in the ensemble structure, we found that observers were more sensitive to changes to the background that altered the ensemble structure than to changes that did not alter the ensemble structure. We propose that reducing attention to the background increases the amount of noise in local feature representations, but that spatial ensemble statistics capitalize on structural regularities to overcome this noise by pooling across local measurements, gaining precision in the representation of the ensemble.\n      </p>", "A detailed, multisite evaluation of instructional software designed to help students conceptualize introductory probability and statistics yielded patterns of error on several assessment items.

Misconceptions included interpreting the y-axis on a histogram as if it were a y-axis on a scatter plot and confusing the values a variable might take on by misinterpreting plots of normal probability distributions.
