{"total_words": 1335, "documents": ["This article proposes some physiognomic speculations regarding three visual characteristics of television in its pre-digital-broadcasting form: (1) the importance of the head shot as a staple technique for representing the human figure and, hence, the primacy of the human face as a televisual image; (2) the mirrorlike reflective surface of the cathode-ray tube television screen, which makes the viewer s reflected image appear to emanate from the depths of the television set; and (3) the boxlike design of television sets that turns them into miniature containers of the pictures they show It argues that these three characteristics amounted to an integrated communicative structure that made television a key mechanism for the social construction of humanity in the second half of the twentieth century, a mechanism whose future is uncertain in the age of new digital platforms.\n      </p>", "Survey research has demonstrated that citizens perceive ideological bias in television news, specifically with regard to CNN and Fox News Channel (FNC), which allegedly represent the liberal and conservative viewpoint, respectively. In this paper I argue that attaching the CNN and FNC labels to news stories sends an ideological cue to the viewer regarding the content of the story. Utilizing an experimental design that allows manipulation of the network attribution of actual FNC and CNN content, I am able to demonstrate that the CNN and FNC labels function as ideological signals to the viewer, with this signal being most pronounced among ideologues whose views are supposedly at odds with those attributed to the network.\n      </p>", "Since the mid 1980s, organization theorists have highlighted the emergence of the networked model of organization as a response to global competition and pressures for increased market flexibility. Cultural industries have not been immune from this development. In this paper, we examine the shift from hierarchy to network in the U.K. television industry. We argue that an important result of this disaggregation is the emergence of latent organization, groupings of individuals and teams of individuals that persist through time and are periodically drawn together for recurrent projects by network brokers who either buy in programmes for publisher-broadcasters or who draw together those artists and technicians who actually produce them. In conclusion, we note how latent organizations may become increasingly important for effective cultural industry production, and in particular how they may provide stable points of reference and recurring work projects for those many individuals now working outside of large, vertically integrated producer-broadcasters.\n      </p>", "At the 2006 Oral History Society conference, historian and documentary film producer Steve Humphries spoke about his experiences developing and producing oral history programmes for television over the last twenty-five years. This is an edited transcript of the talk. Humphries outlines the rise and fall (and rise again) of interest in oral history among those who commission television programmes, drawing attention to the role of individual documentary pioneers such as Stephen Peet, whom this event commemorated - as well as the influence of new technology and audience research - in driving some of the major shifts in television history programming. In the process of this overarching narrative he argues that oral history is particularly important for at least three reasons: it provides access to unique stories, although often with a deeper social significance; that it packs considerable emotional power; and finally, as people's history, oral history has been a major force for the democratisation of history on television.\n      </p>", "Mass media, particularly television, influence public conceptions and attitudes toward learning science. The discovery of an original method that does not rely on self-reported viewing habits to measure the impact of television on students' performance in science arose from a study of a unit on electricity in a Physics course. In determining the number of television sets at home and the number of hours of operation, data emerged that allowed an investigation of associations between each of these variables and student performance in physics. A negative impact on performance was found in its consistent decrease as both the number of sets and the time the sets are on increase. These results provide dramatic independent confirmation of the negative impact of television viewing on achievement determined through meta-analysis of many studies, and are also consistent with those in the literature at large, particularly from the Third International Mathematics and Science Study, and the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Furthermore, the totally 'blind' participation of the subjects lends a degree of authenticity rarely found in a classically designed study. The findings impact scientific literacy, since performance in science and conceptions of science and scientists, are all inextricably linked.\n      </p>", "The purpose of this study was to determine the television viewing habits of families during prime time television hours and the perceptions of family members with regard to viewing habits. Twenty-four mother-father-child triads were interviewed individually to determine television viewing patterns over a four-evening period. The children ranged in age from 3 to 6.6 years. A measure of concordance indicated the extent of agreement between family members on co-viewing habits. Both boys and girls were found to be more concordant with their fathers than with their mothers. Age differences were not significant for either sex. In addition, data on and implications of family activities while watching television are reported.\n      </p>", "This study used the content analysis research technique to identify parenting behaviors portrayed in family-oriented, prime-time television programs. The behaviors coded reflected performance of the parental role, child rearing patterns, and children's responses to those roles and patterns. Results indicated that relatively large numbers of parenting behaviors were being shown in the programs viewed. Television fathers were somewhat more active as parents than were mothers and both mothers and fathers were portrayed in traditional ways, even though many more nontraditional than traditional family structures were represented. Television children responded differently to performance of parental roles and to child rearing patterns according to sex of the television parent. Several recommendations were made for parent and family life education and further related research based on the findings.\n      </p>", "Fifty-five parents are interviewed to investigate the interrelationship of family television viewing and family interaction, and to explore the different approaches families take towards television. Correlational analyses reveal that parental attitudes about children's viewing are moderately related to family interaction. Further, variables regarding organization of children's viewing, holding negative attitudes about television, and the number of television sets owned reflect different approaches parents and their families take towards television viewing. Results indicate that educators need to attend to families' attitudes about television, regulation of children's viewing, and family discussions about television to increase their effectiveness when addressing television issues.\n      </p>", "Six studies containing data obtained from over 1 million students in elementary, intermediate, and high school were meta-analyzed to examine the relationship between amount of television viewing and educational achievement. The findings led to the formulation of the complex viewing\u2014achievement model. According to the model, the function relating achievement to viewing can be described as an inverted check mark. For small amounts of viewing, achievement increased with viewing, but as viewing increased beyond a certain point, achievement decreased. That function was found for each of the 3 ages studied, but optimal viewing time\u2014the apex of the function\u2014was different at each age and decreased with the age of the students.\n      </p>", "An examination of television as a center of meaning and as a social context supports the concept of a place without a location. Similar ideas have appeared in media theory since the 1960s, but have not been the subject of geographic research. Comparison of television with other media, including books, radio, and film, reveals that it is uniquely place-like. Television functions as a social context, providing sensory communion and social congregation; it also functions as a center of meaning, helping a society define \"us\" and \"them,\" conferring value on persons and objects, and, possibly, supporting hegemonic social control. A comparison of television and certain architectural structures identifies similarities and differences that may be related to long-term historical changes in society.\n      </p>", "Do global marketing efforts, for example, those using television as a medium, impact on the values and life satisfaction of people, and, if so, is the process similar or different in various regions of the world? We empirically examine the relationship between television viewing, core values (i.e., religiosity and materialism), and perceived well-being factors (e.g., perceived socioeconomic status and relative life satisfaction). Data collected from the Western developed nations (e.g., United States and New Zealand) and several culturally homogeneous regions, including New Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and the Far and Southeast, support the prevalence of diverse consumption-scapes with multiple global consumer cultures, rather than a single global culture. Globalization and advances in technology have not created global norms and homogenized our identities, but behavioral patterns and regional identities that are surprisingly durable. Specifically, materialism was shown to influence perceived socioeconomic status both positively (for two regions) and negatively (for two regions), and relative life satisfaction (except in New Europe), while perceived socioeconomic status had a positive influence on relative life satisfaction (except in New Europe and Latin America). The quantity of television viewing was positively shown to influence materialism, directly in some cases, as well as through perceived realism in others, providing limited support for the cultivation theory effect. Finally, religiosity was shown to play a countervailing role in negatively influencing materialism only in Latin American and Middle Eastern countries, and a positive influence on relative life satisfaction only in Latin America. The rationale behind the differences across regions was also explored. The overall results can perhaps be best explained by \"postmodern\" epistemologies, in which people worldwide are increasingly implicated, and in which new traditions are constantly being invented.\n      </p>", "A model for the prediction and explanation of individual television viewing choice is presented, incorporating considerations of utility, audience flow, and audience segmentation. The proposed model provides a quantifiably explicit theoretical explanation of television viewing choice, and its validation on large-sample network viewing data provides a baseline degree of accuracy against which the performance of future television viewing models may be compared. Of direct relevance to advertising agencies and the television networks is the suitability of the model for estimating the comparative impact of alternative programs on the audience size and composition of competing programs in the immediate and subsequent time slots.\n      </p>", "Only two Amazonian towns were licensed receivers of national Brazilian television in the early 1970s. Today hundreds are, and estimates of unlicensed pirate parabolic antennas run to the tens of thousands. Geographical analysis of Ministry of Communications records indicates that although four commercial networks and one public network have transmitters in the state of Para, 80 percent of towns there can receive only one network, Globo. Further-more, most towns in Para receive Globo's signal directly from the satellite with only national programming and national advertising. Implications of these patterns are suggested.\n      </p>", "The popularity of television and its acceptance into family life are unparalleled in human history. However, family professionals have been complacent regarding their involvement in television education, policy, and research. In this article, some of the factors that have led to these complacent attitudes and responses are identified. The implications of helping families cope with television are discussed and specific suggestions for intervention are identified. Family professionals can begin to help families maximize the potential and minimize the undesirable effects of television by reexamining their perceptions of television and family life.\n      </p>", "Television journalism and modern design share ideals of rationality, objectivity and utility. Both institutions embrace technology in pursuit of speed and machine vision. Both aspire to editorial and technical transparence. This essay examines the development of US television news design in relation to the modernist ethos, focusing on choices to reveal, conceal and symbolize the production apparatus. I argue that the visual vocabulary of television news was established early and remains durable, constituting an 'International Style.' Since this style emerged largely outside design discourse, this article looks to accounts of decision makers, analysing intentions and the resulting forms, especially as they relate to modernist ideals.\n      </p>", "In March 1957, \"Design Magazine\" was to claim that since the immediate post-war years television had played a major role within the assertion of design's economic, social and aesthetic value to 'a wider public than ever before'. This was achieved through the promotion of the importance of 'good design', not only in educational programming, but also in the sets and furniture used within studio backgrounds. From 1946 onwards, the BBC had joined forces with the Council of Industrial Design to assist in the development of a specific policy of design promotion within its early television service. This association developed because it was coherent with the BBC's ambitions to use television, like radio before it, as an instrument of national improvement. This paper provides an account of the, often problematic, alliance that was to emerge between these two bodies, for although brought together by seemingly similar ideologies, they operated from differing criteria. Over the following decade the BBC's approach towards the propagation of 'good design' was to diverge from the Council's suggestions as television began to develop its own identity and attitude towards design.\n      </p>", "Cet article vise \u00e0 montrer comment un objet totalement inconnu devient, en une trentaine d'ann\u00e9es seulement, un objet courant poss\u00e9d\u00e9 par la quasi-totalit\u00e9 des Fran\u00e7ais, et ce que masque cette \u00e9volution.

This trivialization took place in three steps. The 1950s saw the arrival on the stage of television. In spite of its cost and newness, it rapidly became a popular craze. As an extension of known leisure, a public service television was considered a \"right\". Yet its dissemination remained socially and geographically restricted. The small screen became more democratic in the 1960s to become a domestic, daily, and family leisure activity in the great majority of French households. Yet the object is anything but ordinary. An instrument of propaganda by the powerstructure that paid very special attention to its public television, a new medium of mass culture, and an object of consumption, television was harshly criticized by certain elites. The disparities in equipment showed that it was not evenly distributed. This was not the case in the following decade. While it took on \"color\", the television settled massively into the everyday life of almost all households. The place and uses of this ordinary object, especially with the development of new tools such as the remote control and the VCR, differ from one category to another, or even from one individual to another, and qualify the trivial aspect of a good that has become indispensable to some.\n      </p>", "Currently there is not an adequate data base from which it can be asserted that exposure to television food commercials causes children to influence the consumer behavior of their parents. Therefore, Study 1 sought to address this important issue. Study 2, on the other hand, sought to determine whether mothers provide alternative nutritional information while watching television food commercials with their children. Fifty-seven mothers and their children were participants in Study 1. The mother-child pairs were assigned randomly to one of the two experimental conditions or to a control condition. The purchase influencing attempts of the child were recorded in a store created for this investigation. It was found in Study 1 that children assigned to view a cartoon program that contained food advertisements made more bids for the advertised food than did children in a control condition. In Study 2, it was revealed that mothers do not provide competing pieces of nutritional information when they watch television food commercials with their children.\n      </p>", "The article reviews the key question of the effects of television as proposed by Elihu Katz in his introduction and the various responses to it in the contributions to this volume. It argues that the question is a proper concern of sociology, engaged as it is with the politics of the present and immediate, short-term effects. The question of long-term effects, however, is beyond the scope of a social science methodology concerned with the impact of the new. Long-term effects only show up with the passing of time and are the concern of historical studies. As television begins to have a history, it begins to be possible to examine its historical record to try to tease out its long-term impact on the world\u2014so far!\n      </p>", "Recent research holds that new organizational forms emerge from the identity of candidate organizations that enter a domain. In this study we argue that emergence of a new form, which is ultimately based on validation by external audiences, depends on two mechanisms: identity framing, i.e., how audiences perceive and frame the identity of an emerging organizational domain, and identity matching, i.e., the match between the identity of the domain and the identity of candidates. Accordingly, form emergence is best characterized as contextual rather than as an inherent attribute of the categories of candidate organizations. Using data on the U.S. commercial television industry from 1940 to 1960, we explore how entry rates of TV stations were affected by audiences' expectations about the identity of the nascent domain and by the densities of organizations with different origins. We find evidence that focused expectations expressed through public discourse about media, and the number of stations coming from radio broadcasting increased entry rates. We reconcile our findings with existing theory on the emergence of organizational forms by pointing to the joint relevance of domain-related and candidate-related identities.\n      </p>", "This article presents a comparison between two models of publicness (one based on a type of television firmly anchored in the center, another depending on media that blur all distinctions between centers and peripheries) and asks what sort of sharedness do these two models allow? The article also explores the notion of \"monstration.\" Through what sorts of displays do contending media call on public attention? Can one speak of \"acts of showing\" the way one speaks of speech acts? What is the impact of such acts on a sociology of collective attention? Third, the article examines the coexistence between television of the center and new digital media. Is their relation agonistic or, paradoxically, cooperative? The present situation may echo many earlier cases in which old media learned to coexist with new media by starting unexpected dialogues and practicing a division of labor. Todays situation might be a (reluctant) partnership in a multitiered public sphere.\n      </p>", "This article explores the institutional adjustments that have altered the operation of the U.S. television industry over the past twenty years. The author first chronicles those industrial norms that characterized television during its \"network era\" (1952 to mid-1980s) and upon which most ideas about the role of television in society are based. She then explores the ways in which adjustments in technologies, industrial formations, governmental policies, practices of looking, and textual formations have redefined the norms of television in the United States since the mid-1980s. Analysis of the shifts in the institutional and cultural functions of television reveals the articulations between the dominant industrial practices and the forms, texts, and cultural role of the medium. Such a conception of shifts of the medium allows us to understand recent changes as an evolution of this central cultural medium rather than its demise.\n      </p>", "This study provides a historical overview of the development of the instructional television as a tool within the context of science education. The technology was traced from its beginning as experiments in public service broadcasting by universities and television networks, though closed circuit, cable, and commercially produced science-related programming. The use of the technology as a teaching tool is examined in terms of the concept of scientific literacy and the means by which instructional television helped to accomplish the goals of scientific literacy.\n      </p>", "The proliferation of popular television genres in which the public are key participants (talk shows, reality TV, and makeover and lifestyle television) on the surface may seem less to do with engagement and more to do with entertainment and voyeurism. However, this article explores an alternative to the idea that popular television based on personal experience is a marker of the end of television in general and the weakening of the public service tradition in particular. Two programs, Oprah! and Little Angels, are shown to address the agendas of reflexive modernity and governmentality and potentially to contribute to a normative social order based on the project of the self. The fact that both traditional public service providers and commercial channels are engaging with these social issues suggests that new ways of legitimizing television in the public interest are emerging, with implications for the character of public service television.\n      </p>", "Robert Putnam argues that much of the decline in social trust and civic engagement in the United States can be attributed to increased television viewing. People who watch a lot of television are likely to believe that the real world is as \"mean\" as the \"television world,\" and hence withdraw their trust from other people and decline to participate in civic affairs. Using data from the GSS and other surveys, I show that it is not television that makes people less trusting, but optimism for the future that makes people more trusting. When measures of optimism were used as determinants of trust in the estimation of a simultaneous equation model, the effects of television vanished. There is no support for the argument that television makes us less trusting because of the content of the shows we watch, or for the argument that television makes us withdraw from civic engagement because of the amount of time consumed by viewing. In addition, no evidence for specific cohort effects was found.\n      </p>", "This article addresses the power of popular geographical 'imaginations' and 'knowledges' to foreclose public debate and, in the process, to reinforce often contentious policies or practices. It argues that historically, a prominent example of such a powerful geographical knowledge has been that of 'overpopulation'. The concept of 'underpopulation', meanwhile, has been much less discussed, but in this article I argue that it, too, needs to be queried in much the same way that critics have examined claims of overpopulation. I make this case first at a generic level, describing some of the main situations in which notions of underpopulation are popularly invoked, before substantiating it in much greater detail in one specific context: that of the television economy in New Zealand, a country, it is frequently said, with 'too few people' to support a publicly funded broadcaster. I show that in this particular instance the underpopulation thesis is backed by flawed arguments, but that none the less it is widely accepted and seldom countered, hence serving to protect its protagonists from disclosing in public debate the real reasons for the television policies they pursue and which the idea of underpopulation actively allows.\n      </p>", "Television has been extensively used to communicate health messages for over a decade in Egypt. Viewers of the evening soap operas have been seeing six commercials for family planning, oral rehydration solution (ORS), and immunizations. People of all social classes can sing the jingles of the most popular ads. The producers of these health spots use increasingly sophisticated story lines, settings, and characters representing rural peasants, played by popular and well-liked actors. Evaluation of the content and impact of these messages has lagged behind the creative sophistication of their production. This article reviews the context and content of televised health messages in Egypt during the 1980s, critically assesses the evaluation of mass media health education, and suggests strategies for more effective evaluation. The author worked for some years with a private donor agency that funded the production of a number of televised health commercials in Egypt.\n      </p>", "This article consists of textual analysis of a highly successful television series, Inspector Morse, combined with qualitative audience study. The study of Morse and the fan culture surrounding it is presented in the context of a discussion of recent feminist work on the texts and audiences of popular culture. The textual analysis focuses on those elements of the programmes which contribute to its success as 'quality' television, and particularly on Morse as an example of the role played by nostalgic representations of Englishness in 'quality' media texts of the 1980s. The article goes on to discuss whether the presence of such representations in these programmes leads inevitably to a convergence of 'quality' and conservative ideology. The discussion of the ideological subtexts of the programmes then focuses on the area of gender representation, and on the extent to which feminist influences are discernible in this example of quality popular culture, particularly in its representations of masculinity. The second part of the article presents an analysis of a discussion group involving fans of the series, which was organized as part of a larger qualitative study of the fan culture surrounding the programmes. There is a detailed discussion of the impact of the social dynamics of the group on their readings of Morse. The analysis also focuses on the ways in which the discourses identified in the textual analysis, such as gender representation, quality and Englishness, are mobilized in talk about the programmes. Finally, the nature of the group made it possible to discuss the construction of a feminist subcultural identity in talk about a mainstream media text, and to identify irony and critical distance as key components of that identity, particularly in the discussion of the pleasures offered by the romance narratives of the programmes.\n      </p>", "Overweight and obesity among American children has reached epidemic proportions. More than 9 million youth between the ages of six and nineteen years are considered overweight, and more than 80 percent of overweight adolescents will go on to become obese adults. Research has indicated a wide range of factors believed to contribute to obesity among children, but of growing concern is the potential contribution made by children's media use. In April 2006, an expert panel meeting was convened to meet and address children, television viewing, and weight status. This article reviews the evidence discussed at this meeting about the role that media, specifically television, play in the prevalence of overweight among children. It lays out the panel member's conclusions about the most promising strategies for reducing the negative effects of television on children's weight status and makes recommendations for future research that is needed to fully understand the relationship.\n      </p>", "The golden age of television news gave a large majority of otherwise diverse Americans a unified, seamless, and clear-cut image of their nation, its central players, and its agenda. Carefully scheduled, edited, sequenced, and branded, heard and seen simultaneously across America, it provided a pretense of order to the chaos that is news. The permanence and stability of the nation, as expressed in a complex way by TV news, provided Americans with an all-important sense of existential security experienced on an unarticulated emotional level. Today, a disjointed news environment is crushing the nature of network news as a transitional object. Television news no longer reassures viewers by connecting them to a surmountable world out there but carries them on a loop from themselves to themselves.\n      </p>", "This article analyzes the broadcast activities of the Chicago Sunday Evening Club (CSEC), a mainline Protestant organization founded in 1908 and still active today. The CSEC began broadcasting its weekly meetings on the radio in 1922 and on television in 1956. Drawing on archival organizational records from the CSEC and from listener correspondence, this essay traces how the club\u2019s use of the new media of particular historical moments shaped its history as a public entity.\n         This study makes two claims. First, it argues that, though evangelicals and fundamentalists took to radio and television broadcasting with greater vigor, mainline Protestant groups did as well, and the persistence of a group like the CSEC offers a way to understand the challenges that broadcasting presented to religious organizations. Second, this article shows how audience expectations for religious programming evolved from radio to television. For many listeners, radio offered what they told the CSEC was a spiritual and even miraculous experience, and they marveled at being able to tune in to religious services from their homes. Television, however, prompted remarks often focused on visual style, and the club found itself struggling to compete with the newly emerging group of religious television programs not only on denominational terms (many were evangelicals and fundamentalists) but also on aesthetic terms. In contrast to radio, as many viewers wrote to the CSEC, television seemed to provide not a singular \u201cexperience\u201d but rather spectatorial access to events taking place elsewhere. In the context of competition from the more telegenic programming of evangelicals and fundamentalists, these shifting audience expectations shaped both the history of the CSEC as a public entity and the broader history of mainline Protestantism in the mass media.\n      </p>", "Seeking to extend the scope of current audience measurement methods, this paper qualitatively investigates audiences' relationships with television programs. A content analysis of viewers' discourse from focus groups, Internet \" fan forums\" and five phenomenological interviews suggests a construct we label \" connectedness.\" Transcending involvement, audience connectedness defines intense relationships between the audience and a television program that extend beyond the television watching experience into individuals' personal and social lives. Highly connected audiences were found to be more susceptible to the consumption images presented in television programs, hence illustrating the moderating effect of connectedness on television influence. Implications for audience measurement methods and marketing efforts are discussed.\n      </p>", "The purpose of this paper is to report on qualitative research into the role of television soap opera as a resource employed by teenagers in identity work. The central methodological strategy has been to enable young people to do the research themselves. Twenty groups of young people (aged 14-15) were recruited to talk about soap opera without an adult presence. The stress in the paper is on the formative nature of language in lending form to ourselves from the disorderly flow of everyday talk and practice. I argue that the girls construct reflexive identities in two grammatical forms. Identities are instanciated in the flow of language as well as in the self-narrative of 'I'. I am centrally concerned with the production of multiple, hybrid identities amongst British Asian girls. They see themselves as Asian yet distance themselves from aspects of tradition by virtue of their participation in other domains of British culture. They are both in and out of British society and Asian culture. These identities are complicated by gender relations so that ethnic and gender identities 'cross-cut or dislocate each other'.\n      </p>", "This paper, motivated by the experiences of a major U.S.-based broadcast television network, presents algorithms and heuristics to schedule commercial videotapes. Major advertisers purchase several slots to air commercials during a given time period on a broadcast network. We study the problem of scheduling advertiser's commercials in the slots it purchased when the same commercial is to be aired multiple times. Under such a situation, the advertisers typically want the airings of a commercial to be as evenly spaced as possible. Thus, our objective is to schedule a set of commercials in a set of available slots such that multiple airings of the same commercial are as evenly spaced as possible. A natural formulation of this problem is a mixed-integer program that can be solved using third-party solvers. We also develop a branch-and-bound algorithm based on a problem-specific bounding scheme. Both approaches fail to solve larger problem instances within a reasonable time frame. We present an alternative mixed-integer program that lends itself to an efficient solution. For solving even larger problems, we present multiple heuristics.\n      </p>", "This paper introduces SPOT (Scheduling Programs Optimally for Television), an analytical model for optimal prime-time TV program scheduling. Due in part to the advent of new cable TV channels, the competition for viewer ratings has intensified substantially in recent years, and the revenues of the major networks have not kept pace with the costs of the programs. As profit margins decrease, the networks seek to improve their viewer ratings with innovative scheduling strategies. Our SPOT models for scheduling network programs combine predicted ratings for different combinations of prime-time schedules with a novel, mixed-integer, generalized network-based flow, mathematical programming model, which when solved provides an optimal schedule. In addition to historical performance, subjective inputs from actual network managers were used as input to the network flow optimization model. The optimization model is flexible. It can utilize the managers' input and maximize profit (instead of ratings) by considering not only the revenue potential but also the costs of the shows. Moreover, SPOT can describe the scheduling problem over any time period (e.g., day, week, month, season), and designate certain shows to, and restrict them from, given time slots. The methodology of SPOT is illustrated using data for the first quarter of 1990, obtained from a cable network. The optimization model produces solutions that would have generated an increase of approximately 2% in overall profitability, representing over $6 million annually for the cable network. SPOT not only produces more profitable TV schedules for this network, but also provides valuable general insights into the development of mixed programming strategies for improving future schedules.\n      </p>", "The quintessential image of the television audience is of the family viewing at home\u2014sitting together comfortably in front of the lively set. Accompanying this happy image is its negative\u2014a child viewing alone while real life goes on elsewhere. This article reviews evidence over five decades regarding the changing place of television in children's lives. It argues that, notwithstanding postwar trends that have significantly changed adolescence, the family home, and wider consumer society, there was time for the 1950s family experiment to spawn the 1960s and 1970s family television experiment, thereby shaping normative expectations\u2014academic, policy, and popular\u2014regarding television audiences for years to come. At the turn of the twenty-first century, we must recognize that it was the underlying long-term trend of individualization, and its associated trends of consumerism, globalization, and democratization, that, historically and now, more profoundly frame the place of television in the family.\n      </p>", "The rise of mass television allowed hundreds of millions of people to closely watch other people and places on a regular basis, anonymously and from afar. Television watching altered the balance of what different types of people knew about each other and relative to each other, blurred the dividing line between public and private behaviors, and weakened the link between physical location and access to social experience. In these ways, television contributed to the reshuffling of previously taken-for-granted reciprocal social roles, including those related to age, gender, and authority. In cultivating its viewers into the normalcy of the acts of watching and of being watched, television experience also stimulated the widespread use of more recent interactive visual media, including the displays of self on social networking sites. Moreover, familiarity with television as a watching machine has fostered the otherwise surprising level of tolerance for increasingly pervasive government, corporate, and populace surveillance.\n      </p>", "Strong movements in both education research and education reform are emphasizing that teaching should encourage student activity rather than simply aim knowledge in the general direction of a student audience. Yet video, at least in its traditional technological forms, is passive. How can teachers make effective use of an apparently ineffective medium? What role can video best play in new multimedia instructional systems? This article reviews research on learning through television in order to make practical suggestions. Specific examples use two widely distributed series, Against All Odds: Inside Statistics and Statistics: Decisions Through Data.\n      </p>", "Research on the influence of negative political advertising in America is characterized by fundamentally conflicting findings. In recent years, however, survey research using estimates of exposure based on a combination of self-reported television viewing habits and Campaign Media Analysis Group data (a database of all advertisements broadcast on national and cable television in the top 75 media markets) has argued that exposure to negative political advertising boosts interest in the campaign and turnout. This paper examines the measurement properties of self-reports of television viewing. I argue that the errors from common survey formats may both be nonrandom and larger than previously acknowledged. The nonrandom error is due to the tendency of politically knowledgeable individuals to be more sensitive to question format. Thus the inferences drawn about the relationship between political knowledge, exposure to negative ads, and political behavior are also sensitive to the measures used to estimate exposure. I demonstrate, however, that one commonly used measure of exposure\u2014the log of estimated exposure\u2014is not only more theoretically defensible but also alleviates some of the more serious problems due to measurement error.\n      </p>", "This article explores the impact of structural and technological change on women's employment in the UK television industry. It looks at the challenges faced by women in working in what has become since the mid-1980s a largely freelance industry where short-term contracts, informal recruitment procedures and long, unpredictable work schedules mean that women find it increasingly difficult to combine a career and family. Through case studies of individual careers, of a women's magazine programme for S4C Digital and a survey of women's credits on a selection of the newer channels (Sky One, UK Living and Channel 5), it argues that technological advances in digital transmission and production will not improve working conditions and opportunities for women's participation in all areas of the industry if they continue to replicate existing practice.\n      </p>", "Design in general, and costume design in particular, is an under-explored component of the television drama series, even in such cases as the long-running science-fiction melodrama \"Dr. Who\", where spectacular and memorable images are the norm. Writers on television series have tended either to exclude design from their purview altogether, concentrating on ideological analysis of narrative, or to interpret design simply as a function of the series' ideology. Either way, there is no allowance for the purely visual considerations which June Hudson, sometime principal costume designer on \"Dr. Who\", claims to be central to her design choices. The costume of the principal character in a television series can come to 'stand in' for a television series as a whole, and can even affect the way in which the series' narrative-cum-ideological framework is shaped. The costume designer should, therefore, be understood as occupying an important position in the complex 'authorship' process of a television series. These various contentions are explored in this essay with special reference to June Hudson's designs for \"Dr. Who\", notably the 1979 episode 'The Creature from the Pit'.\n      </p>", "When making product choices, consumers are influenced by the preferences of other consumers, such as family members, friends, neighbors, and colleagues. Preference interdependence among family members is likely to be significant because of cohabitation and strong emotional ties. To estimate the preference interdependence, we specify a simultaneous equation model and propose a Bayesian estimation approach. Unlike existing models that use a spatial autoregressive structure to capture the interdependence of consumer preferences, we are able to estimate the potential asymmetry in the preference interdependence among family members in a more flexible way. In a simulation study, we show that models that ignore interdependence of preferences yield biased estimates of consumers' sensitivity to observed attribute preferences. In an empirical application, we estimate the interdependence of the viewership of television programs between husbands and wives in 481 households. We find that wives' viewing behavior depends more strongly on their husbands' viewing behavior than husbands' viewing behavior depends on their wives' viewing behavior. There exist significant differences in parameter estimates of dependence across categories of television programs. Differences in levels of spousal interdependence across households are partially explained by the age and the education level of the spouses.\n      </p>", "L'introduction de la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision par satellite en Alg\u00e9rie a \u00e9t\u00e9 un \u00e9v\u00e9nement majeur.

It reinforces, among other things, the critiques that Algerians address with respect to Algerian television and to political and public affairs. Although satellite television does not represent in itself the changes that characterise contemporary Algerian society, it highlights some of the signs of these changes, notably the transformations occurring in gender relations. Other issues are also raised by satellite television such as the nature of public space, the sociability as well as the identifications and the formation of identities. Indeed, how does satellite television affect common spaces, such as those of neighborhood, home and family, as well as social actors, men and women? What do the effects of the practices implied by satellite television have on the signification of the political in a society that did not experience democracy?\n      </p>", "I sought to confirm that partners in close relationships \"do gender\" (West &amp; Zimmerman, 1987) and exercise power (Komter, 1989) even in their ordinary everyday behavior and specifically in their selection of television programming via a remote control device (RCD). Individuals in 36 couples (86% heterosexual, 14% gay or lesbian) were interviewed. Men in heterosexual couples use and control the RCD more than women, and their partners find RCD use more frustrating than they do. Heterosexual women also are less able than men to get their partners to watch a desired show. The results confirm that couples create and strengthen stereotypical notions of gender through the exercise of power, even in the mundane, joint, leisure activity of watching television.\n      </p>", "Early television shows that focused on Los Angeles as subject, such as The City at Night (KTLA) and Jack Linkletter's On the Go (CBS), assured white, middle-class, suburban viewers that they had a place in the larger metropolis by presenting a selective knowledge of its features and issues. On the Go surpassed the entertainment level of The City at Night to address some serious social issues. By the mid-sixties, suburbanization had been fully embraced as the \"good life.\" Shows such as Ralph Story's Los Angeles (KNXT), instead of engaging suburban viewers in metropolitan issues, entertained them with glimpses of the city's \"oddities.\" The change in tone marked the passing of the center of cultural identity from the central city to the suburbs.\n      </p>", "Research on racial-ethnic portrayals in television crime news is limited and questions remain about the sources of representations and how these vary for perpetrators versus victims. We draw from power structure, market share, normal crimes, racial threat, and racial privileging perspectives to further this research. The reported race or ethnicity of violent crime perpetrators and victims are modeled as functions of: (1) situational characteristics of crime stories and (2) contextual characteristics of television market areas. The primary data are from a stratified random sample of television newscasts in 2002\u20132003 (Long et al. 2005). An important innovation of our work is the use of a national, more generalizeable, sample of local news stories than prior researchers who tended to focus on single market areas. Results indicate that both the context of the story itself and the social structural context within which news stories are reported are relevant to ethnic and racial portrayals in crime news. We find limited support for power structure, market share, normal crimes, and racial threat explanations of patterns of reporting. Racial privileging arguments receive more extensive support.\n      </p>", "The television \"talk show\" is increasingly becoming a forum for the dissemination of family knowledge to the lay public. This study examines the behavior of professional and lay family experts on one of the more popular television talk shows. The results indicate that neither professional nor lay experts use generally accepted standards of scholarship when communicating family knowledge to the television audience. The need for the development of specific standards of scholarship for the family experts who appear on television, as well as the desirability of educating the public and the producers of television talk shows with regard to these standards, are discussed.\n      </p>", "Exposure to radio frequency (RF) nonionizing radiation from telecommunications is pervasive in modern society. Elevated disease risks have been observed in some populations exposed to radio and television transmissions, although findings are inconsistent. This study quantified RF exposures among 280 residents living near the broadcasting transmitters for Denver, Colorado. RF power densities outside and inside each residence were obtained, and a global positioning system (GPS) identified geographic coordinates and elevations. A viewshed model within a geographic information system (GIS) characterized the average distance and percentage of transmitters visible from each residence. Data were collected at the beginning and end of a 2.5-day period, and some measurements were repeated 8-29 months later. RF levels logged at 1-min intervals for 2.5 days varied considerably among some homes and were quite similar among others. The greatest differences appeared among homes within 1 km of the transmitters. Overall, there were no differences in mean residential RF levels compared over 2.5 days. However, after a 1- to 2-year follow-up, only 25% of exterior and 38% of interior RF measurements were unchanged. Increasing proximity, elevation, and line-of-sight visibility were each associated with elevated RF exposures. At average distances from &gt; 1-3 km, exterior RF measurements were 13-30 times greater among homes that had &gt; 50% of the transmitters visible compared with homes with \u2264 50% visibility at those distances. This study demonstrated that both spatial and temporal factors contribute to residential RF exposure and that GPS/GIS technologies can improve RF exposure assessment and reduce exposure misclassification.\n      </p>", "The paper presents data from a Tunisian village that was visited twice for statistical purpose and for interviews. The aim was to examine the influences of television on social structures. This paper discusses the possibility that television, as it consumes time and has its effects in small rooms only, focuses attention on the family, thus weakening the importance of reciprocity, so typical of traditional village life. Moreover, it seems that reciprocity does not work so well with television, as invitations to watch television cannot be reciprocated, if the invited family does not possess a television set. Furthermore, a return invitation to watch television is difficult because television is typically limited to small rooms only. Thus, the obligation to share is replaced by structures of possession and property, at least in the context of television.\n      </p>", "Paralleling research on the effects of television on cognitions regarding violence, this study examines the effects of television on perceptions of the extent of affluence in the United States. Television's frequent portrayal of America as a highly affluent society suggests that perceptions of affluence are positively related both to amount of television viewing and to perceived veracity of television, and that the effects of television viewing are strongest among persons who attribute the greatest veracity to television's depiction of American life. An analysis of survey data provides little support for these hypotheses. Although moderately strong positive relationships exist between affluence perceptions and both amount of television viewing and perceived veracity of television, these zero-order relationships are spurious associations accounted for by class-related variables, especially education.\n      </p>", "One of the first American labor unions to make significant use of the television medium was Transport Workers Union Local 100, based in New York.

The extensive TWU collection at the Tamiment Library/Robert F.

Furthermore, the ideological components of international relations seem to grow in importance. On the basis of empirical data from 1973 and 1983, this article analyzes the amount, nature and trends of the present international flow of television programs as part of these processes. The survey was carried out in more than 50 countries around the world. The trends discovered in 1983 seem to repeat the 1973 patterns of a one-way traffic from a few exporting countries to the rest of the world and the dominance of entertainment. However, important regional developments also seem to have occurred, for example, in Latin America and the Arab countries. In Europe, the regional process of integration has strengthened arguments for improving European programming. The American influence, however, remains strong in Europe too, with some 12% of the total western European output being US programs. The eastern European countries seem to import more western programming than vice versa. The United States imports relatively fewer foreign programs than any other country. Only 1% to 2% of US broadcast time is composed of imported programs, although there are local exceptions. The issue of communication policy and cultural identity seems to remain strong both in the Third World and in such areas as Europe or Canada. /// La globalisation et la r\u00e9gionalisation marquent aujourd'hui la vie et la politique internationales.

Using the 1995 DDB Needham life style study, analysis of the model permitted an examination of the strength and direction of the causal relationships driving the \"virtuous circle\" of participation and trust; the demographic, situational/contextual, orientational, and attitudinal factors that are exogenous to these latent variables; and the linkage between these components of social capital and viewing preferences for specific television genres. The results indicate that (1) the direction of the linkage between civic engagement and interpersonal trust is mainly from participating to trusting; and (2) television viewing plays a conditional role in the production of social capital that is dependent on the use of particular genres.\n      </p>", "Juxtaposing televised news coverage of the 1968 student movements and Olympics in Mexico City, the author examines the mass media's role during this politically volatile year for the country and the world. Through an analysis of news scripts located in Televisa's news archive, the article demonstrates that news executives and government officials pursued a similar goal\u2014to portray the country as modern, orderly, and peaceful.

They emphasize the dependence on (1) an individual rather than an institutional level of analysis; (2) a model of research utilization that pays little explicit attention to where sources of leverage lie for changes in programming; (3) extremely simple models of the selection processes associated with different levels of television viewing; and (4) uncritical appraisals of the consequences of effects that many would call small or modest. These issues are illustrated by a general discussion of the NIMH report on Television and Behavior and specific discussion of \"mainstreaming\" and the effects of television violence. In 1972, POQ's editors invited Leo Bogart to prepare an extended review article of the Surgeon-General's Study of Television and Social Behavior (POQ 36:491-521). Whe the 10-year follow-up study was released by NIMH in 1982, the editors asked Thomas D. Cook, a distinguished psychologist noted for his research on television, to perform the same function.\n      </p>", "This article reports on the findings of a systematic review-incorporating meta-analytic techniques-of the available research evidence on the effects of closed-circuit television (CCTV) on crime in public space. A number of targeted and comprehensive searches of the published and unpublished literature and contacts with leading researchers produced twenty-two CCTV evaluations that met our criteria for inclusion in this review. CCTV had a significant desirable effect on crime, although the overall reduction in crime was a rather small 4 percent. All nine studies showing evidence of a desirable effect of CCTV on crime were carried out in the United Kingdom. Conversely, the other nine studies showing no evidence of any desirable effect of CCTV on crime included all five North American studies. CCTV was most effective in reducing crime in car parks. It had no effect on violent crimes but had a significant desirable effect on vehicle crimes.\n      </p>", "Children's television advertising is rapidly becoming a major concern to government agencies, citizens' groups and researchers in many areas of the social sciences. To this point there has been little integration of research efforts.

Merger may have bargaining effects in addition to the usual efficiency effects. The effect of merger on the buyers' bargaining position depends on the curvature of the supplier's gross surplus function: merger enhances (worsens) the buyers' bargaining position if the function is concave (convex). Based on a panel of advertising revenue in the cable television industry, our estimates indicate that the gross surplus function for suppliers of program services is convex. This result suggests that cable operators integrate horizontally to realize efficiency gains rather than to enhance their bargaining position vis-a-vis program suppliers.\n      </p>", "We advance several theoretical reasons for arguing that expansion in television viewership may have contributed to the recent escalation in the U.S. budget deficit. We then develop a multivariate model to test the validity of the hypothesis using alternative measures of television viewership. The empirical results could not reject our contention that the fast evolution of the U.S. television viewership since the early 1970s has significantly contributed to the escalating size of the federal budget deficit over and above the effects of several other possible macro determinants. This evidence provides some support to the claim that there exists a \"liberal\" bias within the media (particularly television) that undermines fiscal conservatism. Therefore, it appears advisable for policy-makers to take into account the role of television if they aspire to understand and ultimately control the mounting federal budget deficit.\n      </p>", "Despite a growing literature on the production and reproduction of linguistic inequality in mass media, we know little about how individuals experience such sociolinguistic marginalization. To fill this gap, this study examines a monolingual Taiwanese elderly woman's experiences of television viewing. In the context of language shift in Taiwan after 40 years of Mandarin-only policy, language hierarchy persists despite the current policy of multilingualism. Although the subject does not understand the referential meaning of most shows because of language barriers, she recognizes socially indexical meanings about the ranking of languages and how she is positioned and excluded. The unequal participant structure in the dynamic interactions between two overlapping communicative events of television viewing and family discussions of the shows doubly marginalizes her. This study demonstrates how the choice of linguistic code in television programming conveys meaning and structures participation frameworks that engage minority monolingual individuals in dialogic processes of identity construction.\n      </p>", "The subject of this article is the Israeli television program Such a Life, which was broadcast on the Israel Broadcasting Authority's Channel One between 1972 and 2001. The program, based on a protagonist's life and told through a surprise studio encounter with his or her family, friends, and colleagues, was the Israeli version of the earlier U.S. and British television programs This Is Your Life. But where the U.S. and the U.K. programs focused on sentiment and entertainment, the Israeli counterpart emphasized memory and education, in a conscious effort to contribute to the formation of the national memory. The first part of the article describes the history of Such a Life from its inception to its end, and the second part constitutes a structural analysis of the production process and the broadcast episodes, to explain how its image of the Israeli past was cobbled together.

In particular, stable, vertically integrated organizations are being challenged by those drawing together resources in unique, 'flexibly specialised' webs or 'networks'. Some analysts suggest that the growth of network organizations marks a major 'industrial divide' and that, with the decomposition of mass markets, organizations based upon the principles of economies of scale are no longer viable. This paper questions the interpretation of the flexible specialization thesis as a production paradigm via an examination of the UK television industry. In particular, the diversity of emerging organizational forms in UK television is explored by presenting flexible specialization as a 'mode of production' which can manifest itself in a diversity of organizational models. As a result of such analysis, it is concluded that emergent forms of organization in television are not subject to any one particular categorization, and indeed that to search for a dominant production paradigm is counter-productive. Der zunehmende Wettbewerbsdruck zwingt den Unternehmen in vielen Branchen immer flexiblere Organisationsformen auf. Besonders vertikal integrierte Organisationen sp\u00fcren den Konkurrenzdruck jener Unternehmen, die ihre Ressourcen in einzigartigen, \"flexibel spezialisierten\" Netzwerken organisiert haben.

What is the effect of such news presentation on the complexity with which viewers think about the political issues raised in the stories? Social-psychological research on the effects of schema activation (Milburn, 1987; Milburn &amp; Fay-Dumaine, 1988) indicates that such activation may reduce individuals' cognitive complexity. To test the effect of the dramatic presentation of television news, dramatic news stories were taped and edited to remove the highly dramatic scenes. The edited and nonedited stories were then presented to subjects, and subjects' recall and cognitive complexity were measured. We found that, controlling for various background differences, exposure to the dramatic news stories significantly decreased subjects' recall of the information in the stories and reduced the complexity with which individuals thought about the events reported. The results raise important concerns about the contribution of the news to the public's information level and political sophistication.\n      </p>", "In this article, I focus on the ways in which audiences in the Amazonian community of Gurup\u00e1 respond to television's interpellation for pan-national identity.

While the family environment is known to influence television watching, little is known about the influence of the neighbourhood environment. This study is an exploratory examination of the association of socioeconomic characteristics of the neighbourhood environment with television watching among 9-10 year old girls. Methods: Data collected by the Berkeley site of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Growth and Health Study (NGHS) in 1987-8 from 787 girls who had a complete set of measurements relevant to the analysis were used. These measures included parental education, household income, race and weekly hours spent watching television. Addresses of the girls were geocoded and the median household income for the census tracts in which they lived was used to indicate neighbourhood socioeconomic characteristics. Multilevel modelling procedures were used to estimate fixed effect coefficients for individual and neighbourhood level variables. Results: Living in high income areas was associated with less television watching, a finding that held even when controlling for parental education, household income and race. Race and parental education were also associated with television watching. Conclusion: Television watching among girls was associated not only with the socioeconomic characteristics of their households, but also of their neighbourhoods. Future studies should explore the mechanisms that mediate this relation and determine if these results are generalisable to other populations.\n      </p>", "The extraordinary challenges facing Canadian film and television producers represent both advantages and disadvantages in today's market.

Specifically, to explore who decides when to include tobacco in a project; how that decision is made; what issues are considered; what messages are intended; whether and how the issue of secondhand smoke is considered; and what advocacy methods might be useful in influencing future decisions about tobacco portrayal. Design: Qualitative in-depth interviews of entertainment industry personnel, with a semi-structured interview protocol to guide the interview. Subjects: 54 subjects drawn from a convenience sample of writers, actors, directors, producers, studio executives, and others involved in the film industry. Results: Hollywood is heterogeneous with varying perspectives on rates of tobacco use portrayal; intentionality of the decision to use and the necessity to portray tobacco use; and its degree of acceptance of responsibility for influencing societal smoking. Tobacco depiction may originate with the writer, actor, or director and is included most frequently to elucidate character or portray reality. On-camera smoking is influenced by actors' off-camera tobacco use. Conclusions: The research presented can help advocates better understand the norms and values of those working within the entertainment industry and thereby assist them in creating more effective change strategies.\n      </p>", "Ideally, a media system suitable for a democracy ought to provide its readers with some coherent sense of the broader social forces that affect the conditions of their everyday lives. It is difficult to find anyone who would claim that media discourse in the United States even remotely approaches this ideal. The overwhelming conclusion is that the media generally operate in ways that promote apathy, cynicism, and quiescence, rather than active citizenship and participation. Furthermore, all the trends seem to be in the wrong direction--toward more and more messages, from fewer and bigger producers, saying less and less. That's the bad news. The good news is that the messages provide a many-voiced, open text that can and often is read oppositionally, at least in part. Television imagery is a site of struggle where the powers that be are often forced to compete and defend what they would prefer to have taken for granted. The underdetermined nature of media discourse allows plenty of room for challengers such as social movements to offer competing constructions of reality and to find support for them from readers whose daily lives may lead them to construct meaning in ways that go beyond media imagery.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Experiences of the Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle in hydrogen sulfide corrosion of the wastewater system are cited.

Design: Observational study. Subjects: 64 episodes of three major British television medical dramas: Casualty, Cardiac Arrest, and Medics. Main outcome measures: Frequency of cardiopulmonary resuscitation shown on television; age, sex, and diagnosis of the patients undergoing resuscitation; rate of survival through resuscitation. Results: Overall 52 patients had a cardiorespiratory arrest on screen and 3 had a respiratory arrest alone, all the arrests occurring in 40 of the 64 episodes. Of the 52 patients having cardiorespiratory arrest, 32 (62%) underwent an attempt at cardiopulmonary resuscitation; 8 attempts were successful. All 3 of the patients having respiratory arrests alone received ventilatory support and survived. On 48% of occasions, victims of cardiac arrest seemed to be less than 35 years old. Conclusions: Cardiorespiratory resuscitation is often depicted in British television medical dramas. Patients portrayed receiving resuscitation are likely to be in a younger age group than in real life. Though the reasons for resuscitation are more varied and more often associated with trauma than in reality, the overall success rate is nevertheless realistic. Widespread overoptimism of patients for survival after resuscitation cannot necessarily be blamed on British television medical dramas.\n      </p>", "r />\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(128, 0, 0);\">EDITORS</span></p>\nMary Frances Luce \n<br />\nAnn L.

This application of contingent valuation to estimate cultural benefits offers an insight on the potential for a wider application of the methodology to evaluate cultural policy instruments.

The primary goal of the study was to determine the long-term relations between preschool television viewing and adolescent achievement, behavior, and attitudes. Using a telephone interview and high school transcripts, we assessed adolescent media use; grades in English, science, and math; leisure reading; creativity; aggression; participation in extracurricular activities; use of alcohol and cigarettes; and self-image. In each domain, we tested theories emphasizing the causal role of television content (e.g., social learning, information processing) as contrasted with those theories positing effects of television as a medium, irrespective of content (e.g., time displacement, pacing, interference with language). The results provided much stronger support for content-based hypotheses than for theories emphasizing television as a medium; moreover, the patterns differed for boys and girls. Viewing educational programs as preschoolers was associated with higher grades, reading more books, placing more value on achievement, greater creativity, and less aggression. These associations were more consistent for boys than for girls. By contrast, the girls who were more frequent preschool viewers of violent programs had lower grades than those who were infrequent viewers. These associations held true after taking into account family background, other categories of preschool viewing, and adolescent media use. One hypothesis accounting for the sex differences is that early experiences, such as television viewing, have greater effects when they counteract normative developmental trends and predominant sex-typed socialization influences than when they reinforce them. Adolescents in the study used both television and print media to support ongoing interests. Television content (e.g., entertainment, sports, or world events) predicted extracurricular activities, role models, and body image. The only evidence for possible effects of television as a medium was the positive relation of total viewing to obesity for girls. The medium of television is not homogeneous or monolithic, and content viewed is more important than raw amount. The medium is not the message: The message is.\n      </p>", "In this article, Kristin Roth-Ey explores the complex and often convoluted reception of television technology in the USSR of the 1950s and 1960s. Television held out the potential to fulfill the long-standing dream of a universal Soviet culture--propaganda, art, and science delivered directly to every home--and it offered a compelling symbol of a modern Soviet \"way of life\" in a Cold War context as well. Soviet consumers and technological enthusiasts embraced the new medium with gusto and played an important role in its promotion. As Roth-Ey elucidates, however, the nature of television production and consumption--and, in particular, the Soviets' decision to promote a home-based broadcasting system--put television in implicit conflict with important Soviet traditions, ideals, and, at times, interest groups. The development of the mature form of centralized Soviet television symbolized by Moscow's Ostankino complex is the story of how political and cultural elites, consumers, and the Soviet system in an abstract sense struggled to make a \"home\" for television technology in the USSR.\n      </p>", "This article discusses how the seemingly contradictory construction of many early television comedy stars bespeaks rather coherent symbolic constructions of ethnicity, masculinity, and anxieties over the changing demographics of the American cultural landscape.\n      </p>", "Analysis of early time-diary studies suggests that television has had more impact on daily time than any other household technology in the past century. In the United States, viewing time has steadily increased from roughly ten weekly hours in the 1960s to sixteen hours today, encompassing almost half of all \"free time\" reported in the diaries. A prominent recent TV casualty has been time spent reading the newspaper, providing further support for the functional equivalence argument. This article shows that, so far at least, viewing time seems little affected by the Internet and other recent new technologies. Studies of the publics satisfaction with various activities suggest that viewers find TV to be more enjoyable in the doing rather than in general, even though it may not be particularly challenging or demanding of concentration. Viewing time is also shown to be significantly related to long-term personal unhappiness.\n      </p>", "This article reflects upon the ways television changed the political landscape and considers how far new media, such as the Internet, are displacing television or reconfiguring the political communications ecology. The analysis explores opportunities and challenges facing media producers, politicians, and citizens. The authors conclude by suggesting that the television-politics relationship that emerged in the 1960s still prevails to some extent in the digital era but faces new pressures that weaken the primacy of the broadcast-centered model of political communication. The authors identify five new features of political communication that present formidable challenges for media policy makers. They suggest that these are best addressed through an imaginative, democratic approach to nurturing the emancipatory potential of the new media ecology by carving out within it a trusted online space where the dispersed energies, self-articulations, and aspirations of citizens can be rehearsed, in public, within a process of ongoing feedback to the various levels and centers of governance.\n      </p>", "The purpose of this study was to examine what distance education-related skills and knowledge television production specialists had to learn in order to perform their jobs. The purposive sample for this study consisted of 12 full-time television production specialists who develop live, interactive, video-based educational programs at American universities. However, prior to employment at their respective universities, these television production specialists had no experience or educational background in the field of distance education. Qualitative methods were used to collect data. The analysis gave rise to the finding that television production specialists had to learn skills in two major areas-technical skills and personal/interpersonal skills-and knowledge of instructional design methods.\n      </p>", "Two experiments investigated the impact of warnings in mass-media advertising in print (magazine) or broadcast (television) alcoholic beverage ads. Experiment 1 showed that participants exposed to highly conspicuous warnings in print ads performed better on subsequent memory and knowledge tests than those exposed to less conspicuous warnings. Less conspicuous warnings were generally no better than no warnings In experiment 2, participants viewing broadcast commercials with both-modality warnings generally performed better than those exposed to voice-only or no warnings. Print-only warnings produced performance equivalent to, or in one case lower than, both-modality warnings. Both experiments show that warnings in ads can communicate information if presented in a salient form.\n      </p>", "According to Salomon's (1981) model, children usually invest less effort in television viewing than in book reading, with the result that information from television is less deeply processed than information from books. The amount of invested mental effort, in its turn, is assumed to depend on the way a medium is perceived. Most children perceive television as an easy medium and books as a difficult one. In this article, Salomon's model and the research in which the model was tested are discussed, and a replication study is presented. The study determines the internal structure of the Dutch versions of Salomon's instruments and tests some predictions following from the model. Unlike their American peers, Dutch children do not unconditionally perceive television as an easy medium.\n      </p>", "For marketers, television remains the most important advertising medium. This paper proposes a two-sided model of the television industry. We estimate viewer demand for programs on one side and advertiser demand for audiences on the other. The primary objective is to understand how each group's program usage influences the other group. Four main conclusions emerge. First, viewers tend to be averse to advertising. When a highly rated network decreases its advertising time by 10%, our model predicts a median audience gain of about 25% (assuming no competitive reactions). Second, we find the price elasticity of advertising demand is -2.9, substantially more price elastic than 30 years ago. Third, we compare our estimates of advertiser and viewer preferences for program characteristics to networks' observed program choices. Our results suggest that advertiser preferences influence network choices more strongly than viewer preferences. Viewers' two most preferred program genres, Action and News, account for just 16% of network program hours. Advertisers' two most preferred genres, Reality and Comedy, account for 47% of network program hours. Fourth, we perform a counterfactual experiment in which some viewers gain access to a hypothetical advertisement avoidance technology. The results suggest that ad avoidance tends to increase equilibrium advertising quantities and decrease network revenues.\n      </p>", "Like any other unions, the three American actor's unions, the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA), and Actor's Equity Association (AEA) are expected to fight for the rights of their members, whether for better benefits, wages, or working conditions. In the 1950s they were forced into a new and challenging battle. The different methods these unions chose to face and fight the onslaught brought on by the blacklisting of their members are the focus of this article.\n      </p>", "Ongoing increases in adult and child obesity have become a serious public health concern. The current study of 65 parent-child pairs uses parent-completed surveys and child Body Mass Index (BMI) to portray the potential family processes that put children at risk and to illustrate the household environment, parenting beliefs, and child characteristics of obese and non-obese children. Results suggest that efforts to curb childhood obesity should address improving parent knowledge of child nutrition and reducing child television viewing.\n      </p>", "Teachers know that educational experiences extend far beyond the classroom. With a wide variety of science-related programs on television, there is a need for more research into how these programs can be utilized in a classroom setting. In this mixed-methods study, we asked the question: Can student understanding of human physiology be improved through the use of multimedia resources, specifically through the use of popular television? Episodes of Fox's popular medical drama \"House, M.D.\" were incorporated into high school biology curricula during instructional units on two body systems: the nervous system and the immune system. Through the use of integrated media and classroom discussions, students were exposed to the social aspect of learning as they worked together to analyze what they viewed on TV. This study was conducted over a traditional school year in a general biology class at a lower-socioeconomic urban high school.\n      </p>"], "words": {"essay": {"number": 1, "prob":
