Una de estas relaciones es el papel desempe\u00f1ado por la \"religi\u00f3n-suced\u00e1neo\" en las religiones pol\u00edticas, que enlazan con procesos de secularizaci\u00f3n. Como contrapunto al papel intervencionista del Estado en la religi\u00f3n pol\u00edtica se ofrece el modelo liberal de separaci\u00f3n amistosa entre Iglesia y Estado o el modelo hostil de esta separaci\u00f3n, cuando se rechaza el pluralismo cultural. Otro tipo de relaci\u00f3n es el de la \"ideolog\u00eda-suced\u00e1neo\" en la religi\u00f3n politizada, del que ofrece un buen ejemplo el nacional-catolicismo espa\u00f1ol. Tambi\u00e9n se analiza el nacionalismo pol\u00edtico y religioso, con referencia al caso vasco, entre otros. Se concluye hablando de las funciones expresas y latentes de la religi\u00f3n politizada y de sus diferencias con la religi\u00f3n pol\u00edtica, as\u00ed como de las implicaciones tanto para la religi\u00f3n como para la pol\u00edtica. En un marco autoritario, como fue el caso espa\u00f1ol, la religi\u00f3n politizada puede ser un elemento latente de pluralismo pol\u00edtico./// This article analyses the relationships existing between religion and politics, particularly in totalitarian r\u00e9gimes. One of these relationships is the role played by \"ersatz religion\" in political religions, which in turn link up with secularization processes. Offered as a contrast to the interventionist role of the State in political religion is the liberal model of friendly separation between Church and State or the hostile model of this separation, when cultural pluralism is rejected. Another kind of relationship is \"ersatz ideology\" in politicized religion, a good example of which is Spanish national Catholicism. Political and religious nationalism is also analysed with reference, among others, to the Basque case. The article finishes with an examination of the express, latent functions of politicized religion and how it differs from political religion, besides the implications this has as regards religion and politics. In an authoritarian setting, as was the Spanish case, politicized religion can be a latent element of political pluralism.\n      </p>", "The present article is an inquiry into the relationship between Logbara traditional personal names and religion. As context for the study, the literal and real meanings of Logbara personal names, and the naming-ceremony conferring such names, are considered. The article lists as many personal names associated with religion as could be gathered, with a detailed analysis of their meaning. This is followed by a consideration of the frequency of these names compared to other personal names. Elaborating on this proportion, an explanation is attempted. This conclusion summarizes the main points of the article, the final paragraph inferring that Logbara personal names associated with religion are actually few in number. This is explained by the fact that the social and psychological function of Logbara names does not seem to apply to names associated with religion, as problems arising within religion also find a solution within religion. Moreover, one must not overlook the impact of Christianity and Islam on traditional religion in general.\n      </p>", "This paper discusses the relations between secularism, religion and nationalism in Israel and offers a thesis about the failure of secularism there. The papers adopts Michael Mann's view of \"religion\" as a private case of ideological network of power and suggests a typology of four possible heuristic modules of political legitimacy, which are composed of different blends of nationalism and religionism (the suffix \"ism\" is added to underline Mann's view of religion as an ideology). These modules are constructed by the crosscutting of two axes: the axis of nationalism, which taps \"weak\" to \"strong\" nationalism, and the axis of religionism, which taps \"weak\" to \"strong\" religion (wherein the ultimate case of \"weak religion\" means secularism). The four modules are the following: strong nationalism/weak religionism: this is the case of a dominant and energetic secular nationalism. Strong nationalism/strong religionism: this is the case of a fusion between strong nationalism and strong religionism, which creates a kind of indissoluble mesh of \"religious nationalism\". Weak nationalism/ weak religionism: this module represents a polity which is not founded upon strong pre-political \"primordial\" or ascriptive, national or religious, communal identity, but is rather constitutionally or \"contractually\" oriented. Weak nationalism/strong religionism: historically, this combination represents pre-modern and thus pre-national cultures, in which religion was pervasive as a communal identity. Presently, this combination can represent a type of communal \"post- nationalism\" or a transnational fundamentalism. The paper explains how Israeli political culture had moved from the type of strong nationalism/weak religionism to the type of strong nationalism/strong religionism, which is inimical to secularism.\n      </p>", "Far from being a universal feature of culture, the concept of religion has distinctly western origins. What, then, is religion, and how shall it be empirically studied? I suggest, as one of many possible alternatives, an etymologically-based approach to religion, understood as trust in sources of epistemic and moral authority. Four authorities are considered, including institutional religion, science, nature, and the state. I present results of a survey-based empirical inquiry of U.S. adults, enriched by means of follow-up interviews exploring their trust or distrust in these domains of authority. Based on this inquiry, two hybrid forms are at the forefront of religious debate among Americans: theocracy, a linking of trust in institutional religion and government, and ecology, a combined trust in nature and science. These results are regionally variable in the United States, and cross-national data clarify the exceptionalist position of the United States with respect to European countries. Trust in authority emerges as a fruitful means to link seemingly disparate realms of social life, and offers an important basis for geographic comparison. Yet whether understood broadly as trust in authority or along other lines, the geography of religion will benefit from greater theoretical precision and methodological pluralism as suggested in this study.\n      </p>", "An increasing replication of studies find a correlation between religious belief and practice and mental and physical health and longevity. This paper discusses some of the implications of this research for the ways in which religion might understood psychologically. Most interpretations of this data focus on the presence of one or more mediating variables. This paper argues that the presence of these mediating factors helps us understand more precisely some of the ways in which religion actually does impact on human life and in what the psychological uniqueness of religion actually consists.\n      </p>", "The concept of political religion as used in the study of National Socialism depends upon highly criticized expressive-symbolist theories of religion and an implied opposition to the religion of genuine Christianity. The idea of a counterfeit substitute for Christianity goes back to ancient Christian discourse about heresy. The article advocates rational-cognitivist approaches to religion and argues that these prove better for historical work on National Socialism, and that Steigmann-Gall's Holy Reich is compatible with this way of theorizing religion.\n      </p>", "This paper examines the possibility of setting a boundary between religion and \"pseudo-religion\" (or superstition). Philosophers of religion inspired by Ludwig Wittgenstein's ideas, in particular, insist that religious language-use can be neither legitimated nor criticized from the perspective of non-religious language-games. Thus, for example, the \"theodicist\" requirement that the existence of evil should be theoretically reconciled with theism can be argued to be pseudo-religious (superstitious). Another example discussed in the paper is the relation between religion and morality. The paper concludes by reflecting on the issue of relativism arising from the Wittgensteinian contention that the religion vs. pseudo-religion division can only be drawn within a religious framework, and on Wittgenstein's own suggestion that the religious person \"uses a picture\".\n      </p>", "Though religion appears to play a prominent role in the contemporary political and cultural landscape of the United States and elsewhere, relatively few geographers are contributing toward a better appreciation of this phenomenon. A 2001 review of the field countered earlier charges of incoherence by noting particular strengths in geographic research on religion, and more recent publications by geographers have appeared, but the overall picture has not yet matched the strong wave of media treatment and popular interest in religion. A basic question is whether religion really matters in the world today. This question has been addressed in a highly prominent recent debate over secularization theory, which raises important implications for the relevance of geography and suggests the need for both theoretical and empirical contributions. The articles in this theme section comprise the contributions of five geographers toward theorizing and studying religion. Our broad intent is to reinvigorate discourse among geographers on religion, and suggest the important contribution geographers can make to a vibrant and important scholarly conversation.\n      </p>", "A textbook hypothesis about divorce is that heterogamous marriages are more likely to end in divorce than homogamous marriages. We analyse vital statistics on the population of the Netherlands, which provide a unique and powerful opportunity to test this hypothesis. All marriages formed between 1974 and 1984 (nearly 1 million marriages) are traced in the divorce records and multicariate logistic regression models are used to analyse the effects on dizorce of heterogamy in religion and national origin. Our analyses confirm the hypothesis for marriages that cross the Protestant-Catholic or the Jewish-Gentile boundary. Heterogamy effects are weaker for marriages invroling Protestants or unaffiliated persons. Marriages between Dutch and other nationalities harve a higher risk of dirvorce, the more so the greater the cultural differences between the two groups. Orerall, the evidence supports the view that, in the Netherlands, new group boundaries are more difficult to cross than old group boundaries.\n      </p>", "In an effort to clarify the concepts of religion and spirituality religious professionals (Imams, Ministers, Priests, and Rabbis) defined the terms religion and spirituality and responded to whether the concepts religion and spirituality were different (i.e. non-overlapping), the same, or overlapping. Additionally, they rated each item from the five measures (purportedly to assess religion or spirituality) for the extent to which the items assess the construct of religion and/or spirituality. Content analysis of definitions revealed religion as objective, external, and ritual or organizational practices that one performs in a group setting and that guide one's behavior; while spirituality was defined as internal, subjective, and divine experience or direct relationship with God. Primarily the concepts were viewed as overlapping. Analysis for item ratings revealed few within group differences and relatively few between group differences for ratings of item relevance to assess religion and spirituality. Factor analysis of item ratings revealed one factor named religion/spirituality.\n      </p>", "An increased interest in the effects of religion and spirituality on health is apparent in the psychological and medical literature. Although religion in particular was thought, in the past, to have a predominantly negative influence on health, recent research suggests this relationship is more complex. This article reviews the literature on the impact of religion and spirituality on physical and mental health, concluding that the influence is largely beneficial. Mechanisms for the positive effect of religion and spirituality are proposed.\n      </p>", "The religiosity of scientists is a persistent topic of interest and debate among both popular and academic commentators. Researchers look to this population as a case study for understanding the intellectual tensions between religion and science and the possible secularizing effects of education. There is little systematic study, however, of religious belief and identity among academic scientists at elite institutions, leaving a lacuna of knowledge in this area. This absence of data exists at a time when the intersection between religion and science is reaching heightened public attention. Especially with increased tensions surrounding teaching evolution in the public schools, understanding what kind of resources scientists have (particularly in terms of their own religious beliefs and practices) to transmit science to a broader religiously-motivated public is crucial. Using data from a recent survey of academic scientists at twenty-one elite U.S. research universities, we compare the religious beliefs and practices of natural and social scientists within seven disciplines as well as academic scientists to the general population. We find that field-specific and interdisciplinary differences are not as significant in predicting religiosity as other research suggests. Instead, demographic factors such as age, marital status, and presence of children in the household are the strongest predictors of religious difference among scientists. In particular, religiosity in the home as a child is the most important predictor of present religiosity among this group of scientists. We discuss the relevance these findings have for understanding issues related to current theory and public debate about the intersection between religion and science.\n      </p>", "The study investigated the relationship between religion, belief in afterlife, and death attitudes (death anxiety and death acceptance) in an elderly population using instruments with sound psychometric properties. Survey data was collected from 71 elderly participants. Results indicated a strong correlation between belief in afterlife and intrinsic religion, and differential statistically significant relationships between intrinsic religion and both death anxiety and death acceptance depending on whether the effects of belief in afterlife were partialed out. Findings were discussed in light of the absence of clinically meaningful results and, the role that belief in afterlife appears to play in the literature investigating religion and death anxiety.\n      </p>", "It is proposed that explaining religion in evolutionary terms is a misleading enterprise because religion is an indissoluble part of a unique aspect of human social organization. Theoretical and empirical research should focus on what differentiates human sociality from that of other primates, i.e. the fact that members of society often act towards each other in terms of essentialized roles and groups. These have a phenomenological existence that is not based on everyday empirical monitoring but on imagined statuses and communities, such as clans or nations. The neurological basis for this type of social, which includes religion, will therefore depend on the development of imagination. It is suggested that such a development of imagination occurred at about the time of the Upper Palaeolithic 'revolution'.\n      </p>", "Recent critics of the secularization thesis have questioned the extent to which premodern Britain was religious by creating a caricature of a 'Golden Age of Faith' and then showing that the reality fell short of that image. This rejoinder stresses the need to appreciate the nature of religion pre-Reformation and draws on the work of leading historians to show that, even if we accept the most jaundiced view of religion before and shortly after the Reformation, the previous orthodoxy was more accurate than the recent revisions. In Laslett's phrase, 'the world we have lost' was a religious world.\n      </p>", "We are living through an unprecedented re-formation of human society in which religion and state are experiencing a process of demolition and reconstruction where gender plays a crucial role. South Africa women have a unique role in this new re-formation.\n      </p>", "This paper presents a research-based conceptual model respectively linking three dimensions of religious experience (religious practices, spiritual beliefs, and faith community) with three dimensions of health (biological, psychological, and social). The model is used as a framework to highlight findings in the religion-health knowledge base and to provide a broad survey of this domain of inquiry. Considerations for future research on religion and health are addressed.\n      </p>", "Religion is a central force in the lives of the overwhelming majority of African Americans. However, psychology has been conspicuously silent about the role of religion in African American political life. This work endeavors to challenge the longstanding argument that religiosity promotes an escapist, apolitical stance among African Americans. Particular attention is paid to the ways in which our understanding of the link between religion and African American political behavior is complicated by expanded definitions of what is political and by increased attention to various forms of religious participation. Future directions for research are discussed.\n      </p>", "Though Americans are a religious people, there are times when religion or religious views may confound the ethical process. This article claims that religious values may be expressed as either principles or narratives, then seeks to establish a case for dealing with religious claims as \"principled narratives.\" Methods of evaluation are explored and then seven guidelines are offered for dealing with religion in ethics consultations.\n      </p>", "Radio drama gave Americans a new form of commercial entertainment in the 1930s, but the stories themselves contained time-honored elements. One of these was the rhetorical tradition scholars have identified as American civil religion. Radio Westerns were particularly well suited to promulgate familiar civil religion themes. They described the United States as an instrument of divine will in history, celebrated Americans as pious people, and associated national expansion with the implementation of God's will.\n         The Lone Ranger was the most famous Western to articulate these themes. The show's writers consciously sought to create in their hero a \u201ccomposite of all men who uphold the laws of God and man.\u201d During its long broadcast history from 1933 to 1954, the show attracted a large audience and inspired publishing, film, and television ventures. By the late 1940s, however, owing in part to World War II and in part to the Cold War, some Americans on both sides of the microphone found the old formula unsatisfactory.\n         Gunsmoke, which premiered in 1951, exemplified a second generation of radio Westerns. Though still civil religious, these Westerns located the United States' religious significance less in national triumph than in personal triumphs of its citizens. In doing so, they critiqued the earlier Westerns and shifted from what Martin E. Marty has called the \u201cpriestly\u201d to the \u201cprophetic\u201d form of civil religion. Their impatience with the older Westerns' use of civil religion also paralleled theological critiques of the popular Christianity of the 1950s.\n      </p>", "Es cosa aceptada que la modernizaci\u00f3n lleva consigo el progresivo desvanecimiento de la religi\u00f3n. En efecto, este desvanecimiento es indudable en lo que se refiere a las instituciones eclesi\u00e1sticas, pero resulta de lo m\u00e1s dudoso como fen\u00f3meno general. As\u00ed, seg\u00fan el argumento de este art\u00edculo, el \u00e1nimo religioso persiste, s\u00f3lo que bajo otras formas. Para el autor es interesante pensarlo a partir de la vieja idea de Auguste Comte, a saber, la de la Religi\u00f3n de la Humanidad: seg\u00fan dec\u00eda el pensador franc\u00e9s, a la sociedad positiva le corresponder\u00eda una religi\u00f3n racional, de base cient\u00edfica, cuyo horizonte de trascendencia ser\u00eda la Humanidad. Es posible que, dos siglos m\u00e1s tarde, nuestras sociedades hayan producido una religi\u00f3n precisamente con esas caracter\u00edsticas: nos resulta tan natural, que no logramos verla como religi\u00f3n. /// That modernization goes hand in hand with the progressive melting down of religion is a widely accepted notion. According to the author, there is no doubt of this melting down as regards ecclesiastic institutions, but it is barely tenable as a general phenomenon. As a matter of fact, as the author sets out to demonstrate, the religious sentiment still persists, only under different guises. This idea can be elaborated drawing upon Auguste Comte's old idea of the Religion of Humankind: according to the French thinker, a positivist society would have a rational religion, of a scientific basis, whose horizon of transcendence would be Humankind. It is possible that, two centuries later, our societies may have already produced such a religion: it has become so familiar, that we hardly think of it as a religion.\n      </p>", "In this interview renowned researcher Harold G. Koenig, MD, MHSc shares his perspective on religion and health research, drawing from his experiences as a researcher, educator and practitioner. Throughout the interview, he highlights significant advances and discusses the gaps and potential weaknesses in the current body of religion and health literature. He also outlines recommendations for the continued advancement of religion and health research. Guidelines are given to guide new investigators interested in becoming religion and health researchers.\n      </p>", "This paper investigates the relationship between ethics and income among individuals of different religions in the HKSAR of China. The presence of both traditional Chinese religion and Christianity from the West makes our study particularly interesting. The content of ethical beliefs varies with religion and thus the effect of ethics on income may also vary across religion. Furthermore, a reverse causal relationship may run from income to ethics. Since culture and taste affect the consumption behavior of a person, depending on the religion of the person, a person with a higher income may or may not like to 'acquire' more ethics. Our empirical results find that there is indeed a simultaneous relationship between income and being ethical so that a single equation estimation of income on ethics and vice versa generates biased estimates. Using a two-stage instrumental variable estimation, our study finds that being ethical contributes to higher income for Christians and the non-religious group, but lowers it for people of traditional Chinese religion. On the other hand, an increase in income increases the likelihood of a person's being ethical for both Christians and the people of traditional Chinese religion, but reduces it for the non-religious group.\n      </p>", "Geography of religion is an important subfield of cultural geography yet its theoretical foundations remain undebated. Geographers should become more aware of other approaches to the study of religion. Whereas phenomenological awareness of the deepness of the religious quest in the human psyche is important, geographers are primarily concerned with religion's societal expression and hence will gain valuable insights through the adoption of an historical materialist approach to the study of religious institutions in class society.\n      </p>", "Although it seems that ethics and religion should be related, past research suggests mixed conclusions on the relationship. We argue that such mixed results are mostly due to methodological and conceptual limitations. We develop hypotheses linking Cornwall et al.'s (1986, Review of Religious Research, 27(3): 266-244) religious components to individuals' willingness to justify ethically suspect behaviors. Using data on 63,087 individuals from 44 countries, we find support for three hypotheses: the cognitive, one affective, and the behavioral component of religion are negatively related to ethics. Surprisingly, one aspect of the cognitive component (i.e., belief in religion) shows no relationship. Implications for research and practice are discussed.\n      </p>", "This article examines how religion shapes family ideologies in young adulthood. Using the 31-year Intergenerational Panel Study of Parents and Children (N = 909), we find relationships between mother's religious characteristics when her child was born and the child's own family ideologies in young adulthood. Further, multiple dimensions of young adults' religious identities are independently related to their family ideologies, suggesting unique influences of both religious service attendance and the importance of religion. Our results vary across time and family ideologies in interesting patterns, but relationships between religion and attitudes are remarkably consistent. From early in life, mothers' and children's religious characteristics shape family ideologies in ways likely to help explain relationships found between religion and family behaviors.\n      </p>", "This study explores the conditions under which two dimensions of religion first specified by Durkheim (1995), the normative and the integrative, may be related to a particular aspect of alcohol use among white and black adults. The analysis compares those denominations that oppose the use of alcohol to those that do not, while simultaneously examining the effects of the relative strength of the commitment to the religious community on the risk for dependency. Because a substantially large sample drawn from 41 mid-sized cities nationwide is employed, the study is able to expand the set of denominations considered, and, more importantly, to conduct a more refined analysis of differences between black and white respondents than is typically possible. The findings indicate that although effects due to religious denomination are certainly a factor in the risk for dependency, this is much more so the case among whites than among blacks. By contrast, among blacks, frequency of church attendance, a measure of integration, is a more powerful predictor of risk than it is for whites. These results suggest that to more fully comprehend the manner in which alcohol use and religion are linked, especially in the black community, the organizational nature of the church-and not solely its denomination-needs to be considered in the attempt to assess the risk of alcohol dependency.\n      </p>", "Studies have shown that attitudes toward abortion are polarizing. Yet, these studies have not focused upon what is often assumed to be the cause of polarization-religion. In this paper I find that polarization has increased between mainline and evangelical Protestants, as well as between black Protestants and both Catholics and white evangelicals. Moreover, I find that mainline Protestants and Catholics are internally polarizing. Finally, while I cannot determine the cause of the internal polarization of Catholics, the polarization within mainline Protestantism is caused by demographic changes. For white evangelicals, demographic changes have restrained polarization that would otherwise have occurred.\n      </p>", "This paper asks whether: (1) psychology of religion is doing what it is supposed to do, (2) the contemporary psychological attention to religion and spirituality is perhaps of a transgressive nature, and (3) conceptualizations of spirituality in psychological publications are biased. It makes a plea for phenomenologically well-informed research on real forms of religion and spirituality, from a perspective that is as broad as psychology at present has become, with due regard for both the cultural make-up of the phenomena and the unavoidable limits of psychologists' professional competence.\n      </p>", "An antiseptic religion is a form of Protestant Christianity that was shaped in the context of colonization in Korea. This term was coined to explain a religious hybrid that was produced by the intermingling of American Evangelical Protestant Christianity, the concept of hygiene (germ theory) and indigenous Korean religiosity. This research deals with a historical process of making 'a medicalized religion' in Asia from a perspective of postcolonial ism. Most of the early American Protestant missionaries in Korea were medical doctors who were influenced by the Germ theory of illness and considered Western medicine as an efficient tool to evangelize the country. As a result of their mission, a religious culture which emphasized washing away sins from the soul as analogous to washing away germs from the body was born. In addition, the Korean people developed a very unique form of public bathing ritual centered in the development of public baths to alleviate anxiety and to destabilize the solid strategies of the Japanese and the Americans, the two major colonial powers in Korea's history in the late 19th century.\n      </p>", "This paper aims at the removal of an ethnocentric prejudice against magic. A few examples, taken from the authors' experience among Hindus and Christians, and their analysis show that the appreciation of symbolism plays an important role in the proper understanding of religion and magic. Magic is viewed as an integral part of religion, religion again as part of the culture it is embedded in. It is argued that the anthropological approach towards religion is instrumental in identifying and overcoming ethnocentrism\n      </p>", "This paper presents a review of research addressing religion and family relational health. Strengths of the extant data include the correlation of three dimensions of religious experience (religious practices, religious beliefs, and religious community) with certain aspects of mother-child, father-child, and marital relationships and specific connections between the three dimensions of religious experience and family relationships are identified. Key weaknesses in the research at present include a paucity of research examining the hows, whys, and processes involved behind identified religion-family correlations and a lack of data on non-nuclear families, families of color, interfaith families, and non-Christian religions including Judaism and Islam. Implications for clinical practice and recommendations for future research are offered.\n      </p>", "Based on a history of close conceptual link, empirical studies are beginning to accumulate that investigate the relationship between trauma and religion. A review of empirical studies that examined the relationship between religion/spirituality and PTSD showed mixed findings (n = 11). Though the direction of association varied among studies, all but one study reported significant associations between the two. Factors that might have contributed to the mixed findings are discussed (e.g., measurements, research design). Overall, these results appear to be encouraging toward confirming the conceptual link between religion and trauma. Further research investigating the direction of causation and possible moderators of the association may contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between trauma and religion.\n      </p>", "Controversies concerning the religious implications of science have grown increasingly strained in recent years. Creation scientists have deployed new strategies to eliminate the teaching of evolution in public schools; right-to-life groups have obstructed fetal tissue research; and clerical groups have criticized genomics and genetic testing. Meanwhile, the Templeton Foundation has begun promoting the idea that there is no conflict between science and religion. In this paper, I explore emerging efforts to reconcile religion and science. I focus particularly on the use of religious imagery and metaphor by scientists as they seek to convince the public of the power of genes or to allay concerns about new technologies. I suggest that their use of God talk may reflect both its wider prevalence in political rhetoric in the United States and its instrumental utility in light of the religious implications of contemporary biology.\n      </p>", "Modern communism is traditionally understood as an atheist, secular, and profane movement, actively opposed to religion as well as any form of \"idealism.\" The thought of Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mari\u00e1tegui, one of the main founders of Latin American communism, has very little in common with this conventional image. Mari\u00e1tegui had a heterodox attitude toward religion, as well as other subjects. Mari\u00e1tegui does not venture a new definition of religion. However, it can be inferred from his writings that his is an ethical-political and spiritual concept, one related to \"all the need of the infinite that exists in man\" (of which he wrote in 1925) and the quest for a heroic myth that could restore sense and enchantment to life. The word \"mystical,\" which appears very often in Mari\u00e1tegui's work, is evidently religious in origin but has a broader meaning: it refers to the spiritual and ethical dimension of socialism, as well as faith in the revolutionary struggle, absolute commitment to the emancipatory cause, and the heroic willingness to risk life itself.\n      </p>", "The term \"Japanese religion\" was first coined by Anesaki Masaharu in 1907 for readers of English, and then introduced into Japanese society. Originally, this term has a dual meaning: one refers to a unified religion particular to Japan, the other refers to the diverse religions in Japan. The former is exclusive, the latter is inclusive. Most Japanese scholars have deliberately avoided the term in the former, exclusive, sense. In their research they have, at times, understood Japanese religion in the latter sense. The discourse on \"Japanese religion\" becomes a dialogical and hybrid space between diverse religions that have existed in Japan as a result of the dynamic movement of exchange and conflict between Westernization and indigenization within religious traditions-Christianity, Buddhism, Shinto, new religions, and folk religions. Through such an attempt to deconstruct \"Japanese Religion\" the exclusive sense can be clarified in contrast to the inclusive, heterogeneous sense.\n      </p>", "Anne Parson's insights into the boundary identification importance of female purity in a South Italian community are extended to the Hune of Northern Nigeria. In both communities religion is used to encapsulate and enforce the ideal of feminine chastity. Close examination reveals basic cultural and structural similarities between the two groups. These similarities are used to develop an extension of existing theory regarding situations of \"mythical male dominance.\" This idea, taken from Rogers and Sanday, is combined with those of Douglas to examine ideas of purity and prestige. Finally, the psychoanalytic concepts of Whiting and Whiting are incorporated into a broader sociocultural perspective emphasizing notions of identity.\n      </p>", "Context: Controversy exists regarding whether and how physicians should address religion/spirituality (R/S) with patients. Objective: This study examines the relationship between physicians' religious characteristics and their attitudes and self-reported behaviors regarding R/S in the clinical encounter. Methods: A cross-sectional mailed survey of a stratified random sample of 2000 practicing U.S. physicians from all specialties. Main criterion variables were self-reported practices of R/S inquiry, dialogue regarding R/S issues, and prayer with patients. Main predictor variables were intrinsic religiosity, spirituality, and religious affiliation. Results: Response rate was 63%. Almost all physicians (91%) say it is appropriate to discuss R/S issues if the patient brings them up, and 73% say that when R/S issues comes up they often or always encourage patients' own R/S beliefs and practices. Doctors are more divided about when it is appropriate for physicians to inquire regarding R/S (45% believe it is usually or always inappropriate), talk about their own religious beliefs or experiences (14% say never, 43% say only when the patient asks), and pray with patients (17% say never, 53% say only when the patient asks). Physicians who identify themselves as more religious and more spiritual, particularly those who are Protestants, are significantly more likely to endorse and report each of the different ways of addressing R/S in the clinical encounter. Conclusions: Differences in physicians' religious and spiritual characteristics are associated with differing attitudes and behaviors regarding R/S in the clinical encounter. Discussions of the appropriateness of addressing R/S matters in the clinical encounter will need to grapple with these deeply rooted differences among physicians.\n      </p>", "The article examines whether the indigenous languages in the cultural region called Mesoamerica comprise words corresponding to the European concept of \"religion.\" In spite of the fact that the highly advanced phonetic (i.e. logosyllabic) writing systems are capable of expressing and recognising abstract representations in the languages, extant pre-Columbian Mesoamerican inscriptions do not contain words which can be rendered as \"religion.\" Attention has therefore been directed to the descriptions of indigenous languages made by Spanish ethnographer-missionaries in the 16th and 18th centuries. Six indigenous lexemes translated as \"religion\" in colonial dictionaries, are analysed. It is, however, argued that the native terms for \"religion\" were in reality constructed by the Spanish ethnographer-missionaries in order to promote evangelisation and the conversion of the indigenous people. Nevertheless, it is not ineffective to operate with \"religion\" as an etic notion when analysing Mesoamerican cultures.

Method Longitudinal data (12 months between the T\u2081 and T\u2082 interviews) with 182 older adults sampled from a Northeast city were used to examine in a multivariate analysis of covariance whether gender and the existence of cardiac health problems at T\u2081 and T\u2082 affected older adults' spiritual and religious involvement at T\u2082. Findings A gender and cardiac health condition interaction showed older men with heart trouble had more changes in religious involvement\u2014they engaged in more religious doubt, prayed less, and were not as intrinsically oriented at T\u2082.

In this study the 1985 and 1999 Spanish Fertility Surveys were used to investigate whether the significance of religion for fertility behaviour\u2014current family size and the spacing of births\u2014changed between the survey dates. In the 1985 survey, family size was similar for those Catholics who actively participated in religious activities and those who, though nominally Catholic, were not active participants. By 1999, the family size of the latter was lower and comparable to the family size of those without religious affiliation. These findings accord with the declines in both church attendance and fertility in Spain. The small groups of Protestants and Muslims had the highest fertility.

The history of this sense of identity is told by examining dialogues that the Balinese have been led to establish with various other parties. Since their traditions, now secular, have been adopted by the Indonesian state, and since their culture, now regionalized, has been turned into a tourist attraction, religion has become the emblem of this identity, even though the Balinese have had to dissociate it from its ethnic origins in order to make it a vector for national integration.\n      </p>", "The transnational turn has generated new ways of thinking about borders and phenomena that cross them, including religion.

The implication is that JHWH is the only and true God who demands abjuration from nonbelievers and true confession (cf. Ps. xci with its similar thought).

Patriarchy, as the rule of the father/male over women, is in itself a form of violence because of its effects on women's dignity and place in society. Using the thought of Rene Girard, the links between violence, the sacred and sexuality are established. Christianity, as a patriarchal religion, does violence to women through its preponderant use of male language for God, its traditional teaching on women's inferiority, the Household Codes in the New Testament which mandate the subordination of women, and its hierarchical structure. Hope for the future is seen first, in the growing awareness in South African society of the need to reverse the epidemic of domestic violence and second, in utilising resources in the Christian tradition such as the example of Jesus and his His teachings on love and respect and the use of more inclusive images of the church from the New Testament. Church leaders are challenged to break the silence and to speak out forcefully against domestic violence.\n      </p>", "En Chiapas, las transformaciones econ\u00f3micas y culturales ocurridas en las \u00faltimas ddcadas han influido en la relati\u00f3n que establecen hombres y mujeres indigenas al interior del grupo domestico.

British Muslims are often referred to as if they were a single community. The 2001 Censuses of England and Wales and Scotland demonstrate that Muslims are ethnically heterogeneous. Ethno-religious ward-level data for London from the 2001 census are used to test whether Islam binds together peoples of different ethnicity or whether ethnicity links groups despite religious differences. London Muslims, as a whole, are much less segregated than Sikhs, Jews or Hindus. Paradoxically this low level of overall segregation is produced by high intra-Muslim ethnic segregation. Intra South-Asian mixing irrespective of religion is greater than intra-Muslim mixing, irrespective of ethnicity. Intra-Black mixing is high irrespective of religion, while religion over-rides race and ethnicity for Christian groups.\n      </p>", "In any given time and place, religious pluralism reflects a set of cultural attitudes about the nature and role of religion in society.

Since the war, American society has experimented with several different models, each of which derives from an approach to religious pluralism rooted in a particular region of the country.\n      </p>", "In the work of many of the classics of sociology, religion plays a major role. In post-World War II sociology, however, the study of religion gradually ended up in a marginal position. This article discusses the status of the sociological study of religion in Finland from the post-war period to the present. The focus in the article is on the institutional evolution of the field and the influence of that evolution on the role of the sociology of religion within Finnish sociology. Finnish sociology of religion is divided into three categories: studies carried out in sociology departments, sociological studies carried out within religious studies and church and social studies. The article examines the development and characteristics of each of these disciplines as well as the consequences of institutional scattering for the sociology of religion. The aversion of religion within sociology, the focus on folklore in religious studies and the public identification of church sociology with theology are identified as the reasons for the marginal position of the sociology of religion in Finland. The article closes with a review of recent studies in the sociology of religion and the 'new rise' of the field due to the rise in the societal significance of religion.\n      </p>", "The relationships of spirituality and religion to acute cardiovascular responses, physical symptoms of illness, stress and psychological mood were assessed in a community sample of adults. Nineteen men and 61 women participated in a betrayal interview, while their blood pressure and heart rate were monitored.

Spirituality, especially as assessed by the existential scale of the Spiritual Well-being Scale, was related to symptoms of illness, medication use, stress and negative mood states. Spirituality and involvement in organized religion may represent a means to increase the sense of purpose and meaning in life, which is related to greater resiliency and resistance to stress-related illness.\n      </p>", "In \"Culture and Value\" Wittgenstein remarks that the truly \"religious man\" thinks himself to be, not merely \"imperfect\" or \"ill,\" but wholly \"wretched.\" While such sentiments are of obvious biographical interest, in this paper I show why they are also worthy of serious philosophical attention. Although the influence of Wittgenstein's thinking on the philosophy of religion is often judged negatively (as, for example, leading to quietist and/or fideist-relativist conclusions) I argue that the distinctly ethical conception of religion (specifically Christianity) that Wittgenstein presents should lead us to a quite different assessment. In particular, his preoccupation with the categorical nature of religion suggests a conception of \"genuine\" religious belief which disrupts both the economics of eschatological-salvationist hope, and the traditional ethical precept that \"ought implies can.\" In short, what Wittgenstein presents is a sketch of a religion without recompense.\n      </p>", "The question of the extent of the interconnection, if any, between religion and the Western culture of biomedicine has received considerable scholarly attention over the past several decades. However, any phenomenological analysis that begins by positing an essence of religion is, if not doomed, deeply flawed from the outset. This paper employs William Alston's non-essentialist notion of 'religion-making characteristics' to assess the extent of the interconnection. The conclusion is that the culture of biomedicine does share many, if not all of these characteristics, and that both religion and medicine overlap in significant ways on, to use Erwin Goodenough's metaphor, the painted curtain that separates man from the tremendum.\n      </p>", "Religion impacts suicidality.

Epidemiological data on suicidality across four religions, and the influence of religion on suicidality are presented.

Research on feedback loops, information processing and ego depletion have highlighted key psychological mechanisms involved in self-control. Next this paper explores common themes in religious perspectives regarding the virtue of self-control and self-restraint. A clear preoccupation of major religious traditions is the management of human passion and desire.

This article argues that geographers of religion must take these deconstructive arguments to heart. Rather than assuming there is a universal feature of human life called \"religion,\" the author argues that the religious and the sacred should be studied by geographers as ways of distributing particular kinds of significance across geographic spaces. Rooted in modern distinctions of religious/secular and sacred/profane and in the Enlightenment urge to classify, constructs of religion are efforts to demarcate, purify, and territorialize. Postmodernization exacerbates the individualization of religion but also destabilizes the boundary between the sacred and the profane. If religion is, to paraphrase Michel Foucault, a \"recent invention\" that, with a shift in structural relations, might \"be erased, like a face drawn in sand at the edge of the sea,\" the elements that have made up this thing called religion will certainly persist in other forms, and it is the task of geographers of religion to trace the changing orchestrations of those significances across space and place.\n      </p>", "Australian Aborigines today exercise strong reserve in respect to their religious sphere.

Currently, cohort studies have shown that the baby boomers differ significantly from their elders in their approach to religion, preferring to explore spirituality rather than the religious doctrine of their elders. They also differ in their approaches to health, including greater acceptance and use of alternative health practices. This study isolates the baby boomer and cold war cohorts in order to explore differences in religion, spirituality and alternative health practices. Findings indicate that, for boomers, increased spirituality is significantly related to increased positive health perceptions, while their elders' health perceptions are related to increased religiosity. Alternative health practices and spirituality, however, are not related for either cohort. However, this study does identify important distinctions between the two cohorts. Future studies must recognize differing cohort constructions of reality concerning the meanings of health, spirituality and religion.\n      </p>", "En el presente art\u00edculo nos proponemos indagar algunas interacciones positivas entre determinados elementos presentes en el catolicismo argentino y la acci\u00f3n politica, alrededor de la elaboraci\u00f3n de principios \u00e9ticos ligados a la significaci\u00f3n del trabajo como marco de constructi\u00f3n del sentido.

Accordingly, the article is structured following each of these logics inscribed in differential registers that frame the specific features of the producers of the speeches under consideration.

We ask: (1) How do they gather information about religion and spirituality and determine when that information is relevant to their professional work? (2) Do they perceive religion and spirituality to be a barrier or a bridge to medical care as they do what Thomas Gieryn (1983) calls \"boundary work\"? We find that pediatric oncologists more than pediatricians see religion and spirituality as relevant to their professional work, though still largely outside their professional jurisdiction. It is most relevant when families are making medical decisions and in end of life situations. Physicians tend to view religion and spirituality functionally, describing impermeable boundaries in medical decision making situations and more permeable boundaries at the end of life. Physicians view religion and spirituality as a barrier when it impedes medical recommendations and as a bridge when it helps families answer questions medicine inherently cannot.

Religion was viewed as a personal relationship with God, which is not dependent on socializing with other church members, but was helpful in sustaining the respondents.

Buddhist philosopher Inoue Enryo was crucial to this process. This paper explores \"superstition\" and \"religion\" in his writings, and it discusses the aspects of Buddhism that were invented and sublimated under the influence of this distinction. This paper argues that not only did Buddhism became a religion in Meiji Japan but also that in order to do so it had to eliminate superstitions, which included numerous practices and beliefs that had previously been central.\n      </p>", "This paper explores whether the field of sociology harbors a dismissive attitude towards religion. Specifically it examines whether introductory sociology textbooks present the classic secularization theory over the more recent religious economies explanation of religious change. The classical secularization thesis suggests that religion is declining in importance in modern societies and may disappear completely. The religious economies perspective proposes that religion has actually become more influential and dynamic over time. While both theories are well represented in the sociology of religion literature, we explore whether generalist sociology textbooks reflect this reality. This article provides a content analysis of 31 introductory sociology textbooks published between 2003 and 2006. We assess the presence and promotion of the above theories in these textbooks. Our analysis reveals that 20 (65%) of the 31 textbooks in our study present only secularization theory, while seven (23%) of the textbooks cover both secularization theory and religious economies theory. We assess the ramifications of such a lopsided arrangement and conclude by encouraging a more open dialogue on this issue.\n      </p>", "This article aims to assess the role of religion and religiousness in engendering higher US fertility compared to Europe. Religion is important in the life of one-half of US women, whereas not even for one of six Europeans. By every available measure, American women are more religious than European women. Catholic and Protestant women have notably higher fertility than those not belonging to any denomination in the US and across Europe. In all European regions and in the United States as well as among all denominations the more devout have more children. However, women in Northern and Western Europe who are the least religious have equivalent or even higher fertility than women in the US, and notably higher fertility than those in Southern Europe. This suggests that forces other than religion and religiousness are also important in their impact on childbearing. A multivariate analysis demonstrates that relatively \"traditional\" socioeconomic covariates (age, marital status, residence, education, and income) do not substantially change the positive association of religiousness and fertility. Finally, if Europeans were as religious as Americans one might theoretically expect a small fertility increase for Europe as a whole, but considerably more for Western Europe. /// Religion, religiosit\u00e9 et f\u00e9condit\u00e9 aux Etats-Unis et en Europe.

La religion occupe une place importante dans la vie de la moitie des femmes am\u00e9ricaines, tandis qu'elle n'est importante que pour 1 europ\u00e9enne sur 6. Quelque soit l'indicateur utilis\u00e9, les am\u00e9ricaines sont plus religieuses que les europ\u00e9ennes. Les femmes catholiques et protestantes ont une f\u00e9condit\u00e9 significativement plus\u00e9e que celles sans affiliation religieuse aux Etats-Unis et en Europe. Dans toutes les regions de l'Europe et aux Etats-Unis, ainsi qu'\u00e0 travers toutes les pratiques religieuses, les plus croyants ont plus d'enfants. Toutefois, les femmes d'Europe du Nord et de l'Ouest, qui sont les moins religieuses, ont une f\u00e9condit\u00e9 \u00e9quivalente ou sup\u00e9rieure aux femmes am\u00e9ricaines, et significativement plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e que leurs consoeurs d'Europe du Sud.

Accordingly, using longitudinal data taken from the National Survey of Families and Households, I examined the influence of religious affiliation and attendance on the involvement of residential fathers in one-on-one activities, dinner with their families, and youth activities and found religious effects for each of these three measures. Virtually no evidence was found for a competing hypothesis that these effects are artifacts of a conventional habitus such that the type of men who are more conventional in their patterns of civic engagement are both more religious and more involved with their children. However, civic engagement is positively related to paternal involvement.\n      </p>", "Las representaciones difundidas por la cultura politica republicana espa\u00f1ola en el primer tercio del siglo XX sobre la vinculaci\u00f3n de las mujeres con la religi\u00f3n sirvieron para reforzar los modelos de g\u00e9nero existentes, aunque tambi\u00e9n espolearon a una minor\u00eda, fundamentalmente femenina, a luchar por la emancipati\u00f3n de las mujeres.

These writers use this notion of \"embeddedness' to help us see that categories post-Enlightenment thinkers often regard as distinct (such as politics, economics, and religion) largely overlapped in antiquity. The trope of \"embedded religion\" can, however, also produce the false impression that religion is a descriptive concept rather than a redescriptive concept for ancient cultures (i.e., that there really is something \"out there\" in antiquity called \"Roman religion\" or \"Mesopotamian religion,\" which scholars are simply describing rather than creating). By allowing this slippage between descriptive and redescriptive uses of \"religion,\" the rhetoric of \"embedded religion\" exacerbates the very problem it is meant to solve.\n      </p>", "This article addresses asylum patients\u2019 expressions of Christian religious identity in New Zealand\u2019s only private asylum, Ashburn Hall, Dunedin, New Zealand, between 1882 and 1910. Religion remains an area that has been under-examined by historians of the asylum. A significant minority of patients admitted to Ashburn Hall turned to religion to interpret their surroundings, express their feelings, or assert their identity within the space of the asylum. For those allowed out of the asylum to attend their own denominational services, religion also opened up a community other than the forced community of the asylum. The recurrence of religious language, delusions, and observance in patient case notes suggests the importance of Christianity in patients\u2019 lives and their experiences of the asylum.\n      </p>", "In a re-evaluation of overall decline to below replacement fertility in the Kerala state of India, it was generally found that fertility among Muslims is higher and contraceptive prevalence lower than among Hindus and Christians. This paper examines the interaction between religion and other socioeconomic factors, that is, whether the effect of religion on fertility remains constant across other factors. The analysis is based on the data from the National Family Health Survey-1 in Kerala. The analysis found that large Hindu-Muslim fertility differences at a low level of education do not persist at higher levels. For contraceptive use, wider gaps are found at a middle level of education and at a medium level of standard of living than at lower and higher levels. This indicates that couples at different socioeconomic settings make different decisions in spite of belonging to the same religion. The fact that fertility of Muslims at higher levels of socioeconomic status is low, and not much different than the fertility of other religions, suggests that the observed fertility gap between Hindus/Christians and Muslims is a passing phenomenon.\n      </p>", "Using data from a national survey of 501 Arab American women, this study examines the extent to which family behavior mediates the influence of religion on women's labor force activity. Prior research on families has largely overlooked the role of religion in influencing women's labor force decisions, particularly at different stages of the life cycle. The analysis begins to address this gap by examining whether religious affiliation and religiosity have direct relationships to women's work behaviors, or whether they primarily operate through family behaviors at different phases of the life course. The results show that religiosity exerts a negative influence on women's labor force participation, but only when children are present in the home. Among women with no children, religiosity has no effect on employment.\n      </p>", "Successive writers have located the explanation of the dens otiosus concept in traditional Igbo religion either in the ontological nature of the Supreme (High) God or in a supposed separateness or isolation of the High God from mortals. Because these explanations derive essentially from the speculations of the wnters themselves and ignore the total context of man/god relationship as a form of transactions they fail to exhaust the explanatory possibilities. - This paper offers an alternative explanation of the concept of otiositas (as applied to traditional Igbo religion) based on the conviction that religion is a reflection of social relationships and that as F. Barth puts it, \"most interpersonal relations are transactional in nature.\" - The analysis of this concept in this paper situates the interpretation of otiositas in the prevalent form of interpersonal rehtionship in the relevant Igbo societies. It therefore sees the man/god religious intercourse in the traditional Igbo context as the archetypical form of the dominant pattern of social relations mediated by middlemen (brokers) of appropriate status who are engaged to carry through a message as they see fit until the ultimate patron is reached. Each unit in the transaction in the bid to denve favours from the ultimate source is dyadic though there may be several such units in the total transaction between the first client and the ultimate patron.\n      </p>", "The Lugbara people of Uganda use the word \"religion\" when speaking English, their national language. In their own. language, they use the word dini which is originally a Kiswahili word. But the Lugbara language has actually the word ori expressing much of what both \"religion\" and dini refer to. The terms ori, dini, and \"religion\" reveal a concept of religion that draws from the triadic source indicated by these three words and that has developed during the last century in a complex relationship of rich meanings. This present article tries to analyse such development and the present stand. It concludes on a note of caution when trying to order the ideas related to religion in Lugbara thinking. While there is a need of systematisation as demanded by scientific inquiry, there is also a limit to such exercise. This limit is given by the need to respect \"otherness,\" particularly when tempted to reduce complex pluralism to simpler monism.\n      </p>", "A study of the associations among physical and mental health and differential patterns of religiosity among African American women was conducted with a sample of 253 participants: 104 HIV-infected, 46 chronically ill (not HIV-infected), and 103 healthy subjects. Participants' uses of private (i.e., prayer) and public (i.e., church attendance) forms of religiosity were assessed using data from semi-structured interviews. The relationship between religiosity and mental health exhibited an incongruous pattern, differing across health condition and forms of religious behavior. The practice of public religiosity was found to be inversely associated with engagement in high-risk health behaviors among HIV-infected and healthy women but not among the chronically ill. Although private religiosity was unrelated to participants' perceptions of physical health, public religiosity was positively associated with physical health among HIV-infected women and inversely associated with their CD4 count. Finally, having a sense of control over one's health was positively related to religiosity.

This study investigated the effects of both prosecution and defense appeals. Prosecution appeals did not affect verdict decisions; however, use of religion by the defense affected both verdicts and the weighing of aggravators and mitigators.

Following an extremely conflictive past, as a result of religious schisms, one of the most significant characteristics of current Spanish politics has been the growing irrelevance of the religious factor.

Using several empirical data from post-electoral surveys, the author analyzes the indicators on religiosity and secularization, the ideological profiles of religious groups and the electoral preferences of the sectors affected by religious schisms.

This article examines the characteristics of science and of religions and the possible relationship between science and religion. I argue that creationism is sometimes best seen not as a misconception but as a worldview. In such instances, the most to which a science educator (whether in school, college or university) can normally aspire is to ensure that students with creationist beliefs understand the scientific position. In the short term, the scientific worldview is unlikely to supplant a creationist one for students who are firm creationists. We can help students to find their evolutionary biology courses interesting and intellectually challenging without their being threatening. Effective teaching in this area can help students not only learn about the theory of evolution but better appreciate the way science is done, the procedures by which scientific knowledge accumulates, the limitations of science, and the ways in which scientific knowledge differs from other forms of knowledge.\n      </p>", "In a recent article entitled, Requests \"for inappropriate\" treatment based on religious beliefs,1 Orr and Genesen claim that futile treatment should be provided to patients who request it if their request is based on a religious belief.

For the Garifuna in Central America, the spatial focus of authentic religious practice has for over two centuries been that of their former homeland and site of ethnogenesis, the island of St Vincent. It is from St Vincent that the ancestors return, through spirit possession, to join with their living descendants in ritual events. During the last generation, about a third of the population migrated to the US, especially to New York City. This departure created a new diasporic horizon, as the Central American villages left behind now acquired their own aura of ancestral fidelity and religious power. Yet New-York-based Garifuna are now giving attention to the African components of their story of origin, to a degree that has not occurred in homeland villages of Honduras.

I argue that there is in fact a constructive approach to ethics and religion in Freud's thought, and that this approach can be better understood by examining it in relation to Kant's formulations on these topics. Freud's thinking about religion and ethics participates in the Enlightenment heritage, with its emphasis on autonomy and rationality, of which Kant's model of practical reason is in many ways exemplary. At the same time, Freud advances Kantian thinking in certain important respects; his work offers a more somatically, socially, and historically grounded approach to the formation of rational and ethical capacities, and hence makes it more compatible with contemporary concerns and orientations that eschew the pitfalls of ahistorical idealist orientations.\n      </p>", "This paper presents positivistic, normative/theological, and strategic analyses of the application of religion to the practice of strategic leadership in business.

Religious differences in socioeconomic outcomes are substantial in Ghana. Mainline Protestants have a significant advantage in education and wealth. Catholics and other Christians have intermediate values on these socioeconomic outcomes. Muslims and those without attachment to formal religious groups have a significant disadvantage. Educational differences are particularly important because they account for some of the differences in wealth.

However, what is less apparent is if this relationship may, at least in part, be a function of individual differences in personality, as previous research has demonstrated a relationship between certain measures of personality and both attitude toward alcohol and attitude toward religiosity. The aim of the present study was to explore the impact of personality and the relative efficacy of different markers of religiosity in predicting attitude toward alcohol among a sample of 16-18 year olds in Northern Ireland. Method: The Francis Scale of Attitude toward Alcohol (Francis, 1992c. Drug and Alcohol Dependence, 31, 45-50) was administered alongside the Abbreviated Revised Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (Francis, Brown, &amp; Philipchalk, 1992. \"Personality and Individual Differences,\" 13(4), 443-449), the Francis Scale of Attitude toward Christianity (Francis &amp; Stubbs, 1987. \"Personality and Individual Differences,\" 8, 741-743) and measures of frequency of personal prayer and church attendance among a sample of 243 16- to 18-year-old sixth-form students in Northern Ireland. Results and conclusion: The data demonstrate that a more prohibitive attitude toward alcohol was correlated with lower psychoticism scores (tendermindedness) and a more positive attitude toward Christianity. Multiple-regression analyses confirm the importance of attitude toward religion in predicting individual differences in attitude toward alcohol.\n      </p>", "Through religio-cultural and Christian institutions, older women socialise girls and younger women into being 'acceptable' women in their communities. Inherent in this, is the belief that women are custodians of acceptable beliefs and behaviours. As such, these women find themselves subjected to positions of powerlessness compared to their male counterparts. Sexually, the reality of patriarchy in such communities means that women find themselves in positions of service to men as sexual objects with limited sexual decision-making power. This briefing focuses on young women's struggles to grapple with religio-cultural definitions of women in relation to men, and how these definitions tend to be continuously in conflict with the quest for gender justice both in church and society. Based on the acknowledgement that even in 21st century Africa, religion still plays a vital role in gender construction, this briefing impresses the necessity of targeting religio-cultural socialisation for both women and men. This is a starting point for any effective headway in the process of sexual empowerment for a community of equal participation of women and men so as to ensure gender justice.\n      </p>"], "words":
