{"total_words": 220, "documents": ["By the early 2000s, scrapbook construction in the United States had shifted from a relatively private mode of assemblage into a visible practice bolstered by robust marketing and public venues for creation and display. But today\u2019s scrapbooks often also perform the value of activities long characterized as ephemeral, mundane, and private by recasting them\u2014using archival-safe products and visual documentation\u2014as durable, artistic, and public. In effect, these books perform everyday lives. Arbiters of culture have questioned the authenticity or aesthetic merit of these exhibits in moves that deflect attention from the risks that attend any form of cultural documentation, including their own. Because scrapbooking makes visible the estrangement and objectification that occur when experience is entextualized, this popular hobby prompts reflections about ethnographic practice, the risks of performance, and the regulation of cultural hierarchies more generally.\n      </p>", "           ", "In 1987, two women hatched a business plan that became Creative Memories, a direct-marketing company that sells scrapbook materials and techniques to a mostly female clientele through a worldwide network of sales consultants. By the beginning of the new millennium, millions of people had participated in Creative Memories workshops. Many successful imitators also flooded the crafting market with specialized publications, Web sites, tools, and materials, creating an industry worth $2.55 billion by 2004.\n         As significant as the economic impact of scrapbooking is, however, the claims of importance made by its practitioners rate closer examination. Promising to keep photos safe from deterioration, Creative Memories also sold a worldview, reflected across the industry, that such preservation is essential to human flourishing. Such a claim invites considerations both of how the promoters of memory-keeping envision its working and how memory-keepers themselves distinctively shape their practice. This article takes the view that album-making constitutes a kind of innovative female meaning-making (that is, religion) shaped, in part, by American-style Common Sense epistemology while also reflecting what we might call a sidelong feminism, in which a woman expresses agency, claims her voice, and declares the complexity of her full humanity, all by using modes that, on the surface, appear compliant with patriarchy. This article also uses certain notions of religious testimony to gauge the space between the Common Sense project of the album-making industry and the results produced by album-makers themselves.\n      </p>", "This essay considers the role of layout in intermedial photo-texts, arguing that the scrapbooking of visual material and printed text constitutes an integral aspect to these texts' rhetoric and semantics. Through a close reading of novels by W. G. Sebald and Monika Maron, I show how photographic inserts can be used to connect distant or incommensurate spaces: the represented space inside the photograph; the space of representation (of the photograph itself); and the extratextual space of the reader. However, the establishment of such a connection crucially depends on the imagination of the beholder of photographs, and the more skeptical photographic readings in Maron's novel illustrate that photos can also be used to block off incommensurate times and spaces. The meaningful layout pattern established by both authors is broken up in the English translation of their works, and the essay closes by considering the problematic nature of translated photo-texts.\n      </p>", "           ", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Then, the authors conduct two experimental studies to understand the importance of constraints (e.g., instructional guidance, target outcomes) in facilitating a balance between perceived competence and autonomy for consumers involved in a creative task.

The consequences for brands, marketers, and senior executives are significant. Advertising was traditionally generated by, or on behalf of, the firm and broadcast to relatively passive consumers. With the rise of digital media, the Internet, and inexpensive media software, considerable creative and distributive power has been handed to the consumer. Liberated from the exclusive control of the firm, ads now express a myriad of different voices. Some ads are subversive, others laudatory, but the fact remains that the firm is no longer in exclusive control of the message. Using a number of high profile cases, this article explores the motivations that drive consumers to create their own ads and develops a typology of the ads created. It develops a model for the various strategic stances that a firm can adopt in response to this phenomenon so that managers can anticipate and thus deal more effectively with some of the extreme consequences of liberated advertising.\n      </p>", "This essay examines the 2004 comedy Napoleon Dynamite, analyzing its impact on national popular culture and rural identity in the American West, particularly in the town of Preston, Idaho, where the movie was filmed. As part coming-of-age film, part comedy, and part critique of real life, Napoleon Dynamite fashioned a unique and contested image of the West that helps to expose the underlying anxieties, stereotypes, assumptions, and hopes that still underscore much of the fraught relationship between the rural West and mainstream America.\n      </p>", "Part book and part toy, the 1905 \u201cThe House That Glue Built\u201d gave young readers an opportunity to cut and paste paper objects into rooms found within the book\u2019s pages.

Plath's legacy endures in part because of the recognition that a fluctuation in moods and personas is often the experience of young women, of writers, of those who struggle with depression or anxiety (and the overlap between these populations), and also because of Plath's ability to craft the fever of her emotions into poems that rely on bold and rich figurative language. This essay uses memoir, a survey of Plath's popular and critical reception, and a close reading of Plath poems that take on more adolescent concerns and themes, then concludes by looking at contemporary women poets whose aesthetics, attitudes and themes are relevant to contemporary teenage girl readers.\n      </p>", "How do we speak usefully about unspeakable things? This paper draws on my doctoral research with survivors of spousal abuse and subsequent book to address the methodological and ethical challenges of producing knowledge within and from sites of trauma. Writing what we cannot know, in spaces where we have lost trust in language, connection and cohesive modernist subjectivity raises complex representational challenges. This paper explores the limits of making sense, and proposes alternative approaches, through writing wonder, writing art, writing dirty, being haunted, and troubling genre, illustrated by their application in my own work. Rather than offering problematic promises of recovery, these ways of writing through trauma reach for the redemptive possibilities of thought.\n      </p>", "This paper investigates the spending by spouses in categories in which only one spouse uses the products purchased (e.g., personal electronics, apparel, personal hobbies, massages, tennis lessons). Spouses in these situations assume one of two purchasing roles: \"self-purchasing spouse\" or \"purchaser for one's spouse.\" We propose that the spending of self-purchasing spouses is unrelated to household category budget constraints while the spending of husbands or wives purchasing for their spouses will be subject to category budget constraints. Our research supports these propositions and illustrates the importance of studying spending by individual spouses. Our results are useful for marketers targeting spouses in categories in which only one spouse uses the products purchased.\n      </p>", "           ", "Drawing from a study of one student's literature engagements with English studies and fan fiction and related fan art over her two years in an MA program, and that also reached back to the earlier writing she did for English classes and other writings before the study began, this article employs sociohistoric theory to examine the profoundly dialogic interplay of vernacular and disciplinary literate activities. Following a detailed look at the student's extensive involvement with fan fiction, the article elaborates the trajectory of linkages between fan fiction and English studies, paying particular attention to the repurposing of literate practices across these activities, the synergies and tensions that texture such interactions, and the long-term implications they have for the production of literate practice and person. Ultimately, the article argues for increased theoretical, methodological, and pedagogical attention to the heterogeneous assemblage of literate practices and identities that may be mediating literate action and, in particular, to the role vernacular literacies can play in developing disciplinary engagement and vice versa.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Despite foundations in early pragmatism, research on social patterning of creative action has been scarce in the multidisciplinary literature on creativity.
