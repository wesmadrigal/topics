{"total_words": 1406, "documents": ["This article synthesizes the experimental literature that compares the academic, cognitive, and behavioral performance of adults with reading disabilities to those of average-achieving adult readers. The central question posed by this review is to what extent and in what manner do adults with reading disabilities differ from adults without reading disabilities on measures assumed to relate to overall reading competence. In all, 52 studies met criteria for a meta-analysis, yielding 776 effect sizes (ESs) with an overall a weighted ES of 0.72 (SD = 0.54). Moderate to high ESs in favor of adults without reading disabilities emerged on measures of cognition (naming speed [M = 0.96], phonological processing [M = 0.87], verbal memory [M = 0.62]) and achievement (word attack [M = 1.33], math [M = 0.75], vocabulary [M = 0.71], spelling [M = 1.57], and writing [M = 0.72]). Hierarchical linear modeling indicated that verbal IQ, vocabulary, math, spelling, and specific cognitive process measures (naming speed, phonological processing, and verbal memory) significantly moderated overall group ES differences. Significantly larger ESs emerged for studies with relatively higher IQ scores when compared to studies with IQ and reading scores in the same low range. Overall, the results support the notion that reading achievement and cognitive deficits in adults with reading disabilities are persistent across age.\n      </p>", "Federal legislation has increased the participation of students with disabilities in higher education, but they are less likely to attain a postsecondary degree than students without disabilities. In this paper, I discuss reasons for academic failure and illustrate ten strategies that instructors can implement to increase the academic success of students with disabilities. The ten strategies are an accessible syllabus, study objectives, study guides, frequent tests, remedial activities, guided notes, response cards, peer tutoring, fluency building, and feedback.\n      </p>", "Gr\u00e2ce aux donn\u00e9es de 2001 portant sur un \u00e9chantillon d'enfants de l'Enqu\u00eate sur la participation et les limitations d'activit\u00e9s (EPLA) r\u00e9alis\u00e9e par Statistiques Canada, nous analysons, dans cet article, les co\u00fbts \u00e9conomiques, au Canada, des soins donn\u00e9s aux enfants vivant avec une incapacit\u00e9.

Both explicit out-of-pocket expenditures and implicit costs in the form of foregone labour market opportunities are considered. Results indicate that, despite universal health insurance in Canada, a majority of families of children with disabilities incur significant economic costs. Additional financial support might be offered, particularly when the child's condition is severe, and costly therapy and specialized aids could be covered. Our results also support the need for respite as well as help in balancing work and caregiving for Canadian parents of children with disabilities.\n      </p>", "Twin studies comparing identical and fraternal twins consistently show substantial genetic influence on individual differences in learning abilities such as reading and mathematics, as well as in other cognitive abilities such as spatial ability and memory. Multivariate genetic research has shown that the same set of genes is largely responsible for genetic influence on these diverse cognitive areas. We call these \"generalist genes.\" What differentiates these abilities is largely the environment, especially nonshared environments that make children growing up in the same family different from one another. These multivariate genetic findings of generalist genes and specialist environments have far-reaching implications for diagnosis and treatment of learning disabilities and for understanding the brain mechanisms that mediate these effects.\n      </p>", "The functional and affective relationships characterizing disabled and nondisabled children were described by 838 aging mothers of children with chronic disabilities. Mothers indicated that their nondisabled offspring provided very little functional assistance to their siblings with chronic disabilities, but that affective relationships between siblings were characterized by strong, close ties. Predictors of the affective relationship between siblings, functional assistance provided by nondisabled siblings to their siblings with disability, and the likelihood that a nondisabled child would be a future caregiver to the child with a disability were examined. Implications for practice are discussed.\n      </p>", "This article synthesizes published literature comparing the cognitive functioning of children who have math disabilities (MD) with that of (a) average-achieving children; (b) children who have reading disabilities (RD); and (c) children who have co-morbid disabilities (MD+RD). Average achievers outperformed children with MD on measures of verbal problem solving, naming speed, verbal working memory (WM), visual-spatial WM, and long-term memory (LTM). Children with MD outperformed co-morbid children on measures of literacy, visual-spatial problem solving, LTM, short-term memory (STM) for words, and verbal WM. Children with MD could be differentiated from children with RD only on naming speed and visual-spatial WM. Differences in cognitive functioning between children with MD and average achievers were related primarily to verbal WM when the effects of all other variables (e.g., age, IQ, and other domain categories) were partialed out.\n      </p>", "According to federal regulations, children with reading difficulties are eligible for special education services under the learning disability category if they display reading skills that are significantly lower than their scores on intelligence (IQ) tests. Children who are poor readers but do not display this discrepancy are not eligible for special education. A meta-analysis involving 46 studies addressing the validity of this classification of poor readers revealed substantial overlap between the IQ-discrepant and IQ-consistent poor readers. Aggregated effect sizes were in the negligible range for the Behavior (-.05) and Achievement (-.12) domains but in the small range for the Cognitive Ability domain (.30). The latter effects were heterogeneous, with larger estimates showing higher performance by the IQ-discrepant poor readers. The size of the effects could be largely explained by the selection criteria used to form groups, indicating that variation in group definitions across studies accounted for variability in effect size estimates. These results provide little evidence supporting the validity of the IQ-discrepancy classification fundamental to public policy concerning students with learning disabilities and cast doubt on the need for IQ tests in identifying these students.\n      </p>", "Although he never wrote about disabilities and education, John Dewey's philosophy of education and democracy offers insight into our educational responsibilities to the disabled. In this paper I defend an approach to educational opportunity for the disabled grounded in Dewey's conception of growth. This conception of growth both justifies and explicates the strategy of rich social integration of disabled children in the classroom. The paper demonstrates that consideration of the educational implications of the concept of growth affords insights into the social ideals underlying Dewey's philosophy, as well as the contribution of that philosophy to important contemporary debates about justice and the disabled.\n      </p>", "Boundless playgrounds accommodate children living with and without disabilities. This field report examines one of the largest boundless playgrounds in the United States, Shane's Inspiration in Los Angeles, California, through observations of design features and play behaviors of 56 children with physical disabilities. Shane's Inspiration incorporates paths, apparatus, and social play areas that allow for the free flow of children using wheelchairs and crutches. The children's play was primarily passive and included exploration of the playground. Although children accessed most playground areas, they had few opportunities for functional play and did not engage in group social play. The report concludes with recommendations for future research and interventions to help increase different types of play in children with disabilities.\n      </p>", "Recent research concerning the incidence of reported work-limiting disabilities in the married population indicates a degree of interdependence between spouses' disabilities. This pattern is consistent with several hypotheses. Spouses tend to share many lifestyle traits that might lead to common health outcomes. Alternatively, their joint reports might reflect a shared preference for income benefits or workplace accommodations available to disabled individuals. Another possibility is that disabled individuals tend to be matched in the process of marital formation. This paper investigates the latter hypothesis. Taking advantage of a unique data set from the Swedish population, we select a sample of recently married couples and trace them back in time to their single years. Our analysis indicates nonrandom matching on the basis of disability status. After controlling for observed traits such as age and education, we find a residual correlation between future spouses that is positive and strongly significant. The magnitude of the correlation is within the range of residual correlations obtained from other studies that address marital matching in the contexts of education and earnings.\n      </p>", "Using data on disabilities from the 2000 Census, we found a consistent pattern of living arrangements that leaves children (aged 5 - 15 years) with disabilities living disproportionately with women. Children with disabilities are more likely to live with single parents, and especially their mothers, than are other children. Further, those who do not live with either biological parent are more likely to live in households headed by women than are other children. The results suggest that gendered living arrangements among children with disabilities are a neglected aspect of inequality in caring labor, which is an underpinning of gender inequality in general.\n      </p>", "Within a European context, facilitating the increased participation of marginalized groups within society has become a cornerstone of social policy. In higher education in Ireland this has generally involved the targeting for support of individuals representing groups traditionally excluded on the grounds of socio-economic status. More recently, people with disability have been included in this consideration. This approach has tended to focus on physical access issues and some technical supports. However, access is multifaceted and must include a review of pedagogic practices, assistive provision (technological and personal), student's engagement with their workload (e.g. recording) and evaluation procedures: achieving accreditation levels commensurate with ability. This small-scale Irish study examined the experiences of two groups of young people with physical disabilities and with dyslexia in two higher education institutions. It was apparent that for students with physical disabilities and with dyslexia, assessment practices were fraught with additional limitations. Assessment practices were mediated for these students through the physical environment, the backwash effect of assessment on curriculum, the availability and use of assistive technology, and through the attitudes of staff and students. It can be concluded that access issues within higher education have been inadequately conceptualized and as a result failed to address fundamental issues around assessment for students with physical disabilities and with dyslexia.\n      </p>", "Long-term maternal adjustment to the adoption of children with developmental disabilities was studied in a sample of 123 adoptive families using multiple measures of adjustment including depression, marital satisfaction and others. Conclusions were that adjustment was generally positive over an approximately 11-year period, regardless of family demographic or child characteristics. Moreover, adjustment to subsequently-adopted children was comparable to adjustment to earlier adopted children. These results suggest that adoption policy and practice should promote the adoption of children with developmental disabilities, and be flexible with regard to family and child characteristics, including placing multiple children with disabilities in the same home.\n      </p>", "Ambiguous loss and boundary ambiguity experienced by families during the process of placing their child in out-of-home care was described by parents in 20 families raising a child with severe or profound developmental disabilities. In retrospective interviews, parents discussed their experiences before and after placing their child and how they experienced ambiguous loss as they raised a child that was psychologically absent but physically present. Parents faced ambiguities related to the nature and diagnosis of the disability, support services, and placement. A second situation of ambiguous loss was created when the child was placed. Parents experienced two forms of boundary ambiguity (role and membership ambiguity) and ambivalence regarding placement decisions. Research and clinical implications for working with families are presented.\n      </p>", "Test accommodations are often given to students with disabilities as one means of removing construct-irrelevant barriers to proper measurement of their knowledge, skills, and abilities. However, the practice is controversial. This article reviews numerous studies that focused on the effects of accommodations on test performance. Consistent conclusions were not found across studies because of the wide variety of accommodations, the various ways in which they were implemented, and the heterogeneity of students to whom they were given. But two consistent findings emerged: Extended time tended to improve the performance of all students, although students with disabilities tended to exhibit relatively greater score gains; and oral accommodations on math tests were associated with increased test performance for some students with disabilities.\n      </p>", "Approximately 5% of all public school students are identified as having a learning disability (LD). LD is not a single disorder, but includes disabilities in any of seven areas related to reading, language, and mathematics. These separate types of learning disabilities frequently co-occur with one another and with social skill deficits and emotional or behavioral disorders. Most of the available information concerning learning disabilities relates to reading disabilities, and the majority of children with learning disabilities have their primary deficits in basic reading skills. An important part of the definition of LD is its exclusions: learning disabilities cannot be attributed primarily to mental retardation, emotional disturbance, cultural difference, or disadvantage. Thus, the concept of LD focuses on the notion of a discrepancy between a child's academic achievement and his or her apparent capacity to learn. Recent research indicates, however, that disability in basic reading skills is primarily caused by deficits in phonological awareness, which is independent of any achievement-capacity discrepancy. Deficits in phonological awareness can be identified in late kindergarten and first grade using inexpensive, straightforward testing protocol. Interventions have varying effectiveness, depending largely on the severity of the individual child's disability. The prevalence of learning disability identification has increased dramatically in the past 20 years. The \"real\" prevalence of LD is subject to much dispute because of the lack of an agreed-upon definition of LD with objective identification criteria. Some researchers have argued that the currently recognized 5% prevalence rate is inflated; others argue that LD is still underidentified. In fact, it appears that there are both sound and unsound reasons for the increase in identification rates. Sound reasons for the increase include better research, a broader definition of disability in reading, focusing on phonological awareness, and greater identification of girls with learning disabilities. Unsound reasons for the increase include broad and vague definitions of learning disability, financial incentives to identify students for special education, and inadequate preparation of teachers by colleges of education, leading to overreferral of students with any type of special need. There is no clear demarcation between students with normal reading abilities and those with mild reading disability. The majority of children with reading disabilities have relatively mild reading disabilities, with a smaller number having extreme reading disabilities. The longer children with disability in basic reading skills, at any level of severity, go without identification and intervention, the more difficult the task of remediation and the lower the rate of success. Children with extreme deficits in basic reading skills are much more difficult to remediate than children with mild or moderate deficits. It is unclear whether children in the most severe range can achieve age- and grade-approximate reading skills, even with normal intelligence and with intense, informed intervention provided over a protracted period of time. Children with severe learning disabilities are likely to manifest an increased number of and increased severity of social and behavioral deficits. When children with disabilities in reading also manifest attention deficit disorder, their reading deficits are typically exacerbated, more severe, and more resistant to intervention. While severe reading disorders are clearly a major concern, even mild deficits in reading skills are likely to portend significant difficulties in academic learning. These deficits, too, are worthy of early identification and intervention. Even children with relatively subtle linguistic and reading deficits require the expertise of a teacher who is well trained and informed about the relationships between language development and reading development. Unfortunately, such teachers are in short supply, primarily because of a lack of professional certification programs providing this training. This article focuses primarily on deficits in basic reading skills, both because of their critical importance to academic success and because relatively more is known about these deficiencies. However, other academic, social, and behavioral manifestations of learning disability are also important and cannot be assumed to be adequately addressed by programs to improve basic reading skills. While early intervention is necessary, it should not be assumed to be sufficient to address the multiple manifestations of learning disability.\n      </p>", "Problems concerning people with disabilities in Japan characteristically manifest themselves as problems affecting not only the disabled people themselves, but also their mothers. My research indicates that this stems from the fact that social welfare in Japan: (a) lacks an encompassing vision; (b) views people with disabilities negatively, using the so-called 'medical model' that equates disabilities with disease; and (c) embraces a paradigm in which the family is seen as the primary care-giver and state welfare is seen as having a merely supplemental role. The continuing stress on the family as primary provider of support and care has reduced the issue of disability to a family matter in the eyes of the state. Consequently, questions are seldom raised about the quality of life of people with disabilities who live with their families. This paper discusses challenges to contemporary policies on disabilities, with a view to identifying what needs to be done to enable people with disabilities to live independently, as citizens in their local community.\n      </p>", "Employees with disabilities represent both an important concern and a potential source of value for employers. The need to examine attitudes towards these employees is stronger than ever. The article presents a model with important considerations for companies attempting to be more proactive in responding to the needs of employees with disabilities. Responding to these needs requires more than a set of policies to be pulled off the shelf when needed. Instead, an organization's response should be comprehensive. In addition to changing policies, an organization should seriously examine and question its attitudes, values and beliefs. If such efforts are undertaken seriously, employers may well find value in taking a proactive stance to employees with disabilities.\n      </p>", "Students with disabilities or suspected disabilities are evaluated by schools to determine whether they are eligible for special education services and, if eligible, to determine what services will be provided. In many states, the results of this evaluation also affect how much funding assistance the school will receive to meet the students' special needs. Special education classification is not uniform across states or regions. Students with identical characteristics can be diagnosed as disabled in one state but not in another and may be reclassified when they move across state or school district lines. Most disabilities with a clear medical basis are recognized by the child's physician or parents soon after birth or during the preschool years. In contrast, the majority of students with disabilities are initially referred for evaluation by their classroom teacher (or parents) because of severe and chronic achievement or behavioral problems. There is evidence that the prevalence of some disabilities varies by age, the high-incidence disabilities such as learning disabilities and speech-language disabilities occur primarily at the mild level, the mild disabilities exist on broad continua in which there are no clear demarcations between those who have and those who do not have the disability, and even \"mild\" disabilities may constitute formidable barriers to academic progress and significantly limit career opportunities. Problems with the current classification system include stigma to the child, low reliability, poor correlation between categorization and treatment, obsolete assumptions still in use in treatment, and disproportionate representation of minority students. Both African-American and Hispanic students are disproportionately represented in special education but in opposite directions. The disproportionately high number of African Americans in special education reflects the fact that more African-American students than white students are diagnosed with mild mental retardation. Though poverty, cultural bias, and inherent differences have been suggested as reasons for this disproportionate representation, there are no compelling data that fully explain the phenomenon. In most states, classification of a student as disabled leads to increased funding from the state to the school district. This article suggests a revised funding system that weights four factors (number of deficits, degree of discrepancy, complexity of intervention, and intensity of intervention) in a regression equation that would yield a total amount of dollars available to support the special education of a particular student.\n      </p>", "The study examined attitudes toward school inclusion of students with disabilities of 1,145 prospective teacher trainees from six national/religious groups in eleven colleges in Israel: The groups were secular, religious and ultra-orthodox Jews and Muslim, Christian and Druze Arabs. Participants responded to the \"Opinion Related to Inclusion Scale\". Trainees in all six groups supported the principle of inclusion while simultaneously recognizing the need for segregated special education placements. Several significant group differences were found on the total score and the factor scores. The most supportive group of inclusion (i.e., the strongest rejection of segregation and the least concern about behavior problems) was the Jewish secular group followed by the Jewish religious group. The least support for inclusion was found for the ultra-orthodox Jewish group and the Arab groups. Implications for the preparation of educators in institutions of higher education were discussed.\n      </p>", "The primary purpose of this investigation was to understand the influence of access to the general curriculum on the performance of students with significant cognitive disabilities, as measured by the Wisconsin Alternate Assessment (WAA) for Students with Disabilities. Special education teachers (N = 113) submitted case materials for students with significant disabilities who were assessed using the WAA. Cases included WAA rating scales, students' individualized education programs (IEPs), and a curricular access questionnaire. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the influence of curricular access on students' WAA performance. Students' scores on the WAA Reading, Language Arts, and Mathematics scales were included in the model as the indicators for the latent factor-student performance. Student grade level, teacher reports of students' curricular access, percentage of academic-focused IEP goals, and time spent in general education settings were included as predictors of students' performance. Results indicated the model accounted for 41% of the variance in the latent factor of student performance. Implications of these results are discussed for the validity of WAA scores and the design of professional development and teacher support materials.\n      </p>", "The impact of employment status and a nonspousal partner on the overall well-being of 148 single mothers of children with developmental disabilities was assessed through self-report questionnaires. Although generally multiple roles were associated with greater well-being, the quality of the roles (perceived helpfulness of the partner and perceived financial importance of the job) was more predictive. In fact, interaction effects indicated that having a supportive partner was associated with greater well-being for mothers whose employment was their primary income source (primary providers) and for nonemployed mothers, but not for mothers whose employment did not provide the primary family income (partial providers). Among those without a supportive partner, mothers who were partial providers reported greater well-being than did nonemployed mothers or primary provider mothers.\n      </p>", "This study examines the informal social support systems of 89 mothers of children with severe developmental disabilities. Instrumental, informational, and emotional support is described and compared to mothers' perceived level of support. The results indicate that mothers take on most of the day-to-day responsibility for the care of their children with handicaps, but the assistance they do receive is important to them. Analysis by marital status shows few differences in the help received; however, married women perceived greater support from their husband and his family than single mothers did from the child's father and his family. The convergence of family policy and demographic trends is noted and the implications for mothers and families discussed.\n      </p>", "This paper discusses the results of a qualitative study of risk management for offenders with learning disabilities residing in low/medium-secure accommodation within an NHS hospital in Northern England. The study had two phases: first, 13 staff, including psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses and a social worker, were interviewed about their views on risk management at the hospital; second, 11 case studies, based primarily on interviews with patients, were undertaken. The study identified tension between an anamnestic approach to risk, predicated on the assumption that patients have a propensity to reoffend, and a rehabilitative approach, which attempts to bring about personal change. Reconciling these two approaches will require recognition of the limitations of risk analysis as a guide to the uncertain future.\n      </p>", "Approximately 20% of the United States population suffers from some form of disability. In the United States, leisure activities such as hunting are becoming more accessible to persons with disabilities, though little research has been published on this topic. Research has been conducted in South Dakota to categorize deer (Odocoileus spp.) hunters based on their motivation for hunting and to collect information about hunter satisfaction. This information has proven valuable to the state management agency, facilitating changes in management that increased satisfaction of the majority of hunters. We conducted a study in Alabama, which included both hunters with disabilities and nondisabled hunters, to determine whether motivations and satisfactions differed between groups. Hunter groups displayed some statistical differences, but practical differences were not found. This suggested that management agencies need not differentiate between groups when making decisions related to the motivations and satisfactions of these constituents.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "This research uses a case study approach to assess the implementation of the disciplinary procedures in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), a federal policy developed to ensure the inclusion of all children with disabilities in state public education systems. The findings indicate that many factors influence the implementation of IDEA\u2019s disciplinary practices. Such factors include teacher and administrator knowledge of the law and policies, teacher and administrator discretion, school\u2010based resources, and parental involvement.

The 69 participants completed the Ways of Coping Questionnaire and the Family Hardiness Index. Results indicated that the use of social supports was highly associated with family strengths. In contrast, wishful thinking, self-blame, distancing, and self-control were negatively related to family strengths. Implications for practice are discussed.\n      </p>", "Despite increased concern for the health related quality of life (HRQOL) of people with disabilities, little is known about the HRQOL of children with developmental disabilities. The present study aimed to explore the HRQOL of children who were at risk or having developmental disabilities in Hong Kong. Using the parent-reported Chinese Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), the HRQOL of 173 children (2\u20144 years) with signs of delays in development was contrasted with that of 132 children with typical development. We found that those who exhibited high risk of developing a developmental disability had significantly lower overall well-being (76.3\u00b113.7 vs. 84.2\u00b111.3; p&lt;0.001) and psychosocial health (71.3\u00b115.6 vs. 82.5\u00b112.9; p&lt;0.001) but not necessarily physical health. The findings are consistent with previous findings in children with different disabilities and chronic illnesses. They suggest children at risk or having DDs need help in restoring their quality of life up to the standard experienced by their healthy peers, particular in psychosocial aspects such as social functioning, emotion functioning, and school functioning.\n      </p>", "This article draws from the literature on self-determination and Universal Design for Learning principles to set forth the theory that students identified as having learning disabilities may be environmentally disadvantaged and their learning difficulties exasperated by the traditional classroom learning environment. Alternatively, the digital learning environment found in simulation video games is designed so participants can be autonomous, self-directed, goal-oriented and successful. These are, coincidentally, the salient features of a technology-enhanced learning environment designed with Universal Design for Learning principles. The paper argues that the use of digital learning environments that encourage participant access and success may reduce the need for labels of disability in the future.\n      </p>", "This report by the National Joint Committee on Learning Disabilities (NJCLD) outlines important concerns about documentation issues related to students with disabilities as they transition from high school to postsecondary settings. These issues center on the \"disconnect\" between the nature and extent of disability documentation generated during a student's public school career and the documentation required to access services at the postsecondary education level. There is no easy answer to this problem given the legal, practical, and philosophical differences between these two educational settings, and it is clear that new ways of thinking about the documentation for accessing services in postsecondary education for students with learning disabilities (LD) need to occur. One of the main tenets of this paper is that all persons involved in the successful and equitable transition of individuals with LD to postsecondary institutions need to understand each other's constraints and perspectives. This understanding will be greatly enhanced when there is a shared goal of helping all students receive services to which they are entitled and when educators from each level commit to communicating with each other. The purpose of this report is to outline the issues affecting documentation for postsecondary disability services and to suggest ways to bridge the gap between secondary and postsecondary settings.\n      </p>", "An exploratory study was conducted to inquire into the field placement process for students with disabilities. Fourteen students with disabilities and twelve field directors were interviewed. Findings were grouped into seven areas: (1) field education expectations, (2) special and general considerations for placement, (3) agencies' response to requests for placement, (4) schools' response to agencies, (5) students' response to placement, (6) factors promoting acceptance of students in the field, and (7) reasonable accommodation. Results indicate that there were biases, considerations, and accommodations made by schools and agencies that interfered with students' educational needs. In addition, respondents' definitions of reasonable accommodation varied, yet maintained some common elements.\n      </p>", "Fifty-one Anglo American (28 educationally successful, 23 educationally at risk) and 20 African American (10 educationally successful, 10 educationally at risk) high school boys participated in a study to determine their willingness to allow same-sex peers with learning disabilities (LD) participate in a variety of activities. Kruskal-Wallis One-way Analysis of Variance by Ranks (S. Siegel &amp; N. J. Castellan, 1988) results indicated no significant differences among educationally successful groups, educationally at-risk groups, or ethnic groups regarding their willingness to allow peers with LD to participate in activities. However, there were significant differences in the degree to which peers with LD would be unconditionally or reluctantly allowed to participate or denied participation. Discussion addresses the importance of educating and training adolescents with and without LD to enhance interaction and improve relationships among students.\n      </p>", "In many countries, governments pursue a policy of offering persons with disabilities greater opportunities for participation in society, based on the assumption that this will also improve their subjective well-being. Currently, however, it is not known whether this assumption is valid. In this study we relate the objective participation and the subjective well-being aspects of both disabled and non-disabled persons to an array of social and health-related determinants. Linear structural equation modelling of data of a sample selection of the Dutch population is analysed. The sample size is 5,826, including 642 respondents with physical disabilities. In terms of objective participation, the persons with disabilities are at a greater disadvantage as regards labour participation than is the case for social and cultural participation. When it comes to subjective well-being, we find that the persons with disabilities are more likely to lag behind in perceived physical health than in mental health and happiness. In a multivariate model relating objective participation to subjective health and happiness, correlations are much weaker than expected. It is striking to find that participation, perceived health and happiness are much less closely related than is often assumed. Their determinants differ widely in nature and strength. The empirical model leads to rejection of the hypothesis that higher participation by the persons with disabilities is associated with higher subjective well-being.\n      </p>", "This article discusses the evolution of service delivery for people with developmental disabilities from the medical model to the developmental model to the current support model.

The purpose of this special series was to address issues related to students and mathematics learning disabilities (LD). We identify Response to Intervention (Rtl) as it relates to early mathematics instruction and a multi-tiered service delivery system. Further, because Rtl has focused primarily on young children and the prevention of LD, we present information about older students who have been identified as having mathematics LD and provide strategies for helping them access the general education curriculum. Six papers on various mathematics topics, grade levels, and service delivery will be provided in this special series.

But what kind of health insurance coverage would be optimal for these children? Peter Szilagyi surveys the current state of insurance coverage for children with special health care needs and examines critical aspects of coverage with an eye to helping policy makers and clinicians improve systems of care for them. He also reviews the extent to which insurance enhances their access to and use of health care, the quality of care received, and their health outcomes. Szilagyi begins by noting that nearly 9 percent of children with disabilities are uninsured for all or part of a year and that coverage even for many such children with insurance is inadequate\u2014either not meeting their needs or not adequately covering the costs of care. By one estimate, nearly two of every five special needs children are either uninsured or inadequately insured. The author finds strong evidence that health insurance improves access to health care. Children with disabilities who are insured are more likely than those who are uninsured to have a primary care provider, to be able to reach a specialist, and to have access to supporting services. They also have fewer unmet needs for medical and oral health care and receive care more quickly. The bulk of the evidence shows that insurance improves quality of care for children in general and for children with disabilities. Parents of insured children with chronic conditions are more satisfied with their children's primary care, medications, specialty care, and overall health care than are parents of their uninsured peers. A handful of studies of specific diseases have found insurance to be related to improvements in quality measures, such as more doctor visits and greater continuity of care. In conclusion, Szilagyi stresses the need to provide adequate health insurance to all children with disabilities and to develop a set of best practices in health insurance to cover important services needed by this population. To that end, implementation of the federal health care reform act, including the mandate for insurance coverage, is important. He also urges support for medical home and other quality initiatives and better ways to monitor quality and health outcomes to ensure that children with disabilities receive cost-effective and equitable care.\n      </p>", "Objectives: To determine the association between functional status, measured by the WeeFIM and health-related quality of life (HRQL), measured by the PedsQL4.0 for children with physical disabilities. To explore child, parent and service-related factors associated with each of these measures. Patients: Parents of 115 children (2\u20145 years) with physical disabilities who were referred to occupational (OT) or physical therapy (PT). Mean age of the children was 3 years 7 months (\u00b110 months), 79 were boys and 67 were diagnosed with global developmental delay. Results: Children had more difficulties with self-care tasks and cognitive abilities, as compared to mobility activities on the WeeFIM. The correlation between total WeeFIM and total PedsQL4.0 was r = 0.39. WeeFIM mobility and self-care quotients were each fairly correlated with PedsQL-Physical Health Summary Score (rs = 0.29 and rs = 0.28 respectively). There was no significant association between WeeFIM cognition quotient and each of PedsQL scores (rs = 0.03\u20140.05). The receipt of PT services was highly associated (p &lt; 0.001) with lower scores on the PedsQL-Physical Health Summary score, PedsQL-Total score, and WeeFIM mobility quotient. Conclusion: The WeeFIM and the PedsQL4.0 appear to assess related but different constructs, supporting the need to incorporate complementary measures when measuring general health of children with disabilities.\n      </p>", "This investigation replicated and extended previous research regarding the attitudes of inclusive teachers toward their students with disabilities. Participating teachers included 46 inclusive teachers (grades K-5) from 16 elementary schools in 7 Northeast Ohio school districts. Teachers nominated 3 students in 4 attitudinal categories: attachment, concern, indifference, and rejection. Results indicated that (a) included students with disabilities were significantly overrepresented (in comparison to nondisabled students) among teachers' concern, indifference, and rejection nominations; (b) included students with mild disabilities were significantly overrepresented (in comparison to students with severe disabilities) among teachers' concern nominations; and (c) included students were significantly more likely to receive concern nominations in high-socioeconomic status (SES) school districts and from experienced teachers, and to be nominated in the rejection category in classes with no paraprofessional and in high-SES school districts. Implications and recommendations for inclusive policies and practices are discussed.\n      </p>", "One desired outcome of inclusive education is the enhanced social development of students with disabilities. Some have suggested that planned and systematic support of students with severe disabilities in general education environments may lead to greater social interaction between these students and their peers without disabilities. In an effort to analyze this proposition, we studied two students with severe disabilities as they began participating in general education classrooms. Using within-student multiple baseline designs across class periods, the effects of participating in general education were studied across a range of social participation indicator variables. Our results suggest that planned and systematic efforts to include students with severe disabilities into general education courses can have positive effects on their social contacts and friendship networks. Our findings are discussed in relation to policy efforts to establish inclusive education in public schools, strategies for structuring general education participation, and the potential effects such efforts can have on the social inclusion of students with disabilities.\n      </p>", "Large discrepancies have sometimes been found between the quality of life (QOL) experienced by clients with intellectual disabilities and their QOL as described by their caregivers. Olsen and Schober (Soc Indi Res 1993; 28: 173-193) may have provided a framework useful to conceptualize such discrepancies. They suggested that lack of concordance between objective circumstances (i.e. poverty) and perceived QOL must not be treated as measurement noise, but as a source of information. They speculated on the psychological processes that underly and explain this lack of concordance; particularly processes that try to deal with the stress induced by cognitive dissonance and learned helplessness. In this study low to moderate agreement was found between caregivers judgement of QOL of individual clients and clients' own perception of QOL. In some areas and for some clients the discrepancies indicated dissonance (caregivers are satisfied, clients are not) and in other areas and for other clients adaptation (clients are satisfied, caregivers are not). There were systematic differences between clients falling in these groups with respect to their personal characteristics and with respect to factual conditions of care. These outcomes are interpreted with respect to Olson and Schober's contentions regarding the psychological processes that underly a person's experience of QOL. The Olson and Schober framework appears to be a fruitful way to combine different sources of information regarding QOL.\n      </p>", "The research study highlighted in this article was conducted as part of a three-phased project funded by the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services. The results of this national survey provide a comprehensive examination of current strategies and services employed to facilitate the transition of adjudicated youth with disabilities from correctional settings to community environments.\n      </p>", "The present study analyzed identification procedures and explored the possibility of dyselxia overidentification in Greece. Data from various institutional sources provided evidence that the prevalence rate of dyslexia in the school population, aged 6-18, was slightly higher than 1%. Compared to the corresponding percentages from the United States (approximately 5.5%) and an arbitrary estimation of 5% of a Greek legal document, the dyslexia rate was much lower, thus excluding the possibility of an overidentification problem on a national scale. Nonetheless, the relevant worries expressed by Greek governments seem to be partly justified by the phenomenon of a disproportionate percentage of students with dyslexia in secondary schools, when compared with that in elementary schools. This seems paradoxical, considering that the inadequacies in supportive special education services are much greater in the secondary-level education system. This finding was analyzed in terms of the legal and social actualities of Greece. Finally, a comparison between the Greek situation and the specific learning disabilities reality in the United States revealed differences regarding the issue of identification as well as similarities in the social factors that lead to distortions of the diagnostic procedures.\n      </p>", "Using daily telephone interviews, 82 midlife parents (mean age = 57.4) of children with disabilities (mean age = 29.9) were compared with a closely matched sample of unaffected parents (N = 82) to elucidate the daily experience of non-normative parenting. In addition, salivary cortisol samples were obtained to examine whether parents of children with disabilities had dysregulated diurnal rhythms and the extent to which the amount of time spent with children was associated with divergent patterns of cortisol expression. We found that parents of children with disabilities had similar patterns of daily time use and similar likelihood of positive daily events as the comparison group, but they had elevated levels of stress, negative affect, and physical symptoms, all reported on a daily basis. In addition, their diurnal rhythm of cortisol expression differed significantly from the comparison group, a pattern that was strongest for parents of children with disabilities on days when they spent more time with their children.\n      </p>", "Research confirms that students with disabilities (e.g., emotional and behavioral disabilities, learning disabilities, and developmental delays) are overrepresented in correctional facilities across the United States. The literature suggests several reasons for the overrepresentation of students with disabilities in the correctional system: (a) the large numbers of incarcerated children and youth who are products of the foster care system, (b) failure of students to attend school on a regular basis, and (c) students who have not been identified by the public school system as having a disability. The poor educational outcomes for students with disabilities are alarming. Of all students who are suspended, it is estimated that 20% of them have a disability. Additionally, research has shown that students with disabilities are twice as likely to drop out of school as opposed to their nondisabled peers. Based on these data, it is evident that effective transition planning is important to the future outcomes of students with disabilities. This review of the literature provides background information on the roles and responsibilities of both correctional facilities and public schools in the transition process, as well as delineates the challenges encountered along with recommended solutions.\n      </p>", "Students with disabilities are increasingly being included in large-scale, high-stakes testing programs, despite a lack of evidence regarding the validity of scores from many tests for these students. This study examines Kentucky's efforts to include students with disabilities in its statewide assessment. We explore the level of inclusion achieved, the kinds of assessment accommodations offered, the performance of students with disabilities, and the relationships between performance and the use of accommodations on both multiple-choice and open-response formats. Results indicate that most students were included in the assessment, but that the scores obtained by some students may not be trustworthy due to inappropriate use of accommodations.

Such delays include atypical patterns of development in cognition, communication, emergent literacy, motor and sensory abilities, and/or social-emotional adjustment that may adversely affect later educational performance. Development in each of these domains may be related to individual variations in rates and patterns of maturation, environmental factors such as language exposure, and quality of learning opportunities. Although the focus of this paper is on developmental rather than academic expectations, it is recognized that adequate development across multiple domains is essential for subsequent school success. It also is important to recognize that when children are exposed to high quality learning opportunities prior to kindergarten, they are less likely to experience school failure and be misidentified as having LD in the early grades. LD has been defined by the National Joint Committee on Learning Disabilities (NJCLD) as a heterogeneous group of disorders of presumed neurological origin manifested differently and to varying degrees during the life span of an individual. These disorders are developmental in nature, occur prior to kindergarten, and continue into adult life. Various manifestations of LD may be seen at different ages and as a result of varying learning demands (NJCLD, 1985/2001a, 1990/2001C). Early indicators that a child may have LD include delays in speech and language development, motor coordination, perception, reasoning, social interaction, prerequisites to academic achievement and other areas relevant to meeting educational goals. These indicators may occurconcomitantly with problems in self-regulation, attention, or social interaction (Lowenthal, 1998; McCardle, Scarborough, &amp; Catts, 2001). In effective programs for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers, professionals (1) examine risk and protective factors, (2) conduct systematic observations of individual children, (3) assess developmental status, (4) create rich and varied learning opportunites, (5) plan and deliver services and supports, and (6) provide intervention based on assessment data. These programs are culturally and developmentally appropriate, linguistically sensitive, and based on scientific evidence. This paper describes how such programs can be established and implemented, emphasizes the importance of family and caregiver involvement and responsibilities, discusses issues in professional preparation and development, and articulates critical research needs.\n      </p>", "Three peers without disabilities who volunteered to serve as peer supports and were identified by general education teachers as having academic difficulties were studied across three conditions. In baseline, a peer without disabilities worked alone, while the student with severe disabilities was supervised by an adult In the Peer Support condition, peers without disabilities worked with the student with severe disabilities, and both individuals were supervised by an adult In the Adult Involvement condition, peers without disabilities were supervised by an adult as in the Peer Support condition, but peers worked separately from the student with severe disabilities. Dependent measures included the active engagement of peers without disabilities and students with severe disabilities, and social interactions between students and peers. Our data indicate that the Peer Support and Adult Involvement conditions resulted in higher, but similar, levels of active engagement for two of three peers without disabilities when compared to baseline. For the third peer, high levels of active engagement occurred across all conditions. Active engagement varied across students with severe disabilities, but was typically highest in conditions where peers without disabilities were involved. For all students with severe disabilities, social interactions were more frequent and longer in the Peer Support condition.\n      </p>", "Social workers have long been involved in the support of individuals with developmental disabilities through developmental service institutions or agencies. Governments increasingly expect such individuals to use community-based generic social services, however, and social workers will serve more and more of these clients in a variety of settings. A survey of Canadian schools of social work shows that few courses offer even a minimal level of coverage of issues pertaining to developmental disability. Respondents indicated lack of faculty expertise, limited departmental resources, and lack of student interest as factors limiting coverage of this topic, despite its perceived relevance to social work. Increasing the number of faculty members engaged in related research and stimulating students' interest in this client group are two steps that might improve coverage and help prepare students to work with persons with developmental disabilities. Depuis de nombreuses ann\u00e9es, les travailleurs sociaux soutiennent les personnes atteintes de d\u00e9ficience d\u00e9veloppementale par l'interm\u00e9diaire d'institutions ou d'organismes sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s. Cependant, de plus en plus, les gouvernements s'attendent \u00e0 ce que ces personnes aient recours aux services sociaux communautaires g\u00e9n\u00e9riques.

The classroom ecology was measured using the New Code for Instructional Structure and Student Academic Response (NCISSAR). Social interactions were assessed using the Multiple Option Observation System for Experimental Studies (M.O.O.S.E.S.). Spelling performance was measured by weekly pre-posttests. Using an ABAB single-subject design, results indicated that CWPT resulted in: (a) gains in the spelling accuracy of all students (up to 49%), (b) increases of students' duration of positive social interactions (up to 86%), and (c) high satisfaction ratings for both the students and the teacher. Comparisons between typical students and students with mild disabilities during CWPT suggested no differences in their duration of social interactions. Furthermore, the mean spelling accuracy of the students with mild disabilities was comparable to the spelling accuracy of the typical students (91% vs. 96%, respectively). Implications of the findings for the inclusion of students with mild disabilities in general education settings are discussed.\n      </p>", "The purpose of the present study was to investigate the presence of teacher biases with regard to identification of students with learning disabilities (LD). Factors related to teachers' gender, age, and experience, along with children's gender, were investigated. Results suggested that teacher gender is associated with biases with regard to identification of learning disabilities by a factor of 2:1. In other words, every child who is rated by female teachers as having an LD (who actually has LD) corresponds two children when rated by male teachers. Students' gender, on the other hand, did not differentially predict identification rates. Furthermore, teacher age and experience did not contribute significantly to student identification rates. The findings are discussed with regard to policy mandates and classification schemes.\n      </p>", "A series of focus group meetings were held with African American, Chinese American, Haitian American, Hispanic/Latino American, Korean American, and select Native American communities. Cultural issues in caring for persons with a developmental disability were discussed. Differences were found in the following themes: (1) how disability is perceived, (2) who are the family, (3) who provides care, (4) how the family makes decisions, (5) what family members expect of each other, (6) what support families receive from friends and community, (7) why the family moved, (8) cultural values important to family members, (9) family willingness to accept services from outside the family, (10) the family's first language, and (11) families' concerns about service providers. A range of adherence was observed as most prevalent among each of the cultures and across generations and age groups.

Students were taught to collaboratively plan and revise their essays and independently write their essays using procedures artic-ulated by Wong, Butler, Ficzere, and Kuperis (1996). Results demonstrated notable increases in students' written protocols on the quantitative criteria (e.g., number of words written, prewriting and composing times). However, only three of the five students made gains related to writing clarity and cogency. Students' per-formance improved from \"below basic\" to \"basic\" or \"proficient\" levels with respect to qualitative criteria (i.e., focus, content, and organization) on the statewide writing assessment. Although transfer effects to a different writing task, person, and setting were evident for all students on the quantitative criteria, these effects were mixed on the qualitative criteria. Social validity data indicated student and teacher satisfaction with the planning/writing intervention. Implications of the study for argumentative essay writing instruction are discussed.\n      </p>", "The main purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between some of the sociodemographic characteristics of the handicapped who live in the earthquake region of Sakarya city center, and the self-esteem and levels of anxiety of the handicapped. Participants in the study had low levels of education, half were married, nearly half had orthopedic disabilities, and one-third were blind. Among the reasons for handicap, the most common were illnesses, innate handicaps, accidents, and earthquakes. The proportion of those who became disabled after an earthquake was 9.5 percent. Not only have most of the disabled not yet received any medical treatment, but also only a minority are enrolled in special education and rehabilitation programs. Among the disabled, unemployment was common and average income was low. Low rates of self-esteem and high rates of trait-anxiety were found.\n      </p>", "Aging mothers who lived with an adult child with either mental retardation (n = 308) or mental illness (n = 73) were studied prospectively over a three-year period to determine the antecedents and consequences of the end of co-residence between the aging mother and adult child. Different factors predicted the end of co-residence for the two sub-samples, but the consequences of this transition with respect to maternal burden and depressive symptoms were similar for the two groups. There was a high level of contact between the aging parent and adult child with disabilities even after the period of co-residence ended.\n      </p>", "No studies to date have examined access to insurance coverage or medical care for a broadly defined population of uninsured nonelderly adults with disabilities. This analysis uses the 2002 National Survey of America's Families to examine access to coverage, access to care, and service use for a large sample of adults with disabilities, with a focus on the uninsured. All disabled groups reported unmet need and service use greater than their nondisabled counterparts with the same insured status. Access to coverage was most problematic for low-income adults with work limitations but no other indication of disability, with over one-third uninsured. This group deserves greater policy attention.\n      </p>", "This research examines the relationship between disabilities in families and exits from welfare. Controlling for variations in characteristics known to be associated with welfare exits, this study investigates and documents that specific configurations of disabilities in families are also strongly associated with reduced rates of welfare exits. The impact of a child with a disability on welfare exits is similar to the mother's own disability, with an impact equivalent in magnitude to minority status. The presence of a child with a disability limits the chances that a mother with disability will leave welfare. Our findings add to the literature on welfare dependency and have implications for welfare reforms that emphasize work, self-sufficiency, and reducing poverty.\n      </p>", "In this study, we aimed to estimate the contribution of environmental pollutants to the incidence, prevalence, mortality, and costs of pediatric disease in American children. We examined four categories of illness: lead poisoning, asthma, cancer, and neurobehavioral disorders. To estimate the proportion of each attributable to toxins in the environment, we used an environmentally attributable fraction (EAF) model. EAFs for lead poisoning, asthma, and cancer were developed by panels of experts through a Delphi process, whereas that for neurobehavioral disorders was based on data from the National Academy of Sciences. We define environmental pollutants as toxic chemicals of human origin in air, food, water, and communities. To develop estimates of costs, we relied on data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Health Care Financing Agency, and the Practice Management Information Corporation. EAFs were judged to be 100% for lead poisoning, 30% for asthma (range, 10-35%), 5% for cancer (range, 2-10%), and 10% for neurobehavioral disorders (range, 5-20%). Total annual costs are estimated to be $54.9 billion (range $48.8-64.8 billion): $43.4 billion for lead poisoning, $2.0 billion for asthma, $0.3 billion for childhood cancer, and $9.2 billion for neurobehavioral disorders. This sum amounts to 2.8 percent of total U.S. health care costs. This estimate is likely low because it considers only four categories of illness, incorporates conservative assumptions, ignores costs of pain and suffering, and does not include late complications for which etiologic associations are poorly quantified. The costs of pediatric environmental disease are high, in contrast with the limited resources directed to research, tracking, and prevention.\n      </p>", "Learning disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, developmental delays, and emotional and behavioral problems are among childhood disabilities of increasing concern. Interacting genetic, environmental, and social factors are important determinants of childhood brain development and function. For many reasons, however, studying neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities in children is challenging. Moreover, inadequate incidence and trend data interfere with full understanding of the magnitude of the problem. Despite these difficulties, extensive laboratory and clinical studies of several neurodevelopmental toxicants, including lead, mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls, alcohol, and nicotine, demonstrate the unique vulnerability of the developing brain to environmental agents at exposure levels that have no lasting effect in adults. Historically, understanding the effects of these toxicants on the developing brain has emerged slowly while generations of children are exposed to unsafe levels. Unfortunately, with few exceptions, neurodevelopmental toxicity data are missing for most industrial chemicals in widespread use, even when populationwide exposures are documented. The personal, family, and communitywide costs of developmental disabilities are profound. In addition to the need for more research, a preventive public health response requires mitigation of exposures to potential neurodevelopmental toxicants when available evidence establishes the plausibility of harm, despite residual toxicologic uncertainties.\n      </p>", "The effect of teacher\u2014student attunement on the academic performance of students with and without learning disabilities was examined. Each Grade 4 student (24 with learning disabilities and 24 without learning disabilities, but matched on age and gender) was systematically exposed to 2 teaching approaches\u2014attuned vs. nonattuned (traditional) at different times using different academic contents (mathematics and social studies). Teaching transpired within 8 naturally occurring classrooms; students were given pre- and posttests to assess their learning. A manipulation check indicated that the attuned teaching resulted in significantly more teacher\u2014student attunement than did the nonattuned condition. The attuned teaching condition significantly improved academic performance over nonattuned teaching. When exposed to attuned teaching, girls without learning disabilities exhibited significantly greater improvement than did girls with learning disabilities.\n      </p>", "Mutations in the HSD17B10 gene were identif ied in two previously described mentally retarded males. A point mutation c.776G&gt;C was found from a survivor (SV), whereas a potent mutation, c.419C&gt;T, was identified in another deceased case (SF) with undetectable hydroxysteroid (17\u03b2) dehydrogenase 10 (HSD10) activity. Protein levels of mutant HSD10(R130C) in patient SF and HSD10(E249Q) in patient SV were about half that of HSD10 in normal controls. The E249Q mutation appears to affect HSD10 subunit interactions, resulting in an allosteric regulatory enzyme. For catalyzing the oxidation of allopregnanolone by NAD\u207a the Hill coefficient of the mutant enzyme is \u22481.3. HSD10(E249Q) was unable to catalyze the dehydrogenation of 2-methyl-3-hydroxy-butyryi-CoA and the oxidation of allopregnanolone, a positive modulator of the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A receptor, at low substrate concentrations. Neurosteroid homeostasis is critical for normal cognitive development, and there is increasing evidence that a blockade of isoleucine catabolism alone does not commonly cause developmental disabilities. The results support the theory that an imbalance in neurosteroid metabolism could be a major cause of the neurological handicap associated with hydroxysteroid (17\u03b2) dehydrogenase 10 deficiency.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Gregory B. Lewis and Cheryl Lynn Allee ask that question in light of the recent passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (1990). Disabled federal employees have had such protection since passage of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act. Using an annual sample drawn from OPM's Central Personnel Data File between 1977 and 1989, the authors focused their analysis on hiring patterns, grade level assignments, and promotions. Lewis and Allee found that disabled federal employees \"made few gains in the federal work force except in their numbers.\" While cautious in attributing these findings to discriminatory practices, the study's authors suggest that greater attention be paid to what happens to the career paths of disabled Americans.\n      </p>", "This study examined the effectiveness and efficiency of combining classwide peer tutoring (CWPT) and constant time delay (CTD) on the academic performance of 3 students with learning disabilities (LD) and 15 students without LD enrolled in an inclusive sixth-grade language arts class. Treatment integrity checklists were used to measure the extent to which the tutors with LD used the constant time delay procedure correctly. A multiple-probe design across behaviors replicated across students was used to examine the effectiveness of the CTD peer tutoring procedures. The results indicated that students with LD reliably implemented the CTD peer tutoring procedures with a high degree of treatment integrity. When implemented by students without LD, the procedures were effective and efficient for teaching targeted vocabulary words to students with LD. Similarly students without LD mastered the targeted vocabulary words when tutored by peers with LD and by peers without LD using the CTD peer tutoring procedures. Additionally, students with LD and without LD maintained the targeted vocabulary words over time, generalized the words across context, and generalized the CTD peer tutoring procedures across content. Finally, measures of social validity indicate that students and teachers involved in this study were satisfied with the CTD peer tutoring procedures.\n      </p>", "This article demonstrates the role that courts have played in the development and implementation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.

The current work presents 2 studies, including a total of 488 families with children with disabilities, which were conducted to complete the development of a scale to assess family quality of life. The measure was refined through confirmatory factor analyses into 25 items that assess 5 domains of Family Quality of Life: Family Interaction, Parenting, Emotional Well-Being, Physical/Material Well-Being, and Disability-Related Support. Each subscale was found to be unidimensional and internally consistent. An initial examination of test-retest reliability and convergent validity is also presented.

Recent legislation and testing initiatives provide an impetus to generating more information about potential hazards to children. In the United States, the 1996 Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) required the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) to make a finding that a pesticide food use is safe for children. In addition, the law requires U.S. EPA to incorporate an additional 10-fold factor in risk assessments for pesticide residue tolerances to take into account the special sensitivities of infants and children as well as incomplete data with respect to toxicity and exposures. The potential of chemicals in food and drinking water to cause endocrine disruption will also be examined via the Endocrine Disruptor Screening and Testing Program required by the FQPA and the 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act. In addition, a new voluntary chemical information program will provide screening-level information for the some 2,800 high-volume chemicals in commerce in the United States. These initiatives will need to be accompanied by research focused on developmental toxicity for children, including developmental disabilities. Developmental disabilities exact a large toll on children's health in the United States. Three major developmental disabilities-autism, cerebral palsy, and severe mental retardation-each affect substantial numbers of children. We know very little about the etiology of these conditions. A number of priority areas for research are suggested, including a large environmental prospective study of developmental neurotoxicity.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "This paper examines the relationship between military service status (active duty, veteran, never served), sex, and six functional limitations/disabilities using data from the 5% sample of the 2000 U.S. Census. We estimate multivariate logistic regression models separately for men and women, and evaluate sex differences by comparing coefficients across models using a Wald chi-square test and computing predicted probabilities. For both men and women, the highest rates of functional limitation/disability are observed among veterans, while the lowest rates are recorded among active duty personnel. The increased odds of functional limitations/disabilities associated with veteran status is higher among women than men, whereas the decreased odds of functional limitations/disabilities associated with active duty status is lower among women than men. The predicted probabilities, which are based on a subgroup of 40-49 year olds with select sociodemographic characteristics, indicate that veteran women's probabilities of many types of functional limitations/disabilities equal or exceed those of veteran men. Overall, the findings suggest women experience a more detrimental effect of past military service and a less beneficial effect of current military service. More life course analysis with longitudinal data that accounts for factors that influence sex-differentiation with respect to selection into military service, experiences in the military, and the short-and long-term consequences of military service is needed to fully understand sex differences in the relationship between military service and functional limitations/disabilities.\n      </p>", "Numerous connections between allergies and learning disabilities have been made in the popular press and other media directed to parents of the learning disabled. This article briefly traces the reasons for this association and critically analyzes existing research of such factors as school underachievement and learning problems, listening and hearing problems, absenteeism, and social-emotional disorders. Results of a comparison of group achievement scores, school attendance records, and medical symptoms of allergic and nonallergic students with and without learning disabilities raise serious questions about the purported relationship between allergies and learning problems.\n      </p>", "There is a widespread expectation that the combination of significant population ageing in Europe over the coming decades, along with the fact that the elderly are more likely to have disabilities, will result in a large increase in the total prevalence of disability and the need for significantly expanded care facilities for the elderly. Recent evidence from the U.S., however, suggests that disability rates of the elderly are declining and that further declines could be expected in the future. In this paper we present alternative demographic scenarios for the European Union (EU-15) that distinguish between people with and without disabilities by age and sex. The results show that under the assumption of a constant age-specific disability profile, we indeed expect a significant increase in the total number of people with disabilities due to population ageing. However, if the age profile of disability is shifted to the right (i.e., to higher ages) by one, two, or three years per decade, the scenarios show a much lower or no increase in the number of persons with disabilities in Europe over the coming decades.\n      </p>", "No Child Left Behind (NCLB) creates a high-stakes environment by holding schools accountable for how all students perform on state assessments, including students with disabilities and students who are English Language Learners.

In addition to a number of constructs found in many existing definitions, responses include perceptions and conceptualizations that are only available from first-hand experience of living with learning disabilities into the adult years. Even when these perceptions evidence technical inaccuracies, their personal nature offers important insights into the effects of learning disabilities throughout the lifespan.

Our findings show that (1) of those with disabilities, about 1 in 13 males and 1 in 33 females live in GQ; (2) GQ rates are higher for individuals reporting mental, self-care, or go-outside-the-home disabilities than for those reporting sensory, physical, or employment disabilities; (3) younger males with disabilities are more likely to reside there, particularly at institutional GQ, reflecting their relatively high incarceration rate; (4) individuals with and without disabilities who are black, American Indian, were never married, or have less than a high school education have higher GQ residence rates; (5) 40% of male and 62% of female GQ residents have a disability; (6) adding GQ residents to household residents increases estimated disability prevalence for males by 6%, and the estimated difference between disability prevalence rates by gender nearly disappears; and (7) inclusion of the GQ population substantially lowers employment rate estimates for young males, blacks, and American Indians.\n      </p>", "A comprehensive literature review revealed 66 reports involving science education for students with disabilities. These investigations were subdivided into (a) instructional strategies--including, instructional variables, mnemonic techniques, and text adaptations--and (b) science curriculum evaluation or comparison reports and involved students of all disability areas. Overall, it was found that (a) instructional variables including study guides and text adaptations exhibited a positive effect on student learning, behavior, and motivation; (b) mnemonic strategies were very effective in facilitating verbal knowledge of scientific phenomena; and (c) activities-oriented science curricula generally were effective in facilitating knowledge of science content, manipulative skills, and science process skills.

Methods A database on permanent occupational disabilities occurring between 1986 and 2000 was linked with the national death registry database to construct the survival function. A method with Monte Carlo simulation was used to extrapolate survival for up to 600 months to derive the life expectancy for different disability grades (N=81 249). A Cox (proportional hazard) regression was carried out to explore the determinants and to estimate the hazard ratios. Demographic variables, including age, gender, insured wage, severity of disability, injury causes, and organ-system disability, were included in the model as covariates. Results The results indicate that the survival period for workers suffering permanent occupational disabilities is shorter than that of the general population, amounting to an estimated loss of life expectancy ranging from 5 to 19 years. After adjustment for age and gender, a higher severity of disability, impairment of vital organs or lower extremities, and a lower insured wage had a significant association with shorter survival. Injury types, including transportation incidents, being struck by sliding objects, or a trip, slip or stumble, and collapse injury, indicated hazard ratios of between 1.24 and 1.34, as compared with injuries such as being trapped or caught in machinery. Conclusions The findings identify major determinants for predicting survival for workers with permanent occupational disabilities; these determinants may be of use in improving the equity of the compensation system for workers.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

As in many other policy areas, inferring program effectiveness is difficult because students not in special education do not provide a good comparison group. By following students who move in and out of targeted programs, however, we are able to identify program effectiveness from changes over time in individual performance. We find that the average special education program significantly boosts mathematics achievement of special-education students, particularly those classified as learning-disabled or emotionally disturbed, while not detracting from regular-education students. These results are estimated quite precisely from models of students and school-by-grade-by-year fixed effects in achievement gains, and they are robust to a series of specification tests.\n      </p>", "In an earlier study, a consistent preference pattern in the rank-ordering of various types of physical disabilities was demonstrated among children aged 10 and 11.

In the present paper we postulate two factors significant in the acquisition of a value: (1) the child's exposure to the value, and (2) the child's ability to learn the value. From the first factor we predicted that adults hold the same preference pattern to the various disabilities; and that Jewish and Italian children, coming from subcultures which, we believed, held different values related to physical appearance, would hold a different preference pattern. From the second factor we predicted that mentally retarded and emotionally disturbed children would hold preference patterns that differ from the normative. The results supported these hypotheses.\n      </p>", "Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), employers must provide employees with disabilities reasonable accommodations that will enable them to perform job duties, as long as the accommodations do not financially burden the organization. Two studies were conducted to investigate whether disability origin and/or prior work history impermissibly influence the granting of reasonable accommodations under the ADA. In both studies, participants granted more accommodations for employees whose disability was caused by some external factor than for those whose disability was caused by the employee's own behavior. In Study Two, participants also granted more and costlier accommodations for an employee with an excellent work history than for an employee with an average work history.
