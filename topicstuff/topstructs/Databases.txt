{"total_words": 1305, "documents": ["We have implemented a pair of database projects, one serving cortical electrophysiology and the other invertebrate neurones and recordings. The design for each combines aspects of two proven schemes for information interchange. The journal article metaphor determined the type, scope, organization and quantity of data to comprise each submission. Sequence databases encouraged intuitive tools for data viewing, capture, and direct submission by authors. Neurophysiology required transcending these models with new datatypes. Time-series, histogram and bivariate datatypes, including illustration-like wrappers, were selected by their utility to the community of investigators. As interpretation of neurophysiological recordings depends on context supplied by metadata attributes, searches are via visual interfaces to sets of controlled-vocabulary metadata trees. Neurones, for example, can be specified by metadata describing functional and anatomical characteristics. Permanence is advanced by data model and data formats largely independent of contemporary technology or implementation, including Java and the XML standard. All user tools, including dynamic data viewers that serve as a virtual oscilloscope, are Java-based, free, multiplatform, and distributed by our application servers to any contemporary networked computer. Copyright is retained by submitters; viewer displays are dynamic and do not violate copyright of related journal figures. Panels of neurophysiologists view and test schemas and tools, enhancing community support.\n      </p>", "In industrial and government settings, there is often a need to perform statistical analyses that require data stored in multiple distributed databases. However, the barriers to literally integrating these data can be substantial, even insurmountable. In this article we show how tools from information technology-specifically, secure multiparty computation and networking-can be used to perform statistically valid analyses of distributed databases. The common characteristic of these methods is that the owners share sufficient statistics computed on the local databases in a way that protects each owner's data from the other owners. Our focus is on horizontally partitioned data, in which data records rather than attributes are spread among the databases. We present protocols for securely performing regression, maximum likelihood estimation, and Bayesian analysis, as well as secure construction of contingency tables. We outline three current research directions: a software system implementing the protocols, secure EM algorithms, and partially trusted third parties, which reduce incentives for owners to be dishonest.\n      </p>", "Objective\u2014To determine the efficiency of the major bibliographic databases by assessing the percentage of references among the total literature available that can be retrieved from each database. We also evaluated the best database combinations to carry out an exhaustive search. Methods\u2014BIOSIS, EMBASE, MEDLINE, NIOSH-TIC, and TOXLINE were searched on two topics: allergy to latex and asbestos and mesothelioma, in the title, abstract, or keywords (textwords). This search was performed for the years 1994 and 1995. All the records were classified by journal and author's name and were verified for each record whether or not it was indexed in each database. Statistical analysis was performed with \u03a72 test. Results\u2014777 articles in 510 issues were found. The efficiency of each database (percentage of articles recovered) and of combinations varied between 11% and 63% for one database and between 42% and 86% for a combination of two databases. The reasons why these differences exist between databases, and within a database, between two different subjects or two different years are reported. Conclusion\u2014Firstly, it is not advisable to assert that a bibliography is complete when only one database is searched. Secondly, the efficiency of the databases may be quite different. Finally, it is suggested that the best way to be as exhaustive as possible is to search two or more databases\u2014for example, in EMBASE and TOXLINE, or to a lesser extent EMBASE and MEDLINE. This seems to be the best compromise solution between time consumed for searching and efficiency.\n      </p>", "Advances in DNA technology and the discovery of DNA polymorphisms have permitted the creation of DNA databases of individuals for the purpose of criminal investigation. Many ethical and legal problems arise in the preparation of a DNA database, and these problems are especially important when one analyses the legal regulations on the subject. In this paper three main groups of possibilities, three systems, are analysed in relation to databases. The first system is based on a general analysis of the population; the second one is based on the taking of samples for a particular list of crimes, and a third is based only on the specific analysis of each case. The advantages and disadvantages of each system are compared and controversial issues are then examined. We found the second system to be the best choice for Spain and other European countries with a similar tradition when we weighed the rights of an individual against the public's interest in the prosecution of a crime.\n      </p>", "This research describes and analyzes schemes for managing decision support databases that are extracted from a central database and \"downloaded\" to personal workstations. Unlike a (true) distributed database system, where updates are propagated to maintain consistency, these remote \"snapshots\" are updated only periodically (\"refreshed\") upon command of the remote workstation user. This approach to data management has many of the same advantages of a distributed database over a centralized database (e. g., reduced communication costs, improved response time for retrievals, and reduction in contention), but it avoids the high overhead for concurrency control associated with updating in a distributed database. The added cost is in reduced data consistency. The schemes analyzed include full regeneration, the scheme used by System R*, and two new schemes. One new scheme\u2014called modified regeneration\u2014is a variation on simple full regeneration of the snapshot, but transmits only relevant changes to the snapshot The other new scheme uses a difference table of relevant updates. Algorithm descriptions, models of processing and communication costs, analytical and numerical comparison of performance, and qualitative evaluation are included. Our conclusions are that the difference-table approach is the most robust scheme; the System R* scheme has lowest cost for only rather limited environments; and the modified-regeneration scheme is attractive due to its simplicity and flexibility. The results and models presented here could be used by a DBMS \"refresh optimizer\" to determine the best scheme to employ as a function of refresh frequency, update rate, and various processing and communication cost parameters.\n      </p>", "This paper discusses the discourse of 'participation' in the context of genetic databases. Focusing on UK Biobank, it suggests that this discourse can be seen as a reflexive institutional response to public ambivalence towards science and expertise. Drawing on empirical evidence from focus groups, I explore how people from various backgrounds constructed and contested two different kinds of participation in UK Biobank. The first relates to people providing research materials to genetic databases and the second to people becoming 'co-decision makers' in these projects. My analysis highlights how focus groups positioned themselves and others in relation to UK Biobank and drew on a variety of 'discursive repertoires', such as altruism, public ignorance, expertise, and lay empowerment. I conclude that discourses of participation reflect the way people position themselves and others - as experts, publics, patients, or research subjects - in relation to the opportunities and uncertainties of new biomedical research.\n      </p>", "A statistical database aims at providing users with statistics about the population while not compromising the confidentiality of the individuals whose data are included in the database. Threats to the database security range from issuing cleverly designed sequences of queries to using such sophisticated methods as regression analysis. In order to overcome this security problem, several solution methods have been suggested in the literature. These methods can be classified under four general approaches: conceptual modeling; query restriction; data perturbation; and output perturbation. These methods, however, can be easily compromised, or require excessive CPU and memory, or result in biased response to users. The purpose of this paper is to propose a new type of output perturbation method that may be very difficult to compromise and provides unbiased response. The method is based on recoding of the data, the jackknifing concept, and an extension of the random sample queries method suggested by Denning [5]. A comparison of the proposed method and the modified random sample queries method (which is considered a viable alternative for security of statistical databases) is presented.\n      </p>", "Online searchers are faced with an ever-increasing number of databases, search techniques, and vendors.

The experience of using a computerized abstracting service as a source of information on mergers/acquisitions in the chemical industry is reviewed. This experience informs an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of similar databases as information sources in economic geography. The proliferation of such databases, together with advances in text management software, suggests that their potential has not been fully appreciated. This potential is considerable in providing easy access to detailed factual information on economic events and processes at continental and global scales. It is, however, strictly limited when it comes to interpreting the corporate strategies and motivations responsible for these developments.\n      </p>", "Many important strategic applications involve inter-corporate linkage or intra-corporate integration of information. This requires multiple databases to work together. We refer to this category of information systems as Composite Information Systems (eis). Migrating from separate systems to a more fully integrated CIS environment is usually a difficult, expensive, and time-consuming process both due to technical and organizational realities. An evolutionary approach is presented in this paper to meet the challenge. The essence of this approach is captured in four eis principles: (1) the separation of data from processing; (2) the use of flexible tools; (3) the use of interfaces that facilitate data conversion and communication between processing components and databases; and (4) the explicit recognition of the eis environment. Based on these principles, we delineate five stages of evolution, which may co-exist: (1) separate systems; (2) virtual-driver; (3) logical separation; (4) physical separation; and (5) specialized functional engine. The opportunities for strategic uses of information technology in organizations are often blocked by the difficulties of getting from the current state to the desired situation. The evolutionary process presented in this article has been found to be effective in overcoming this problem.\n      </p>", "This article considers errors in databases commonly used by researchers. Specifically, the study investigates the manner in which the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) tapes adjusts prices for stock distributions, i.e., stock dividends and stock splits. All distributions reported by CRSP during the period January 1 through December 31, 1989 were reviewed for proper distribution code, record date, ex-dividend date, and distribution date by comparison to a secondary data source, Moody's Dividend Record (MDR). Additionally, the accuracy of the factor used by CRSP to adjust the price and number of shares outstanding for the stock distribution was verified by comparison to MDR. Completeness of CRSP reporting was tested by tracing all stock distributions reported by MDR back into the CRSP tapes. In all, 718 distributions were examined. All differences (142, or 20 percent of the distributions) were reconciled where possible (11 could not be resolved) by examination of the respective companies' annual reports. Coding differences (91, or 64 percent of the differences) arose because of CRSP policy of designating as stock dividends all distributions that are less than or equal to 20 percent of the then-existing shares while all others are stock splits. This coding policy may affect research that uses stock distributions to test signalling by management. The remaining 51 exceptions (36 percent) included 20 ex-date differences that were perceived to be of little consequence, and 31 dissimilarities (22 percent) that are considered significant. In 27 of these variances, CRSP was found to be in error, which ranged from 75 percent to 100 percent when compared to primary data sources. In a second phase, the 1990 CRSP tape was examined to follow-up the status of 44 errors observed in the data review of previous work by these authors utilizing 1981 and 1982 data and of errors detected in phase one of this study. The evidence demonstrates that some errors remain undetected for long periods of time. Finally, the degree to which errors may affect the statistical testing of volume variables showed no significant bias.\n      </p>", "An architecture for federating heterogeneous dictionary databases is described. It proposes a common description language and query language to provide for the exchange of information between databases with different organizations, on different platforms and in different DBMSs. The common query language has an SQL like structure. The first version of the description language follows the TEI standard tag definitions for dictionaries with the expectation that the description language will be expanded in the future. A practical implementation of the proposals using WWW technology for two multi-lingual dictionaries is described.\n      </p>", "This paper reports a detailed evaluation of the effectiveness of a system that has been developed for the identification and retrieval of morphological variants in searches of Latin text databases. A user of the retrieval system enters the principal parts of the search term (two parts for a noun or adjective, three parts for a deponent verb, and four parts for other verbs), this enabling the identification of the type of word that is to be processed and of the rules that are to be followed in determining the morphological variants that should be retrieved. Two different search algorithms are described. The algorithms are applied to the Latin portion of the Hartlib Papers Collection and to a range of classical, vulgar and medieval Latin texts drawn from the Patrologia Latina and from the PHI Disk 5.3 datasets. The effectiveness of these searches demonstrates the effectiveness of our procedures in providing access to the full range of classical and post-classical Latin text databases.\n      </p>", "Identifying attribute correspondences across heterogeneous databases is a critical and time-consuming step in integrating the databases. Past research has applied correlation analysis techniques to explore correspondences between attributes. These techniques, however, are appropriate for numeric attributes that are linearly related. This paper proposes an information-theoretic approach to exploring correspondences between attributes in heterogeneous databases. The proposed approach is applicable to character attributes, as well as to numeric attributes, regardless whether or not they are linearly related. It overcomes some serious shortcomings of previous approaches based on correlation analysis and has much broader applicability. The proposed procedure samples both matching and nonmatching pairs of records from the databases under consideration, applies matching functions to compare pairs of attributes, and then uses the mutual information to measure the dependency between a matching function as applied to a pair of attributes and the class (i.e., matching or nonmatching) of a pair of records. A high mutual information index implies a potential attribute correspondence, which is presented to the analyst for further evaluation. The paper also presents some empirical results demonstrating the utility of the proposed approach.\n      </p>", "A survey of faculty members at Texas A&amp;M University revealed that 21 percent were searching databases from their offices and labs without centralized funding or assistance from the Library. Results of the survey indicate that \"convenience\" was the reason most faculty were searching from their offices rather than through the Library. Faculty were willing to spend money on the convenience of having their own subscriptions rather than taking advantage of the Library's heavily subsidized After Dark Program. The results of the survey indicate that users will use distributed access to databases. Three Wilson databases were loaded onto the University main frame and made available through the Library's online catalog, NOTIS.\n      </p>", "This paper provides a first outline of the European Network of Health Economic Evaluation Databases (EURO NHEED) project. The project is funded by the European Commission and will implement, in 7 European centres based in France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom, databases on the economic evaluation of healthcare interventions. The network will be based on two existing and well-established resources, namely the UK's NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), and France's Connaissances et D\u00e9cision en EConomie de la Sant\u00e9 (CODECS) database. EURO NHEED will initially cover 17 European countries and will provide its users with bibliographic records, detailing the main characteristics of all included studies. In addition, structured abstracts will be provided for articles identified as full economic evaluations (cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness or cost-utility), which will offer a detailed critique of the findings and the methodology used. These databases will be accessible free of charge on the Internet. The EURO NHEED project is the first attempt to develop such a resource on a multi-national basis. The project will bring together Health Economists and Information Scientists from the European Union and beyond and is anticipated to facilitate a number of benefits and advances in the field of Health Economics. These include harmonisation and increased understanding of the theory and methodology of economic evaluation in healthcare, the interpretation of the generalisability of studies to target settings, and the influence of healthcare system variations among the European countries. The project will therefore advance the state of the art in collecting, summarising, critiquing and disseminating economic evaluations of healthcare conducted within Europe.\n      </p>", "Because primary data collection can be expensive, researchers are increasingly using information collected in medical administrative databases for scientific purposes. This information, however, is typically collected for reasons other than research, and many such databases have been shown to contain substantial proportions of misclassification errors. For example, many administrative databases contain fields for patient diagnostic codes, but these are often missing or inaccurate, in part because physician reimbursement schemes depend on medical acts performed rather than any diagnosis. Errors in ascertaining which individuals have a given disease bias not only prevalence estimates, but also estimates of associations between the disease and other variables, such as medication use. We attempt to estimate the prevalence of osteoarthritis (OA) among elderly Quebeckers using a government administrative database. We compare a naive estimate relying solely on the physician diagnoses of OA listed in the database to estimates from several different Bayesian latent class models which adjust for misclassified physician diagnostic codes via use of other available diagnostic clues. We find that the prevalence estimates vary widely, depending on the model used and assumptions made. We conclude that any inferences from these databases need to be interpreted with great caution, until further work estimating the reliability of database items is carried out. /// Puisque la collecte de donn\u00e9es primaire peut \u00eatre co\u00fbteuses, les chercheurs emploient de plus en plus pour des buts scientifiques l'information rassembl\u00e9e dans les bases de donn\u00e9es administratives m\u00e9dicales. Cette information, cependant, est typiquement rassembl\u00e9e pour des raisons autres que pour la recherche, et on a montr\u00e9 que beaucoup de telles bases de donn\u00e9es contiennent de substantielles proportions d'erreurs de classification. Par exemple, beaucoup de bases de donn\u00e9es administratives contiennent des champs pour des codes diagnostiques des patients, mais ils sont souvent absents ou impr\u00e9cis, en partie parce que les remboursements des m\u00e9decins d\u00e9pendent des actes m\u00e9dicaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s plut\u00f4t que de n'importe quel diagnostic.

Nevertheless, they have limitations. We studied three of these limitations: (1) inadequacy of raw data to describe richness patterns due to sampling bias, (2) lack of survey effort assessment (and lack of exhaustiveness in compiling data about survey effort), and (3) lack of coverage of the geographic and environmental variations that affect the distribution of organisms. We used a biodiversity database (BIOTA-Canarias) to analyze richness data from a well-known group (seed plants) in an intensively surveyed area (Tenerife Island). Observed richness and survey effort were highly correlated. Species accumulation curves could not be used to determine survey effort because data digitalization was not exhaustive, so we identified well-sampled sites based on observed richness to sampling effort ratios. We also developed a predictive model based on the data from well-sampled sites and analyzed the origin of the geographic errors in the obtained extrapolation by means of a geographically constrained cross-validation. The spatial patterns of seed-plant species richness obtained from BIOTA-Canarias data were incomplete and biased. Therefore, some improvements are needed to use this database (and many others) in biodiversity studies. We propose a protocol that includes controls on data quality, improvements on data digitalization and survey design to improve data quality, and some alternative data analysis strategies that will provide a reliable picture of biodiversity patterns.\n      </p>", "Objectives. A hierarchical classification for avoidable morbidity in infants was developed based on a conceptual model for causes of morbidity. Experts rated the impact of risk factors and health services on diseases coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Classification Modification (ICD-9-CM). An etiologic framework was chosen for the classification because knowledge of etiology often suggests strategies for prevention. Causes of morbidity that cluster on the basis of similar risk factors might be avoided using similar strategies. Methods. Diseases (346 different diagnoses) were rated by 16 general pediatricians; 12 attributes were considered, including the impact on disease occurrence and on severity of five risk factors, preventive health services, and medical treatment. Raters evaluated the impact of health services, constitutional risk factors, and environmental risk factors without regard for service site (eg, inpatient, emergency department, primary care office). Environmental risk factor categories, including family, social, and physical environments, were rated separately. The impact of health services was rated on prevention, treatment, and complications of care. Results. Only ratings indicating that the impact of a risk factor category was substantial were used for the final classification of 275 diagnoses. Consistent with the multifactorial etiology of many diseases, many diagnoses had ratings indicating substantial impact of multiple risk factors. Five mutually exclusive clusters were derived from the 12 ratings based on factor analysis and recognized strategies for prevention. Ordered by level of avoidability, these clusters were termed vaccine-preventable, health-care quality indicators, environmental, environmental/constitutional, and constitutional. Conclusions. The usefulness of this classification for policy-oriented epidemiologic and health services research is grounded in the premise that prevention is the cardinal objective of child health policy. Cluster-specific hospitalization rates, ie, rates aggregated for all diagnoses falling in a cluster, might be used for allocating resources to interventions directed at environmental or health service determinants of morbidity. Widespread use of ICD-9-CM codes in hospital discharge and ambulatory databases suggests many potential applications for this classification of morbidity burden in population groups.\n      </p>", "Data perturbation and query restriction are two methods developed to protect confidential data in statistical databases. In the former, the data is systematically changed to yield answers to queries that are statistically similar to those that would have resulted from the original data. The latter provides exact answers to queries as long as the risk of exact disclosure of confidential data does not become too great. We present a new methodology to combine these techniques so that the advantages of both are captured. The model is appropriate and computationally viable for large databases whether the queries are linear or nonlinear. The query restriction phase consists of finding an optimal subset of queries to answer exactly without compromising the database. This is an NP-hard problem with a matroid intersection structure that lends itself to an efficient greedy heuristic. Then, given the queries that are answered exactly, we implement a data perturbation phase that provides stochastic protection and consistency. We present computational results on a large database with both linear and nonlinear queries. The results indicate that many queries can be answered exactly and the proposed perturbation approach provides more accurate answers than the standard perturbation method.\n      </p>", "Objectives To describe the multicentre clinical databases that exist in the United Kingdom, to report on their quality, to explore which organisational and managerial features are associated with high quality, and to make recommendations for improvements. Design Cross sectional survey, with interviews with database custodians and search of electronic bibliographic database (PubMed). Studies reviewed 105 clinical databases across the United Kingdom. Results Clinical databases existed in all areas of health care, but their distribution was uneven\u2014cancer and surgery were better covered than mental health and obstetrics. They varied greatly in age, size, growth rate, and geographical areas covered. Their scope (and thus their potential uses) and the quality of the data collected also varied. The latter was not associated with any organisational characteristics. Despite impressive achievements, many faced substantial financial uncertainty. Considerable scope existed for improvements: greater use of nationally approved codes; more support from relevant professional organisations; greater involvement by nurses, allied health professionals, managers, and laypeople in database management teams; and more attention to data security and ensuring patient confidentiality. With some notable exceptions, the audit and research potential of most databases had not been realised: half the databases had each produced only four or fewer peer reviewed research articles. Conclusions At least one clinical database support unit is needed in the United Kingdom to provide assistance in organisation and management, information technology, epidemiology, and statistics. Without such an initiative, the variable picture of databases reported here is likely to persist and their potential not be realised.\n      </p>", "Genome-related databases have already become an invaluable part of the scientific landscape. The role played by these databases will only increase as the volume and complexity of relevant biology data rapidly expand. We are far enough into the genome project and into the development of these databases to assess their attributes and to reexamine some of the conceptual organizations and approaches they are taking. It is clear that there are needs for both highly detailed and simplified database views, the latter being especially needed to make expert domain data more accessible to nonspecialists.\n      </p>", "Multiple scenarios are critical to \"what-if\" analysis. Scenarios are built using alternate versions of a database; each version shows, in detail, the result of a decision or a combination of decisions. Relational database management systems, despite their widespread use, lack the explicit capabilities for what-if analysis. We present a concept called independently updated views (IUVs) for creating multiple scenarios. An IUV corresponds to a version of the database. Each version is manipulated and updated as if it were the \"real\" database; however, only differences between the version and the real database are stored. This paper describes an experiment for measuring the overhead of using IUVs for supporting what-if analysis for a range of typical views and queries. Results indicate that the overhead is minimal for creating what-if scenarios based on views with aggregate functions (SUM, AVG) and on views that are small subsets of the database. These are the classes of views that are more often used in decision making. For views that require retrieval of entire or large portions of the database, the overhead can be high and special data structures may be required.\n      </p>", "Adaptive and science-based management is widely accepted as necessary to safeguard wildlife and their habitats into the future. However, many of the decisions in this field are still based on unsupported ideas that lack validation with real data and which do not make their analysis available for a public review. Decisions based on soft foundations can be harmful to wildlife, habitat and the survival of both. I suggest a new wildlife management approach founded on scientific databases that has become possible, if not imperative, with improved technology and increasing access to freely available data over the Word Wide Web (WWW). This approach is partly a consequence of the effective implementation of the U.S. Freedom of Information Act and the National Spatial Data Infrastructure. In order to justify management decisions relating to wildlife, habitat, and conservation, the listing, use, and full investigation of all available and relevant databases needs to be implemented, voluntarily or legally, as a prerequisite. Second, similar to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Standards, each major wildlife management decision needs to add a standard management documentation system as a backup that clearly records what data and research were or were not available at that time and what the recommended research still needs to address in order to complete the data situation and to decrease uncertainty.\n      </p>", "The sharing of databases either within or across organizations raises the possibility of unintentionally revealing sensitive relationships contained in them. Recent advances in data-mining technology have increased the chances of such disclosure. Consequently, firms that share their databases might choose to hide these sensitive relationships prior to sharing. Ideally, the approach used to hide relationships should be impervious to as many data-mining techniques as possible, while minimizing the resulting distortion to the database. This paper focuses on frequent item sets, the identification of which forms a critical initial step in a variety of data-mining tasks. It presents an optimal approach for hiding sensitive item sets, while keeping the number of modified transactions to a minimum. The approach is particularly attractive as it easily handles databases with millions of transactions. Results from extensive tests conducted on publicly available real data and data generated using IBM's synthetic data generator indicate that the approach presented is very effective, optimally solving problems involving millions of transactions in a few seconds.\n      </p>", "Amphibian population declines and sudden species' extinctions began to be noted at the beginning of the 1980s. Understanding the causes of the losses is hampered by our poor knowledge of the amphibian fauna in many parts of the world. Amphibian taxa are still being described at a high rate, especially in the tropics, which means that even quantifying species lost as a percentage of the current fauna can be a misleading statistic in some parts of the globe. The number of species that have gone missing is only one measure of the loss of biodiversity. Long-term studies of single-species populations are needed, but this approach has its limits. Amphibian populations often show great annual variation in population size making it difficult, if not impossible, to use short-term studies as a basis for deciding if a population is increasing or decreasing in the long term. Aggregating single studies into databases and searching for patterns of variation is a way of overcoming this limitation. Several databases on species and population time series are available or in development. These records show that declines are continuing worldwide with some species and populations, especially in the tropics and at higher elevations, at greater risk of extinction than others. Unfortunately, amphibian databases with population time series have much less information for the tropics compared to the temperate zone, and less for Africa and Asia compared with Europe and North America. Focusing limited resources using comprehensive statistical designs is a way to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of monitoring efforts. It is clear that, in the first decades of the twenty-first century, the regions of the globe with the highest diversity of amphibian species will experience the greatest rates of decrease of forests and increase in human population size, fertilizer use, agricultural production, creation of new croplands and irrigation. Many of these changes are likely negatively to affect amphibian species diversity, and their influence must be understood before concluding, at least for amphibians, that the 2010 millennium assessment goal of significantly reversing the rate of loss of Earth's biodiversity can be met.\n      </p>", "The paper describes a prototype system called HiSQL (Historical SQL) which extends the functionality of SQL in manipulating historical data, by providing functions for spatial and temporal processing.

After a number of false starts, electronic web-based preparation and publication of floristic and taxonomic projects in the form of continually updated information systems and databases are beginning to replace conventional time- and information-limited floras and, to a lesser extent, monographs. Coincidental with these developments, the value of floristics is being questioned by some biologists on the grounds of its lack of scientific objectivity and its weakening of systematics as a scientific endeavour, while at the same time its fundamental importance, under the guise of completing the inventory of biodiversity, is being emphasised by other biologists and by the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Global Taxonomic Initiative. Other important developments that will affect the way in which floristics and monography are pursued, is the questioning of the continuing relevance of the Linnaean hierarchical structure of biological classification and proposals to replace it with a phylogenetic structure, and proposals to adopt phylogenetic species concepts. Both of these, however scientifically justified, would drastically affect the accessibility of the units of taxonomy to a large number of non-specialist users. In contrast to this, we are beginning to see in taxonomy policy-making, an increasing sensitivity to societal and ethical concerns that characterise \"post-normal science\". This includes the recognition of the need to command strong public identification such as response to user needs and concerns, and an acceptance that floristic and taxonomic work cannot be pursued as open-ended, long-term enterprises. There is a time limit imposed by human activities in destroying the very resource base of biodiversity that we are aiming to study.\n      </p>", "Objectives. In 1997, the Management Decision and Research Center of the Department of Veterans Affairs convened cost experts and health economists in a working meeting. Its goal was to provide consensus guidelines for conducting cost analyses in managed care systems, such as VA, that do not have encounter-level cost data or that do not prepare itemized patient bills. The impetus for the meeting was that too often computer-based cost data were proposed or used in studies that were inappropriate for the question being addressed. There was also a sense that often great effort was being expended by VA health economists \"reinventing the wheel\" in developing new cost components for each study. Methods. A group of 45 VA and non-VA health economists, health researchers, and policy-makers attended a 2 day working meeting organized around a series of case vignettes to identify areas of consensus, controversy, and gaps in knowledge. Results. Consensus emerged in the following four areas: (1) Cost Methods. A \"hybrid model\" was identified as the current standard of cost analysis in VA and entails mixing \"micro-costing\" primary data collection and \"gross-cost\" computer-based methods to reflect resource-use variations that are essential to the research question. (2) Cost Infrastructure. VA is developing a new, but unevaluated, costing system that could allow for computer-based cost analyses at much finer levels of detail than is currently possible. (3) Data Quality. Ongoing data validation of existing and developing cost databases is needed, especially concerning interfacility variation. (4) Dissemination. A new cost data center was recommended to provide training, information dissemination, and coordination. Conclusions. Consensus was reached about the hybrid model as the current paradigm for cost analysis in systems like VA.\n      </p>", "After 15 years of experience with Flora of Veracruz project it seems important to make an evaluation of its challenges and accomplishments. This is important because we believe it is the oldest on-going project using computers; is the oldest floristic project initiated, directed, and financed mostly by a tropical developing country; and because it has been a success in spite of being unfinished. We have always considered the Flora of Veracruz to be an experimental flora, a place to try new ideas and techniques. Through this approach we hoped that an information and technological transfer could be possible to established or beginning floristic programs.\n      </p>", "The legal status of information in its electronic forms of programs and data and the rights of individuals to keep private some information about themselves is not clearly defined in the current patchwork of old and new legislation on computer-based information. As information usage in organizations increases, there is a need to minimize the information liabilities of managers and their organizations. This article identifies key issues, reviews relevant laws, and highlights implications for information managers. The discussion centers on the protection of intellectual property rights concerning programs and data and the protection of individual rights to privacy of information stored in computer-based systems. Specific methods can help an organization establishing satisfactory legal posture to deal with these issues.\n      </p>", "Objective: To compare risk prediction models for death in hospital based on an administrative database with published results based on data derived from three national clinical databases: the national cardiac surgical database, the national vascular database and the colorectal cancer study. Design: Analysis of inpatient hospital episode statistics. Predictive model developed using multiple logistic regression. Setting: NHS hospital trusts in England. Patients: All patients admitted to an NHS hospital within England for isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm, and colorectal excision for cancer from 1996-7 to 2003-4. Main outcome measures: Deaths in hospital. Performance of models assessed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve scores measuring discrimination (&amp;lt;0.7=poor, 0.7-0.8=reasonable, &amp;gt;0.8=good) and both Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics and standardised residuals measuring goodness of fit. Results: During the study period 152 523 cases of isolated CABG with 3247 deaths in hospital (2.1%), 12 781 repairs of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (5987 deaths, 46.8%), 31 705 repairs of unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (3246 deaths, 10.2%), and 144 370 colorectal resections for cancer (10 424 deaths, 7.2%) were recorded. The power of the complex predictive model was comparable with that of models based on clinical datasets with ROC curve scores of 0.77 (v 0.78 from clinical database) for isolated CABG, 0.66 (v 0.65) and 0.74 (v 0.70) for repairs of ruptured and unruptured AAA, respectively, and 0.80 (v 0.78) for colorectal excision for cancer. Calibration plots generally showed good agreement between observed and predicted mortality. Conclusions: Routinely collected administrative data can be used to predict risk with similar discrimination to clinical databases. The creative use of such data to adjust for case mix would be useful for monitoring healthcare performance and could usefully complement clinical databases. Further work on other procedures and diagnoses could result in a suite of models for performance adjusted for case mix for a range of specialities and procedures.\n      </p>", "The Documentation Project is a cooperative project between Faculties of Arts in the Norwegian universities.

Scientific databases that give references for publications are numerous and widely used; scientific numeric databases that are open to the public are far fewer and less used. Online retrieval systems are becoming easier to use as a result of the introduction of artificial intelligence techniques and user-friendly front ends and gateways. Issues related to electronic databases include public-private sector competition, transborder data flow, copyright, downloading, and the changing roles in database generation and processing.\n      </p>", "Types of databases commonly used for handling taxonomic data are compared. It is shown that none of the existing types of databases fully support the requirements of taxonomic data. The results of this comparison provide a rationale for the design and implementation of a new database system based on an Extended Object-Oriented model. The new model, the Prometheus Object-Oriented Model (POOM) and its query language Prometheus Object-Oriented Language (POOL), are discussed in relation to the requirements of taxonomic data and the Prometheus Taxonomic Data Model. POOM provides the ability to represent the semantics of relationships between data. This allows us to build the type of graph structures that are found in taxonomic hierarchies. In addition, the system can query and manipulate these graphs (POOL). These features have been used to improve the original Prometheus Taxonomic Data Model. These improvements and the advantages they offer are described and discussed.\n      </p>", "A practical method is presented for giving unlimited, deterministically correct, numerical responses to ad-hoc queries to an online database, while not compromising confidential numerical data. The method is appropriate for any size database, and no assumptions are needed about the statistical distribution of the confidential data. Responses are in the form of a number plus a guarantee, so the user can determine an interval that is sure to contain the exact answer. Virtually any imaginable query type can be answered, and in the absence of insider information, collusion among the users presents no problem. Experimental analysis supports the practical viability of the proposed method.\n      </p>", "Large-scale biodiversity informatics projects will not properly address the needs of one important potential user group. Ecologists do not have ready access to datasets which allow them to assign plant species to functional types. We believe that information technology has developed sufficiently to allow taxonomists and ecologists to work together to address this need and develop specimen databases to combine taxonomic data with ecological and ecophysiological information so that this information will be assigned to the correct taxon in the future. Digital images provide a rapid and economical method of vouchering specimen data, reducing the need to store physical vouchers in herbaria.\n      </p>", "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) established several internal research organizations to analyze the many VA and non-VA databases. The information obtained assists VA in achieving its objective of providing cost-effective, high-quality health care for veterans. Each group has a unique and well-defined function. All major informational inputs needed for VA planning are covered by the groups: resource allocation, workload requirements, population projections, and technology assessment, among others. Both managerial and academic research are conducted. The Department of Veterans Affairs has demonstrated flexibility in initiating new research centers as the need arises, such as during the recent health care reform debates. The Department of Veterans Affairs has provided for the dissemination of information about research and databases by explicitly including this task as the focus of one group. A drawback to VA's research system is the minimal intercommunication among the groups. Learning about VA's internal research structure can assist other multihospital systems to identify their informational needs and establish suitable research organizations.\n      </p>", "Data mining is a new discipline lying at the interface of statistics, database technology, pattern recognition, machine learning, and other areas. It is concerned with the secondary analysis of large databases in order to find previously unsuspected relationships which are of interest or value to the database owners. New problems arise, partly as a consequence of the sheer size of the data sets involved, and partly because of issues of pattern matching. However, since statistics provides the intellectual glue underlying the effort, it is important for statisticians to become involved. There are very real opportunities for statisticians to make significant contributions.\n      </p>", "This article presents several methods for performing linear regression on the union of distributed databases that preserve, to varying degrees, confidentiality of those databases. Such methods can be used by federal or state statistical agencies to share information from their individual databases, or to make such information available to others. Secure data integration, which provides the lowest level of protection, actually integrates the databases, but in a manner that no database owner can determine the origin of any records other than its own. Regression, associated diagnostics, or any other analysis then can be performed on the integrated data. Secure multiparty computation, based on shared local statistics effects computations necessary to compute least squares estimators of regression coefficients and error variances by means of analogous local computations that are combined additively using the secure summation protocol. We also provide two approaches to model diagnostics in this setting, one using shared residual statistics and the other using secure integration of synthetic residuals.\n      </p>", "Background: Veterans Health Administration (VHA) databases are used extensively to study racial/ethnic disparities; however, these databases may not capture all care received by VHA patients. Objectives: We examined the extent to which accounting for non-VHA care changed conclusions about racial/ethnic disparities for VHA patients with diabetes. Methods: Using a cross-sectional observational study, we analyzed a national sample of noninstitutionalized Hispanic (n = 5931), black (n = 24,670), and white (n = 149,222) VHA patients with diabetes who were at least 65 years of age for receipt of annual &lt;tex-math&gt;${\\rm HbA}_{1{\\rm c}}$&lt;/tex-math&gt; testing, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol testing, or eye examination from VHA and Medicare administrative files. Results: In VHA alone data, adjusting for patient characteristics, Hispanic and black patients were as likely as white patients to receive &lt;tex-math&gt;${\\rm HbA}_{1{\\rm c}}$&lt;/tex-math&gt; testing (odds ratio 1.06 [95% confidence interval 0.99-1.13] and 1.04 [1.00-1.07], respectively), and more likely to receive eye examinations (1.31 [1.24-1.38] and 1.33 [1.29-1.37], respectively). Hispanic patients were equally likely (1.01 [0.95-1.07]) and black patients were less likely (0.81 [0.79-0.84]) to receive LDL testing versus white patients. In VHA plus Medicare data, Hispanic and black patients were less likely than white patients to receive &lt;tex-math&gt;${\\rm HbA}_{1{\\rm c}}$&lt;/tex-math&gt; (0.76 [0.71-0.82] and 0.83 [0.80-0.87], respectively) and LDL testing (0.84 [0.79-0.90] and 0.70 [0.68-0.72], respectively), and equally likely to receive eye examinations (0.91 [0.86-0.96]) and 0.98 [0.95-1.01]), respectively). Accounting for VHA facility had little effect on results. Conclusions: Restricting to VHA data masks racial/ethnic disparities in care of VHA patients. VHA researchers must be aware and supplement VHA data with other sources whenever possible.\n      </p>", "Objective: The National Children's Study is a long-term epidemiologic study of 100,000 children from 105 locations across the United S\u00fbtes. It will require information on a large number of environmental variables to address its core hypotheses. The resources available to collect actual home and personal exposure samples are limited, with most of the home sampling completed on periodic visits and the personal sampling generally limited to biomonitoring. To fill major data gaps, extant data will be required for each study location. The Queens Vanguard Center has examined the extent of those needs and the types of data that are generally and possibly locally available. Data: In this review we identify three levels of data\u2014national, state and county\u2014and local data and information sets (levels 1\u20133, respectively), each with different degrees of availability and completeness, that can be used as a starting point for the extant data collection in each study location over time. We present an example on the use of this tiered approach, to tailor the data needs for Queens County and to provide general guidance for application to other NCS locations. Conclusions: Preexisting and continually evolving databases are available for use in the NCS to characterize exposure. The three levels of data we identified will be used to test a method for developing exposure indices for segments and homes during the pilot phase of NCS, as outlined in this article.\n      </p>", "Taxonomists publish information about biological organisms that is of great value to the scientific community. Unfortunately conventional texts have two shortcomings: they are commonly indexed only by scientific name and taxonomic position of the organisms described, and soon become outdated. Such indices are of little use to applied biologists whose primary interest is in accessing the descriptive information in the body of the text. Access to this information would be improved if it were stored in databases with multiple indices and which in turn could be used to publish more diverse up to date information products. Free-text databases offer few advantages over conventional texts stored on word processor while structured database design ensures greater consistency, permits automatic checks of data integrity, and provides for flexible indexing and reliable retrieval. The design and construction of structured taxonomic databases is challenging and labour intensive. Use of such databases, however, requires limited intellectual effort or expertise and may be used effectively by the casual user. If descriptions are to be used for more than one purpose then multiple characters may be needed to define single features of organisms. Such \"sister characters\" differ in their information content or the phraseology of definition. Only structured databases permit users with differing needs to obtain alternative views of a single stored description. The technology now exists to incorporate visual information within taxonomic databases but visual data are subject to the same structural constraints as descriptive text. An understanding of these constraints is necessary for effective database construction and furthers our understanding of taxonomic data and taxonomic practice.\n      </p>", "As the costs of health care assume increasing importance in national health policy, information systems will be required to supply better information about how costs are generated and how resources are distributed. Costs, as determined by accounting systems, often are inadequate for policy analysis because they represent resources consumed (expenditures) to produce given outputs but do not measure forgone alternative uses of the resources (opportunity costs). To accommodate cost studies at the program level and the system level, relational information systems must be developed that allow costs to be summed across individuals to determine an organization's costs, across providers to determine an individual patient's costs, and across both to determine system and population costs. Program-level studies require that cost variables be grouped into variable costs that are tied to changes in volume of output and fixed costs that are allocated rationally. Data sources for program-level analyses are organizational financial statements, cost center accounting records, Medicare cost reports, American Hospital Association surveys, and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) cost distribution files. System-level studies are performed to predict future costs and to compare costs of alternative modes of treatment. System-level analyses aggregate all costs associated with individuals to produce population-based costs. Data sources for system-level analyses include insurance claims; Medicare files; hospital billing records; and VA inpatient, outpatient, and management databases. Future cost studies will require the assessment of costs from all providers, regardless of organizational membership status, for all individuals in defined populations.\n      </p>", "We introduce a hypermedia-based distributed design image database system that can provide simple and flexible user access capabilities based on the \"kansei link method. As proof of this concept, we have developed a prototype distributed multimedia information network incorporating the DHS model. Dubbed the Textile Design Image Database System (TDIDS), this database aids designers using apparel computer-aided design (CAD) systems in different locations, collaborating or working separately, in the design of clothes, including kimonos. Our purpose has been to create a database that will allow each designer to make the best use of his or her creativity and originality\u2014his or her \"style and sensitivity to beauty,\" or, in Japanese, kansei. In our hypermedia system, \"metanodes\" are defined as abstract nodes that are dynamically organized by multimedia objects, while \"metalinks\" are defined as flexible kansei links. Metanodes and metalinks are combined to organize a dynamic hypermedia space from which users can easily retrieve desired design image objects by querying a knowledge agent. The knowledge agent, utilizing the knowledge base, creates links from kansei word objects provided by the user to suitable design image objects among those stored on multimedia databases distributed across the network. The knowledge agent also performs query conversion of individual users' subjective kansei (idiosyncratic, subjective use of kansei words) into objective kansei words using each user's own \"user model,\" These objective kansei words are then converted to equivalent color values. Color value is the means by which all stored design images are characterized. This dynamic linking of kansei word objects to equivalent design images allows individual users' kansei to influence the retrieval process. The sophisticated and flexible CAD systems of the future will require multimedia database systems with cooperative supporting capabilities similar to our kansei system.\n      </p>", "The internet has opened new opportunities for the distribution of systematic information. Advantages such as immediate worldwide distribution, affordable presentation of color illustrations, ease of updating the information, and low cost all suggest that the web is an ideal medium for the publication of taxonomic keys, descriptions, illustrations, and catalogues. Using examples from on-line interactive keys published on the web and the interactive key projects developed at the USDA ARS Systematic Botany and Mycology Laboratory (SBML), this paper presents important points to be considered in developing online interactive keys. These include the use of standard internet protocols, emphasis on images, and easy maintenance by scientists without intervention of IT staff. An additional technical point is that morphological data should be external to the key program. As a result, when data are changed or replaced, the system will automatically be updated. In addition, these data can be used for applications outside of the key. While the potential usefulness of internet keys and other on-line systematic information may be obvious, there are hurdles that must be overcome before there is any significant proliferation of on-line keys. Systematists must embrace the internet as a desirable publishing option, peer review and institutional reward systems must recognize the significance of non-paper publication, and systematists need to incorporate structured procedures for data collection.\n      </p>", "Because of the heterogeneous nature of different data sources, data integration is often one of the most challenging tasks in managing modern information systems. While the existing literature has focused on problems such as schema integration and entity identification, it has largely overlooked a basic question: When an attribute value for a real-world entity is recorded differently in different databases, how should the \"best\" value be chosen from the set of possible values? This paper provides an answer to this question. We first show how a probability distribution over a set of possible values can be derived. We then demonstrate how these probabilities can be used to solve a given decision problem by minimizing the total cost of type I, type II, and misrepresentation errors. Finally, we propose a framework for integrating multiple data sources when a single \"best\" value has to be chosen and stored for every attribute of an entity.\n      </p>", "Adding databases to local online public catalogs dramatically increases the amount of information easily available to users. Users need more effective information handling skills to cope with these resources. The existing level of undergraduate user skills and the amount of information available in locally loaded databases create new challenges for bibliographic instruction. Locally loaded databases challenge bibliographic instruction librarians to identify and teach effective strategies for an environment that includes too much information.\n      </p>", "Question: How many vegetation plot observations (relev\u00e9s) are available in electronic databases, how are they geographically distributed, what are their properties and how might they be discovered and located for research and application? Location: Global. Methods: We compiled the Global Index of Vegetation-Plot Databases (GIVD; http://www.givd.info), an Internet resource aimed at registering metadata on existing vegetation databases. For inclusion, databases need to (i) contain temporally and spatially explicit species co-occurrence data and (ii) be accessible to the scientific public. This paper summarizes structure and data quality of databases registered in GIVD as of 30 December 2010. Results: On the given date, 132 databases containing more than 2.4 million non-overlapping plots had been registered in GIVD. The majority of these data were in European databases (83 databases, 1.6 million plots), whereas other continents were represented by substantially less (North America 15, Asia 13, Africa nine, South America seven, Australasia two, multi-continental three). The oldest plot observation was 1864, but most plots were recorded after 1970. Most plots reported vegetation on areas of 1 to 1000 m2; some also stored time-series and nested-plot data. Apart from geographic reference (required for inclusion), most frequent information was on altitude (71%), slope aspect and inclination (58%) and land use (38%), but rarely soil properties ( &lt; 7%). Conclusions: The vegetation plot data in GIVD constitute a major resource for biodiversity research, both through the large number of species occurrence records and storage of species co-occurrence information at a small scale, combined with structural and plot-based environmental data. We identify shortcomings in available data that need to be addressed through sampling under-represented geographic regions, providing better incentives for data collection and sharing, developing user-friendly database exchange standards, as well as tools to analyse and remove confounding effects of sampling biases. The increased availability of data sets conferred by registration in GIVD offers significant opportunities for large-scale studies in community ecology, macroecology and global change research.\n      </p>", "We discuss the development of factual and bibliographical databases and database systems, including management systems and information retrieval systems. Special reference is made to the International Bibliography on Computers and Law, with respect to both the current situation and future plans.\n      </p>", "The number of journals with embargo periods in aggregated databases designed for academic libraries has increased for the simple reason that the number of available full text journals in these collections has also increased. Misconceptions surrounding embargo periods deduce that embargoes diminish access to information by withholding the current full text from journals, when in fact, embargoes increase access to information for journals that otherwise would not be available in aggregated databases. Embargoes exist for the purpose of preserving a publisher's traditional print and electronic journal subscriptions. Full text databases and e-journals are distinctly different resources. The use of embargoes may be valid in one electronic resource, but not the other. Linking capabilities provide seamless access from embargoed journals with current indexing in databases to the corresponding current full text found in a library's e-journal collection. Embargoed information from a given journal is far superior to no full text information at all from that source.\n      </p>", "Databases have been increasing greatly in number over the last two decades, as has the reliance upon them. Libraries during this time have focused their attention chiefly on the standard bibliographic databases available online or on CD-ROM through the large commercial vendors. The number of nonbibliographic databases is increasing very rapidly; many of them are not available through these vendors. Researchers, due to economic pressures, are now relying more heavily on recycled data available in nonbibliographic databases, especially machine-readable data files (MRDF). The vitality of libraries may in part depend upon how well they keep abreast of and respond to the changing needs of researchers. Research needs should be assessed and an appropriate level of service provided.\n      </p>", "Users must understand the meaning of a database before they can intelligently interpret the data in it. We explore the problem of making databases self-descriptive. We first examine the levels of semantics of data by analogy to the area of programming languages. Next, we consider several \"semantic data models\", which are formal languages for conceptual data description, and how a semantic description can be linked to the objects in a database. We discuss the advantages of making a semantic description part of a database itself and the types of application programs that would use that description. In particular, we focus on PIQUE, a high-level relational query language that uses such semantic information.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The purpose of these comments is to identify and frame issues concerning data sharing within the neuroimaging community. Data sharing has become an important issue in most fields of science. The neuroimaging community is no exception, and it clearly perceives potential benefits in such efforts, as have been realized in other fields such as genomics. At the same time, such efforts can be costly (both in time and expense), and there are important factors that differentiate brain imaging from other fields and that pose specific challenges to the generation of useful neuroimaging databases. These include the rapid pace of change in brain imaging technologies; the complexity of the variables that must be specified to meaningfully interpret the results (such as the method of image acquisition, behavioral design, and subject characteristics); and concerns about participant confidentiality. These issues are outlined with the goal of framing and promoting a public discussion of the benefits and risks of data sharing, which can inform the field of neuroimaging as well as others that face similar challenges.\n      </p>", "Data, whether images, measurements, counts, occurrences, or character codings, are a cornerstone of vertebrate paleontology.

In turn, the vertebrate paleontology community relies on published data in order to reproduce and verify others' work, as well as to expand upon published analyses in new ways without having to reconstitute data sets that have been used by earlier authors and to accurately preserve data for future generations of researchers.

BioMOBY is a biological Web Service interoperability initiative that began as a retreat of representatives from the model organism database community in September, 2001. Its long-term goal is to provide a simple, extensible platform through which the myriad of on-line biological databases and analytical tools can offer their information and analytical services in a fully automated and interoperable way. Of the two branches of the larger BioMOBY project, the Web Services branch (MOBY-S) has now been deployed over several dozen data sources worldwide, revealing some significant observations about the nature of the integrative biology problem; in particular, that Web Service interoperability in the domain of bioinformatics is, unexpectedly, largely a syntactic rather than a semantic problem. That is to say, interoperability between bioinformatics Web Services can be largely achieved simply by specifying the data structures being passed between the services (syntax) even without rich specification of what those data structures mean (semantics). Thus, one barrier of the integrative problem has been overcome with a surprisingly simple solution. Here, we present a nontechnical overview of the critical components that give rise to the interoperable behaviors seen in MOBY-S and discuss an exemplar case, the PlaNet consortium, where MOBY-S has been deployed to integrate the on-line plant genome databases and analytical services provided by a European consortium of databases and data service providers.\n      </p>", "We examine the potential for selection bias in voluntarily reported hedge fund performance data. We construct a set of hedge fund returns that have never been reported to a commercial hedge fund database. These returns allow a direct comparison of performance between funds that choose to report to commercial databases and funds that do not. We find that funds that report their performance to commercial databases significantly outperform nonreporting funds. Our results suggest that the voluntarily reported performance in commercial databases suffers from a selection bias that may exaggerate the average skill of the universe of hedge fund managers.\n      </p>", "\u2022 Here, the reliability of published fungal nucleic acid sequences is tested by the critical re-evaluation of 206 named sequences obtained from public-access databases. \u2022 Sequences from the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene cluster were examined as these are commonly used to establish fungal phylogeny and evolution, and are also increasingly employed in the identification of fungi from nonculture based studies. \u2022 Fifty-one rRNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences were obtained for species of Amanita, 55 ITS sequences were obtained for species of Phoma and 100 rRNA small subunit sequences were obtained from representative genera of the order Helotiales. In each case, the fungal group was selected partly on the basis of sequences deposited by three or more laboratories in order to avoid sample bias. The results suggest that up to 20% of the sequences available for each group may be unreliable, and this proportion is supported by additional informal observations.\n      </p>", "The wealth of new information coming from the many genome sequencing projects is providing unprecedented opportunities for major advances in all areas of biology, including the environmental health sciences. To facilitate this discovery process, experts in the fields of functional genomics and informatics and the emerging field of toxicogenomics recently gathered at the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory in Salisbury Cove, Maine, site of a National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Marine and Freshwater Biomedical Science Center, to share their ideas and latest research findings. The goal of the symposium was to highlight approaches that may be used to identify and characterize toxicologically relevant genes being discovered in the genome sequencing projects. Many of the approaches rely heavily on comparative models as a way of identifying gene homology, ontology, and physiologic function, and on the availability of databases that facilitate storage, analysis, interpretation, and widespread dissemination of relevant data.\n      </p>", "This article summarizes the activities of the Istituto di Linguistica Computazionale.

Our primary objective is to provide an overview of database and informatics support for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI). Methods. We discuss the role of information technology resources in the QUERI process. We also review current VA information systems and specific databases in terms of strengths and weaknesses for addressing the QUERI goals. A synthesis of the issues and strategies for addressing specific data needs are presented by use of examples from 2 of the QUERI disease modules: Diabetes Mellitus and Human Immunodeficiency Virus. Finally, we discuss issues that need to be considered during development of new information systems to address the needs of clinical quality-improvement efforts. Conclusions. Quality enhancement in VA health care requires coordination and careful planning among clinical, administrative, research, policy, and information technology leaders to ensure that key clinical process and outcome measures are reliably collected in the VA information systems. As the QUERI progresses, data needs will probably shift from addressing data gaps to developing approaches for feedback and evaluation. Continued and enhanced cooperation among all VHA business processes is vital to the success of the QUERI.\n      </p>", "Databases with a lot of data very often mean little information. It is because of the collinearity of variables which consist of the data of the database. This collinearity is in fact a kind of redundancy of the database. In the study a new indicator is given. With this indicator, which contains the eigenvalues of the variables' correlation matrix, it is possible to quantify the percentage of collinearity: from 0% (all the eigenvalues are equal to 1) to 100% (all the eigenvalues, except the first, are equal to 0). /// Bien souvent, les fichiers de donn\u00e9es qui contiennent un grand nombre de donn\u00e9es, signifient peu d'information, \u00e0 cause de la relation entre les variables qui contiennent les donn\u00e9es du fichier.

A first step in IRT modeling is development of item banks. Our aim is to describe the value of including librarians and to describe processes used by librarians, in the creation of such banks. Method Working collaboratively with PROMIS researchers at the University of Pittsburgh, a team of librarians designed and implemented comprehensive literature searches in a selected set of information resources, for the purpose of identifying existing measures of patient-reported emotional distress. Results A step-by-step search protocol developed by librarians produced a set of 525 keywords and controlled vocabulary terms for use in search statements in 3 bibliographic databases. These searches produced 6,169 literature citations, allowing investigators to add 444 measurement scales to their item banks. Conclusion Inclusion of librarians on the Pittsburgh PROMIS research team allowed investigators to create large initial item banks, increasing the likelihood that the banks would attain high measurement precision during subsequent psychometric analyses. In addition, a comprehensive literature search protocol was developed that can now serve as a guide for other investigators in the creation of IRT item banks.\n      </p>", "Background: Despite the potential usefulness of administrative databases for evaluating outcomes, coding of heart failure and associated comorbidities have not been definitively compared with clinical data. Objective: To compare the predictive value of heart failure diagnoses and secondary conditions identified in a large administrative database with chart-based records. Methods: The authors studied 1808 patient records sampled from 14 acute care hospitals and compared clinically recorded data with administrative records from the Canadian Institute for Health Information. The impact of comorbidity coding in the administrative data set according to the Charlson classification was examined in models of 30-day mortality. Results: The positive predictive value (PPV) of a primary diagnosis ICD-9 428 was 94.3% using the Framingham criteria and 88.6% using criteria previously validated with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. There was reduced prevalence of secondary comorbid conditions in administrative data in comparison with clinical chart data. The specificities and PPV/negative predictive values of administratively identified index comorbidities were high. The sensitivities of index comorbidities were low, but were enhanced by examination of hospitalizations within 1 year prior to the index heart failure admission. Using information from prior hospitalizations modestly enhanced 30-day mortality model performance; however, the odds ratio point estimates of the index and enhanced administrative data sets were consistent with the clinical model. Conclusion: The ICD-9 428 primary diagnosis is highly predictive of heart failure using clinical criteria. Examination of hospitalization data up to 1 year prior to the index admission improves comorbidity detection and may provide enhancements to future studies of heart failure mortality.\n      </p>", "In this paper we give some examples of using databases of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity for quantitative and qualitative correlation studies between short-term tests and carcinogenicity. The quality of the databases is obviously important, but one of the major deficiencies of present databases is that they are too small. Using relatively small, different databases, different results can be obtained. With small databases it is difficult to disaggregate data for homogeneous chemical classes or other types of subsets. Using the databases of Gold (carcinogenicity) and W\u00fcrgler (genotoxicity), we have investigated the carcinogenic potency of genotoxic and nongenotoxic carcinogens for different chemical classes.\n      </p>", "In recent years, there has been a proliferation of database systems in all types of organizations. In many cases, these databases are developed in different departments and maintained autonomously. Much is to be gained, however, if databases across departments, divisions, or even organizations can be related to one another. One main problem of relating data stored in different databases is the differences in their representation of real-world entities, such as the use of different identifiers or primary keys. We present a decision theoretic model for matching entities across different databases. The decision to match two entities from two different databases inherently involves some uncertainty since an exact match may not be found because of errors in data collection, data entry, and data representation. We model this uncertainty using probability theory and propose an integer programming formulation that minimizes the total cost associated with the entity matching decision. The model has been implemented and validated on real-world data.\n      </p>", "The concept of a \"potential taxon\" as a name- and literature-related data area in botanical databases is introduced. A potential taxon is a name with taxon circumscription information attached to it by means of one or more literature references. As a compromise solution between linking information in database systems entirely to specimen data or only to accepted names, using potential taxa can effectively preserve information links without hindering rapid database input and information processing. It is suggested that a potential taxon be cited by its name, followed by the abbreviation \"sec.\" (for secundum = according to) and at least one of the literature references used to define it.\n      </p>", "Objective: In the United States, data on transplanted and waitlisted patients collected by the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) have been widely used in transplantation research. Administrative claims data, collected by health plans for reimbursement purposes, are also commonly used in health-services research. This study linked OPTN and private payer claims data to assess the relationship between data elements common to both sources. Methods: All transplanted or waitlisted patients in the registry were considered for inclusion. A multistep match algorithm was employed to link OPTN and payer data from years 1995 to 2004. Variables common to both datasets that contained relevant information for similar time periods were compared. Results: A total of 21,419 solid organ transplant recipients and 8808 waitlist patients were included in the final linked database. Organ type and demographic variable distributions in the linked dataset were similar to the overall OPTN database. Using claims as the reference group, sensitivity and specificity values were on average 0.72 and 0.69, respectively, and were highest for the indicators of immunosuppression use at discharge and follow-up. Conclusion: This comparison of payer data with information reported by transplant centers to the OPTN provides important insight into the value of both data sources. Using administrative claims to augment the registry data with utilization and cost information will be useful for evaluation of both economic and clinical endpoints in solid organ transplantation.\n      </p>", "This paper reports on the initial findings of an interdisciplinary research project on the governance of human genetic databases in England and Wales. The number of biosample and information collections has expanded, yet considerable legal uncertainty surrounds their definition, collection, storage, management, and use which could inhibit research and clinical practice, while failing to protect the rights and interests of all stakeholders. We report some initial findings from the legal research and identify major challenges associated with defining 'genetic databases'. We identify a wide range of relevant instruments and regulatory actors, and suggest that none adequately addresses the challenges posed by contemporary research techniques or the 'corporeal' and 'informational' materials used in the genetic databases context. This preliminary analysis seriously questions the efficacy of the current regulatory framework and concludes that developing an appropriate governance framework for the creation, maintenance, and use of genetic databases requires the bringing together of legal analysis with good quality empirical evidence.\n      </p>", "In-house database building can be an activity that helps libraries to survive in today's competitive information world.

Locally oriented and collection-specific databases can become essential tools in successful local networking and cooperative collection development.\n      </p>", "Background: To support health research on the unique cohort of women with a history of military service, this study assessed the completeness of mortality ascertainment for Texas women veterans in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and non-VA databases. Methods: We examined female veteran-specific mortality ascertainment comparing the VA Beneficiary Identification and Records Locator Subsystem Death File (BIRLS DF), VA Patient Treatment Files (PTF), and Social Security Administration-Death Master File (SSA-DMF) with Texas death certificate data. Databases were deterministically cross-linked, using female sex and social security numbers. Deterministic and probabilistic linkage methods were also compared. Results: Of 6297 decedents identified by death certificates, SSA-DMF, BIRLS DF, and PTF databases identified 97.5% collectively and 94%, 77%, and 5% individually. Compared with Texas death certificates, sensitivity of VA and SSA databases improved with increasing age. Conclusions: This study highlights that although the VA and SSA administrative databases have less complete ascertainment for younger decedents, combined these electronic databases provide nearly complete ascertainment for women veterans. Challenges related to large female-specific cross-linkage studies are explored, and a need to examine methods for female-specific health research studies in the general population is identified.\n      </p>", "Monitoring of the ecological as well as economical aspects of the planet Earth will in future require more sophisticated data obtaining systems (e.g. satellites) and data processing devices (e.g. GIS). In order to process the great amount of data, detailed information on geographical databases has to be provided in an easy way. In this paper a concept of an information system on geographical databases is presented which encompasses a centrally managed international directory with summary information as well as local information interfaces geographical databases. An information interface provides detailed information on the extent, structure and geographical meaning of the data stored in the geographical database belonging to it. To describe this information a conceptual scheme, based on an object oriented approach, is developed.\n      </p>", "Many thousands of chemicals are produced industrially and many more occur naturally. Information on the toxicology of these chemicals is often minimal or absent. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has published evaluations of the carcinogenic risk to humans of over 700 chemicals, groups of chemicals, and complex mixtures as a regular series of monographs. A database has been created containing summaries of all the relevant epidemiological, animal carcinogenicity, and other relevant biological data for each chemical or mixture evaluated. Additional databases have been created for ongoing epidemiological studies of cancer in humans and for long-term carcinogenicity studies in rodents, as well as a database containing information on genotoxic and related effects of chemicals. Some of these databases have been published in print form. IARC now plans to publish them electronically, together with other databases, in the form of a CDROM (compact disk, read-only memory). The objective will be to make the entire IARC database of cancer information as widely available as possible in an integrated format conducive to efficient and combined exploitation of all the component databases.\n      </p>", "The World Grass Species databases have been in development at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew for the past decade, and represent many years of effort archiving and collating data into a central resource. Twenty-first century agrostology requires that workers in the field embrace the new technologies that have become available with increasing computer power and literacy. The databases have been available on Kew's website for several years, but there has been limited internal use of this resource and almost no external use. There are two databases, one containing full grass nomenclature and the other containing descriptions for all grass species. The nomenclature database provides citation details for all grass names contained therein. It produces regional checklists, provides accepted names and synonyms for all species and a number of other search possibilities. Until recently, the descriptions database was only accessible through the software INTKEY, and required considerable computer literacy to access. These databases are in the process of being integrated, upgraded and made web accessible. The current versions have involved an almost complete redevelopment of the descriptions databases. Species descriptions have been generated and made available through the Kew website for all 10,916 accepted species, and considerable documentation has also been made available. The major changes implemented in the nomenclature database are the provision of a link to these descriptions and species distribution from the 'search for synonyms' and regional and generic checklist queries. This provides the beginnings of a full World Grass Flora. Current facilities, as well as future plans for these databases, their integration, and scope for collaboration are discussed.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "A review of the literature on online information storage and retrieval systems for secondary sources in the field of history is presented, the effect of online databases on the reference process discussed, and principal machine readable databases in the field of history introduced.

This essay discusses some factors that have inhibited empirical research; it develops its examples from work in progress on 18th century English poetry and on reader responses. A number of large linguistic and text databases are almost useless for research on women writers because works by women are either not included or represented by easily accessible, rather than editorially clean, texts. Traditional and contemporary reader response studies are also insufficiently empirical for reasons of sexual bias or flaws in research design.\n      </p>", "Background: Case-mix adjustment is widely used in health services research to ensure that groups being compared are equivalent on variables predicting outcome. There has been considerable development and testing of comorbidity indices derived from diagnostic codes recorded in administrative databases, but increasingly, the benefit of clinical information and patient reported ratings of health and functional status is being recognized. One type of information that is highly valued but has so far not been captured by administrative health databases is functional status indicators (FSI). Objective: The purpose of this study was to estimate the extent to which prediction of health outcomes can be improved on by including information on functional status indicators (FSI). Research Design: The data for the current study was obtained from a clustered randomized trial evaluating computerized decision support for managing drug therapy in the elderly, conducted from 1997 to 1998. A total of 107 primary care physicians participated in this trial and 6465 of their patients (51%) completed a generic health status measure-the SF-12-before the intervention. C statistics and R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; were used to compare the predictive value of sociodemographic factors, 2 comorbidity indices, and 11 FSI predictor variables derived from the SF-12 and coded (possible for 8) using the International Classification of Functioning (ICF). Results: Using stepwise logistic regression, FSI, particularly limitation in stair climbing or doing moderate activities like housework, were found to be strong and independent predictors of all outcomes, even after controlling for sociodemographics and comorbidity. Conclusion: This study indicates that FSI provided as robust a prediction of health events as did complex comorbidity indices. Additionally, the ICF coding system provides a mechanism whereby information on FSI could be incorporated into administrative databases through the use of electronic health records that include a health or functional status measure.\n      </p>", "This paper offers a brief survey of some important developments in the use of computers in making dictionaries and lexicons. Making a dictionary involves collecting the data, sorting and lemmatizing, editing and printing.

In some cases, there are attempts to extract engineering information (e. g., on the reliability of components) from such databases. Another important application is to use warranty data to detect potentially serious field reliability problems as early as possible. When a serious problem arises, the existence of the problem will eventually be obvious. Early detection of serious problems through the use of sensitive statistical methods, allowing early action to mitigate potential reliability problems, could save large amounts of money and product goodwill.

Our efforts have also led to a prototype implementation, called MOTC, for exploring hypothesis space in large and complex data sets. Our KDD conceptual development rests on two main principles. First, we use the crosstab representation for working with qualitative data. This is by now standard in on-line analytical processing (OLAP) applications, and we reaffirm it with additional reasons. Second, and innovatively, we use prediction analysis as a measure of goodness for hypotheses. Prediction analysis is an established statistical technique for analysis of associations among qualitative variables. It generalizes and subsumes a large number of other such measures of association, depending on specific assumptions the user is willing to make. As such, it provides a very useful framework for exploring hypothesis space in a KDD context.

Optimal care for frail elderly patients depends on comprehensive assessment. This is especially true in the complex setting of interdisciplinary home care programs. To facilitate comprehensive assessment, as well as to generate a useful, policy-relevant patient database, standardized, multidimensional, and validated instruments are very helpful. Objectives. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate that the Minimum Data Set assessment instrument for Home Care (MDS-HC) can be used to detect functional and cognitive impairment as defined by analogous research instruments. Research Design. This was a cross-sectional correlation study. Subjects. We studied 95 patients admitted to home care services of the Health Care Agency of Bergamo (Italy). Measures. The MDS-HC form was completed for all patients by well-trained nurses, independently of and with nurses blinded to the results from the research rating scales. The Barthel Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Index, the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living of Lawton (IADL), and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) were considered the gold standard. Results. Agreement between the MDS-HC scales and the research rating scales was assessed with Pearson's correlation coefficient. This coefficient was 0.74 for MDS-ADL versus Barthel Index, 0.81 for MDS-IADL versus Lawton Index, and 0.81 for Cognitive Performance Scale versus MMSE, indicating an excellent agreement. Conclusions. The MDS-HC scales, when performed by trained nurses using recommended protocols, provide a valid measure of function and cognitive status in frail home care patients. These findings point out the overall validity of the functional and clinical data contained in the MDS-HC assessment. Use of the MDS-HC gives the unique opportunity of setting up a database, a prerequisite for all epidemiological evidence-based medicine studies.\n      </p>"], "words": {"represent": {"number": 1,
