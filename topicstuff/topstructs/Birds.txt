Other problems, such as zinc or iron toxicoses, myopathies, feather loss or depigmentation, and generalized poor doing, may be linked to nutrition.

Hyperestrogenism might be causative. The purpose of this study was to compare endocrinologic and pathologic findings in birds with polyostotic hyperostosis. Thirty-five birds with polyostotic hyperostosis and three control birds were examined. Blood samples were taken for endocrinologic evaluation (estrone, estradiol, testosterone, and estrone sulfate concentrations) and the values compared with pathologic findings. Our findings did not support the hypothesis that polyostotic hyperostosis is caused by hyperestrogenism.\n      </p>", "Tracheal obstruction in 19 dyspneic psittacine birds was treated with a vacuum technique. Diagnosis was made by tracheoscopy. Following localization of the obstruction, the obstructive material was removed by vacuum suction. Aspergillus fumigatus was cultured from tracheal swab samples in all birds. All birds had a history of dietary nutritional deficiencies; they had been fed an all-seed diet. The tracheal suction procedure in conjunction with an air sac tube is a lifesaving technique in acutely dyspneic psittacine birds with a tracheal obstruction. Whole-body radiographs and tracheoscopic findings provide information about the prognosis of the bird. The owner should always be warned that recurrence of tracheal obstruction is possible.\n      </p>", "Strips of mature trees along intermittent or permanent streams, called streamside zones (SZ), often are retained to protect water quality and accommodate wildlife when forest stands are harvested. We investigated the effects on breeding birds of 3 SZ widths (narrow 15-25 m, medium 30-40 m, and wide 50-95 m) in young pine (Pinus spp.) plantations in eastern Texas. Bird abundance was generally positively related to SZ width. Narrow SZ were inhabited mainly by species associated with young brushy stands and habitat edge. Bird species frequenting the wide zones were mostly those associated with mature pine-hardwood and bottomland hardwood stands in the South. Species found in the medium zones were a mix of species associated with narrow and wide zones. Retention of medium and wide SZ maintains species of birds in local communities and benefits species associated with mature forest.\n      </p>", "We used an allometric approach to compare the minimum nitrogen requirements (MNR) and the total endogenous nitrogen loss (TENL) of nectar- and fruit-eating birds with those of omnivorous birds. These two parameters were 4\u00d7 higher in omnivores than in nectarivores and frugivores. In nectarivorous-frugivorous birds, MNR was $152.8\\ {\\rm mg}\\ {\\rm N}\\ {\\rm kg}^{-0.76}\\ \\text{day}^{-1}$ ; in omnivorous birds, it was $575.4\\ {\\rm mg}\\ {\\rm N}\\ {\\rm kg}^{-0.76}\\ \\text{day}^{-1}$ .

The residuals of the allometric relationships between TENL and MNR and body mass were positively correlated, which suggests that a large proportion of the interspecific variation in MNR is explained by variation in TENL.

The success of this method is explained by the presence of physiologic adaptations in the avian rectum for rectal modification of ureteral urine. The failure to achieve fluid homeostasis in two pigeons possibly resulted from catheterinduced hyperperistaltic movement that prevented fluid resorption. We suggest that, after improvement of the technique, rectal infusion can be a good alternative route of fluid administration in birds when other methods are less appropriate.\n      </p>", "At a regional scale, species richness and human population size are frequently positively correlated across space. Such patterns may arise because both species richness and human density increase with energy availability. If the species-energy relationship is generated through the 'more individuals' hypothesis, then the prediction is that areas with high human densities will also support greater numbers of individuals from other taxa. We use the unique data available for the breeding birds in Europe to test this prediction. Overall regional densities of bird species are higher in areas with more people; species of conservation concern exhibit the same pattern. Avian density also increases faster with human density than does avian biomass, indicating that areas with a higher human density have a higher proportion of small-bodied individuals. The analyses also underline the low numbers of breeding birds in Europe relative to humans, with a median of just three individual birds per person, and 4 g of bird for every kilogram of human.\n      </p>", "Aim The aim of this study was to assess the influence of island area, distance to source pool, latitude, habitat diversity and habitat type on species richness of forest birds in the Andaman islands. Location The Andaman islands (India) in the Bay of Bengal. Methods The distributions of 47 species of forest birds were surveyed on 45 islands in the Andaman islands across a latitudinal gradient. The size of the island and distance to the nearest large island were assessed on a satellite image of 1: 250,000 scale. The number and types of habitats and the species richness of birds on each island were recorded during a field survey. The effects of the variables measured on the species richness of forest birds were assessed using regression analyses. The best fit models were selected for interpretation of the results. Separate analyses were conducted with selected islands to eliminate the effects of latitude and to control the effects of area and habitat diversity. Results The number of species of forest birds was strongly influenced by island area and habitat diversity. However the key determinant of species richness was habitat type, particularly the presence of wet forests. Wet forests, either semi-evergreen or evergreen tropical forests are more common towards the southern islands and are usually restricted to larger islands. Main conclusions Area, habitat diversity and the presence of wet forests on islands significantly influenced species richness of forest birds. The wet forests maintain the biodiversity of the Andamans and should be regarded as a 'keystone habitat'. This is probably because wet forests are species rich and also because the Andaman biota has affinities with that of the Malay peninsula where wet forests predominate. Therefore biogeographical history probably plays an important role in influencing biodiversity at a regional scale.\n      </p>", "This paper describes a decorated carinated vessel excavated at the Teouma Lapita site, on the south coast of Efate, central Vanuatu.

Although Archaeopteryx is still the oldest and only Jurassic bird, a wealth of recent discoveries combined with new phylogenetic analyses have documented the divergence of a number of lineages by the beginning of the Cretaceous. These and younger Cretaceous fossils have filled much of the morphological chasm that existed between Archaeopteryx and its living counterparts, providing insights into the evolutionary development of feathers and other important features of the avian flight system. Dramatic new perceptions of the life history, growth and development of early birds have also been made possible by the latest data. Although no primitive birds are known to have survived beyond the end of the Cretaceous, the present fossil record provides no evidence for a sudden disappearance. Likewise, a Mesozoic origin for extant birds remains controversial.\n      </p>", "The Mesozoic fossil record has proved critical for understanding the early evolution and subsequent radiation of birds. Little is known, however, about its relative completeness: just how 'good' is the fossil record of birds from the Mesozoic? This question has come to prominence recently in the debate over differences in estimated dates of origin of major clades of birds from molecular and palaeontological data. Using a dataset comprising all known fossil taxa, we present analyses that go some way towards answering this question. Whereas avian diversity remains poorly represented in the Mesozoic, many relatively complete bird specimens have been discovered. New taxa have been added to the phylogenetic tree of basal birds, but its overall shape remains constant, suggesting that the broad outlines of early avian evolution are consistently represented: no stage in the Mesozoic is characterized by an overabundance of scrappy fossils compared with more complete specimens. Examples of Neornithes (modern orders) are known from later stages in the Cretaceous, but their fossils are rarer and scrappier than those of basal bird groups, which we suggest is a biological, rather than a geological, signal.\n      </p>", "Wild birds are suspected to play a role in the spread of avian influenza H5N1; however, much remains unknown about the ecology and epidemiology of H5N1 in wild birds. Lake Constance is an important wetland area and was a focus for surveillance of dead wild birds between February and June 2006. Dead wild birds collected from the lake and surrounding regions were tested for avian influenza H5. This article provides a descriptive and spatial analysis of the data collected during this period and includes discussion of the strengths and limitations of this type of surveillance. The sampling of dead birds may provide a rapid and cost-effective means of detecting the presence of H5N1; however, such sampling is prone to certain biases and lacks sensitivity in detecting asymptomatic infections. The benefit of such surveillance will be enhanced by detailed ornithologic information, greater accuracy of spatially referenced data, and quantification of surveillance effort.

Because animals generally eat to meet energy requirements, the nutrient content of a diet must be balanced with the energy content. To formulate balanced diets for a range of bird species, both the energy needs of the relevant bird species and the energy content of the diet must be calculated. The most practical way of understanding the energy requirements of pet birds is by studying their daily energy expenditure. Factors affecting energy requirements are body size, activity patterns, environmental temperature, plumage cover, age, and physiologic state. Energy costs of maintenance are directly related to the lean body mass and the relative size of the different organs, because these are the tissues that actively use oxygen. Activity patterns also have a considerable impact; the difference between sitting and standing can affect the daily energy expenditure by as much as 42%. There are a variety of published allometric equations for determining avian energy requirements, but those derived from fasted species are inappropriate. For companion birds, equations derived for the particular body-weight range of the avian species in question are the most applicable. Two equations are recommended: one for calculating the energy requirements of avian species less than 100 g, and the second for avian species whose body weights are in the range 100-1500 g.\n      </p>", "Wild waterfowl is considered a natural reservoir of potentially infectious agents and a source of pathogenic viruses like avian paramyxoviruses type 1 (APMV 1). In 1997, commercial poultry in Argentina had reached the status of being free from virulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infections. Vaccination and biosecurity measures are actively performed to maintain this preferential sanitary condition. However, the risk of reintroduction of pathogenic viruses is always present. In this context, we conducted a study to describe the status of wild healthy birds in a geographic region relevant for the poultry industry. The presence of anti-NDV antibodies was determined in different species in all areas sampled suggesting previous contact with NDV. Seven ND viruses were isolated and characterized as apathogenic strains by biological and molecular methods. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the majority of the Argentinian isolates form a subgroup related to viruses of genotype II. The results presented here highlight the importance of maintaining strict biosecurity measures and vaccination programs in poultry industries in order to preserve the virulent NDV-free status for commercial flocks in the country. /// Las aves acu\u00e1ticas silvestres son consideradas un reservorio natural de potenciales agentes infecciosos y una fuente de virus patog\u00e9nicos como el paramixovirus aviar tipo I.

In particular, associations among latitudinal midpoint, body mass, and latitudinal extent are examined; significant differences between natural history characteristics (trophic guild, forest dependence, number of forest types) and latitudinal extent are identified; and a test is undertaken of Rapoport's rule for birds at the edge of their northern or southern range in Nicaragua. Birds in Nicaragua were classified into four categories based on latitudinal extent: birds generally restricted to Central America (20%); birds near the edge of their range within Nicaragua (34%); Neotropical birds (42%); and Pan-American birds (4%). Latitudinal midpoint had a significant negative correlation with latitudinal extent over different taxonomic scales. Natural history characteristics of trophic guild, forest dependence and number of forest types can account for significant differences in species latitudinal extent. Carnivores had greater latitudinal extents than most other trophic guilds, non-forest birds had greater latitudinal extents than birds that require patchy forest, and birds that occur in four or more forest types had greater latitudinal extents than birds restricted to one or two forest types. Contrary to Rapoport's rule, birds with a northern affinity or latitudinal midpoint north of Nicaragua had significantly smaller latitudinal extents than birds with a southern affinity or latitudinal midpoint south of Nicaragua. A comparison of natural history characteristics of birds with northern and southern affinities found no difference between trophic guild or forest dependence but a significant difference among the number of forest types used by forest birds. Birds with a southern affinity were restricted to fewer forest types than birds with a northern affinity.\n      </p>", "The global pledge to deliver 'a significant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity loss by 2010' is echoed in a number of regional and national level targets. There is broad consensus, however, that in the absence of conservation action, biodiversity will continue to be lost at a rate unprecedented in the recent era. Remarkably, we lack a basic system to measure progress towards these targets and, in particular, we lack standard measures of biodiversity and procedures to construct and assess summary statistics. Here, we develop a simple classification of biodiversity indicators to assist their development and clarify purpose. We use European birds, as example taxa, to show how robust indicators can be constructed and how they can be interpreted. We have developed statistical methods to calculate supranational, multi-species indices using population data from national annual breeding bird surveys in Europe. Skilled volunteers using standardized field methods undertake data collection where methods and survey designs differ slightly across countries. Survey plots tend to be widely distributed at a national level, covering many bird species and habitats with reasonable representation. National species' indices are calculated using log-linear regression, which allows for plot turnover. Supranational species' indices are constructed by combining the national species' indices weighted by national population sizes of each species. Supranational, multi-species indicators are calculated by averaging the resulting indices. We show that common farmland birds in Europe have declined steeply over the last two decades, whereas woodland birds have not. Evidence elsewhere shows that the main driver of farmland bird declines is increased agricultural intensification. We argue that the farmland bird indicator is a useful surrogate for trends in other elements of biodiversity in this habitat.\n      </p>", "Do birds show a different pattern of insular evolution from mammals? Mammals follow the 'island rule', with large-bodied species getting smaller on islands and small-bodied species getting bigger. By contrast, the traditional view on birds is that they follow no general island rule for body size, but that there is an insular trend for large bills. Insular shifts in feeding ecology are, therefore, widely assumed to be the primary cause of divergence in island birds. We use a comparative approach to test these ideas. Contrary to the traditional view, we find no evidence for increased bill size in insular populations. Instead, changes in both bill size and body size obey the 'island rule'. The differences between our results and the traditional view arise because previous analyses were based largely on passerines. We also investigate some ecological factors that are thought to influence island evolution. As predicted by the traditional view, shifts in bill size are associated with feeding ecology. By contrast, shifts in body size are associated with the potential for intraspecific competition and thermal ecology. All these results remain qualitatively unchanged when we use different methods to score the ecological factors and restrict our analyses to taxa showing pronounced morphological divergence. Because of strong covariation between ecological factors, however, we cannot estimate the relative importance of each ecological factor. Overall, our results show that the island rule is valid for both body size and bill length in birds and that, in addition to feeding ecology, insular shifts in the level of intraspecific competition and the abiotic environment also have a role.\n      </p>", "Recent studies suggest that species' life histories and ecology can be used to forecast future extinction risk. Threatened species often share similar traits such that if a trait predisposing a species to decline or extinction is evolutionarily conserved, then close relatives of threatened species are themselves likely to be at risk. The phylogenetic distribution of current threat has been argued to provide insight into the species that could be threatened in the future when trait data are not available. Conservation criteria are typically based on multiple indices that capture different symptoms of threat including population trends and range contraction. However, there is no reason to assume consistent phylogenetic distributions of different symptoms. I construct a molecular phylogeny of 249 species of British birds (more than 93% of the breeding and wintering species) and use this to show that the species that are threatened due to population declines are phylogenetically more closely related than expected by chance alone. However, species that are listed for other reasons, including range contraction, are distributed randomly with respect to phylogeny. I suggest that while phylogeny can be informative with respect to identifying clades that are susceptible to some measures of extinction risk, such patterns are likely to be idiosyncratic with respect to symptom and taxa.\n      </p>", "The ability to attract wading birds to a specific location is an important tool for wading bird research. We examined the effectiveness of three commercially available decoy types in attracting free-ranging wading birds to a precise location. There was a statistically significant effect of decoy type on the abundance of wading birds. Wading birds were more attracted to sites with plastic flamingo and Tyvek\u00ae bag decoys than with Texas rag decoys or no decoys (control sites). The flamingo and Tyvek\u00ae bag decoys have a rigid three-dimensional shape, which may be a more important characteristic than the detailed features of a decoy in attracting wading birds. White wading birds showed a significant effect of decoy type on abundance, whereas birds with dark plumage did not. /// La habilidad de atraer aves vadeadoras a una localidad espec\u00edfica es una herramienta importante en la investigaci\u00f3n de estas aves.

We examined the sensitivity of shrubland specialists to (a) the area of shrub stands and (b) proximity to mature-forest edges, and we evaluated whether habitat characteristics, food resources, or productivity of bird populations could have caused the relationships we identified. In 2002-2003, we used constant-effort mist-netting on 6 small (4-8 ha) and 6 large (13-16 ha) regenerating clearcuts that were 4-6 years post-harvest in southern Ohio, USA. We placed 3 nets at 20, 50, and 80 m from the mature-forest edge (n = 9 nets per site), and we sampled vegetation, fruit, and arthropods at each net. Seven of 8 shrubland specialists, particularly blue-winged warbler, prairie warbler, yellow-breasted chat, indigo bunting, and field sparrow, avoided mature-forest edges, with twice as many birds caught 80 m from edges compared to 20 m. Abundances of most species, especially yellow-breasted chats, were positively correlated with area, though the combined area effect was not statistically significant. We found no evidence of reduced avian productivity in small stands. Neither area nor edge was associated with habitat characteristics, fruit abundance, or arthropod biomass. Our results suggest shrubland birds avoid habitat edges. Thus, small or narrow cuts may not provide optimal habitat for this suite of declining species, and managers should consider options to minimize edge and provide larger patches of shrubland habitats in landscape-scale planning efforts.\n      </p>", "Large-scale population declines have been documented across many faunal assemblages. However, there is much variation in population trends for individual species, and few indications of which specific ecological and behavioural characteristics are associated with such trends. We used the British Common Birds Census (1968-1995) to identify specific traits associated with long-term abundance trends in UK farmland birds. Two factors, resource specialization and relative brain size, were significantly associated with population trend, such that species using atypical resources and with relatively small brains were most likely to have experienced overall declines. Further analyses of specific brain components indicated that the relative size of the telencephalon, the part of the brain associated with problem solving and complex behaviours, and the brain stem might be better predictors of population trend than overall brain size. These results suggest that flexibility in resource use and behaviour are the most important characteristics for determining a species' ability to cope with large-scale habitat changes.\n      </p>", "Sucrose, glucose, and fructose are the three sugars that commonly occur in floral nectar and fruit pulp. The relative proportions of these three sugars in nectar and fruit in relation to the sugar preferences of pollinators and seed dispersers have received considerable attention. Based on the research of Herbert and Irene Baker and their collaborators, a dichotomy between sucrose-dominant hummingbird-pollinated flowers and hexose-dominant passerine flowers and fruits was proposed. Data on sugar preferences of several hummingbird species (which prefer sucrose) vs. a smaller sample of passerines (which prefer hexoses) neatly fitted this apparent dichotomy. This hummingbird-passerine dichotomy was strongly emphasized until the discovery of South African plants with sucrose-dominant nectars, which are pollinated by passerines that are able to digest, and prefer sucrose. Now we know that, with the exception of two clades, most passerines are able to assimilate sucrose. Most sugar preference studies have been conducted using a single, relatively high, sugar concentration in the nectar (ca 20%). Thus, we lack information about the role that sugar concentration might play in sugar selection. Because many digestive traits are strongly affected not only by sugar composition, but also by sugar concentration, we suggest that preferences for different sugar compositions are concentration-dependent. Indeed, recent studies on several unrelated nectar-feeding birds have found a distinct switch from hexose preference at low concentrations to sucrose preference at higher concentrations. Finally, we present some hypotheses about the role that birds could have played in molding the sugar composition of plant rewards. /// Sacarosa, glucosa y fructosa son los az\u00facares mas comunes en n\u00e9ctar floral y pulpa de fruta.

Basandose en estudios de Herbert e Irene Baker y colaboradores se propuso la existencia de una dicotom\u00eda entre plantas con n\u00e9ctares ricos en sacarosa que son polinizadas por colibr\u00edes, y plantas con n\u00e9ctares y frutos ricos en hexosas que son polinizadas por paserinos. Datos sobre la preferencia de az\u00facares en varias especies de colibr\u00edes (que prefieren sacarosas) comparados con una peque\u00f1a muestra de paserinos (que prefieren hexosas) apoyan la existencia de la dicotom\u00eda propuesta.

Por lo tanto, carecemos de informaci\u00f3n sobre el papel que juega la concentraci\u00f3n de az\u00facares en las preferencias de estos por las aves. Debido a que muchos procesos digestivos son afectados, no solo por la composici\u00f3n de az\u00facares, sino tambi\u00e9n por su concentraci\u00f3n, sugerimos que las preferencias por diferentes az\u00facares depender\u00e1n de su concentraci\u00f3n.

The pharmacokinetic disposition of a drug depends on the anatomy and physiology of the patient as well as specific properties of the drug itself. Many drugs or drug metabolites are excreted by the kidneys of mammals. Although these compounds are presumed to be excreted by the kidneys of birds as well, few investigations have attempted to confirm this. In addition to understanding the morphology and physiology of avian and mammalian kidneys, the clinician must understand the physicochemical properties of renally excreted drugs to determine the validity of extrapolating drug dosages between the two classes of animals. The purpose of this report is to review plasma and tissue pharmacokinetic studies of drugs currently used in birds. These studies indicate that laboratory and clinical investigations are needed to define the mechanisms and rates of drug elimination in the many avian species veterinarians may treat. Consistent with the diverse anatomic and physiologic characteristics, plasma and tissue concentrations and elimination rates differ between different species of birds. We speculate that drug pharmacokinetics are closely correlated to physiologic differences between species of birds. These differences may represent adaptations to environmental niches. Further studies are needed to confirm this.\n      </p>", "The DVD release of Robert Gardner's \"Dead Birds\" exemplifies the added value of extra features and the improvement in viewing quality when existing ethnographic films are distributed in this new medium. Whereas in the past, ethnographic films have been experienced as transitory performances, a nonlinear medium like DVD makes it possible to read a film the way one reads a book, stopping, reflecting, and reviewing. The inclusion of multiple soundtracks, additional sequences, and associated texts affords a density of content that has not previously been possible in either films or books.\n      </p>", "We investigated the occurrence and potential ecotoxicological significance of elevated concentrations of strontium (Sr) in eggshells of nine passerine birds from four regions in Arizona. Concentrations of Sr in eggshells ranged from $70 to 1360 \\mu g g^{-1}$ dry weight ( $overall mean = 684 \\pm 345 SD \\mu g g^{-1} dw$ ) for the four regions. 23% of the eggshells had Sr concentrations greater than $1000 \\mu g g^{-1} dw$ . To our knowledge, these are among the highest levels of Sr that have been reported in bird eggshells in North America. Of the nine species, Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) had the greatest concentrations of Sr. There was a significant positive correlation between Sr and calcium (Ca), and between barium (Ba) and Ca. Ca, Sr, and Ba interact with each other and can exert similar chemical and pharmacological effects. Mean (n \u2265 3) eggshell:egg ratios for Sr varied with species and ranged from 6.1:1 to 40.2:1; ratios for individual eggs reached 92.7:1. Mean Sr/Ca values ranged from $1.3 \\times 10^{-3}$ to $3.0 \\times 10^{-3}$ and mean eggshell thickness ranged from $83 \\pm 6 to 120 \\pm 9 \\mu m$ for all species. Eggshell thickness was not significantly correlated with Sr for any species but tended to increase with Sr concentrations. We postulate that high concentrations of Sr in the shell could affect later-stage embryos by possible interference with Ca metabolism and bone growth, resulting in reduced hatching success and potential minor beak deformities. /// Investigamos la ocurrencia y el significado $ecotoxicol\\acute{o}gico$ potencial de concentraciones elevadas de estroncio (Sr) en las $c\\acute{a}scaras$ de huevo de nueve aves paserinas de cuatro regiones en Arizona.

Two frequently invoked hypotheses to explain these shifts are that postbreeding birds select (1) dense cover to reduce risk of predation and (2) abundant fruit resources to facilitate foraging. Using mist nets between 15 June and 16 August in 2002 and 2003, we captured mature-forest birds during the postbreeding period in 12 regenerating hardwood clearcuts (three to seven years old) in southeast Ohio. Vegetation structure and fruit resources were measured at nine net locations within each clearcut. We applied an information-theoretic approach, where we used vegetative and fruit variables as predictors in seven a priori models to evaluate how habitat factors might explain capture rates. In two seasons, we captured 1,089 hatch-year (HY) and 445 after-hatch-year (AHY) postbreeding birds of 32 mature-forest species. In general, models reflecting habitat structure (density of low vegetation, canopy height) best explained variation in capture rates, which were negatively related to the density of low vegetation (&lt;1.5 m) and positively related to canopy height. Extremely dense low vegetation may be disadvantageous if it inhibits movements and provides cryptic locations for ground predators. Instead, habitats with greater vertical structure (e.g., taller vegetation) and relatively less dense low vegetation below may provide better protection from aerial and ground predators. Overall, results suggest that vegetation structure may explain high use of early-successional forests by many birds during the postbreeding period, though fruit may be the most important factor for seasonal frugivores. /// Varios estudios han demostrado que muchas aves de bosque maduro utilizan h\u00e1bitats en estados sucesionales tempranos intensamente despu\u00e9s del per\u00edodo reproductivo. Las dos hip\u00f3tesis que pueden explicar estos cambios son: (1) que las aves post-reproductivas seleccionan \u00e1reas con una cobertura densa para disminuir el riesgo de depredaci\u00f3n y (2) que las aves post-reproductivas seleccionan \u00e1reas con abundancia de frutos para facilitar el forrajeo. Utilizando redes de niebla entre el 15 de junio y el 16 de agosto de 2002 y 2003, capturamos aves de bosque maduro durante el periodo post-reproductivo en 12 bosques en regeneraci\u00f3n posterior a tala rasa (de tres a siete a\u00f1os de edad) en el sudeste de Ohio. Medimos la estructura de la vegetaci\u00f3n y la abundancia de frutos en nueve localidades de captura de aves en cada bosque secundario. Aplicamos un enfoque de teor\u00eda de la informaci\u00f3n en el cual utilizamos variables vegetativas y de frutos como variables de predicci\u00f3n en siete modelos definidos a priori para determinar c\u00f3mo los factores de h\u00e1bitat podr\u00edan explicar las tasas de captura. Durante dos estaciones, capturamos 1,089 individuos nacidos en el a\u00f1o de muestreo y 445 individuos post-reproductivos nacidos en a\u00f1os anteriores pertenecientes a 32 especies de bosque maduro. En general, los modelos que incluyeron variables de estructura del h\u00e1bitat (densidad de la vegetaci\u00f3n baja, altura del dosel) fueron los mejores para explicar la variaci\u00f3n en las tasas de captura, las cuales estuvieron relacionadas negativamente con la densidad de la vegetaci\u00f3n baja (&lt;1.5 m) y positivamente con la altura del dosel. Una vegetaci\u00f3n baja extremadamente densa puede ser desventajosa si inhibe el movimiento y si provee lugares cr\u00edpticos para depredadores terrestres. Contrariamente, los h\u00e1bitats con una mayor estructura vertical (e.g., vegetaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s alta) y con una vegetaci\u00f3n baja relativamente menos densa pueden proveer de una mejor protecci\u00f3n ante depredadores a\u00e9reos y terrestres. En general, estos resultados sugieren que la estructura de la vegetaci\u00f3n puede explicar el uso intenso de bosques en estados sucesionales tempranos durante el per\u00edodo post-reproductivo, a pesar de que la presencia de frutos puede ser el factor m\u00e1s importante para los frug\u00edvoros estacionales.\n      </p>", "Silvicultural practices, such as thinning, are increasingly performed both for commodity production and to help achieve biodiversity goals and promote ecological restoration. However, relatively little research has examined effects of thinning conifer forests on vertebrates. We experimentally manipulated stands using a randomized block design to evaluate influences of two thinning intensities on populations of diurnal breeding birds in western Oregon. We conducted point counts of birds seven times each year in 1994 (prior to treatment) and from 1995 through 2000 (subsequent to treatment). We analyzed data using multiple linear regression and information-theoretic approaches to model selection. Of the 22 species for which we had sufficient data for analysis, detections of nine species decreased and eight species increased in thinned stands relative to controls, and there was no strong evidence that thinning influenced numbers of five species. Of the 17 species that responded to thinning, the magnitude of response of eight species varied with thinning intensity; for each of these species, response was greatest in the more heavily thinned stands. Although no species was extirpated from stands following thinning, detections of Hutton's Vireos (Vireo huttoni), Golden-crowned Kinglets (Regulus satrapa), Brown Creepers (Certhia americana), Black-throated Gray Warblers (Dendroica nigrescens), and Varied Thrushes (Ixoreus naevius) decreased to less than half of the detections in controls in one or more treatment types, suggesting thinning significantly reduces their numbers. In contrast, American Robins (Turdus migratorius), Townsend's Solitaires (Myadestes townsendi), and Hammond's Flycatchers (Empidonax hammondii) were rare or absent in controls but regularly present in thinned stands, and detections of Western Tanagers (Piranga ludoviciana), Evening Grosbeaks (Coccothraustes vespertinus), and Hairy Woodpeckers (Picoides villosus) increased by threefold or more in thinned stands relative to controls. Only Pacific-slope Flycatchers (Empidonax difficilis), Warbling Vireos (Vireo gilvus), and Western Tanagers showed strong evidence of temporal trends in response. For these species, differences between numbers in controls and treated stands became more extreme through time. Our findings suggest that thinning densely stocked conifer stands in landscapes dominated by younger stands enhances habitat suitability for several species of birds, but that some unthinned patches and stands should be retained to provide refugia for species that are impacted by thinning.\n      </p>", "A surgical technique for renal biopsy by a dorsal pelvic approach was developed in helmeted guinea fowl (Numida meleagris), domestic pigeons (Columba livia domestica), Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica), Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos), Indian peafowl (Pavo cristatus), and cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus). Presurgical and postsurgical uric acid concentrations were within reference ranges and correlated with histopathologic interpretation of biopsy samples. Biopsy samples were adequate for histopathologic examination of the cortical elements of the avian kidney. All birds survived the procedure and few complications were observed. This technique for renal biopsy in birds is compared with current techniques that require an abdominal approach and expensive instrumentation.\n      </p>", "After mostly freshwater replaced agricultural drainage water used for wetland management in 1985, Selenium (Se) concentrations in 3 wintering waterfowl species and black-necked stilts (Himantopus mexicanus) from the North and South Grasslands of central California, USA, declined in the years from 1986 to 1988 and 1989 to 1994. However, Se concentrations were still above the threshold for potential reproductive impairment and exceeded background levels for some species. Consequently, we measured Se concentrations in aquatic birds in 2005 after long-term use (20 yr) of predominately freshwater for wetland management in the Grasslands. As in 1986-1994, Se concentrations in 2005 were higher for birds from the South Grasslands, which historically received more undiluted drainage water compared with the North Grasslands. Liver Se concentrations for stilts from the South Grasslands were at levels associated with potential reproductive impairment. All species from the South Grasslands, as well as mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), northern pintails (A. acuta), and American coots (Fulica americana) from the North Grasslands, were above species-specific background levels. From 1994 to 2005, Se levels in some aquatic birds stabilized above background levels likely indicating long-term cycling within the Grasslands. We recommend Se-contaminated drainage water (\u22652 ppb Se) not be used for management or allowed as an input into arid wetlands throughout the western United States.\n      </p>", "The Tongass National Forest encompasses a large expanse of temperate rainforest in southeastern Alaska and contains 12 designated Research Natural Areas (RNAs). Existing in as near a natural condition as possible, RNAs receive minimal commercial and recreational use. Because few bird studies have been conducted on RNAs, we used point counts and area searches to determine the occurrence and abundance of breeding landbirds present in vegetation communities of RNAs. Of 49 species of small landbirds detected during area searches, the most widely distributed birds among RNAs were rufous hummingbird (Selasphorus rufa), chestnut-backed chickadee (Poecile rufescens), winter wren (Troglodytes troglodytes), golden-crowned kinglet (Regulus satrapa), Swainson's thrush (Catharus ustulatus), hermit thrush (C. guttatus), varied thrush (Ixoreus naevius), and Townsend's warbler (Dendroica townsendi). The 8 most abundant species recorded on 187 point counts (&gt;0.5 birds/point) were Pacific-slope flycatcher (Empidonax difficilis), hermit thrush, varied thrush, winter wren, golden-crowned kinglet, Townsend's warbler, and chestnut-backed chickadee. Several species had significant differences in abundance between low- elevation hemlock-spruce forest and their abundance in either high- elevation fir-spruce forest or mixed conifer-shore pine muskeg. Because RNAs provide forests that are not disturbed by human activities, these sites could provide a standard to evaluate changes in bird abundance and richness that may occur on developed land in southeastern Alaska.\n      </p>", "Our purpose is to provide researchers, consultants, decision-makers, and other stakeholders with guidance to methods and metrics for investigating nocturnally active birds and bats in relation to utility-scale wind-energy development. The primary objectives of such studies are to 1) assess potential impacts on resident and migratory species, 2) quantify fatality rates on resident and migratory populations, 3) determine the causes of bird and bat fatalities, and 4) develop, assess, and implement methods for reducing risks to bird and bat populations and their habitats. We describe methods and tools and their uses, discuss limitations, assumptions, and data interpretation, present case studies and examples, and offer suggestions for improving studies on nocturnally active birds and bats in relation to wind-energy development. We suggest best practices for research and monitoring studies using selected methods and metrics, but this is not intended as cookbook. We caution that each proposed and executed study will be different, and that decisions about which methods and metrics to use will depend upon several considerations, including study objectives, expected and realized risks to bird and bat populations, as well as budgetary and logistical considerations. Developed to complement and extend the existing National Wind Coordinating Committee document \"Methods and Metrics for Assessing Impacts of Wind Energy Facilities on Wildlife\" (Anderson et al. 1999), we provide information that stakeholders can use to aid in evaluating potential and actual impacts of wind power development on nocturnally active birds and bats. We hope that decision-makers will find these guidelines helpful as they assemble information needed to support the permitting process, and that the public will use this guidance document as they participate in the permitting processes. We further hope that the wind industry will find valuable guidance from this document when 1) complying with data requirements as a part of the permitting process, 2) evaluating sites for potential development, 3) assessing impacts of operational wind-energy facilities, and 4) mitigating local and cumulative impacts on nocturnally active birds and bats.\n      </p>", "Three modes of allopatric speciation can be distinguished, depending on whether the isolating geographic barrier is within a single land mass (\"continental speciation\"), between islands of the same archipelago, or between different archipelagoes (\"insular speciation\"). The contributions of these three modes to speciation in Pacific land birds are analyzed. Continental speciation in birds has occurred in no Pacific land mass smaller than Australia, New Guinea, and possibly New Zealand; intra-archipelagal speciation has occurred only on six of the most remote archipelagoes; and inter-archipelagal speciation has produced most of the sympatric bird species pairs from the Bismarcks to Samoa. The frequency of each mode depends on area and isolation of the island, and on mobility and perhaps population density of the taxa involved. What is an \"island\" to some taxa may be a \"continent\" to others. For example, New Caledonia behaves as a continent to higher plants, insects, and lizards, but not to birds or ferns.\n      </p>", "Real-time ultrasonography was used to detect the oviductal structures in 33 birds of prey of seven different species. The oviducts were visualized in unanesthetized birds with an ultrasonographic scanning probe placed into the cloaca. The left oviduct appeared as an elongated hypoechoic structure with sharply demarcated echogenic borders and an inconsistently detectable luminal echo. The morphologic identification and regular topologic localization of the vaginal portion of the avian oviduct was confirmed with correlative dissection of the reproductive tracts. Ultrasonography is atraumatic and accurate and is a valuable procedure for noninvasive gonadal sex diagnosis in monomorphic species of raptors.\n      </p>", "There is much debate about the relative roles of poultry movements and wild bird movements in the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1. This article looks at the problem from an ornithologic perspective. Outbreaks in wild birds are examined in relation to three scenarios of possible wild bird involvement in virus transmission. These scenarios are examined separately for five phases of the outbreak that began in 1997 and which has recently become more dynamic in terms of virus spread. Most outbreaks in wild birds seem to reflect local acquisition of infection from a contaminated source, followed by rapid death nearby. Outbreaks in Europe in early 2006 indicate that the virus can be spread further by wild birds and thus that they can become infected and travel varying distances before dying, and probably passing the infection to other wild birds before death. There is only limited evidence that some wild birds can carry the virus asymptomatically, and no evidence from wild bird outbreaks that they have done so over long distances on seasonal migration routes. Other potential sources of infection and evidence for asymptomatic infection in wild birds are discussed, and the need for more ornithologic input into epidemiological studies of HPAI H5N1 is highlighted. /// Existe una gran controversia acerca del papel que cumplen los movimientos de ayes comerciales y los de ayes silvestres en la diseminaci\u00f3n del virus de influenza aviar H5N1 de alta patogenicidad.

Therefore, we studied bird use of wildlife water developments in the Sonoran Desert of southwestern Arizona, USA, using 2 observational approaches (bird surveys in washes with and without water developments and direct observations at water developments) and 1 experimental approach (direct observations at water sources with and without vegetation cover). In spring 2004, we conducted weekly bird surveys at 3 pairs (with and without developments) of washes. In spring 2005, we designed an experiment to test whether migratory birds more frequently used water developments with than without vegetation cover. During spring, in both 2004 and 2005, we documented use of water by directly observing birds at 13 existing water developments. We found little evidence to support that water developments were important water sources for migratory birds. Migratory bird communities in desert washes near wildlife water developments did not differ in species richness, relative abundance, or density when compared with washes without water developments. This observation suggests that the wildlife water developments that we studied were not an attractant to migratory birds at the landscape scale. At a finer scale, migratory birds rarely (0.1% of all observations) used water developments and experimental water sources. However, resident bird species frequently were recorded (&gt;69,000 observations) drinking and bathing at wildlife water developments. Based on our observations, we conclude that water developments are an important resource for local bird populations in the Sonoran Desert, USA, particularly during periods of drought.\n      </p>", "In the first decades after logging, the vegetation structure of harvested areas changes rapidly due to succession. For shrubland birds, many of which specialize on regeneration of specific ages, the changing vegetation structure makes determining how much habitat is available for individual species difficult. We conducted a meta-analysis to determine how populations of shrubland birds in the eastern United States and Canada respond to succession in the first 20 years after timber harvest. Based on those results, we used the area under the abundance-time regression curves to estimate the proportion of regenerating forest actually used by each bird species. Of the 28 species for which we had sufficient data, 14 showed significant changes in abundance over time. For 6 species, abundance was highest immediately after logging and decreased thereafter. Abundances of 7 other species were initially low, peaked roughly 10 years after harvest, and declined thereafter. Based on these results, shrubland birds would be expected to occupy a mean of just 53% (SD = 17%) of regenerating forests up to 20 years old. Thus, current estimates of habitat availability for shrubland birds may be too high by a factor of 2. Our findings also suggest that managed openings should be maintained on longer rotations than are currently used, providing habitat for birds that prefer older regeneration.\n      </p>", "The widespread and ongoing declines of North American bird populations that have affinites for grassland and grass-shrub habitats (hereafter referred to as grassland birds) are on track to become a prominent wildlife conservation crisis of the 21st century. There is no single cause responsible for the declines of grassland birds. Rather, a cumulative set of factors such as afforestation in the eastern United States, fragmentation and replacement of prairie vegetation with a modern agricultural landscape, and large-scale deterioration of western U.S. rangelands are the major causes for these declines. The North American Bird Conservation Initiative (NABCI) is a set of comprehensive and coordinated strategic actions modeled on the Joint Venture initiatives that were used to successfully implement the North American Waterfowl Management Plan. The NABCI is emerging as a potential broad-scale solution for conserving populations of grassland birds. Coordinating grassland bird conservation efforts with initiatives to stabilize and increase upland game birds that have strong affinities for grassland habitats-such as quail and prairie grouse-presents additional opportunities to leverage funding and resources that will positively impact virtually all species of North American grassland birds.\n      </p>", "We used playback trials to determine whether birds will cross treeless gaps to respond to simulated territorial intruders. We evaluated the effect of gap width on responses by five forest bird species. We found that for forest specialists such as the Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus), Golden-crowned Kinglet (Regulus satrapa), and the Black-throated Green Warbler (Dendroica virens), the probability of crossing gaps decreased sharply with gaps 25-40 m wide. By contrast, control trials showed no significant decrease in their probability of response up to 100 m through continuous stands. Habitat generalists such as the White-throated Sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis) and the Dark-eyed Junco (Junco hyemalis) were more prone to cross treeless gaps than forest specialists. Playback studies provide a new tool for understanding birds' responses to microscale habitat discontinuities.\n      </p>", "In mid-elevation areas of Mesoamerica, Acacia pennatula commonly occurs in mixed woods with various species of oak. During a 1-y study in Nicaragua, we found the abundance of birds in acacia was far higher than the representation of this species in the mix of trees, whether this is estimated by number of individual trees, canopy cover or foliage cover. This higher abundance was probably related to the fact that acacias supported approximately three to four times the abundance of arthropods that were found in oaks and twice the biomass. Although oak foliage supported fewer arthropods, relatively more of them were large (&gt; 1 cm). The greater preponderance of small arthropods in acacias versus oaks was probably related to the small leaflet size of acacias. However, it is likely that the higher abundance of arthropods in acacias, particularly herbivorous species, was related to the higher nutritional content of the acacia foliage (crude protein, minerals, non-structural carbohydrates) and lower content of digestion-inhibiting compounds (structural carbohydrates, total phenolics, condensed tannins). The major defensive mechanisms of acacia are mechanical (thorns) or qualitative-defence chemicals (cyanogenic glucosides) that are apparently more effective against vertebrate than invertebrate herbivores. These observations support the hypothesis that the anti-herbivore defences of acacia are primarily directed against large mammalian herbivores, rendering the foliage highly palatable to arthropods.\n      </p>", "As wind power generation is rapidly expanding worldwide, there is a need to understand whether and how preconstruction surveys can be used to predict impacts and to place turbines to minimize impacts to birds. Wind turbines in the 165-km\u00b2 Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area (APWRA), California, USA, cause thousands of bird fatalities annually, including hundreds of raptors. To test whether avian fatality rates related to rates of utilization and specific behaviors within the APWRA, from March 1998 to April 2000 we performed 1,959 30-minute behavior observation sessions (360\u00b0 visual scans using binoculars) among 28 nonoverlapping plots varying from 23 ha to 165 ha in area and including 10-67 turbines per plot, totaling 1,165 turbines. Activity levels were highly seasonal and species specific. Only 1% of perch time was on towers of operating turbines, but 22% was on towers of turbines broken, missing, or not operating. Of those species that most often flew through the rotor zone, fatality rates were high for some (e.g., 0.357 deaths/megawatt of rated capacity [MW]/yr for red-tailed hawk [Buteo jamaicensis] and 0.522 deaths/MW/yr for American kestrel [Falco sparverius]) and low for others (e.g., 0.060 deaths/MW/yr for common raven [Corvus corax] and 0.012 deaths/MW/yr for turkey vulture [Cathartes aura]), indicating specific behaviors or visual acuity differentiated these species by susceptibility to collision. Fatality rates did not correlate with utilization rates measured among wind turbine rows or plots for any species except burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia) and mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). However, mean monthly fatality rates of red-tailed hawks increased with mean monthly utilization rates (r\u00b2 = 0.67) and especially with mean monthly flights through turbine rows (r\u00b2 = 0.92). Fatality rates increased linearly with rates of utilization (r\u00b2 = 0.99) and flights near rotor zones (r\u00b2 = 1.00) for large raptor species and with rates of perching (r\u00b2 = 0.13) and close flights (r\u00b2 = 0.77) for small non-raptor species. Fatalities could be minimized or reduced by shutting down turbines during \u22651 season or in very strong winds or by leaving sufficiently large areas within a wind farm free of wind turbines to enable safer foraging and travel by birds.\n      </p>", "Natural selection may favour sexually similar brain size owing to similar selection pressures in males and females, while sexual selection may lead to sexually dimorphic brains. For example, sperm competition involves clear-cut sex differences in behaviour, as males display, mate guard and copulate with females, while females choose among males, and solicit or reject copulations. These behaviours may require fundamentally different neural government in the two sexes leading to sex-dependent brain evolution. Using two phylogenetic approaches in a comparative study, we tested for roles of both natural and sexual-selection pressures on brain size evolution of birds. In accordance with the natural-selection theory, relative brain size of males coevolved with that of females, which may be the result of adaptation to similar environmental constraints such as feeding innovation. However, the mode of brain size evolution differed between the sexes, and factors associated with sperm competition as reflected by extra-pair paternity may give rise to sexually size dimorphic brains. Specifically, species in which females have larger brains than males were found to have a higher degree of extra-pair paternity independently of potentially confounding factors, whereas species in which males have relatively larger brains than females appeared to have lower rates of extra-pair paternity. Hence, the evolution of sperm competition may select for complex behaviours together with the associated neural substrates in the sex that has a higher potential to control extra-pair copulations at the observed levels. Brain function may thus be affected differently in males and females by sexual selection.\n      </p>", "The decline in populations of several species of marsh birds in North America has prompted development of a monitoring protocol that involves the broadcast of conspecific calls to enhance detection of these secretive species. However, with a standardized protocol, temporal (seasonal) and geographic variation in responses to the broadcast of calls could lead to inadequate monitoring of migratory species with large ranges. Our objective was to examine temporal variation in the response of marsh birds to playback of conspecific calls in west-central and northern New York to determine if use of the current protocol would permit effective monitoring of their populations. From 11 April to 8 July 2005, we conducted 572 surveys at 143 survey points on 16 marshes and detected 663 individuals of our target species. Our results revealed more detections of American Bitterns (Botaurus lentiginosus) and Pied-billed Grebes (Podilymbus podiceps) early in our survey period, and more detections of Virginia Rails (Rallus limicola) and Least Bitterns (Ixobrychus exilis) later in our survey period. Only 22% of Least Bitterns were detected before 28 May, whereas 76% of American Bitterns and 70% of Pied-billed Grebes were detected before 28 May. With the current recommended monitoring protocol, surveys are to be completed during a 44-day period that includes three 10-day sampling periods separated by 1 week. However, our results indicate that this protocol would lead to inadequate and inaccurate monitoring of marsh birds in New York. Given that the timing of peak detection of different species of marsh birds varies geographically, we recommend flexibility in the timing and duration of surveys so that surveys can be synchronized with location-specific peak-detection periods. /// La reducci\u00f3n num\u00e9rica poblacional en los Estados Unidos de varias especies de aves de anegados ha fomentado el desarrollo de protocolos de monitoreo que envuelvan el uso de grabaciones de llamadas y otros sonidos (vocalizaciones) para mejorar la detecci\u00f3n de especies de h\u00e1bitos secretivos. Sin embargo, con protocolos estandarizados, las variaciones estacionales y geogr\u00e1ficas (como respuesta a las grabaciones) pueden dar origen a un monitoreo inadecuado particularmente de las especies migratorias de amplia distribuci\u00f3n.

Nuestro resultados revelan mayor cantidad de detecciones de individuos de Botarus lentiginosus y Podilymbus podiceps temprano en el periodo de conteo y mayor n\u00famero de detecciones para Rallus limicola e Ixobrichus exilis tarde en los periodos de conteo. Tan solo el 22% de los individuos de Botarus y el 70% de Podilymbus fueron detectados, despu\u00e9s del 28 de mayo. El actual protocolo de monitoreo recomienda que se termine con el mismo en un periodo de 44 dias, lo que incluye tres periodos de 10 dias de muestreos separados por una semana. Nuestros resultados indican, que dicho protocolo produce resultados inadecuados e inexactos en New York.

However, do differences in energy turnover simply represent a phenotypic adaptation to the local environment, or are they genetically based? To test this, we obtained nestling stonechats (Saxicola torquata) from equatorial Kenya (0\u00b0 N), Ireland (51.5\u00b0 N), Austria (47.5\u00b0 N) and Kazakhstan (51.5\u00b0 N). Birds were hand-raised and kept in Andechs, Germany. We measured their resting metabolic rates (RMR) and locomotor activity at an age of ca. 14 months (July) and 20 months (January), when birds went through postnuptial moult (July), and neither moulted nor exhibited enlarged gonads or migratory activity (January). RMR was generally higher during moult, but differed among populations: RMR was lowest in the resident Kenyan birds, higher in mostly sedentary Irish birds, and highest in migratory Austrian and Kazakhstan birds. Thus our data demonstrate that even in birds kept from early life under common-garden conditions, the 'pace of life', as indicated by metabolic turnover, is lower in sedentary tropical than in north-temperate migratory individuals of the same species. Such intrinsically low energy expenditure in sedentary tropical birds may have important implications for slow development, delayed senescence and high longevity in many tropical organisms.\n      </p>", "Waterbird research increasingly involves capturing birds to mearsure attributes of individuals and for attachment of telemetry devices, but there are few established techniques for capturing wading birds away from their nests. We describe the construction and testing of a new trapping technique for wading birds based on a small flip trap. Our trap was developed to capture wading birds in the Florida Everglades in water less than 30 cm deep, but could also be used to capture other waterbirds and upland species. The primary advantages of this new trap design are its ability to be esily concealed, ability to selectively capture birds, low injury rate, ease of resetting the trap after captures, minimal training requirements for operator, capacity to be fired remotely, and moderate cost. We also evaluated the effectiveness of using a net gun to capture wading birds in wetlands. Our results demonstrated that the net gun was the most effective method for capturing large numbers of wading birds, however, the modified flip trap provides a safer alternative that may be appropriate for endangered species. /// La investigaci\u00f3n con aves de \u00e1reas anegadas muchas veces envuele el capturar las aves para tomarles medidas morfom\u00e9tricas o para colocarles aparatos utilizados en radiotelemetr\u00eda.

Pathologic changes in the bony parts of the head (fractures, hyper- and hypocalcification, carcinoma) could often be diagnosed; however, pathologic alterations of the upper airway system were detected only in birds with severe disease. Most anatomic structures were detected best in the lateral projection. Fewer structures were detectable in raptors than in psittacine birds because of the multifold superimpositions caused by the triangular shape of the raptor head. The heads of 10 healthy psittacine birds were examined by computed tomography to establish a standard for the examination of the upper respiratory system. By choosing the uncommon longitudinal scanning axis, the examination time was decreased and the scan was directly compared with the conventional lateral radiograph. Additionally, five psittacine birds with symptoms indicative of rhinitis or sinusitis were examined. Compared with the healthy birds, the volume of the pneumatized areas in diseased birds was decreased. Furthermore, anatomic structures (nasal conchae, apertura sinus infraorbitalis) could be studied in detail. Successful diagnosis by conventional radiography was restricted to changes in the bony structures and to advanced cases of rhinitis or sinusitis. Early stages of upper airway disease and other soft tissue disorders were best diagnosed by computed tomography. In upper airway diseases, measurements of the pneumatized areas allow exact estimation of the degree of alteration and provide a reliable basis for treatment and prognosis.\n      </p>", "In the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, flood control has led to a drastic reduction in the area of forest habitat and altered the patchwork of forest cover types. Silvicultural management of the remaining fragmented forests has changed to reflect the altered hydrology of the forests, current economic conditions of the area, and demand for forest products. Because forest type and silvicultural management impact forest birds, differences in avian productivity within these forests directly impact bird conservation. To assist in conservation planning, we evaluated daily nest survival, nest predation rates, and brood parasitism rates of forest birds in relation to different forest cover types and silvicultural management strategies within this floodplain. Within bottomland hardwood forests, nest success of blue-gray gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea, 13%), eastern towhee (Pipilo erythrophthalmus, 28%), indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea, 18%), northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis, 22%), and yellow-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus, 18%) did not differ from that within intensively managed cottonwood plantations. However, average daily survival of 542 open-cup nests of 19 bird species in bottomland hardwoods (0.9516 \u00b1 0.0028, \u223c27% nest success) was greater than that of 543 nests of 18 species in cottonwood plantations (0.9298 \u00b1 0.0035, \u223c15% nest success). Differences in daily nest survival rates likely resulted from a combination of differences in the predator community-particularly fire ants (Solenopsis invicta)-and a marked difference in species composition of birds breeding within these 2 forest types. At least 39% of nests in bottomland hardwood forests and 65% of nests in cottonwood plantations were depredated. Rates of parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) were greater in managed cottonwoods (24%) than in bottomland hardwoods (9%). Nest success in planted cottonwood plantations for 18 species combined (\u223c14%), and for yellow-breasted chat (Icteria virens, 7%), eastern towhee (14%), indigo bunting (14%), and northern cardinal (17%) did not differ from nest success in cottonwood plantations that were coppiced from root sprouts following pulpwood harvest. Within bottomland hardwood forests, uneven-aged group-selection timber harvest reduced the combined daily nest survival of all species from 0.958 to 0.938, which reduced nest success by about 14%. Specifically, timber harvest reduced nest success of species that nest in the forest midstory and canopy, such as Acadian flycatcher (Empidonax virescens)-from 32% before harvest to 14% after harvest. Conversely, those species that nest primarily in the shrubby understory-such as northern cardinal-were not affected by timber harvest and maintained an overall nest success of about 33%. Thus, birds nesting in the understory of bottomland hardwood forests are not adversely impacted by selective timber harvest, but there is a short-term reduction in nest success for birds that nest in the canopy and midstory.\n      </p>", "Aim Species transported to and introduced into non-native environments, termed 'introductions', constitute a growing component of many regional floras and faunas, yet not all such species successfully establish. Investigations into why some introductions succeed while others fail are often based on analyses of the outcome of historical introductions. Such 'experiments in nature' have the drawback that the effects of interest may be confounded because they have not been randomized with respect to each other, and because the species and locations chosen for introduction may not be a random subset of the available species or locations. Our aim is to quantify this non-randomness using a global data set of bird introductions, and examine the factors associated with introduction probability in two subsets of these data, one taxonomic (order Anseriformes) and one geographical (British birds). Location Global. Methods Statistical analyses of the distributions among taxa and locations for 1378 introduction events for 426 bird species across the world, and statistical analyses of the characteristics of Anseriform and British bird species selected for introduction. Results Global introductions of birds have been highly non-random with respect to taxon, location of origin, and location of introduction. Most introductions involve species in just five families (Phasianidae, Passeridae, Psittacidae, Anatidae and Columbidae), and most introductions have been to temperate and island locations. Within the taxonomic and geographical subsets, the species chosen for introduction tend to be abundant species that would have been relatively easy to obtain. Main conclusions The characteristics of the species and locations chosen for introduction are not representative of species and locations in general, which limits our ability to draw general conclusions from historical records, and generates problems of confounding and non-independence in statistical analyses of introduction success. We suggest possible solutions for these problems.\n      </p>", "Delta-wing theory, which predicts the aerodynamics of aircraft like the Concorde, is the conventional explanation for the way in which a bird's tail operates in flight. Recently, doubt has been cast on the validity of applying a theory devised for supersonic aircraft to the small tails of slow-flying birds. By testing delta-wing models and birds' tails behind bodies with wings, I empirically show that the tails of birds produce lift in a very similar way to conventional delta-wing models. Both Perspex and birds' tail models produce lift similar to that predicted by delta-wing theory when narrowly spread and at low angles of attack. However, when widely spread and at high angles of attack, both tails and Perspex models produce much less lift than predicted, owing to vortex breakdown after which the assumptions of delta-wing theory are violated. These results indicate that birds' tails can be regarded as delta wings but that the theory predicting the forces produced by delta wings can only be applied within acceptable limits (i.e. tails spread less than 60\u00b0 and at angles of attack of less than 20\u00b0).\n      </p>", "All recent studies of bird phylogeny have produced poorly resolved relationships among the orders of Neoaves, the lineage that includes most modern birds. This \"bush\" result suggests the possibility of an explosive and potentially unresolvable evolutionary radiation. However, simultaneous radiations of multiple lineages are thought to be rare or nonexistent in nature and difficult to corroborate empirically because lack of phylogenetic resolution can also be caused by analytical artifacts. Here we examine the predictions of the explosive radiation hypothesis for five independent genetic datasets for Neoaves. We propose a methodology for testing for polytomies of evolutionary lineages, perform likelihood-ratio tests to compare trees with zero-length branches to more resolved trees, compare topologies between independent gene trees, and propose a power test for the SOWH test. The evidence of (1) extremely short (in some cases zero-length) branches for interordinal relationships across independent gene trees and (2) topological incongruence among gene trees suggests that the bird tree includes essentially simultaneous radiation of multiple lineages. This result explains why a robust phylogeny of birds has not been produced despite much effort on the part of avian systematists.\n      </p>", "The impacts of potential linear barriers such as roads, highways, and power lines on rainforest fauna are poorly understood. In the central Brazilian Amazon, we compared the frequency of local movements (\u2264300 m long) of understory birds within intact forest and across a 30- to 40-m-wide road over a 2-year period. Rainforest had regenerated along some road verges, to the extent that a nearly complete canopy was formed in some areas, so we also assessed whether this facilitated bird movement. Movement data were determined from 1212 recaptures of 3681 netted birds at six study sites. The road significantly inhibited total bird movement across roads at five of the six sites. Bird foraging guilds varied in their responses to the road and different ages of regrowth. Movements of frugivorous and edge and gap species were not inhibited at any site, whereas most forest-dependent insectivores (mixed-species flocks, terrestrial species, and army-ant followers) had markedly inhibited road-crossing movements, except at sites with extensive regrowth. Solitary understory species were especially vulnerable, rarely crossing even roads overgrown by tall regrowth. For sensitive species, road-crossing movements were inhibited because individuals tended to avoid both edge-affected habitat near the road and the road clearing itself. Our results suggest that even narrow roads with low traffic volumes can reduce local movements of many insectivorous birds in Amazonia.\n      </p>", "In the midwestern United States, less than 1% of the original tallgrass prairie ecosystem remains. State and federal agencies have responded to this habitat loss with programs and land acquisition that have increased the amount of grassland on the landscape by restoring grassland from other land-use practices. We assessed the effects of habitat restoration and the relative contribution of local habitat and landscape factors on breeding grassland birds in northern Iowa. During the 1999 and 2000 breeding seasons, we surveyed grassland birds in 10 tallgrass prairies and 10 restored grasslands that contained a wide diversity of habitat and landscape conditions. Densities of common bird species were similar between habitat types, except for grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) and savannah sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis), which were 4 and 9 times more dense in restored grasslands, respectively. Species richness of breeding birds was similar between habitat types. Habitat structure was different in prairies and restored grasslands; restored grasslands had 7% less total vegetation cover and 3% more bare ground. A nested, multiscale analysis indicated that habitat structure explained some variation in species richness and bird density of all common species, yet addition of landscape structure improved models for species richness and for density of 4 of 8 species considered, explaining an additional 10-29% of the variation. Edge-density metrics were the most common variables entering into landscape models; most species had lower densities in landscapes with high edge density. Our results indicate that restored grassland habitats contain bird communities generally similar to those in native prairie habitats in northern Iowa, suggesting that restored grasslands may provide similar habitat suitability for most grassland birds. In addition, both local habitat and landscape factors can be important for managing breeding grassland birds.\n      </p>", "No other group of North American birds has declined as precipitously and over so large an area as has the grassland assemblage. In the Flint Hills of Kansas, the largest extant region of tallgrass prairie, annual spring burning of rangeland has largely replaced traditional regimes and natural patterns with longer intervals between burns. I examined effects of burning and low-intensity cattle grazing on abundances of seven bird species at Konza Prairie Research Natural Area in June 2002 and 2003. Every species was affected by fire, with Upland Sandpipers (Bartramia longicauda) more abundant, and six species\u2014Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), Henslow's Sparrow (A. henslowii), Dickcissel (Spiza americana), Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna), Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater), and Bell's Vireo (Vireo bellii)\u2014either less abundant or absent at sites in the breeding season following a fire. These results demonstrate that annual burning limits the potential of much of the Flint Hills prairie to harbor high breeding densities of many grassland birds. On the other hand, I found a trade-off between immediate and longer-term effects of burning for several grass-dependent species. Grasshopper Sparrows, Henslow's Sparrows, and Eastern Meadowlarks, although more numerous in areas that were not burned the preceding spring, were less abundant at sites burned every 4 yrs than those burned at shorter intervals. In contrast, shrub-dependent Bell's Vireos were more abundant at sites burned every 4 yrs. Upland Sandpipers, Grasshopper Sparrows, and Eastern Meadowlarks were more abundant in grazed areas. Use of alternatives to annual burning could increase habitat heterogeneity by transforming the Flint Hills into a mosaic of regularly, but asynchronously, burned pastures that would better meet the diverse habitat needs of the region's grassland birds. /// Ning\u00fan otro grupo de aves de norteam\u00e9rica se ha reducido en n\u00famero de forma tan precipitada y sobre un \u00e1rea tan extensiva, que las aves de yerbazales.

Theoretically, potential pathogens might establish themselves in released wild birds or be spread from them to other species. There are very few fully substantiated accounts of disease problems associated with translocation or releases of wild birds, and much of the \"evidence\" has been circumstantial. Serious study of the subject has been confined to Hawaii, Mauritius, and a few other locations. Although such research has added weight to the thesis that infectious disease may contribute to a decline in free-living populations, dissemination of organisms by released birds has generally not been confirmed. The paucity of sound data on this subject is probably attributable to the failure to adequately monitor pathogens and disease in birds prior to and following release. More rigorous research is needed to evaluate the true role of released birds in the introduction and dissemination of pathogenic organisms.\n      </p>", "It is well established that birds use fat stores to primarily fuel migration; however, few studies have focused on the causes and consequences of observed seasonal changes in fatty acid composition of fat stores in birds. We propose and test two hypotheses that address the causes of these seasonal changes in composition of fat stores: (1) diet composition determines fatty acid composition of fat stores, and (2) birds selectively metabolize and store certain fatty acids during migration in lieu of changing their diet. When we offered Red-eyed Vireos (Vireo olivaceous) choices between diets that differed only in fatty acid composition, vireos preferred diets with more triolein over diets with more tristearin and tripalmitin, and these preferences were similar between seasons. We also collected fat samples six times throughout the year from captive Red-eyed Vireos fed one of two diets differing in fatty acid composition, and found that fatty acid composition of stored fat differed by diet and changed over time, although these changes were not season-specific or consistent with the selective-metabolism hypothesis. Thus, fatty acid composition of stored fat was primarily a product of diet composition; selective metabolism possibly played a minor, but important, role. Given recent evidence that fatty acid composition of birds affects their energy expenditure during intense exercise, the implication is that birds at stopover sites can influence the fatty acid composition of their body fat by selective feeding, and this can significantly affect the energetic cost of migration. /// Se sabe que las aves utilizan reservas de grasa principalmente como fuente de energ\u00eda durante la migraci\u00f3n; sin embargo, pocos estudios han analizado las causas y consecuencias de los cambios estacionales en la composici\u00f3n de \u00e1cidos grasos de las reservas de grasa de las aves. Aqu\u00ed proponemos y probamos dos hip\u00f3tesis que se relacionan con las causas de los cambios estacionales en la composici\u00f3n de las reservas de grasa: (1) la composici\u00f3n de la dieta determina la composici\u00f3n de \u00e1cidos grasos de las reservas de grasa, y (2) las aves metabolizan y almacenan de manera selectiva ciertos \u00e1cidos grasos durante la migraci\u00f3n, en lugar de cambiar sus dietas. Ofrecimos a individuos de la especie Vireo olivaceous para que elijan entre dietas que s\u00f3lo difer\u00edan en la composici\u00f3n de \u00e1cidos grasos, los cu\u00e1les prefirieron dietas con m\u00e1s trioleina que dietas con m\u00e1s tristearina y tripalmitina, y estas preferencias fueron similares entre estaciones. Colectamos adem\u00e1s muestras de grasa, en seis oportunidades a lo largo del a\u00f1o, de individuos en cautiverio alimentados con una de las dos dietas disponibles, las que difirieron en la composici\u00f3n de \u00e1cidos grasos. Encontramos que la composici\u00f3n de \u00e1cidos grasos de las reservas de grasa difiri\u00f3 en relati\u00f3n a las dietas y vari\u00f3 a lo largo del tiempo, aunque estos cambios no fueron estacionalmente espec\u00edficos ni coherentes con la hip\u00f3tesis de metabolismo selectivo. Por lo tanto, la composici\u00f3n de \u00e1cidos grasos de las reservas de grasa fue principalmente el producto de la composici\u00f3n de la dieta; el metabolismo selectivo probablemente jug\u00f3 un papel menor, aunque importante. Existe evidencia reciente que sugiere que la composici\u00f3n de \u00e1cidos grasos en las aves afecta el gasto energ\u00e9tico que tienen durante per\u00edodos de ejercicios intensos, lo que implica que las aves pueden influir sobre la composici\u00f3n de los \u00e1cidos grasos en sus reservas de grasa al alimentarse de manera selectiva en los sitios de parada migratoria, lo que puede afectar significativamente el costo energ\u00e9tico de la migraci\u00f3n.\n      </p>", "Agricultural environments are critical to the conservation of biota throughout the world. Efforts to identify key influences on the conservation status of fauna in such environments have taken complementary approaches. Many studies have focused on the role of remnant or seminatural vegetation and emphasized the influence on biota of spatial patterns in the landscape. Others have recognized that many species use diverse \"countryside\" elements within farmland, and emphasize the benefits of landscape heterogeneity for conservation. Here, we investigated the effect of independent measures of both the spatial pattern (extent and configuration) and heterogeneity of elements (i.e., land uses/vegetation types) on bird occurrence in farm-scale agricultural mosaics in southeastern Australia. Birds were sampled in all types of elements in 27 mosaics (each 1 \u00d7 1 km) selected to incorporate variation in cover of native vegetation and the number of different element types in the mosaic. We used an information-theoretic approach to identify the mosaic properties that most strongly influenced bird species richness. Subgroups of birds based on habitat requirements responded most strongly to the extent of preferred elements in mosaics. Woodland birds were richer in mosaics with higher cover of native vegetation while opentolerant species responded to the extent of scattered trees. In contrast, for total species richness, mosaic heterogeneity (richness of element types) and landscape context (cover of native vegetation in surrounding area) had the greatest influence. These results showed that up to 76% of landscape-level variation in richness of bird groups is attributable to mosaic properties directly amenable to management by landowners. Key implications include (1) conservation goals for farm landscapes must be carefully defined because the richness of different faunal components is influenced by different mosaic properties; (2) the extent of native vegetation is a critical influence in agricultural environments because it drives the farmscale richness of woodland birds and has a broader context effect on total bird richness in mosaics; (3) land-use practices that enhance the heterogeneity of farmland mosaics are beneficial for native birds; and (4) the cumulative effect of even small elements in farm mosaics contribute to the structural properties of entire landscapes.\n      </p>", "Ten psittacine birds (3 African grey parrots [Psittacus erithacus], 3 blue and gold macaws [Ara ararauna], 2 scarlet macaws [Ara macao], a harlequin macaw [Ara ararauna x macao], and a yellow-naped Amazon parrot [Amazona ochrocephala auropalliata]) with histories of chronic sinusitis were referred for evaluation before possible surgical therapy. The duration of clinical signs in these birds ranged from 8 months to 11 years, and response to conventional medical therapy had been poor. Diagnostic procedures performed in each bird included a physical examination, complete blood count, plasma biochemical analysis, survey whole body and skull radiographs, and skull magnetic resonance imaging. In 7 of the 10 birds, a discrete lesion was localized by using magnetic resonance imaging. Six of these 7 birds had surgery performed to remove the lesion. Four granulomas, a mucocele, and a polyp were diagnosed by histopathologic examination. The chronic sinusitis resolved after surgery in 5 birds. Magnetic resonance imaging proved to be an excellent diagnostic tool for examining the avian infraorbital sinus, allowing identification, localization, and characterization of lesions within the sinuses.\n      </p>", "Effects of silvicultural activities on birds are of increasing interest because of documented national declines in breeding bird populations for some species and the potential that these declines are in part due to changes in forest habitat. Silviculturally induced disturbances have been advocated as a means to achieve suitable forest conditions for priority wildlife species in bottomland hardwood forests. We evaluated how silvicultural activities on conservation lands in bottomland hardwood forests of Louisiana, USA, influenced species-specific densities of breeding birds. Our data were from independent studies, which used standardized point-count surveys for breeding birds in 124 bottomland hardwood forest stands on 12 management areas. We used Program DISTANCE 5.0, Release 2.0 (Thomas et al. 2006) to estimate density for 43 species with &gt;50 detections. For 36 of those species we compared density estimates among harvest regimes (individual selection, group selection, extensive harvest, and no harvest). We observed 10 species with similar densities in those harvest regimes compared with densities in stands not harvested. However, we observed 10 species that were negatively impacted by harvest with greater densities in stands not harvested, 9 species with greater densities in individual selection stands, 4 species with greater densities in group selection stands, and 4 species with greater densities in stands receiving an extensive harvest (e.g., &gt;40% canopy removal). Differences in intensity of harvest influenced densities of breeding birds. Moreover, community-wide avian conservation values of stands subjected to individual and group selection, and stands not harvested, were similar to each other and greater than that of stands subjected to extensive harvest that removed &gt;40% canopy cover. These results have implications for managers estimating breeding bird populations, in addition to predicting changes in bird communities as a result of prescribed and future forest management practices.\n      </p>", "Avian influenza H5N1 viruses pose a significant threat to human health because of their ability to infect humans directly. In the paper, three highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza viruses were isolated from three species of migratory birds in Qinghai Province of China in 2006. The analysis of the genome sequences indicated that the three isolates shared high homology with each other (94% to 99%). Three isolates shared a common ancestor and were closest to strains isolated from Qinghai and Siberia in 2005, but distinct from poultry viruses found in Southeast Asia. In experimental infection, all three viruses were highly pathogenic to chickens and mice. The results suggest that highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses still exist in the migratory birds and could spread to other regions with wild bird migration. /// Los virus de influenza aviar tipo H5N1 son una amenaza significante para la salud humana debido a su capacidad de infectar directamente a los humanos. En este trabajo, se aislaron tres virus de influenza aviar H5N1 altamente pat\u00f3genos a partir de tres especies de aves migratorias en la provincia de Qinghai en China en el a\u00f1o 2006. El an\u00e1lisis de las secuencias del genoma indic\u00f3 que los tres aislados compartian altos porcentajes de homolog\u00eda entre ellos (94% a 99%). Los tres aislados compart\u00edan un ancestro com\u00fan y estaban muy cercanos a las cepas aisladas en Qinghai y en Siberia en el a\u00f1o 2005, pero fueron diferentes a los virus aislados de aves dom\u00e9sticas en el Sureste de Asia, En la infecci\u00f3n experimental, todos los tres virus fueron altamente pat\u00f3genos para pollos y ratones. Los resultados sugieren que los virus de influenza aviar H5N1 de alta patogenicidad a\u00fan existen en aves migratorias y pueden diseminarse a otras regiones mediante la migraci\u00f3n de aves silvestres.\n      </p>", "In the western United States, riparian ecosystems are among the highest priorities for improved management and restoration. Riparian vegetation has been widely destroyed or seriously degraded by livestock grazing, water diversions, altered flood regimes, and other human activities. Riparian degradation has led to a major federal initiative to assess riparian areas and prioritize them for restoration. Proper Functioning Condition (PFC) assessment has served as the main methodology for assessing riparian health by the United States Bureau of Land Management (BLM), United States Forest Service (USFS), and United States Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). PFC is a qualitative rapid assessment method whose purpose is to assess \"how well the physical processes are functioning\" (BLM 1998a:1). Here, I propose a simple method for incorporating an assessment of the breeding land-bird community into the PFC methodology. This would bring PFC assessment closer to an evaluation of biotic integrity. Experts identified 77 species as obligate or dependent breeding riparian land birds in the western United States, and their occurrence serves as the standard to which site data can be compared. The method is illustrated with sample data from the Boise River in southwestern Idaho. The first step was to construct a list of riparian obligate and dependent land-bird species that should occur on the site during the breeding season. Relative abundance data from the Breeding Bird Survey could be used to fine-tune the list of expected obligate and dependent species. The simplest scoring was to calculate the percentage of potential obligate and dependent species that actually occurred on the site (i.e., 44% [n=25] in this example). Knowledge of the ecology of those species actually on the site and those missing should be used along with the score to help determine conservation priority.\n      </p>", "Many young birds on the Arctic tundra are confronted by a challenging task: they must molt their feathers and accumulate fat stores for the autumn migration before climatic conditions deteriorate. Our understanding of the costs and constraints associated with these stages is extremely limited. We investigated post-juvenal molt and premigratory fattening in free-ranging juvenile White-crowned Sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii) on the Arctic tundra. We found evidence for trade-offs between premigratory fat accumulation and molt: heavily molting birds had significantly less fat. Birds increased the rate of fat accumulation as the season progressed, but we found no evidence of a similar increase in rate of molt. Using a controlled captive study to isolate the energetic costs of body feather replacement, we found no difference in fat or size-corrected mass of birds actively growing body feathers as compared to controls. Molting birds, however, consumed 17% more food than controls, suggesting a significant cost of body feather growth. Our results provide evidence of significant costs, constraints, and trade-offs associated with post-juvenal molt and premigratory fat accumulation in young Arctic birds.\n      </p>", "1. Data from 364 mammal and 564 bird species were used to compare these two taxa in the patterns of variation in population density and energy use as a function of body mass. 2. This study demonstrates previously unappreciated quantitative differences between mammals and birds. Over a wide range of sizes, population densities and rates of energy use are at least one order of magnitude higher in mammals than in birds of similar size. The highest population densities are found in species that weigh about 100 g in mammals and 30 g in birds. 3. Comparisons between mammals and birds from the same dietary category indicate that mammals maintain higher densities and use more energy than birds. Insectivorous mammals and birds maintain the lowest densities. 4. Flying mammals and birds reach lower densities and use more energy than nonflying forms. 5. These findings reveal relationships between the morphology, physiology and behaviour of individual organisms and the ecological performance of these endothermic vertebrates in populations, communities and ecosystems: relationships that have not previously been appreciated.\n      </p>", "The importance of the lower Rahway River, New Jersey, to wading birds was investigated, and foraging patterns and interspecific differences in wading bird microhabitat use are described. Foraging decisions by wading birds are complex and occur at several levels. In order to examine foraging decisions at the habitat and microhabitat levels, 79 censuses were conducted by boat along a 5-km tidal section of this river in 1988, 1998, 1999, and 2002. The locations of 1,148 birds were recorded on maps, and patterns of microhabitat use were determined. Overall, year, date, and tide level were important predictors for the numbers of wading birds that were recorded. However, each species responded to a different combination of variables: for Great Egret it was year and date; for Snowy Egret date and tide level; and for Glossy Ibis year, date, and tide level. Tide flow direction was not important for any species. For all three species, spatial distributions long the river were clumped rather than uniform, which were associated with physical characteristics along this section of the river. All three species used the mouths of narrow tidal creeks more frequently than expected, but species differed in the use of mudflats and areas of slow-moving water. There was little overlap among species in spatial distribution along the river, but the overall use of microhabitats was broadly similar. This study suggests that the lower Rahway River estuary in New Jersey is valuable to local wildlife and should be considered in future development plans.\n      </p>", "1. The little bustard Tetrax tetrax is among many birds thought to be declining because of agricultural intensification in western Europe. In contrast with the situation elsewhere, bustard numbers have greatly increased during the last 50 years in the Crau, southern France, as agriculture has been developing. We wished to ascertain which features of agricultural development might have supported this population increase. 2. Using data on habitat-specific densities obtained by surveys of the Crau in 1998 and 1999, we assessed how breeding male little bustards used habitats representing various levels of agricultural intensification. We also documented historical changes in bustard numbers and agricultural trends in the Crau, comparing them with present patterns of habitat use, to determine how changes in farmed landscapes may have driven population trends. 3. Male bustards used natural steppe and extensive agricultural habitats (fallow, grazed crops, legume crops), whereas more intensive agricultural habitats (hay-meadows, grain crops) were little used. Mean densities on extensive agricultural habitats were always high, but densities on steppe varied with landscape composition: densities were low where steppe was dominant in the landscape, but high where steppe and extensive agriculture were mixed. 4. Available literature showed that little bustards settled in the Crau around 1950, after 40% of the original steppe had been converted into arable land. We estimate a current population of 473-539 breeding males. Only 17% of the original steppe remains, but extensive agricultural habitats still represent 30% of arable land. 5. Both historical data and present habitat use suggest that little bustard population trends in the Crau are driven by the development of extensive agriculture. Extensive agricultural habitats may provide little bustards with resources unavailable or scarce in natural steppe. Severe declines in little bustard numbers observed elsewhere could be reversed within a few decades by restoring extensive agricultural habitats. The potential impact of current European agricultural policies is discussed, with special reference to agri-environmental measures and set-aside policy. 6. This work provides an example of an avian species that benefits from cultivated landscapes, providing that they are extensive rather than intensive. We propose a simple conceptual model to illustrate how little bustards, and possibly grassland birds in general, might respond where natural habitats are modified along orthogonal axes representing cultivation and agricultural intensification.\n      </p>", "We examined cavity-nesting bird use of natural snags (n = 221) and 10- to 12-year-old snags (n = 836) created by topping mature conifers in 3 silvicultural treatments (group-selection cuts, 2-story regeneration harvests, clearcuts with retained trees) and 2 snag arrangements (clustered, scattered) in 30 Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) stands in the Oregon Coast Range. Eight bird species nested in created snags. Open-canopy stands (2-story and clearcut treatments) had higher levels of avian nesting, species richness, and species diversity compared to closed-canopy, group-selection stands. We did not find a difference in nesting levels between clustered and scattered snags. In created snags, most active nests were in the top 25% of the bole, cavity entrances typically faced northeast, and the presence of dead branches did not alter use of snags for nesting. Topped conifers that remained alive (n = 102) were rarely used for nesting or foraging. Since the last survey 6 years prior to our survey, the number of cavities per created snag per silvicultural treatment increased 3.3- to 6-fold, and we observed 4 additional avian species nesting; 3 were secondary cavity nesters. Total cavities per snag averaged 5.1, 4.3, and 2.5 for created snags, natural snags &gt;12 years old, and natural snags &lt;12 years old, respectively. Only 1 created snag fell in the decade since topping. Natural new snag recruitment resulting from residual green tree mortality was highest in 2-story stands (0.76 snag/ha) and lowest in clearcuts (0.20 snag/ha). Snags created by topping large conifers provided nesting and foraging structures for cavity-nesting birds under a range of silvicultural conditions, and use was influenced more by residual green tree density than snag arrangement. In addition, created snags increased in value for birds through their first decade (88% had cavities). Because snags created by topping last long and are readily used by birds, they should be considered a management option to improve avian habitat in managed forests.\n      </p>", "Seven psittacine birds from an aviary of 35 birds developed respiratory disease and died after the premises were cleaned with a commercial solution of undiluted sodium hypochlorite (5% chlorine bleach). Six birds died within 12 days postexposure, and clinical abnormalities were first observed at 6 days. All 7 birds were necropsied and had gross and histopathologic lesions of the trachea, including epithelial deciliation (7/7), ulceration (6/7), squamous metaplasia (5/7), and epithelial hyperplasia (5/7). These tracheal lesions were consistent with inhalation of a noxious agent. Death in these birds was considered to result from hypoxia secondary to blockage of the trachea or pulmonary congestion and, in some cases, sepsis secondary to invasion of bacteria through the altered tracheal mucosa.\n      </p>", "This review provides an overview of anatomic and physiologic features of the avian kidney that should be considered in designing regimens for renally excreted drugs in birds. Veterinarians frequently use drugs in birds that are formulated for use in mammals. Attempts have been made to extrapolate drug dosages for birds from those prescribed for mammals using allometric equations based on metabolic rates. Differences in anatomy and physiology of the two classes of animals make it difficult to achieve equivalent drug concentrations and durations of drug exposure, that is, pharmacokinetic equivalency, in birds and mammals using dosage normalization schemes such as the allometric equations currently in use. Furthermore, current schemes of allometric scaling separate birds into two large groups: passerines and nonpasserines. Because of the many structural and functional differences in the kidneys of birds within each of these two groups, it seems necessary to develop regimens for smaller, more uniform, groups of birds. Further studies may yield information that will allow birds to be grouped according to physiologic differences that represent adaptations to their environment.\n      </p>", "We studied physiognomy-specific (i.e., gaps vs. understory) responses of birds to low harvest (18.7 m\u00b3/ha), reduced-impact logging by comparing 3500 mist net captures in control and cut blocks of an Amazonian tena firme forest in Brazil at 20-42 mo postharvest. Species richness did not differ significantly between control (92 species) and cut (85) forest based on rarefaction to 1200 captures. Fifty-six percent of all species were shared between control and cut forest, compared to the 64 percent shared between control blocks. Higher captures of nectarivores and frugivores in cut forest likely occurred as a consequence of postharvest resource blooms. Higher captures of some insectivores in cut as compared to control forest were unexpected, attributable to increased wandering or shifts from association with midstory to understory as a consequence of habitat alteration. Logging influenced capture rates for 21 species, either consistently, or via positive interaction with physiognomy or time (13 species higher in cut forest and 8 species higher in control forest). Cut understory sites had lower diversity (H') and scaled dominance than understory and gap sites in control forest. Temporal changes in captures may have resulted from successional dynamics in cut forest: two guilds and three species increased in abundance. Increases in abundances of guilds and particular species were more prevalent in control than in cut forest, suggesting that logging displaced birds to control forest. In general, the effects of logging were relatively minor; low harvest rates and reduced-impact methods may help to retain aspects of avian biodiversity in Amazon forest understories. /// N\u00f3s estudamos as respostas fision\u00f4mico-espec\u00edficas (ou seja, clareiras vs. sub-bosque) das aves \u00e0 explora\u00e7\u00e3o madeireira de impacto-reduzido (18.7 /ha) comparando 3,500 capturas com redes em parcelas controle e exploradas de uma floresta de terra firme na Amazonia Brasileira entre 20 a 42 meses ap\u00f3s a explora\u00e7\u00e3o.

Cinq\u00fcenta e seis por cento das esp\u00e9cies eram compartilhadas entre a floresta controle e a floresta explorada, enquanto que 64% das esp\u00e9cies eram compartilhadas entre as parcelas controle.

As maiores taxas de captura de alguns inset\u00edvoros em floresta explorada em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 floresta controle foram inesperadas, e s\u00e3o atribu\u00eddas ao incremento da mobilidade das aves ou a um deslocamento de esp\u00e9cies associadas ao m\u00e9dio-bosque para o sub-bosque em resposta \u00e0s altera\u00e7\u00f5es de h\u00e1bitat.

Location: This study includes information on species of birds from throughout the world. Methods: I gathered data on body size variation from the literature and used two general meta-analytical procedures to test the validity of Bergmann's rule in birds: a modified vote-counting approach and calculation of overall effect sizes. Related species may show similar body size trends, thus I performed all analyses using nonphylogenetic and phylogenetic methods. I used tests of phylogenetic signal for each data set to decide which type of statistical analysis (nonphylogenetic or phylogenetic) was more appropriate. Results: The majority of species of birds (76 of 100 species) are larger at higher latitudes, and in cooler areas (20 of 22 species). Birds show a grand mean correlation coefficient of +0.32 for body size and latitude, and -0.81 for body size and temperature, both significant trends. Sedentary species show stronger body size trends in some, but not all, analyses. Neither males nor females consistently have stronger body size trends. Additionally, the strength of body size trends does not vary with latitude or body mass. Conclusions: Bergmann's rule holds for birds throughout the world, regardless of whether temperature or latitude (as a proxy) is used. Previous studies have suggested that Bergmann's rule is stronger for sedentary than migratory species, males than females and temperate than tropical taxa. I did not find strong support for any of these as general themes for birds, although few studies of tropical taxa have been conducted. The processes responsible for Bergmann's rule remain somewhat of a black box; however, fasting endurance is probably a more important factor than the traditional hypothesis of heat conservation.\n      </p>", "We compared the distribution of shorebirds, wading birds, and seabirds in coastal habitats along the entire Pacific and Atlantic coasts of Panama in January 1993. For all birds combined, the greatest densities occurred on mudflats with mangrove swamps adjacent to ocean-upwelling zones in the Bay of Panama. Median densities on mudflats with mangroves were more than 26 times greater than on mudflats without mangroves, and more than 100 times greater than in habitats without mudflats and mangroves. Median density of shorebirds in sectors with mudflats and mangroves was more than 32 times greater than on mudflats without mangroves, and more than 1,000 times greater than densities in habitats without mudflats and mangroves. The respective median densities of seabirds and wading birds were 16 and 3 times greater on mudflats with mangroves than on mudflat without mangroves. We conclude that coastal waterbirds in Panama occur in greatest densities where a combination of geomorphological features and ocean upwelling lead to the formation of highly productive, broad mudflats backed by mangroves.\n      </p>", "A recent explanation for diversity gradients proposes a 'null model' based on how species ranges are constrained by the geometry of bounded domains. We conduct a test of this hypothesis by comparing patterns predicted by two two-dimensional geometric models against observed diversity patterns for terrestrially feeding Nearctic birds. Consistent with previous tests in two-dimensional space, we find empirical support for the hypothesis to be very weak. We also point out a fundamental conceptual flaw in the hypothesis with respect to the key assumption that ranges can exist independently of the environment in which they are embedded that undermines its theoretical basis as well. We conclude that the mid-domain effect has little empirical support and no theoretical support for its existence, and recommend that it be eliminated as a potential explanation for diversity gradients.\n      </p>", "In response to predictions of mass extinctions in the twenty-first century, birds can play a critically important role in identifying key sites for biodiversity conservation. The BirdLife Biodiversity Project has mapped the distributions of all the world's restricted-range bird species and identified the areas where they are concentrated. Re-analysis of project data originally published in 1992 has led to the identification of 218 'Endemic Bird Areas' (EBAs), defined as areas supporting two or more species with ranges of less than 50,000 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Point locality data for a total of 2649 such restricted-range birds were mapped using GIS to identify these areas. A large series of regional maps and six tables present the project findings in outline, and details of revisions to the original analysis are provided. In total, EBAs occupy a mere 4.5% of the Earth's land surface, and contain 73% of all globally threatened birds; research to date indicates a high congruence of endemism between birds and other life-forms, so that it is reasonable to propose that EBAs should be used as guides to general centres of endemism. Identifying refugia, the use of GIS and remote sensing, and exchange of information between biogeographers are three ways to continue this work towards a global map of biodiversity.\n      </p>", "In psittacine birds, the antemortem diagnosis of aspergillosis is usually based on the clinical signalment combined with the results of diagnostic tests such as radiography, routine hematologic and biochemical analysis, and biopsy. For several years, plasma protein electrophoresis has been used as an ancillary diagnostic technique in forming a diagnosis and treatment plan in avian species. More recently, a commercially available assay to measure galactomannan, an Aspergillus species antigen, has been described for clinical use in humans, cattle, horses, dogs, and gyr falcons. This report describes several confirmed cases of aspergillosis, with accompanying clinical data, including plasma protein electrophoresis and galactomannan assay results, in addition to results of traditional evaluations by hematology, radiography, and biopsy. In clinical cases in psittacine birds, the galactomannan assay appears useful for detecting circulating Aspergillus antibody.\n      </p>", "Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests with Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) are associated with higher bird abundance and diversity than are ponderosa pine forests lacking Gambel oak. Little is known, however, about specific structural characteristics of Gambel oak trees, clumps, and stands that may be important to birds in ponderosa pine-Gambel oak (hereafter pine-oak) forests. We examined associations among breeding birds and structural characteristics of Gambel oak at a scale similar in size to individual bird territories in pine-oak forests in northern Arizona and western New Mexico, USA. Avian species richness and occurrence of some bird species were associated with specific growth forms of Gambel oak. Estimated probability of Virginia's warblers (Vermivora virginiae), black-headed grosbeaks (Pheucticus melanocephalus), and red-faced warblers (Cardellina rubrifrons) occurring at points increased with increasing density of pole-sized Gambel oak 7-15 cm in diameter at breast height. We also found evidence that large Gambel oak trees (\u226523 cm dbh) were associated with increased occurrence of yellow-rumped warblers (Dendroica coronata) at points. Some avian associations with oak were influenced by characteristics of ponderosa pines. For example, bird species richness was positively associated with the abundance of large Gambel oak when density of large pine trees \u226523 cm in diameter at breast height was low. Because large oak trees are rare and their numbers are thought to be declining, efforts should be made to retain and promote growth of additional oaks in this size class. Forest management practices that maintain forest openings, such as prescribed burning, could promote growth of pole-sized Gambel oak, which appears important to some bird species in pine-oak forests.\n      </p>", "Ranches are being converted to exurban housing developments in the southwestern United States, with potentially significant but little-studied impacts on biological diversity. We counted birds in grasslands and savannas in southeastern Arizona that were grazed by livestock, embedded in low-density exurban housing developments, or both, or neither. Species richness and bird abundance were higher in exurban neighborhoods than in undeveloped landscapes, independent of livestock grazing. The positive response to development was particularly evident among doves, quail, hummingbirds, aerial insectivores, and some but not all ground-foraging sparrows. Effects of livestock grazing were comparatively minor and mostly involved birds with requirements for tall ground cover or the lack of it. The average rank correlation between counts of individual species and housing density was positive across all transects. However, this relationship disappeared among the exurban transects alone, and bird species richness on the exurban transects was negatively correlated with the number of homes nearby. These results suggest that the positive influence of exurban development on avian abundance and variety was greatest at the lowest housing densities. We attribute the attraction of many birds to exurban development to an oasis effect, in which resources otherwise scarce in arid southwestern environments (shade, nectar, nest sites, and especially water) are relatively abundant around exurban home sites. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that exurban home sites represented resource supply points inside birds' home ranges otherwise consisting mostly of natural vegetation.\n      </p>", "The greatest concentration of Chinese Galliformes occurs in the Trans-Himalayas. We selected 4 northwestern Yunnan counties (Lijiang, Shangri-la, Deqin, and Weixi) in the Trans-Himalayas to assess the conservation status of 9 gallinaceous forest birds. We developed maps depicting recent forest cover and modeled habitat availability of each gallinaceous forest bird based on 3 factors that restrict its distribution: geographic location, elevation range, and forest coverage. The conservation status of 4 species was inadequate, because &lt;10% of their respective potential habitats were within existing nature reserves. To predict the historic habitats of the species we studied, we also delineated a forest map from the late 1950s. We calculated the loss and fragmentation of potential habitats within the past 40 years as degree of habitat degradation. Our results showed that all 9 species became reduced and fragmented of their potential habitats from the late 1950s to 2002. Assessing habitat degradation and conservation status of wild species could help identify the threatened species with poor protection and degraded habitats, thereby warranting more attention in future conservation strategies. To protect those threatened species, it is urgent that the government should design new nature reserves to fill the conservation gaps, and enlarge and strengthen the management of existing natural reserves to reduce effects of human activities on their habitats.\n      </p>", "Serotype and DNA fingerprint methods were used to study Pasteurella multocida isolated from 320 wild birds of North America. Isolates were collected during 1978-93. The HhaI profiles of 314 isolates matched the HhaI profile of somatic reference type 1, strain X-73; somatic type 1 antigen was expressed by 310 isolates, and the serotype of four isolates was undetected. Differentiation of the 314 isolates was observed by digestion of DNA with HpaII. None of the HpaII profiles matched the HpaII profile of X-73 (designated HhaI 001/HpaII 001). Three HpaII profiles were recognized among the somatic type 1 isolates: HpaII 002 (n = 18), HpaII 003 (n = 122), and HpaII 004 (n = 174). Profile HpaII 002 was found among isolates collected during 1979-83. Profile HpaII 003 was identified from isolates collected during 1979-89, with the exception of two isolates in 1992. The HpaII 004 profile was identified from isolates collected during 1983-93. Of the six remaining isolates, four expressed somatic type 4 and had HhaI profiles identical to the somatic type 4 reference strain P-1662 profile (designated HhaI 004); these isolates were differentiated by digestion of DNA with HpaII. One isolate was identified as serotype F:11, and another was serotype A:3,4.

The external skeletal fixator consisted of bent Kirschner wires and a connecting system of molded polymethyl methacrylate. In four birds with a tibiotarsal fracture the external skeletal fixator was combined with an intramedullary pin. The device was inexpensive, lightweight, easy to remove, and tolerated by the birds, which allowed early postoperative weight bearing on the affected limb. Healing of the fracture in seven birds with a tibiotarsal fracture was radiographically complete 10 weeks following application of the external skeletal fixator. Arthrodesis of the intertarsal joint rather than osteotomy of the tibiotarsus proved to be a successful technique for correcting angular deformities originating from the distal tibiotarsus. Arthrodesis of the intertarsal joint stabilized by an external skeletal fixator from the tibiotarsus to the tarsometatarsus was radiographically complete 13 weeks following surgery. Complications in two birds (delayed union and malunion) were related to technical errors in the construction and application of the external skeletal fixator and led to abnormal function of the pelvic limb.\n      </p>"], "words": {"all": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "influenza": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "chinese": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06},
