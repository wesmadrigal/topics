Evidence of his early music and career, however, has so far eluded scholars. While much important work has been done on the genre of the Christmas pastorella in the Czech lands by scholars such as Ji\u0159\u00ed Berkovec, Geoffrey Chew and Mark Germer, evidence from the 17th century for some common pastorella melodies has been scarce. By the first half of the 18th century the basic characteristics of the genre seem to have been in place: the evocation of shepherds' piping or horn calls, the cuckoo, and the quotation of common Christmas tunes, usually lullabies to the Christ-child. Detailed source studies show that Finger was at the court of Bishop Liechtenstein-Castelcorno at Olomouc and Krom\u011b\u0159\u00ed\u017e in Moravia, falling under the influence of local masters such as Vejvanovsk\u00fd, Biber and Schmelzer. Finger's early contributions to the pastorella genre (for viols and recorders) reveal previously unknown sources of Christmas melodies that would become more commonplace in the following centuries. Some of these melodies were probably intended to evoke the texts of earlier vocal models. The identification of certain melodies in his pastorellas reveals that this tendency was already present in instrumental works of the 1670s and 80s. The discovery and analysis of these pieces sheds new light on an often obscure genre and a little-known composer.\n      </p>", "Analysis of Christmas Bird Count (CBC) data is complicated by the need to account for variation in effort on counts and to provide summaries over large geographic regions. We describe a hierarchical model for analysis of population change using CBC data that addresses these needs. The effect of effort is modeled parametrically, with parameter values varying among strata as identically distributed random effects. Year and site effects are modeled hierarchically, accommodating large regional variation in number of samples and precision of estimates. The resulting model is complex, but a Bayesian analysis can be conducted using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. We analyze CBC data for American Black Ducks (Anas rubripes), a species of considerable management interest that has historically been monitored using winter surveys. Over the interval 1966-2003, Black Duck populations showed distinct regional patterns of population change. The patterns shown by CBC data are similar to those shown by the Midwinter Waterfowl Inventory for the United States. /// El an\u00e1lisis de los datos de los conteos navide\u00f1os de aves es complicado por la necesidad de tener en cuenta la variaci\u00f3n en el esfuerzo en los conteos y de proveer res\u00famenes a trav\u00e9s de regiones geogr\u00e1ficas amplias.

The largest crabs grow to &gt; 120 mm carapace width and reach &gt; 500 g in mass. Red crabs are diurnally active, and moisture appears to be the most important factor governing surface activity - activity was nil below 77% RH, relatively low at 87% RH, and high above 95% RH The crabs retreat to the interior of their burrows during dry periods, but emerge rapidly in response to rain. Because of their dependence on moisture for surface activity, red crabs show greater levels of activity during the wet season Annual breeding migrations and moulting activity decreased the density of surface-active crabs at the main study sites for several weeks at the start of the wet season, and fruit and leaf fall caused dramatic local increases in the density of active red crabs. Density and biomass at the main study sites averaged 1.3 crabs m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; and 1454 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, and 1 2 crabs m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; and 1137 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; at a total of five sites across the island. Rough calculations suggest that the island-wide population is at least 100 million individuals. Red crabs are the dominant consumer on the forest floor, and consume seeds, seedlings and leaf litter. Because they are both abundant and widespread, these animals have the potential to be the most important determinant of pattern and process in rain forest on Christmas Island\n      </p>", "Aim To describe the species composition of stranded seeds and fruits drifted by ocean currents to Christmas Island, Indian Ocean. Location Christmas Island, Indian Ocean. Methods Frequent visual searches along the strand line of the island's few accessible beaches over a 4-year period 1988-92, with most effort concentrated on Greta Beach, on the cast coast. Results The collection contained not fewer than sixty-three species in forty-nine genera and twenty-nine families. Leguminous seeds were by far the most common (especially Caesalpinia bonduc (L.) Roxb., Dioclea spp., Entada spp., Erythrina spp. and Mucuna gigantea (Willd.) DC.), but Calophyllum inophyllum L., Guettarda speciosa L., Hernandia ovigera L., Heritiera littoralis Aiton and Terminalia catappa L. were also common. Main conclusions Only about one-third of species recorded in the drift flora are native to the island, and most disseminules stranded on the island are probably not locally derived. The most likely distant sources of drift disseminules are probably the southern Indonesian islands and Sumatra, with most disseminules probably arriving via the Timor and Arafura Seas between Indonesia and Australia. However, some disseminules may originate from as far east as the Moluccas and the east coast of Kalimantan. The majority of species recorded in the drift flora are not native to the island, and yet some of these were encountered frequently and displayed a high degree of viability on arrival (e.g. Dioclea hexandra (Ralph) Mabb., Erythrina fusca Loureiro and Mucuna gigantea (Willd.) DC.). Several possible reasons for the failure of many drift species to establish on the island are discussed.\n      </p>", "Males of the araneid genus Cyrtophora Simon 1864 are comparatively rare in collections, possibly because they are much smaller and less conspicuous than their female counterparts and are expected to have a much shorter lifespan. Field work on Christmas Island (Indian Ocean) revealed a male of Cyrtophora unicolor (Doleschall 1857) copulating with a female. Both male and female are described here. The known distribution of C. unicolor is updated to include southern parts of China, Taiwan and Japan in the North, the Philippines and Papua New Guinea to the south-east, Indonesia and Christmas Island to the South, and Thailand, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka to the East. Cyrtophora acrobalia (Thorell 1895), described from a juvenile from Myanmar, is considered a nomen dubium.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "Field experiments comparing leaf-fall in the presence and absence of the red land crab, Gecarcoidea natalis, in rain forest on Christmas Island, Indian Ocean showed that, by eating and returning leaves to their burrows, they significantly reduced accumulation of leaf-fall on the forest floor. Red crabs removed 30-50% of the leaf-fall at the experimental sites during the study. Differences in leaf-fall mass between crab-access and exclusion quadrats were positively correlated with the density of foraging red crabs. Red crabs also generated spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of litter on the forest floor by returning litter to their burrows. Leaves lined chambers of 64% of excavated burrows and litter biomass around the entrances was significantly greater than that on off-burrow locations. This was reflected in the significantly higher concentrations of organic matter and nutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Na, and Mg) associated with soils near burrow entrances. These results suggest that a single species, G. natalis, is the major processor of leaf-fall in rain forest on Christmas Island and may affect (1) the temporal and spatial patterns of nutrient availability and (2) the diversity and biomass of the litter fauna.\n      </p>", "We analyzed 30 years of Christmas Bird Count (CBC) data for Florida populations of six species of wading birds: Great, Cattle, and Snowy Egrets; Little Blue and Tricolored Herons; and the Wood Stork, a federally listed endangered species. These species are conspicuous components of wetland ecosystems, and the target of numerous management efforts in the state and region. The nonlinear dynamics of these populations were assessed through time series of birds seen during volunteer-based surveys and the first differences of successive annual counts, autocorrelations, and two new metrics: correlation time and a momentum oscillator. CBCs have the advantage of being conducted regularly over a large geographic scale. When properly analyzed, CBCs are among the few available sources of reliable population information for small, dark-plumaged species such as Little Blue and Tricolored Herons. Population trends assessed for all species by CBCs paralleled the known or suspected trends determined by breeding-season aerial and ground surveys, conducted by professional biologists. Cattle Egret populations have declined following rapid expansion through the 1960s and 1970s; Snowy Egret and, to a lesser extent, Tricolored Heron populations have declined throughout the study period; Little Blue Heron and Great Egret numbers have been relatively stable. Wood Storks, following a period of decline that lasted into the mid-1970s, slowly recovered through the 1980s. Only Cattle Egrets displayed strongly deterministic population dynamics, indicating that predictions of population trends for the other species will require stochastic models with broad confidence bands.\n      </p>", "The red land crab (Gecarcoidea natalis) is the major collector of fruits and seeds from the rain forest floor on Christmas Island, Indian Ocean. At three sites, they rapidly removed fruits and seeds of 17 species tested (usually within 12 h after placement) and most were taken to crab burrows. Direct observations of seed predation, and application of estimated chelar forces of red crabs indicated that seeds of many species, especially those with thin seed coats, are likely to be killed through handling. However, removal of some resistant seeds to burrows may be favourable for seedling establishment when canopy gaps occur. Fruit removal rates by crabs were positively related to nitrogen concentration in fruit tissues but negatively correlated with condensed tannins. These observations suggest that seed predation by land crabs may affect the success of colonization and the relative abundance of plants on oceanic islands.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "Few monitoring programs in North America track bird populations at a continental scale during the winter, a critical stage of the life cycle for many species. To date, only Christmas Bird Counts (CBC) have been used to index bird abundance in winter across North America. We evaluated another continentwide program, Project Feeder Watch (PFW), which monitors many bird species more intensively than CBC. PFW is a survey in which volunteers use standardized methods to count birds visiting feeders every two weeks from November through April. We compared population indices and trends from PFW and CBC data for 43 species in 3 regions of Ontario, Canada, over a 21-year period from 1976-1997. Annual population indices from PFW were significantly positively correlated with similar indices from CBC for about 80% of species for which annual variation in counts was substantially greater than sampling error. Log-linear population trends from both surveys were also well correlated, though the absolute value of the trend estimates tended to be higher for PFW. The high consistency between surveys suggests that both may be suitable for detecting population changes for many bird species in winter, especially irruptive species that show large annual fluctuations, and species with marked population trends. However, some species did not correspond between surveys, despite being measured fairly precisely, highlighting the value of having two independent surveys to corroborate patterns. Christmas Bird Counts have the advantage that they sample more species, but Project FeederWatch has a more consistent protocol and continues through the winter, allowing analysis of changes in populations through the winter. /// Pocos programas de monitoreo en Am\u00e9rica del Norte siguen a las poblaciones de aves a escala continental durante el invierno, cuando muchas especies pasan por una etapa cr\u00edtica en su ciclo de vida. Hasta el presente, s\u00f3lo los Conteos de Aves de Navidad (CAN) han sido usados para cuantificar la abundancia de aves en el invierno a lo largo de Am\u00e9rica del Norte. Nosotros evaluamos otro programa a nivel continental, el Proyecto de Observaci\u00f3n de Comederos (POC), el cual sigue muchas especies de aves de modo m\u00e1s intenso que los CAN.

Las tendencias poblacionales de ambos muestreos, representadas de modo log-lineal, tambi\u00e9n estuvieron bien correlacionadas, aunque el valor absoluto de la tendencia estimada tendi\u00f3 a ser mayor para el POC. La alta consistencia entre los programas de muestreo sugiere que ambos pueden ser adecuados para detectar los cambios poblacionales de muchas especies de aves durante el invierno, especialmente para especies eruptivas que muestran grandes fluctuaciones anuales, y para aquellas con tendencias poblacionales marcadas. Sin embargo, algunas especies mostraron diferencias entre los programas de muestreo a pesar de haber sido medidas de modo bastante preciso, destacando el valor de tener dos m\u00e9todos de muestreo independientes para corroborar los patrones.

Both the Hawaii and Farrallon Islands data exhibit longer term correlations with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Populations are suppressed during the warm phase of the PDO.

The Christmas Bird Count is an early winter survey, whereas the North American Breeding Bird Survey is conducted in June. Combining information from these surveys permits estimation of seasonal population variance components and improves estimation of long-term population trends. The composite analysis also controls for survey-specific sampling effects. We applied the model to estimation of population change in northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus). Over the interval 1969-2004, bobwhite populations declined, with trend estimate of -3.56% per year (95% CI = [-3.80%, -3.32%]) in the surveyed portion of their range.

Adults are larger on Johnston than on Christmas in the four variables measured (culmen, wing, tail, and mass), but greater dimorphism between the sexes exists on Christmas. We relate these morphological data to environmental variability and predictibility and the various published hypotheses on the evolution of sexual size dimorphism.\n      </p>", "Dickens's A Christmas Carol exemplifies the literary and cinematic use of visual representation to reinforce ideological values in Western culture. The story positions Scrooge and its readers as spectators of a series of culturally valorized scenes; access to the spectator's idealized self depends on the ability to perceive and desire (to identify and identify with) the values embedded in those scenes. Scrooge saves his life by recovering what the story posits as his natural ability to identify with representations, an ability that characterizes both his ideal, sympathetic self and the ideal subject of commodity culture.\n      </p>", "The essay explores the connection between a family's history and a traditional holiday recipe. Kieflies, or kifli, are Hungarian walnut crescents baked by the author's family at Christmas. The tradition of baking kiflis, like the family itself, has no clear, authentic origin myth; rather, the passage of the ritual from one generation to the next is marked by distortion and reinvention: the mystery of the family's Hungarian Jewish origins; the development of a non-consanguineous lineage, from Irish daughters-in-law to Korean adoptees; and the strategies of evasion, survival, storytelling, adaption, and imagination that both obscure and enrich the ritual. The author has assumed the role of kieflie-baker to her adoptive family, applying her own innovations and interpretations to the tradition, as her mother, aunt, grandmother, and great-aunts did before her.\n      </p>", "A unique stand of mangroves of the genus Bruguiera occurs on the shore terrace at Hosnies Spring, Christmas Island, Indian Ocean. The mangrove stand, of about 0.33 ha, occurs 120 m inland and over an elevational range of 13 m, from 24 to 37 m above sea level. It is flooded by freshwater from a spring which trickles over a partially-cemented calcsinter concretion gravel with mud. Trees reach 30-40 m high, and 80 cm diameter breast height. The size structure is bimodal with few trees in the 10-25 cm dbh size classes, but abundant propagules, seedlings and saplings. The shore terrace contains corals, some in their position of growth, and has been shown by Uranium-series dating to be Last Interglacial in age. Several alternative explanations of how the mangroves reached this site are examined. One explanation is that this stand of mangroves has persisted at the site for approximately 120,000 years since the Last Interglacial. While this cannot be proved it does appear that the stand is relict and is actively regenerating in this unusual location.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

I compared these predicted limiting temperatures to mean minimum temperatures at northern winter range boundaries determined from Christmas Bird Count data. Estimates derived from physiological parameters predicted minimum temperatures at range boundaries more accurately than did allometric equations. Phylogenetic analyses of independent contrasts under two branch length hypotheses corroborated that physiological parameters were superior to allometric equations as predictors of range boundary temperature. Thus using body mass as a surrogate for physiological data underestimates the association between physiological cold tolerance and northern range limits. However, this association could be explained by phenotypic acclimatization to different environments as well as by genetic differences among species; thus low values of the physiological temperature limit may be a result rather than a cause of northerly ranges. The distribution of predicted metabolic rates at northern range boundaries relative to BMR did not cluster at a clear upper boundary, so it is uncertain whether a constraint on maximum metabolic rate limits distribution of some species. Metabolic rate at the northern range boundary was a smaller multiple of BMR for insectivores than for non-insectivores, suggesting that food availability may limit winter ranges of insectivores, but analysis of independent contrasts did not verify this effect.

Common species were no more conspicuous than rare ones, as measured by detectability on variable distance point counts. The same species that were most abundant locally also were most abundant on Christmas bird counts across Arizona and throughout the western United States. The positive correlation between distribution and abundance of winter landbirds appear to be neither an artifact of conspicuousness, nor a consequence of the geographic scale of comparison.

The article traces the history of zampone from Renaissance Modena to modern commercial versions; it then recounts the author's attempt to make it from scratch, as was done in his childhood in the Cape Cod village of Sagamore, a community of immigrants from Emilia-Romagna who long preserved traditions of home butchering and sausage-making.\n      </p>", "This is a speculative investigation of an extremely complex social phenomenon, Christmas. It asks why the traditional Incarnation feast has been overwhelmed by intense commercial cooptation and economic rationalization. In pursuit of some of the roots of this institutionalized activity an effort is made to grasp the place of economic surplus (those goods left over after basic subsistence needs have been cared for) in human society. Religious control and direction of surplus, sacredly interpreted, produced a complex of ethical postulates aimed at development of restraints on practices considered as self-aggrandizing in a material way. Pre-Christian and Christian practices up to the Reformation seem to be as one on this issue. The Reformation and movements which arose in conjunction with it seem to have revised this ancient system of material restraint. Modern Christmas appears to be a manifestation of a new complex of attitudes regarding use of economic surplus. Gift-giving is central and conjecturally considered as a phenomenon which reveals some of the meaning of this national period of festivity; festivity aimed at honoring the productiveness of the American economic system. There is also an attempt made to judge the power of the 'work ethic' as a fundamental construct involved in the processes of the American culture's magnification of Christmas as its greatest moment of prodigal exuberance.\n      </p>", "This study quantified the burrow dynamics of the gecarcinid land crab Gercarcoidea natalis (Pockock, 1888), the most common land crab in rain forest on Christmas Island, Indian Ocean. Mean burrow density remained relatively stable over a two-year period, fluctuating between 1.4 and 1.6 burrows/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Burrows were long-lived, stable structures, with a mean turnover time estimated at least 4.4 \u00b1 1.6 y, and probably greater than 5 y. Burrow entrances were also highly stable in space. Two thirds of burrow entrances were repositioned within an area of 20 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or less, and 83% of entrances moved within less than 60 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Red crabs accumulate litter around their burrow entrances and create nutrient hotspots in the soil around burrow entrances, whose stability and longevity suggested that germinating seedlings may derive some benefit from germinating in the immediate vicinity of crab burrows. The rate of burrow turnover is slow, causing minimal soil disturbance at the study site with little, if any, impact on above-ground plant productivity. Red crabs plugged their burrows intermittently year-round with loose wads of leaves or with soil. Major plugging peaks were recorded in March of both years of the study, midway through the wet season. At this time 49-59% of burrow entrances were sealed with a deep plug of soil, and many burrows remained plugged long enough for the crabs to molt. These data suggest that most red crabs molted annually at the study site.\n      </p>", "Ceratopetalum gummiferum Sm. 'Albery's Red' (NSW Christmas Bush), a native to eastern Australia, has become an important commercial plant in both the export and domestic markets. A protocol for in vitro culture was investigated for rapid clonal propagation of selected cultivars. Murashige and Skoog medium, supplemented with various concentrations of 6-benzylaminopurine, kinetin, 6(\u03b3,\u03b3-dimethylalrylamino)-purine or zeatin were examined for their effects on multiplication. The most successful treatments were 2.2 \u03b3M 6-benzylaminopurine and 11.6 \u03b3M kinetin which increased shoot number and explant weight. Although zeatin and 6(\u03b3,\u03b3-dimethylalrylamino)-purine increased shoot length, both failed to increase multiplication rates. However, hyperhydricity was found to be a serious physiological disorder in tissue culture of C. gummiferum 'Albery's Red'. Rooting in vitro was also examined with indole-3-butyric acid and naphthalene acetic acid, the most successful being 4.9 mM indole-3-butyric acid. The development of an in vivo rooting protocol, however, may prove to be essential for the commercial production of this plant.\n      </p>", "We investigated the geographical ecology of acorn woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus) using 30 years of Audubon Christmas Bird Counts and data on the diversity and abundance of oaks. Spatial autocorrelation in acorn woodpecker population densities is not significantly greater than zero both in either the southwestern United States, where populations are often locally isolated, or along the Pacific Coast, where they are more evenly distributed. In both regions, the effective distributional limit of acorn woodpeckers is set not by the limits of oaks but by sites where oak diversity drops to a single species. This result is consistent with acorn production patterns in central coastal California demonstrating that variability in overall acorn production and the probability of acorn crop failure decline with increasing oak species number but drop most markedly when two, compared to one, species of oaks are present together. Along the Pacific Coast, acorn woodpecker densities increase and population variability decreases with increasing abundance and diversity of oaks; however, analyses indicate that overall population size in this region is primarily determined by resource abundance while population stability is determined by resource diversity. Comparable patterns are not obvious in the Southwest, where acorn woodpecker densities are much lower than along the Pacific Coast. This may be due to a combination of greater competition for resources and oak communities that differ both qualitatively and quantitatively in their productivity compared to those along the Pacific Coast.\n      </p>", "Red-tailed Tropicbirds (Phaethon rubricauda) breeding on Christmas Island, Central Pacific Ocean, exhibited stable preferences for nest sites over time, such that vegetative characteristics associated with active nests were similar in 1980 and 1984. Before the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO, 1980) the vegetative structure of randomly placed points differed from that of actual nests. After the ENSO (1984) the vegetative structure at randomly placed points resembled that of actual nests, suggesting that the overall availability of preferred sites may have increased. Records of the thermal environment surrounding actual nests and other points within the same shrub suggest that shifts in vegetative structure of nesting habitat created a favorable thermal environment for tropicbird chicks. This post-ENSO shift in habitat structure was accompanied by an increase in the number of active nests at the Y-site colony relative to pre-ENSO breeding seasons. These data support the hypothesis that suitable nest sites may limit short-term reproductive opportunities of tropicbirds, hence influence the rate of population growth and time course of recovery from catastrophic events such as ENSO.\n      </p>", "The population structure of the freshwater land crab Discoplax hirtipes (Gecarcinidae) was studied on Christmas Island, Indian Ocean, to which this species is endemic in its blue colour form. Despite previous overexploitation of this crab, this is the first such study to take place for this species on Christmas Island. Surveys were conducted in the dry (non-migration) season, at Ross Hill Gardens, which is one of several permanent 'residential areas' inhabited by D. hirtipes. The sex ratio was found to be skewed in favour of males 2:1. Similarly to other gecarcinid species, male crabs were found to grow larger than females in terms of body weight, carapace width and chelae size (length and width). During the survey, few juveniles were found, which could suggest an ageing population. Despite being protected by law on Christmas Island, this is potentially worrying for a species that due to its restricted distribution continues to be especially vulnerable to outside threats, including that of aggressive invasive species and long term habitat destruction.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Distribution and abundance maps of 148 land birds wintering in the contiguous United States and southern Canada are compared with maps of six environmental factors: average minimum January temperature, mean length of frost-free period, potential vegetation, mean annual precipitation, average general humidity, and elevation. The species maps were generated from 10 years of National Audubon Society's Christmas Bird Count data. The comparisons reveal that average minimum January temperature, mean length of frost-free period, and potential vegetation frequently associate with the northern range limits of wintering species (60.2%, 50.4%, 63.7%, respectively). Only two factors, potential vegetation and mean annual precipitation, are coincident with a large proportion of species' eastern range boundaries (62.8% and 39.7%, respectively). The frequency of association between the environmental factors and the western boundaries of the species' ranges is lower than in the other two directions, and more factors exhibit a correspondence. These include potential vegetation (46.0%), mean annual precipitation (36.0%) and elevation (38.0%). Associations with species' southern boundaries are ignored, because 89.2% of the species have range limits abutting the edge of the study area. Only 0.6% of the possible associations between the species' ranges and environmental factors are expected to occur by chance. To enhance the understanding of the correspondence between species' range limits and environmental factors, four mutually exclusive feeding guilds are examined. These include Raptors and Shrikes, Bark Gleaners, Foliage Gleaners, and Seed Eaters. Predictably, both temperature factors, minimum January temperature and mean length of frost-free period, associate with northern range limits of many species in all four guilds (Raptors and Shrikes, 54.5% and 36.4%; Bark Gleaners, 46.1 and 46.1%; Foliage Gleaners, 86.4% and 68.2%; and Seed Eaters, 60.0% and 56.0%, respectively). Isopleths of mean lenght of frost-free period also coincide with the western boundaries of Foilage Gleaners (55.6%). Potential vegetation corresponds with the northern distributional boundaries of a large proportion of species in all four guilds (Raptors and Shrikes, 54.5%; Bark Gleaners, 76.9%; Foliage Gleaners, 68.2%; Seed Eaters, 68.0%), while along the eastern and western boundaries, vegetation is coincident with members of the two guilds most strongly linked with vegetation: Bark Gleaners (East 88.9% and West 66.7%) and Seed Eaters (East 62.5% and West 42.9%). The western range edges of the Bark and Foliage Gleaners associate with elevation (44.4% and 44.4%).\n      </p>", "Ischaemum nativitatis Jansen ex Renvoize, an endemic grass, from Christmas Island, in the eastern Indian Ocean, is described and its nomenclatural history discussed.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Climate change is thought to promote the poleward movement of geographic ranges; however, the spatial dynamics, mechanisms, and regional anthropogenic drivers associated with these trends have not been fully explored. We estimated changes in latitude of northern range boundaries, center of occurrence, and center of abundance for 254 species of winter avifauna in North America from 1975 to 2004. After accounting for the effect of range size and the location of the northern boundary, positive latitudional trends were evident for the northern boundary (1.48 km/yr), center of occurrence (0.45 km/yr), and center of abundance (1.03 km/yr). The northern boundary, when examined across individual species, had the most variable trends (SD = 7.46 km/yr) relative to the center of occurrence (SD = 2.36 km/yr) and center of abundance (SD = 5.57 km/yr). Trends did not differ based on migratory status, but there was evidence that trends differed for species with ranges centered in the southern vs. northern portion of the study area. Species occurred more sporadically over time at northern range boundaries, and northern boundaries were associated with a concentration of colonization and extirpation events, with a greater prevalence of colonization events likely promoting poleward trends. Regional anthropogenic drivers explained \u223c8% of the trend for the northern boundary, 14% for the center of occurrence, and 18% for the center of abundance; however, these effects were localized in the northern portion of species' ranges and were associated with distributional changes within ranges, primarily abundance, producing patterns that mimicked poleward movements. We conclude that poleward distributional shifts represent the interaction between climate change and regional factors whose outcome is determined by the scale of the analysis and the biotic and abiotic features in the region, and how anthropogenic activities have impacted these features.\n      </p>", "The ritual Christmas gift giving in Middletown involves virtually the entire population and is governed by elaborate unwritten rules that are remarkably well enforced without obvious means of enforcement.

The North American Breeding Bird Survey is conducted each summer; the Christmas Bird Count is conducted in early winter. The temporal staggering of these surveys allows investigation of seasonal components of population change, which we illustrate with an examination of the effects of severe winters on the Carolina Wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus). Our analysis uses a hierarchical log-linear model with controls for survey-specific sampling covariates. Temporal change in population size is modeled seasonally, with covariates for winter severity. Overall, the winter\u2014spring seasons are associated with 82% of the total population variation for Carolina Wrens, and an additional day of snow cover during winter\u2014spring is associated with an incremental decline of 1.1% of the population.\n      </p>"], "words": {"essay": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "ith": {"number": 4, "prob": 3.312505952159133e-05}, "german":
