{"total_words": 405, "documents": ["A tendency to focus on details at the expense of configural information, 'weak coherence', has been proposed as a cognitive style in autism. In the present study we tested whether weak coherence might be the result of executive dysfunction, by testing clinical groups known to show deficits on tests of executive control. Boys with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) were compared with age- and intelligence quotient (IQ)-matched boys with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and typically developing (TD) boys, on a drawing task requiring planning for the inclusion of a new element. Weak coherence was measured through analysis of drawing style. In line with the predictions made, the ASD group was more detail-focused in their drawings than were either ADHD or TD boys. The ASD and ADHD groups both showed planning impairments, which were more severe in the former group. Poor planning did not, however, predict detail-focus, and scores on the two aspects of the task were unrelated in the clinical groups. These findings indicate that weak coherence may indeed be a cognitive style specific to autism and unrelated to cognitive deficits in frontal functions.\n      </p>", "Against a background of the various definitions of drawing and design offered in the Encyclop\u00e9die ou Dictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 des sciences, des arts et des m\u00e9tiers (1754), the author argues that 'design', as applied to the manufacture of wallpapers at the end of the eighteenth century, is not so much a thing, either representation or pattern, as a means of communication between parties. The direct and indirect pressure exerted by the market is examined, and the role of the entrepreneur is considered, as is the importance of the ready availability of design information across manufactured goods and competitive emulation between them. Finally, and with particular reference to arabesque wallpapers, the specific role of the designer is considered. The structure of the paper reverses traditional expectations and priorities, which have generally focused on the designer rather than on clients or manufactures.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Designing an object and anticipating its manufacturing at the same time is not new: it is probably as old as industry itself, even though it was formulated in various ways throughout history. To understand what was at stake and what the conflicts and interactions of those involved were, this paper will detail some elements of a historical survey of the eighteenth century: design practices will be scrutinised by taking into account instruments and material support (papers, sketches, and so on). At that time, technical illustrations did not deal directly with manufacturing but they were instrumental in its development.\n      </p>", "This historical study describes two series of confrontations between nineteenth-century Massachusetts state agents for the promotion of industrial drawing and the Prang Educational Company: Smith vs. Prang, 1881, and Bailey vs. Prang, 1896 and 1898. The study examines conflicts between the ethics of public service and the economics of private enterprise. Developing conceptions of art education also helped generate the conflicts examined, specifically changing answers to three questions: Who should teach art? Who should write and disseminate curriculum? What teaching aids are most appropriate?\n      </p>", "This paper distinguishes between the type of drawing useful for making pictures and the type of drawing useful for designing. It describes a generative method for the sequential construction of complex images from simple geometric forms. These images are subsequently transformed into representations of some meaningful artefact with further enhancement of their visual complexity. This procedure has been found useful in the teaching of the art of design, and the author argues that its usefulness could be extended to composition even in technological subjects.\n      </p>", "Children's perceived competence in drawing during the middle childhood years may be related not only to the development of drawing skills, but also to perceived competence in other domains. In this investigation, children's drawing skills were related to their perceived competence in drawing; in turn, perceived competence in drawing was related to perceived competence in other domains. A sample of 106 children produced free-drawings and completed a Domain Competency Inventory. Thirteen judges rated the drawings for their levels of realism, pleasingness, and originality. Findings revealed that greater perceived competence in drawing was related to higher levels of realism and originality in drawings, as well as greater perceived competence in domains with visual-spatial components, like mathematics and acting. Also, levels of realism and originality in drawings were greater at higher grade levels. Perceived competence in drawing, along with other nonacademic domains, like singing, were lower at higher grade levels, but academic domain competencies, like science, were unrelated to grade level.\n      </p>", "A unique example of 'Dynamic Figures' style motifs drawn with dry pigment was recently located in south-western Arnhem Land. One of these figures has been partially over-painted with wet pigment, suggesting that the drawings were produced as sketches for the painting of Dynamic Figures. The implications for rock art research are discussed.\n      </p>", "\" Penser, c'est dessiner \", d\u00e9clare l'artiste Joseph Beuys. \u00c9largie \u00e0 tout geste de d\u00e9signation se cristallisant dans une trace, la pratique du dessin \u00e9chappe aux cat\u00e9gorisations partielles (Beaux-Arts, dessin scientifique et technique, style) qui en ont, depuis plusieurs si\u00e8cles, restreint l'usage et la port\u00e9e. Elle retrouve ainsi le r\u00f4le de commencement de pens\u00e9e et de \" langue d'avant les symboles \" qui est le sien dans la plupart des cultures. /// The artist Joseph Beuy has said, \" To think is to draw \". Broadened to cover any gesture of portrayal that crystallizes in a line, the practice of drawing escapes from partial categorizations (Fine Arts, draftsmanship, style), which have, for several centuries now, restrained its use and scope. It thus rediscovers the role of the beginning of thought and of the \" language before symbols \" which belongs to it in most cultures.\n      </p>", "The Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus (1707\u20131778) is reputed to have transformed botanical practice by shunning the process of illustrating plants and relying on the primacy of literary descriptions of plant specimens. Botanists and historians have long debated Linnaeus's capacities as a draftsman. While some of his detailed sketches of plants and insects reveal a sure hand, his more general drawings of landscapes and people seem ill-executed. The overwhelming consensus, based mostly on his Lapland diary (1732), is that Linnaeus could not draw. Little has been said, however, on the role of drawing and other visual representations in Linnaeus's daily work as seen in his other numerous manuscripts. These manuscripts, held mostly at the Linnean Society of London, are peppered with sketches, maps, tables, and diagrams. Reassessing these manuscripts, along with the printed works that also contain illustrations of plant species, shows that Linnaeus's thinking was profoundly visual and that he routinely used visual representational devices in his various publications. This paper aims to explore the full range of visual representations Linnaeus used through his working life, and to reevaluate the epistemological value of visualization in the making of natural knowledge. By analyzing Linnaeus's use of drawings, maps, tables, and diagrams, I will show that he did not, as has been asserted, reduce the discipline of botany to text, and that his visual thinking played a fundamental role in his construction of new systems of classification.\n      </p>", "The role of early parent-child interaction has been largely neglected in most accounts of drawing development, and social influences often have been considered to drive later drawing development in middle childhood at best. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the nature of mother-child dyadic drawing activities. Primarily middle-class, U.S. mothers and their 1+-, 2+-, and 3+-year-old children were videotaped as they drew during an open-ended, unstructured task and a structured copying task. Several social aspects of these joint activities were compared across the two tasks and three age groups. For example, age-related differences were observed regarding who suggested goals for drawing activities. Also, both partners often adjusted their interactional behaviors depending on whether the mother or child initially suggested the goal. Overall, the results indicated that both mothers and young children were active participants in shared drawing activities and both adjust the quality of their participation in a variety of ways.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "The drawing and copying skills of nine autistic and eight mentally retarded children matched for mental age were investigated on 5 drawing and 4 copying tasks.

To make sense of inconsistent empirical evidence, the research review is organized around a series of hypotheses grounded in current understandings of cognitive and strategic processing.

Polarizing microscopy of the gland's duct revealed two liquid crystalline optical textures: a curved pattern in the feedstock within the ampulla of the gland and, later in the secretory pathway, the cellular texture previously identified in synthetic nematic liquid crystals. The behaviour of droplet inclusions within the silk feedstock indicated that elongational flow at a low shear rate occurs in the gland's duct and may be important in producing an axial molecular orientation before the final thread is drawn. Our observations suggested that the structure of the spider's silk production pathway and the liquid crystalline feedstock are both involved in defining the exceptional mechanical properties of spider dragline silk.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "This paper investigates how Chinese children between ages 2 years 7 months and 6 years 1 month, in a Singaporean nursery and kindergarten, draw a solid sphere and cube placed before them. Analysis of both finished drawings and video-recordings of drawing processes suggests that many of the children try to represent the objects, but they use powerful modes of representation which are little understood by many adults and which have been obscured by assumptions about representation and human vision built into traditional experimental design. In art education, even during the early years, there is a great emphasis on drawing from observation. It is crucial, therefore, that we identify and support children's representational intentions and strategies if we are to teach drawing appropriately and in ways which assist, rather than undermine, children's development and learning. The present study challenges one of the most basic assumptions about the development of representation, that it is a gradual adaptation made by the child to 'visual reality'. Rather, the process of drawing is a dialectical relationship in which the child records his or own thinking in relation to events and objects over time.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The other is a two-light-and-oculus tracery pattern, and is particularly interesting because it is drawn to full scale and was cut into a reused slab of ancient marble. In this essay, I reconstruct the geometric process of generating the design and analyze the position of the tracing, with its peculiar Roman features, within the European Gothic context.

The order of stimulus presentation was counter-balanced for different participants. A second set of 36 participants rated each of the 76 drawings on their similarity to the target drawing in normal orientation. A repeated measures analysis of variance indicated that, contrary to Edwards' hypothesis, the drawings produced from the inverse orientation were not superior to those drawn from the normal orientation. Additionally, males (but not females) showed a practice effect such that their second drawing, regardless of orientation, was superior to the first.

Pens for plotters must be chosen for reliable operation under conditions of mechanical handling, usually without continuous supervision.

Over 80% of 5-year-olds produced a single square to represent a cube. Also, over 80% of 14- and 15-year-olds and over 80% of adults produced a parallel-projection drawing. However, there are several routes between these two milestones of drawing development, since no other drawing type captured more than 23% of the drawings at any age between 6 and 13. It is instructive that some children produced drawings that never were made by any of the adults, while some adults produced drawings of cubes that young children did not.

Recent work has shown that this operation involves the cooperative interaction of large neuronal populations. A population vector method, by transforming neuronal activity to the spatial domain, was used to visualize the motor cortical representation of the hand's trajectory made by rhesus monkeys as they drew spirals. Hand path was accurately reflected by a series of population vectors calculated throughout the task. A psychophysical rule relating speed to curvature, the \"power law,\" was found in this cortical representation. The relative timing between each population vector and the corresponding portion of the movement was variable. The population vectors only preceded the movement in a predictive manner in portions of the spiral where the radius of curvature was greater than 6 centimeters. These results show that the movement trajectory is an important determinant of motor cortical activity and that this aspect of motor cortical activity may contribute only to discrete portions of the drawing movement.\n      </p>", "In this article two-dimensional space is structurally defined and differentiated so as to serve as an analog for modeling aspects of world events and processes.

Results of all three experiments replicated previously published findings by showing that primary school children with deafness or autism, aged 6 to 13 years, scored significantly lower than normal-developing 4-year-old preschoolers on standard misleading-container and unseen-change tests of false-belief understanding. Furthermore, deaf and autistic children generally scored higher on drawing-based tests than on corresponding standard tests and, on the most challenging of the false-drawing tests in Experiment 2, they significantly outperformed the normal-developing preschoolers by clearly understanding their own false intentions and another person's false beliefs about an actively misleading drawing. In Experiment 3, preschoolers outperformed older deaf and autistic children on standard tasks, but did less well on a task that required the drawing of a false belief. Methodological factors could not fully explain the findings, but early social and conversational experiences in the family were deemed likely contributors.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

It asked if there were changes with age in, and relationships between, the systems and found that although there were changes with age within systems only, some relationships between systems were significant. Surprisingly, a number of children gained the ability to join interior contour lines with an outline by grade 1, indicating that a unified system for representing contours was present at an early age. However, it was not until later grades that a comprehensive system for representing form appeared.

Searching for fresh knowledge is not normal; the second section describes the stimulus to search as dissatisfaction with the status quo. Lessons can be sought by searching across time and/or across space; the choice depends upon a subjective definition of proximity, epistemic communities linking experts together, functional interdependence between governments, and the authority of intergovernmental institutions. The process of lesson-drawing starts with scanning programmes in effect elsewhere, and ends with the prospective evaluation of what would happen if a programme already in effect elsewhere were transferred here in future.
