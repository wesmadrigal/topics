It will prove difficult to recognise archaeologically and new techniques will have to be developed. Even more difficult to recognise will be the indigenous forms of slavery which existed in many parts of the continent at the coming of both Christianity and Islam, and the interaction between the three different concepts on which they were based.\n      </p>", "European Islam is facing the challenge of developing a role for Islam outside the dar al Islam, the classic Islamic territories. Muslims must localize themselves with respect to their country of immigration, their country of origin, and global Islam. This complex task leads to the development of several competing positions. Referring to the example of Turkish Sunnites in Europe, the article discusses this development over two generations. The exilic Islam of the first generation is characterized by a defensive attitude toward Europe and a general orientation toward the home country. The diasporic Islam which is currently developing among Muslims of the second generation, is oriented toward Europe. Reflecting the logical positions which can be adopted in the struggle for recognition (i.e. struggle for equality and antidiscrimination; struggle for the right for difference; quest for authenticity) three tendencies are developing: (1) an individualized l Islam de culture (2) a community-oriented orthodox wing; (3) an antihegemonic-ultraorthodox wing. Each wing provides different answers to the problem of relating religious values to the civil culture of the respective country of immigration. In the same process the strong ties to the homecountry are losened and replaced by an orientation toward the global umma. These positions have not yet found an organizational form. Instead, they are articulated within the communities established by the first generation, leading to the development of subgroups and facilitating new coalitions.\n      </p>", "This article explores the relationship between religion and politics in the context of the recent debates on Islam and religious fundamentalism. I argue that too much attention is paid to the theological issues of Islam, and that we shoudl rather focus on the historical conditions that tend to produce religious tolerance or intolerance. I use the Ottoman Empire as an example of a polity that succeeded in maintaining religious and ethnic toleration for the tremendous diversity it encountered within its frontiers. I analyze the specific relationship between the Ottoman state and Islam, the subordination of religion to the state, the dual role of religion as an institution and a system of beliefs as well as intricacies of the millet system. I conclude that the particular relationship that was forged between religion and politics during the first four centuries of the empire promoted religious openness and toleration.\n      </p>", "In this article, we discuss the current trend of authoritarianism in the Islamic world, especially as embodied in the institution of taqlid, whereby a lay person blindly follows a religious scholar. We will compare this to the mystical tradition of Ibn 'Arab\u00ee as well as the early esoteric Sh\u00ee'ite tradition, where a much more \"rebellious\" type of Islam was offered and provided purviews of pluralism and universalism that challenge authoritarian closures of interpretation in relationship with God.

All anthropologies, however, as has increasingly been appreciated in recent decades, are to some extent value-based and prisoners of their own assumptions and definitions of relevance and significance. This is most explicitly true of other \"ideological\" anthropologies such as marxist, feminist, or applied anthropologies.

It examines the reconstitution of village communities in the wake of violence and enslavement during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and documents the ways in which widespread mobility and trans-local social processes fostered the emergence of new forms of religious identification and practice. It demonstrates that many of the region's first Muslims were returning slaves whose conversion was a cultural consequence of slavery. Oral accounts of village histories of Islam are used in reconstructing a history that has left few traces in the archival record.\n      </p>", "This article begins with a quotation from a local informant highlighting a perception in the Gambia/Casamance borderlands that there is a pattern linking the violence of the later nineteenth century with more recent troubles. It argues that there is some merit in this thesis, which is encapsulated in a concatenation of events: systematic raiding by Fod\u00e9 Sylla led to the creation of a relatively depopulated colonial border zone which was later filled by Jola immigrants from Buluf to the southeast. In the perception of some, it is these immigrants who attracted the MFDC rebels. Mandinkas and Jolas of Fogny Jabankunda and Narang, and Karoninkas from the islands of Karone have therefore been largely unreceptive to appeals to Casamance nationalism. The article also argues that there are more twisted historical connections. Whereas in the later nineteenth century, the Jolas associated Islam with violent enslavement, they later converted en masse. Their attitude towards Fod\u00e9 Sylla remained negative, whilst the Mauritanian marabout, Cheikh Mahfoudz, was credited with the introduction of a pacific form of Islam that valorized hard work and legitimated physical migration. This legacy has posed a further barrier to militant nationalism.

A review of the political demands and identity theories formulated by the three major Afro-American nationalistic Muslim movements (the Ahmadyyah Movement in America, Moorish Science Temple and Nation of Islam) shows how Afrocentrism mainly draws inspiration from the theory of an Afro-Asian Islam and an Afro-Asian origin of the black race.

Religion, family, and work are important sites for the formation, negotiation, and change of gender relations. The article therefore discusses the views and experiences of immigrant Muslim women concerning wife-husband relations and participation in the labor market. Four analytical types of views toward gender relations are introduced, and the variation in gender practices and views found among Muslim women in Oslo is discussed in relation to these types. The analysis suggests that immigrant Muslim women use Islam as a flexible resource for interpreting gender relations.

Javanese Muslim women's rights activists focus on the historical contextualization of religious doctrine to argue against what they see as misguided interpretations of Islam that threaten to control women. This paper examines these efforts through a close reading of the discursive shifts and arguments that take place in the context of programs designed to promote women's rights in Islamic education in Java. It argues that the challenge for women's rights activists and intellectuals is to locate the ways that moderate or normative social and religious values can combine during times of change or crisis to reinforce a moral hierarchy of gender relations and an \"idea of woman\" in an attempt to control such change. The paper demonstrates that in Java, a moral hierarchy of gender relations, mimetically extended from family to nation, dovetails with religious interpretations to resolve anxieties about social change and security through the control of women.\n      </p>", "Contemporary African American followers of Sunni Islam are self-consciously articulating a form of eating that they see as liberating them from the heritage of slavery, while also bringing them into conformity with Islamic notions of purity. In so doing, they participate in arguments about the meaning of \"soul food,\" the relation between \"Western\" materialism and \"Eastern\" spirituality, and bodily health and its relation to mental liberation.

However the recent emergence in Europe and the US of a new type of militant Islam, especially through arts and culture, is challenging these perceptions.

British Muslims are often referred to as if they were a single community. The 2001 Censuses of England and Wales and Scotland demonstrate that Muslims are ethnically heterogeneous. Ethno-religious ward-level data for London from the 2001 census are used to test whether Islam binds together peoples of different ethnicity or whether ethnicity links groups despite religious differences. London Muslims, as a whole, are much less segregated than Sikhs, Jews or Hindus. Paradoxically this low level of overall segregation is produced by high intra-Muslim ethnic segregation. Intra South-Asian mixing irrespective of religion is greater than intra-Muslim mixing, irrespective of ethnicity. Intra-Black mixing is high irrespective of religion, while religion over-rides race and ethnicity for Christian groups.\n      </p>", "Although many accounts of transnational religious movements emphasize mobility and communication, equally important are efforts by both political actors and religious leaders to carve out distinctive national forms of religion.

During the colonial period the Saf\u00e8n were ruled by Wolof chiefs, who treated them as a conquered population. Until the First World War, Saf\u00e8n resistance was based on preserving a separate religious and ethnic identity, symbolized by the village shrine and matrilineal descent. Conversion to Islam had its roots in the crisis created by military recruitment. When the Saf\u00e8n were forced to give soldiers to the French, 'maternal uncles' used their authority over their 'nephews' to recruit soldiers. Today this act is remembered as a 'betrayal' that called into question the legitimacy of the matrilineal system of labor and inheritance. Conversion to Islam has been studied by focusing on long-term Islamization rather than the moment of conversion. Oral testimony from converts emphasizes changes in behavior, funeral rites, inheritance and patterns of labor and power in the village community.\n      </p>", "During the last decade the agenda of local and global politics is heavily marked by the encounter of two powerful currents, namely democracy and political Islam. On the one hand Islam as a religion itself is facing a cultural dialectic between a modern and an authentic form, producing a synthesis which is only to be criticized again by a new radical antithesis. Within that framework political Islam is perceived to be a tool for this current antithesis, attacking the states for impiety and materialism. Democracy, on the other hand, is becoming dominant as a criterion of good government, the \"only game in town\", with its inherent complexity which reveals itself in each particular context. The two currents are not necessarily irreconcilable, but they produce a number of different effects on each other whenever they meet.

One mechanism involves the use of Islam to legitimize worldviews that served vested interests. Another emphasizes religious obstacles to free thinking and innovation. And still another focuses on communalist norms that dampened incentives to develop capitalist economic institutions. None of these explanations elucidates why groups without any stake in the impediments to growth failed to bring about major reforms.

A few well-educated Islanders were drawn to Islam's elegant monotheism and promise of unity in the 1980s and early 1990s, but numbers have grown significantly in the years following a violent civil conflict (1998-2003). Many of these new Muslim converts, especially those from the island of Malaita, seem preoccupied with the problem of sin and blame Christianity for destroying customary rules, especially those enforcing gender segregation. Echoing long-standing Malaitan critiques of Christian freedom, they say that Christians rely too heavily on God's grace and their own ability to resist temptation. Unlike Christianity and similar to the traditional religion of the islands, Islam provides clear moral rules for living.

We further demonstrate that these deficits are not fully explained by poverty or by oil but seem to have something to do with Islam itself. We further demonstrate that the democracy and freedom deficits are larger in the Islamic heartland than elsewhere in Muslim-majority countries. We show that the democracy deficit is not driven by demands for autocracy in Muslim-majority countries, and indeed, that individual Muslims value democracy more than non-Muslims. We suggest that the lack of religious freedom in Muslim-majority countries (the supreme power concept) may be a significant variable in explaining the democracy deficit.\n      </p>", "Unlike the saintly power of her male counterpart, which is conceived as an attribute of the individual, the spiritual power of the female saint in Sylhet, Bangladesh, is attributed to a supernatural entity that is temporarily affiliated with her. This difference cannot simply be regarded as an example of gendered domains of religious practice, in which men study the Qu'ran and women traffic with spirits, as in Sylhet, male healers practice with the aid of spirits. I describe how one woman's saintly status allowed her to resist the virilocal rule of residence, a patriarchal structure that is said to underpin women's subordinate position in Bangladesh. Her story demonstrates that Islam cannot be conflated with patriarchy and that it may support women's emancipation from structures of male authority.

This essay analyzes the role that reincarnation plays in maintaining a sense of unity and identity among the Druze, an Islamic sect residing primarily in the Levantine Middle East. It also describes the necessary conditions for reincarnation according to Druze doctrine and as evidenced in reincarnation stories. Reincarnation is of great social significance for the Druze, regarding family and village relations, and the Druze community at large. There is, however, some resistance within the community to a belief in reincarnation. This resistance is due in part to image management in the political context of Syria, and also because a belief in reincarnation is a stigma for a group in the Islamic Middle East. It also works against Druze efforts to present itself to the world as modern.\n      </p>", "Sufism - spiritual practice, intellectual discipline, literary tradition, and social institutionhas played an integral role in the moral formation of Muslim society. Its aspiration toward a universal kindness to all creatures beyond the requirements of Islamic law has added a distinctly hypernomian dimension to the moral vision of Islam, as evidenced in a wide range of Sufi literature. The universal perspective of Sufism, fully rooted in Islamic revelation, yields a lived (and not just studied) ethics with the potential to view and embrace all creatures through a single ethical vision, regardless of religious or other affiliation. This side of Islam, both acknowledging and surpassing the outlook of the legal heritage, offers important insight into understanding the nature of Muslim society as both Islamic and metaIslamic in religious orientation. Sufism, still significant in today's Islamic world, thus offers important material for locating Islam as part of an international order with principles and standards that resonate deeply with the moral vision of Islam itself.\n      </p>", "This paper provides an overview of legal, religious, medical and social factors that serve to support or hinder women's access to safe abortion services in the 21 predominantly Muslim countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, where one in ten pregnancies ends in abortion.

Afghans and Iranians both seek services in Iran's public health sector for family health care, treatment of infectious disease, and childhood vaccinations.

The paper concludes that with the possible exception of Islam's focus on personal responsibility and the non-recognition of the corporation as a legal person, which could undermine the concept of corporate responsibility, there is no divergence between the tenets of the religion and the principles of the UN Global Compact. Indeed, Islam often goes further and has the advantage of clearer codification of ethical standards as well as a set of explicit enforcement mechanisms.

It focuses on one Swahili man's efforts to find effective treatment for a severe bout of fever, including resort to poorly understood Western medicine, to home remedies, and to humoral-based treatment. The sick man attributes his eventual cure to a medicine called the \"equalizer.\" The case study is part of wider research that examines individual knowledge of Islamic humoral medicine as part of the Swahili heritage. Versions of humoral theory are articulated by lay people and underlie the local understanding of fever. The growth of a reformed Islamic movement, as well as local economic change, influences treatment choice by leading people to reject consultations with descendants of the Prophet Mohammed who offer mystical healing powers. This rejection connects to individuality and to the physical and social mobility of the Swahili. Advice givers among family and friends do not constitute a therapy management group, and the manner in which the sick man retains control over treatment choice is typical of the Swahili.\n      </p>", "This paper discusses three post-revolutionary dissident political theologies in Iran. They all question the absolutist theology of the ruling clerics and utilize indigenous sources of scholarship to oppose the clerical hegemony. They have complementary emphases: whereas Soroush highlights the variable nature of religious knowledge, Shabestari and Kadivar underline its limited and multiple nature. They represent the maturing of the dialogue of the Iranian-Islamic thought with Western social and political philosophy, and as the coming of age of the indigenous Islamic political theology reclaiming its pluralistic and democratic elements. Together, they attack the totalitarian Islam, and call for a guarded and objective secularism, while preserving Islam's spiritual and cultural identity.\n      </p>", "Soon after the 1979 Iranian revolution, women's appeals for equal protection of their rights were deemed by supporters of the new government to be remnants of European-U.S. imperialism.

This article highlights, the relationship between the Orthodox Church and Islam vis-\u00e0-vis the nascent but rapidly developing Oromo nationalism. Based on the analysis of Oromo ethnography, history, the system of thought and their contemporary political movements, the paper argues that Oromo nationalism is the antithesis of the Ethiopian state/official nationalism supported by the Orthodox Church. It also demonstrates that Islam is not a driving ideological force of Oromo's political struggle. On one the hand, it is in contradiction with many aspects of the pre-existing culture such as Gadaa-Qaaluu and other values from which the nationalists try to take inspiration to build their future. On the other hand, from the strategic perspective, the adoption of Islam or Christianity as an ideological tool of their nationalism would be a factor of more division and fragmentation.

There was overwhelming agreement among Americans that the only way to disarm Iraq was to remove Saddam Hussein. Nevertheless, despite this general consensus, responses to the removal of Hussein still clearly were colored by religious factors. Religious factors also shaped support for invading Iraq and views of Islam as a violent religion.

Less widely reported, however, was the intensification of a struggle between Muslim proponents of democracy and neofundamentalist conservatives, sparked by the same incidents. This article explores the varied reactions of Muslims to the violence of September 11 and its aftermath in light of this contest between rival Muslim groupings. It examines their competing visions of Islam and nation, as well as their supporting alliances in state and society. The example highlights the pluralism of Muslim politics and the special challenges of democratic transitions.

In the process, activists influenced the growing nationalist movement by using the legacy of Islam to justify both the political and cultural autonomy of Eritrean society. Using previously overlooked archival sources, Muslim League publications, secondary literature, and interviews with activists from the period in question, this article attempts to revise current understandings about how the implementation and steady erosion of the Ethiopian-Eritrean Federation influenced the course of political and cultural activism among Eritrea's Muslim communities.

These women function as cultural mediators between the traditional culture of the sending country and the modern one of the host country. They see themselves as both tradition-bearers and integration proponents. The demands of immigration have given rise to the growth and development of different leaders, among them cultural mediators seeking a bridge between Islam and modernity, economic mediators seeking to establish women in the media and as entrepreneurs, and political mediators who seek access to power at the local level for the immigrants.

Women's absolute LMP is higher in Muslim countries with higher levels of economic development and in the oil-exporting countries. For women's relative LMP, practical democracy (the degree to which people actively participate in the system) takes in a key position. It has a strong positive effect on women's relative LMP and mediates the effects of economic development (positive), formal democratic structures (positive) and state Islamization (negative) on women's relative LMP.

This quest has led them to adhere to practices that give them the sense of exercising a degree of control over the recurrent afflictions of nature. Among these practices we find the recourse to fatalism, attempts to propitiate Allah, the concept of agents of evil, the creation of taboos, and the belief in the power of magic. Although these various devices do not form a single integral religion, yet, in their appeal to the supernatural, they constitute the bedouin's true religion. It is the purpose of this paper to present some of these practices, as witnessed and understood by the author, and to indicate their relatedness to the natural environment of bedouins past and present. It is also proposed that, while Islam provides a caption for the overall religious identity of the bedouins, it is but one of several belief systems practiced by them simultaneously.

In my analysis, I link economic development and human rights to globalization and the continuing costs of militarization. Such connections allow feminists to target the structural conditions that sustain the laws in Pakistan and help create an environment that will bring about the repeal of the laws while contributing to trans-national feminist solidarity.\n      </p>", "Among Hausaphone Mawri communities of Niger, twins are powerful yet dangerous beings endowed from birth with extraordinary abilities. While they are welcomed by parents who interpret multiple births as lucky, twins are feared because they kill offenders and perceive things which normal people cannot see. Twins are also fiercely jealous of each other. Defusing this rivalry entails treating both children identically, lest they hurt each other. This essay explores how the Mawri deal with the paradox of double births through practices that emphasize the magical powers of twins or, conversely, stress their vulnerability. It also discusses how, with the emergence of reformist Islam, the meanings and implications of twin births are being reassessed through debates over morality.\n      </p>", "The present article is an inquiry into the relationship between Logbara traditional personal names and religion. As context for the study, the literal and real meanings of Logbara personal names, and the naming-ceremony conferring such names, are considered. The article lists as many personal names associated with religion as could be gathered, with a detailed analysis of their meaning. This is followed by a consideration of the frequency of these names compared to other personal names. Elaborating on this proportion, an explanation is attempted. This conclusion summarizes the main points of the article, the final paragraph inferring that Logbara personal names associated with religion are actually few in number. This is explained by the fact that the social and psychological function of Logbara names does not seem to apply to names associated with religion, as problems arising within religion also find a solution within religion. Moreover, one must not overlook the impact of Christianity and Islam on traditional religion in general.\n      </p>", "Dinoflagellate cysts have been recorded and studied from the upper part of the London Clay and overlying Bagshot Formation sensu stricto of early-middle Eocene age from Baughurst, Shapley Heath, Virginia Water, Chobham Common and the Isle of Sheppey in the London Basin and from the early-middle Eocene Bracklesham Group at Bracklesham Bay in the Hampshire Basin.

For the human geographer both the Hajj and the other pillars-foundations of Islamic belief provide a constancy and spatially reinforcing dynamic to facilitate at least a partial comprehension of the properties of a specific and large cultural region; the community of Islam. It is to be stressed that any singular concern with the Hajj that fails to see it as a part or rite within a wider functioning Islam will do a disservice both to the pilgrimage itself and present an unacceptable view of Islam. The recent growth of the Hajj is considered as part of the continuity and indeed mounting ebullience and vitality of Islam. Continuing population growths and developments in transport technologies that present increasing opportunities to a widening number of Muslims are outlined and the various transport modes utilized by Hajjees are considered.\n      </p>", "The struggle over women's rights has been one of the main battlegrounds between the forces of modernity and tradition in Iranian politics and society. With the emergence of a Reformist movement in 1997 this struggle entered a new phase in the Islamic Republic. It became part of the part of a broader conflict over two differing notions of Islam. One is an absolutist and legalistic Islam, premised on the notion of \"duty,\" tolerating no dissent and making little concession to popular will and contemporary realities. The other is a pluralistic and tolerant Islam that promotes democratic values and human rights--including women's rights.\n      </p>", "There are at least 83 countries where homosexuality is condemned in the criminal code; 26 of these are Muslim countries and in seven the death penalty for persons presumed guilty of homosexual acts makes sexual minorities extremely vulnerable. In spite of such obstacles, same-sex relationships do take place, even in the most repressive countries. Sometimes the very segregation of the sexes allows for intimacy between people of the same sex without it being considered abnormal. There are positive examples of same-sex relationships to be found in different Muslim cultures, e.g. in travelling theatre and musical groups and in poetry. Controversy regarding the position of Islam on homosexuality is ongoing, as the Qur'an is far from clear on the issue. There is also a strong connection between homophobic assaults by fundamentalists and those directed against women who do not \"behave\". Sexuality and sexual conformity may be the focus of attention by fundamentalist forces because individual choice and autonomy, especially for women, is seen as a threat. Despite a threatening environment, sexual minorities are organising and becoming more visible in Muslim countries and communities; whether mainly political, social or religious in their motivation, these organisations all aim at breaking the isolation faced by sexual minorities. /// Dans au moins 83 pays, dont 26 pays musulmans, l'homosexualit\u00e9 est punie par le droit p\u00e9nal; dans sept d'entre eux, la peine capitale pr\u00e9vue pour les pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s coupables d'actes homosexuels rend les minorit\u00e9s sexuelles extr\u00eamement vuln\u00e9rables.

The papers in this issue explore how AIDS is understood and confronted through religious ideas and practices, and how these, in turn, are reinterpreted and changed by the experience of AIDS. They reveal the creativity and innovations that continuously emerge in the everyday life of East Africans, between bodily and spiritual experiences, and between religious, medical, political and economic discourses. Countering simplified notions of causal effects of AIDS on religion (or vice versa), the diversity of interpretations and practices inserts the epidemic into wider, and more open, frames of reference. It reveals East Africans' will and resourcefulness in their struggle to move ahead in spite of adversity, and goes against the generalised vision of doom widely associated with the African AIDS epidemic. Finally, it shows that East Africans understand AIDS not as a singular event in their history, but as the culmination of a century-long process of changing spiritual imaginaries, bodily well-being and likelihoods.

Following a state-centered approach, this study argues that state-building activities are a primary origin of Islamic movements. Regimes adopt religious symbolism and functions that legitimate the role of Islam in the public sphere. State incorporation of religion thus creates Islam as a frame for political action, with increased access to mobilizing resources and better able to withstand repression and political exclusion. To provide an explicit and systematic test of cross-national variation, data on 170 political and militant organizations across the region are analyzed. Results indicate that state incorporation of religion is a crucial factor in the religiosity of movement organizations. Mixed effects of political exclusion and repression are found. No support is found for theories of economic grievances or foreign influence as causes of Islamic mobilization. In sum, analysis suggests that a state-centered perspective is the most fitting account of political Islam.\n      </p>", "In the 1990s, Muslims in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire redefined the boundaries of their identity, as well as the structure of their community. While young men have been at the forefront of this movement of religious revitalization as leaders and erudites, the life trajectories of young Muslim women have been deeply altered by these changes. This article explores how, through renewed acts of faith and displays of orthodoxy, Western-style educated and financially self-sufficient young women are negotiating their participation into marriage markets. Their relatively new social roles, defined by Western-style education and salaried employment, exclude them from locally sanctioned notions of \"proper womanhood.\" Whilst their lifeworld inscribes them within a locally defined space of modernity and self-realization, they are not fully actualized as Muslim women due to their exclusion from marriage markets and, by extension, legitimate motherhood. Through their overt display of Islamic practice and their participation into newly created Islamic youth associations, they position themselves as \"marriageable women\" in light of marriage practices that generally favour younger and less formally educated women. The locally articulated Arabized version of Islam is at the core of their inclusion into local and transnational matrimonial markets. /// Dans les ann\u00e9es 1990, le fait d' \"\u00eatre musulman\" dans le contexte social ivoirien a acquis une toute nouvelle signification.

This concept of a popular, as opposed to an official, practice has deep roots, however, extending back to the formative period of the Muslim tradition. Classically, the emergence of a clerical elite defined in terms of their functions in the fields of law, education, and administration as well as religion coincided with the rise of a parallel folk piety inspired by Sufism which adapted Islam to local circumstances. The sweeping changes of the last two centuries have undermined many of the old religious institutions belonging to both these spheres. But the overall structures of social relations have largely remained within the context of the nation-state. With few and short-lived exceptions, rural peasants and urban masses who continue to regard Islam as the primary basis for their identity have not responded positively to the summons of the current revival. On the other hand, Islamicists, despite divisions among themselves, have established their importance.

Women play no substantial role in either conception or pregnancy. Furthermore, they are dispossessed of the substance flowing from their breasts (which they can but give to their babies) because milk is more than a nutrient: this fluid conveys an identity.

In spite of the increasing appeal of liberal-democratic ideas of individual freedom, pluralism, and political tolerance in the new reform movement and the overwhelming endorsement of these ideas in four recent national elections, including two presidential polls, the authors argue that the movement has had but a limited and, for the most part symbolic, influence on Iran's objective, and still repressive, political conditions.\n      </p>", "The Sama of the southern Philippines are reconstructing the nature of Islamic knowledge, the ways one knows Islam, and the constitution of religious authority.

Or, comparable \u00e0 l'image des institutions politiques lignag\u00e8res du Manden, l'association repr\u00e9sente \u00e0 la fois une force impr\u00e9visible venue d'ailleurs, et l'ordre pr\u00e9\u00e9tabli par les a\u00een\u00e9s. /// Seeking to restore an original state of purity, studies of the K\u00f2ma (or K\u00f2m\u00f2), a religious association, have tended to overlook exchanges between, on the one hand, local religious practices and conceptions, and, on the other, Islam. Discourses about the Maninka K\u00f2maw (in the Manding mountains, a region considered to be the cradle of Mande civilization) express these interactions, which, depending on the political circumstances, vary between the two poles of identity as a Moslem or 'heathen'. The current emphasis placed on the K\u00f2ma 'spirits' (rather than on ritual objects) is a sign of a new phase of reconciliation with Islam. This emphasis on the \"spirits\" also legitimates the K\u00f2ma's leadership by social groups that have been formally barred from traditional political offices. This does not however compromise this association's conservative nature. In the likeness of Manden political (lineage) institutions, the K\u00f2ma represents both an unpredictable force coming from outside the society, and also the order that elders previously established.\n      </p>", "Recent polls reveal that between 20% and 25% of Americans erroneously indicate that President Obama is a Muslim. In this article, we compare individuals' explicit responses on a survey about religion and politics with reaction time data from an Implicit Association Test (IAT) to investigate whether individuals truly associate Obama with Islam or are motivated reasoners who simply express negativity about the president when given the opportunity. Our results suggest that predispositions such as ideology, partisanship, and race affect how citizens feel about Obama, which in turn motivates them to accept misinformation about the president. We also find that these implicit associations increase the probability of stating that Obama is likely a Muslim. Interestingly, political sophistication does not appear to inoculate citizens from exposure to misinformation, as they exhibit the same IAT effect as less knowledgeable individuals.\n      </p>", "Bernard of Clairvaux lives in a geographic region and in a century, where politicians and intellectuals both look upon the Islam and its supporters as a religious and military danger for Western Europe and its culture. Unlike many contemporary theologians and philosophers Bernard does not engage in an intellectual controversy with Islamic positions. Even the explicit invitation of his friend, Peter the Venerable, who has let the Koran be translated into Latin, does not encourage him for such an effort. On the contrary he accepts the papal order to promote the second crusade. Why does act Bernard in this way? The article wants to show that Bernard's theological basic assumptions, especially his epistemological convictions make it impossible, to defend the truths of the Christian religion by the help of rational arguments. /// Bernardo de Claraval vive numa regi\u0101o do mundo e num s\u00e9culo em que lanto pol\u00edticos como intelectuais olham para o Isl\u0101o e os seus apoiantes como um perigo tanto religioso como militar para a Europa Ocidental e a sua cultura. Ao contr\u00e1rio de muitos te\u00f3logos e fil\u00f3sofos, Bernardo n\u00e3o se compromete numa controv\u00e9rsia intelectual com posi\u00e7\u00f5es isl\u00e2micas. Mesmo o convite expl\u00edcito que Ihe fez o seu amigo, Pedro o Vener\u00e1vel, o qual ordenou a tradu\u00e7\u00e3o do Cor\u00e3o para Latim, n\u00e3o o encoraja nesse sentido. Pelo contr\u00e1rio, Bernardo aceita a ordem do Papa para que promova a segunda cruzada. Porque \u00e9 que Bernardo actua desta forma? O presente artigo pretende demonstrar que as pressuposi\u00e7\u00f5es teol\u00f3gicas de base em Bernardo, especialmente as suas convic\u00e7\u00f5es epistemol\u00f3gicas, tornam imposs\u00edvel uma defesa das verdades da religi\u00e3o Crist\u00e3 com aux\u00edlio de argumentos racionais.\n      </p>", "Mauritian Muslims profoundly disagree over the legitimacy of the devotional genre na't, as audition of audiocassette and audio-CD recordings of the genre has become more popular. In this article, I suggest a close articulation between critiques of textual and spiritual mediation in South Asian Islamic traditions practiced in Mauritius and certain uses of electronic voice mediation, such as the circulation of audiocassette and audio-CD na't. The significance of electronically mediated devotional discourse emerges in the ways in which media practices become part of genealogical forms of Islamic authority centered on ensuring authentic textual and performative transmission through long chains of reliable interlocutors.\n      </p>", "This essay argues that the convergence of religious ethics and business management knowledge illustrate the formation of what are termed spiritual economies. Spiritual economies conceptualize how economic reform and neoliberal restructuring are conceived of and acted on as matters of religious piety and spiritual virtue. The spiritual economy described consists of producing spirituality as an object of intervention, reconfiguring work as a form of religious worship, and inculcating an ethic of individual accountability and entrepreneurial responsibility among workers. Drawing on 18 months of ethnographic research, the majority of which took place at Krakatau Steel in Banten, Indonesia, this essay describes a moderate Islamic spiritual reform movement active in state-owned companies, government bureaucracies, and private enterprises in contemporary Indonesia. Proponents of spiritual reform consider the separation of religious ethics from economic practice as the root of Indonesia's economic crisis because this disjunction resulted in rampant corruption, inefficiency, and a lack of discipline at the workplace. The essay analyzes these efforts to inculcate Islamic ethics in combination with western management knowledge that is expected to enhance economic productivity, reduce endemic corruption, and prepare employees of state-owned enterprises for privatization.\n      </p>", "The establishment of mosques is an incentive for public discussions on Islam and the presence of Muslims in Western European societies. This article critically reconstructs Public Policy discourses on mosque establishment in the Dutch city of Rotterdam. It shows how urban-planning discourses, and their specific frames, which came to dominate mosque establishment as a policy issue in Rotterdam from the 1980s onwards, created their own set of meanings. The article analyses these discourses in terms of their enabling and constraining roles during a period in which local authorities became more involved in the improvement and placement of new mosques in the Rotterdam area. On the one hand, the urban renewal framework allowed for a substantial improvement in the housing of Islamic religious and cultural practice. On the other hand, urban planning policy discursive practices gave less attention to issues such as visibility and presence that are now at the heart of the heated debates about Muslim populations in Dutch society. More recent discussions on the aesthetics and location of mosques in Rotterdam illustrate how these dominant discourses are not only contestable but are also being contested from all quarters.\n      </p>", "The political role of Shi'i religion in the tobacco movement of 1890-1892 against the Qajar state and a British company in Iran is considered. Using this historically significant event, this article pursues a dual objective. First, it makes a modest attempt to clarify the connection between ideology and class action. The utility of conceiving ideology as a discourse, a set of general principles and concepts, rituals and symbols that shape class action, is suggested. Second, after summarizing and criticizing the existing explanations of Shi'i politics in the 19th century, it offers an alternative interpretation of the oppositional role of Shi'ism in the politics of late 19th-century Iran. I argue that in the tobacco movement Shi'i Islam constituted a language for addressing the problem of British domination; it transcended class differences and provided an effective tactic for mobilizing support against a British monopoly. The merchants' capacity to act was not simply the result of their organization and resources but was enhanced by Shi'i discourse.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

This article sheds light on the post-1993 bombing of the World Trade Center when journalists and evangelicals looked for sensational and inflammatory statements about the so-called Islamic militancy toward the United States. In this process, the preachers of hatred against Islam attempted to portray the Muslim faith as monolithic, unchanging, and viciously directed against Americans. What they did not choose to highlight was the enormous diversity among Muslim cultures or the focus within many Muslim groups on building community. The article anticipates that such enduring myths about Islam could lead to the rise of a new anti-Semitism in the United States: not against Jews, but against Muslims.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "One of the most fundamental ways that religious devotion is held to be \"anti-biotechnology\" is in its emphasis on submission to divine will. This article seeks to re-orient discussions of religious \"fatalism\" through ethnographic analysis of terminally-ill dialysis patients in Egypt who argue that they would rather \"accept God's will\" than pursue kidney transplantation. I argue against the presumptions that this is a religious constraint on a potentially beneficial treatment, or that this reaction is merely a \"comfort mechanism\" to appease those without access to treatment. I argue that we should not think of people's perceptions of the amount of control they can exert over their lives in terms that would place analyses of social benefit and religious belief in opposing or even in discretely separate categories. I also demonstrate that, far from being passive, the disposition of accepting God's will must be actively cultivated through work on the self.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "In this article, I emphasize the endeavor of religious Muslims to weave Muslim practices and institutions into the heterogeneous lifeworlds of modern society.
