That music can sometimes elucidate or contradict an exclusively social or literary reading may be seen, for example, in Emile de Becque's immobility at the end of \"Some Enchanted Evening.\" In other cases, when the social assimilation of Jewish characters is revealed to be a musical one as well, music can support Most's argument. The problem exemplified by writings such as Most's-the distortions and misreadings that may result from a social history that does not engage music-may be seen in the broader context of Broadway and opera scholarship. Lessons to be learned from studying the musical Show Boat and the works of Sondheim point to the need for scholars and critics to consider how the music in musicals might convey social meanings, intellectual content, and dramatic ideas beyond words, stories, and stage directions.\n      </p>", "This essay examines the popular 1960s films Mary Poppins (Stevenson 1964) and The Sound of Music (Wise 1965) which, despite their foreign settings and stars and their historical timeframes, are seen in the light of their relevance to social and political concerns of the United States in the 1960s. The films set about addressing anxieties surrounding masculinity, motherhood, domestic gender roles, and the constitution of the family that were current at the time. The films are seen as a response to the burgeoning women's movement of the mid-1960s and rising levels of recognition of women's changing place in society, as well as what was considered men's loosening grip on patriarchal power in the family. In both films, the character of the nanny, a threshold figure and family interloper, is the person responsible for reinstalling the father, whose domestic role as head of the intact, patriotic family was thought to be in jeopardy, by ensuring that his familial relations are modernized.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Nonparametric techniques are used to test for a trend in the proportion of new shows accounted for by revivals. These tests indicate that the proportion of revivals is indeed increasing over time. Using nonparametric techniques again to test for stochastic dominance it is difficult to argue that Broadway produces too many revivals. Although original productions on average run for longer, revivals are much less likely to close after only a small number of performances.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "           ", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

In the first part of the twentieth century, musicals viewed life through rose-colored glasses; musicals were equivalent to musical comedy. Starting in the 1940s, the mood of musicals darkened. One indication of the new, serious tone was that characters in musicals died in the course of the show. This essay examines several questions relating to death in the Broadway musical, such as who dies, when in the course of the drama the death occurs, and how the death is marked musically. It concludes with a look at musicals involving the deaths of historical characters and at AIDS-related musicals, works whose assumptions and ideals are very far from those of the musical comedies of the early twentieth century.\n      </p>", "Play indexes are numerous and perversely disparate.

By so tracing West Side Story's twining histories from the musical's earliest beginnings in 1949 through the changes-upon-changes marking its 2009 revival, the essay demonstrates how compiling West Side Story's parahistories helps to explain why one of the most canonical Broadway musicals of the twentieth century remains a source of controversy and contention in the twenty-first.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

It was also decisive in separating an emergent literary theatre, which disdained jazz for its alleged social and moral depravity, and musical comedy and vaudeville, which not only embraced jazz but became crucial arenas for its development and dissemination. By analyzing early Gershwin musicals, this essay argues that musical comedy, by ingeniously mixing highbrow and lowbrow, became a privileged site in which the debates about the social, cultural, racial, and ethnic status of jazz were both thematized and enacted.\n      </p>", "           ", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Yangge is a popular rural dance in north China. In the Yan'an era (1936-47) the Chinese Communist Party used the art form as a political tool to influence people's thinking and to disseminate socialist images. During the early years of the People's Republic of China, the Communists introduced a simpler form of yangge in the cities. In three major yangge musicals performed in Beijing, the Party attempted to construct \"a narrative history through rhythmic movements\" in an effort to weave the developments of the Party's history into a coherent success story, affirming various themes: the support of the people, the valour of the Red Army, the wise leadership of the Party and the country's bright future. However, urban yangge's simplicity as an art form, the professionalization of art troupes, the nation's increasing exposure to a variety of alternative dance forms and, worse still, stifling government control all contributed to the rapid decline of this art form in urban China.\n      </p>", "Stephen Sondheim composed a three-movement piano sonata for his thesis in music at Williams College and submitted the two outer movements upon graduation. Sondheim has since been unwilling to publish or disseminate the work, and a college stipulation has prevented reproduction of the thesis. The sonata shows the influences on Sondheim's emerging musical style - predominantly Ravel, Rachmaninov (influences previously established by scholars), Prokofiev and Hindemith (influences less well established) - and demonstrates that his compositional language was significantly developed by the time of his graduation. Similarities abound between the sonata and the mature musicals of the 1970s and beyond. In addition to providing examples from the completed movements - a feat made possible by Sondheim's decision to grant limited permission to reproduce the sonata - the article examines a two-page sketch for the second movement, a manuscript that had remained in Sondheim's sole possession until October 2000.\n      </p>", "As recently as December, 2002, the New York Times' Elvis Mitchell referred to the \"wreckage\" of Showgirls (1995).

Returning to this musical and its production history in the light of recent theorizations of the transnational, this essay identifies a tradition of \"mock transnational performance\" that has been significant within African American commercial theatre and that shapes Jamaica's staging of the Caribbean. Mock transnational is meant to describe a theatrical mode and performative stance that takes up the misuse of diasporic cultural indices to critique and refigure the politics of the nation-state and racialized national formations.The essay locates Jamaica's mock transnational strategies in the leftist poetry of lyricist Yip Harburg; in the auditory maneuvers and performance strategies of its star, Lena Home; and in the networks of professional support and social activism cultivated in the musical's backstage relations. These surplus moments made use of diasporic imaginative geographies, sounds, and gestures\u2014 often in tension with the musical's book\u2014to explore and complicate the relationship between African American racial consciousness and theatrical form, on the one hand, and African diasporic histories and fantasies on the other.\n      </p>", "Contemporary painter Deborah Kass appropriates the forms of post-war masters such as Andy Warhol, Jackson Pollock, and Frank Stella in her work, but her subject choices are often conscious manifestations of her nostalgic identifications with middlebrow Jewish artists and Broadway musicals.

Kass's performative interventions insert her feminist-Jewish-lesbian self squarely at the center of visual culture's frame and on the stage of art's history.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "We estimate a demand function for live theater provided by the General Directorate of State Theaters in Turkey. We show that demand is more elastic in less developed cities, that attendance is not significantly affected by various qualitative variables, and that the government's practice of offering free passes to government officials is an ineffective way of increasing paid attendance. Comedies and musicals both show significantly higher attendance. Having a Turkish author does not significantly affect attendance. Having a known author significantly increases attendance for more developed cities but not for less developed cities. Being the opening season significantly reduces attendance in less developed cities but has no effect in more developed cities.
