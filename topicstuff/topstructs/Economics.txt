The dominant school of economics in the United States, neoclassical economics, equates human welfare with the level of consumption of market goods and sees the natural world merely as an input into the economic process. To neoclassical economists, sustainability means sustaining economic output. Ecological economists take a broader view of sustainability by recognizing that essential features of the earth's life-supporting systems also must be sustained. The sustainability debate currently focuses on the ability of the economy to substitute human-created infrastructure for the services of the environment. The neoclassical concept is called \"weak\" sustainability, and the ecological economics concept is called \"strong\" sustainability. The motivation for weak sustainability is preserving an economy's capital stock, which produces economic output. Capital stock consists of human-made or \"manufactured capital,\" the services of the environment or \"natural capital,\" and the level of technology and training or \"human capital.\" Weak sustainability assumes that these kinds of capital are substitutable for one another. The motivation for strong sustainability is recognizing that substitution possibilities among these different kinds of capital are limited. This paper discusses some of the terms and concepts behind the sustainability debate between neoclassical and ecological economics.\n      </p>", "The aim of this paper is to give an overview on the development, current status and future challenges of health economics in Hungary. We identified the major challenges during the development of health economics in Hungary. The greatest challenge that health economics faced in the early and mid-1990s was the lack of well-qualified professionals because in Central and Eastern European countries there had not been any relevant trainings before. It was the next major challenge for the Hungarian health care financing system to integrate the results from health economics studies into the decision making processes of public administration, through the development of the legal framework and institutionalisation health economics. Hopefully, the development of health economics in Hungary over the last 15 years will continue, which is greatly stimulated by hosting the 6th European Conference on Health Economics in Budapest in 2006.\n      </p>", "The paper explores Buddhist economics as a major alternative to the Western economic mindset. Buddhism is centred on want negation and purification of the human character. Buddhist economics, developed by Schumacher, Payutto, Welford and others, challenges the basic principles of modern Western economics: (1) profit-maximisation, (2) cultivating desires, (3) introducing markets, (4) instrumental use of the world, and (5) self-interest-based ethics. Buddhist economics proposes alternative principles such as minimising suffering, simplifying desires, non-violence, genuine care, and generosity. It is suggested that Buddhist economics is not a system but a strategy, which can be applied in any economic setting.\n      </p>", "The National Center for Educational Statistics' Baccalaureate and Beyond (B and B) Longitudinal Study followed a nationally representative sample of approximately 11,000 students after their graduation in the 1992-93 academic year, with interviews conducted in 1994 and 1997. Approximately 1,700 graduates reported working as teachers at some time in their careers. Using transcript data from the B and B study, the authors report the quantity and type of economics courses that these teachers completed as undergraduates and their average grades in these courses and then compare those figures to the overall B and B population.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "This paper suggests that mathematics may have become so important in economics for four reasons: (1) to make use of existing human capital, (ii) to attain scientific respectability, (3) to help assure security with respect to claims of truth, and (4) because economics was created primarily by Western economists to understand Western economic behavior.\n      </p>", "A number of business ethics theorist have highlighted the potential for economics to contribute to the advancement of business ethics. In response, this article emphasizes the insights of a particular area of economics that could provide such expansion and development. Subjectivist economics may yet provide an effective analytical framework through which to investigate and evaluate business decision making, and hence the ethics of business. Integrating the concepts of uncertainty, time and imagination, subjectivist economic theory contributes to a greater appreciation of economic choice and behaviour. While such notions are often effectively omitted from modern economic analysis to aid formal representation, business ethicists could utilize such concepts more effectively than their colleagues in economic theory. Significantly, the well-known economists who have championed the insights of subjectivist economics have themselves recommended its extension to an analysis of ethics.\n      </p>", "Species and ecosystems have been assigned dollar values through methods developed by economists. Their value is then measured in financial terms and becomes comparable to any good or service traded in markets. This assignment of economic value to biodiversity and species will not guarantee their protection. In fact, pricing these nonmarket values allows for their direct comparison with market goods on a common metric, allowing for the possibility of optimal economic extinction of a species. In contrast to a market model of choice, I propose a decision framework that incorporates complexity, uncertainty, and limits to substitution between biodiversity and monetized goods and allows for critical valuation decisions outside the market model.\n      </p>", "Ecotourism has been proposed as a viable economic activity that can minimize negative human impacts on wildlife habitat and provide an incentive to preserve natural areas. The potential of ecotourism as a wildlife conservation strategy is limited by its inability to insure the long-term protection of environmental assets and by its tendency to contribute directly to environmental degradation. Ecotourism is a proxy market designed to align consumers' preferences for recreation with the protection of environmental assets. Because it does not necessarily address the direct protection of those assets, it is prone to market failure. Pressures on governments and firms involved in providing ecotourism services will impair their ability to minimize detrimental effects of human economic behavior. Ethical appeals to minimize harmful practices face serious obstacles. Promoting ecotourism may actually distract from more appropriate means of environmental protection.\n      </p>", "Research has found that women tend to have more negative predispositions towards studying economics than men, which contributes to their underrepresentation in the field. This paper uses survey data on principles students at a large state university to investigate causes of this difference. We find that students widely view economics as a business-oriented field that prioritizes math skills and making money \u2014 a combination that is a turnoff for women, but not so much men. Thus, emphasizing uses of economics for social welfare analysis, while de-emphasizing its business applications, may help to rebalance predispositions at the outset of the principles class.\n      </p>", "Feminist economics draws increasing attention from professional mainstream economists.

We point to parallels between feminist economics and institutional economics, and argue that these relations might be strengthened to the benefit of both.\n      </p>", "The most important problems facing wildlife conservation are the growing human population and its affluence, and the concomitant requirement for resources to accommodate this growth. A pressing question is how to maintain wildlife numbers and diversity when prime wildlife habitat is needed for agriculture, resource extraction, or urban expansion. Solutions to this problem may not be forthcoming because mainstream (generally meaning neoclassical) economic logic and policies are often in direct conflict with the goals of wildlife science. There is a great need for wildlife scientists to broaden their view and sophistication of economics and also to expand the wildlife field to encompass the larger social forces that are changing the well-being of wildlife species. In what follows we elaborate on 1) what we perceive to be the underlying problem of wildlife conservation; 2) why our current system of economic valuation will, in the long term, undercut the goal of wildlife conservation; and 3) how to incorporate these concepts into wildlife curricula and the wildlife profession.\n      </p>", "Weintraub's study shows that mathematics does not provide a fixed point of reference for economics. He explains how the notions of rigor and consistency have changed within mathematics over the years, and how it has proved impossible to express mathematics itself as a complete formal system. As a result, we can see more clearly that there is methodological confusion embedded in much applied economics, which gives priority to mathematical expression. In providing this account, Weintraub raises historiographical issues, which we address here-notably who should construct histories, given the normative content of all approaches (including science studies)?\n      </p>", "The authors describe an interdisciplinary approach to teaching economics that uses a powerful contemporary medium, the motion picture, to establish the context for teaching elementary economics concepts.

This cycle does not conform to overall degree trends, shifts in the gender composition of undergraduate populations, or changing interests of female students in any of the four countries. There is no evidence that changes in the \"price\" of a degree to students, tightened marking standards or degree requirements, or changes in pedagogical methods caused the cycle. Jobs for economics graduates declined in the United States between 1988 and 1990 and thereafter recovered. With a two-year recognition lag, the pattern of employment prospects fits the U. S. slump in economics degrees perfectly. Unfortunately, employment patterns in the other three countries are inconsistent with the degree cycle. The explanation that fits the economic degree pattern best is interest in business education.\n      </p>", "This essay discusses the implications for the evolution of mathematical economics of the ideas presented in E. Roy Weintraub's How Economics Became a Mathematical Science. A central issue in the discussion is the nature of formalism and axiomatization in mathematical economics, how that has evolved in mathematics, and how that evolution has influenced developments in economics. It is argued that modern mathematical economics has followed mathematics itself in moving beyond hyper-formalistic approaches such as Bourbakism to the use of other approaches, such as computer simulation and more inductive methods. The essay will also argue that mathematics is useful in developing Post Keynesian economics.\n      </p>", "This essay examines the relationship between strategic management and economics. It introduces the special issue on this same topic by providing a guide to the eight papers contained in the special issue, and it offers the guest editors viewpoints on the contributions of each discipline to the other. The essay notes the major contribution from economics has been primarily from the industrial organization literature, with promises of important gains to be made from the `new' economics as it breaks away from the neoclassical theory of the firm. Contributions from strategic management to economics are noted. Areas for further research utilizing the relationship between strategic management and economics are also indicated.\n      </p>", "Introducing economics to undergraduates with courses that incorporate various elements of economic fields at an introductory level has the potential to increase the appeal of economics classes. The author provides a model for teaching such courses using an environmental economics class as an example. This approach incorporates introductory economics concepts into an interdisciplinary class that includes three disciplines focused on a central theme. In this course, called environmental perspectives, the economics section covered the principles of microeconomics, the fundamentals of environmental economics, and linked these applications to the topics covered in the ecology and philosophy sections of the class. A discussion of the methods for applying this model to other courses that include economics is included.\n      </p>", "Health promotion activities consume a growing proportion of health sector spending in most developed countries. Yet, there is still considerable debate in the non-economic literature about exactly what health promotion constitutes and precisely how its role is to be conceived. This paper provides one economic answer to such questions. It sets out an argument that health promotion may be viewed, through the lens of traditional welfare economics, as a response to problems of market failure. A Grossman-type health investment model is invoked to analyse individual deviations from equilibrium and the possible instruments and targets of health promotion policy. The paper concludes by suggesting some of the alternative conceptual approaches that might be brought to bear, as well as some ideas for empirical research.\n      </p>", "Ranking of agricultural economics departments based upon the number of articles or article pages does not take into account the impact or usefulness of these journal articles or other works to the profession. In this paper, an alternative ranking scheme is employed which utilizes citations from a broad array of publications of a department's faculty. Rankings are developed for agricultural economics units at 1862 land grant universities, 1890 land grant universities, independent U.S. universities, and Canadian universities, as well as an overall composite ranking and comparisons with economics departments.\n      </p>", "Modern economics produces many interpretations of the category of equilibrium as well as competing views of its relevance or worth for economic theorizing. In particular, interpretations and valuations often differ systematically between mainstream and heterodox contributions. I argue that these differences are best explained through understanding the competing ontological presuppositions of the mainstream and heterodox traditions. If correct, this explanation reinforces the assessment advanced elsewhere (Lawson, 2003) that mainstream and heterodox traditions are best distinguished not according to substantive claims or policy stances but rather precisely in terms of their ontological commitments.\n      </p>", "As the United States has become a more litigious society, executives are finding more of their time and their firms' resources consumed by litigation. This paper attempts to assist their decision making with regard to legal matters by looking at the following questions: (1) Under what conditions should a potential plaintiff litigate a specific issue? (2) Under what conditions should a defendant faced with a lawsuit respond forcefully to it? (3) How can legal expenses be budgeted and controlled by both sides? (4) What are the most likely conditions under which both plaintiff and defendant would be willing to seek out of court settlement? The research determines the economic requisites of both a plaintiff's decision to litigate an issue and the corresponding defendant's decision on how to respond to the suit. These decisions are viewed as both commensurate and competitive with other managerial operating decisions, e.g. capital budgeting and market expansion, that make demands upon the firm's resources. Models from economics and learning theory are employed both to illustrate the relationship between expenditures on a civil suit and the probability of success and to show how litigation costs should be budgeted and controlled. The research also shows both the conditions under which it is advantageous for both sides to seek an out of court settlement and the means to estimate the probability of out of court settlements in civil litigation in general. This latter is shown under the most general conditions to be a minimum of 0.66 and to rise as the participants in the litigation become more risk averse.\n      </p>", "The nation's loss in economic majors in the early 1990s is primarily attributed to a 24 percent decline at public universities, but there is now a continuing increase in the total number of undergraduate degrees awarded in economics from a low in 1995-96.\n      </p>", "Despite our pretensions to science, modern industrial society is as myth-bound and mystical as any that has preceded it. Our prevailing cultural myth includes a dangerous vision of global sustainability and poverty reduction centered on unlimited economic expansion, \"free\" trade and technological fixes. This paper dissects the modern myth, exposing its conceptual flaws and practical failings. It then proposes an alternative conceptual framework for development derived from ecological economics and ecological footprint analysis. The new framework recognizes that the human enterprise is a subsystem of the ecosphere whose growth is constrained by biophysical limits. If humanity is to seize control of its destiny it must arise above wishful thinking and tribal instinct. Global society needs a new cultural myth rooted in humanity's unique claim to intelligence and self-awareness in the face of danger. Human security depends on equitable development--not growth--within the means of nature. Sustainability with social justice can be achieved only through an unprecedented level of international cooperation rooted in a sense of compassion for both other peoples and other species.\n      </p>", "The study of the economy has not developed as have other sciences, in which direct observation and data collection by the scientists themselves play a large part. Rather than evidence, which is mostly scarce and indirect, it is political ideology that determines which side of any controversy any economist is likely to take. Two methodological habits of the economics profession have contributed to the poor state of development of economics as a science. One is theorizing based on simple made-up scenarios and assumptions about human cupidity and rationality. The other is the lack of a rigorous connection between the modeling of the macroeconomy and an empirically based description of the behavior of consumers, firms, banks, and individual markets. This article provides a brief discussion of the work of those economists doing systematic observation of economic actors and an assessment of whether their work will lead toward an economics that is empirically based.\n      </p>", "We report the results of a study analyzing the proportion of theoretical and empirical articles in two core health economics journals. The Journal of Health Economics published 30% theory during the period 1982-1986, but by 1997-2001 the proportion had risen to 40% theory. Health Economics published 38% theory during 1992-1996, but the proportion fell to 32% theory during 1997-2001. In both journals articles were more likely to be published by men (78%), and published women were 50% less likely to publish theory than were men. Articles were more likely to be published by United States authors (54%), but United States authors were less likely to publish theory than authors from other countries. Compared to other disciplines, health economics published a higher proportion of theory than sociology, chemistry, and physics but less than economics and political science.\n      </p>", "Economics has typically been the social science of choice to inform public policy and policymakers. In the current paper we contemplate the role behavioral science can play in enlightening policymakers. In particular, we provide some examples of research that has and can be used to inform policy, reflect on the kind of behavioral science that is important for policy, and approaches for convincing policy-makers to listen to behavioral scientists. We suggest that policymakers are unlikely to invest the time translating behavioral research into its policy implications, and researchers interested in influencing public policy must therefore invest substantial effort, and direct that effort differently than in standard research practices.\n      </p>", "The financial profitability of intensive grazing management techniques such as short duration grazing (SDG) and the Savory Grazing Management (SGM) has received very little attention in the range management or economics literature. Most research has emphasized variables which measure technical rather than economic efficiency. A conceptual economic model is presented which illustrates the importance of the management factor in determining the optimal stocking rate and profitability of cell grazing practices. Empirical results yield internal rates of return on an after-tax basis for a $10,000 grazing cell for 11-40% assuming cow herd productivity is maintained at, or increased above, pre-adoption levels. As cell costs increase and stocking rates increase, ranch profitability declines and increases respectively in almost all cases. The principal determinant of long-run profits is found to be livestock productivity since this factor has a greater impact on profitability than stocking rate levels or cell investment costs. Increased stocking rates with intensive grazing technology do not insure increased profits unless concurrent improvement in range, livestock, and business management practices are adopted.\n      </p>", "Most people learn to drive without knowing how the engine works. In a similar vein, the author believes that students can learn economics without knowing the algebra and calculus underlying the results. If instructors follow the philosophy of other economics courses in using graphs to illustrate the results, and draw the graphs accurately, then they can teach economics with virtually no algebra or calculus. The author's intermediate micro course is taught using mathematical software that does the mathematics and that draws accurate graphs from which students can see the key results. He backs up this no-algebra no-calculus approach with tutorial exercises in which students do economics and with exams that require no knowledge of algebra and calculus. The students end up feeling the economics, rather than fearing the algebra and the calculus.\n      </p>", "Until ca. 2000, information security was seen as a technological discipline, based on computer science but with mathematics helping in the design of ciphers and protocols. That perspective started to change as researchers and practitioners realized the importance of economics. As distributed systems are increasingly composed of machines that belong to principals with divergent interests, incentives are becoming as important to dependability as technical design. A thriving new field of information security economics provides valuable insights not just into ' security' topics such as privacy, bugs, spam and phishing, but into more general areas of system dependability and policy. This research programme has recently started to interact with psychology. One thread is in response to phishing, the most rapidly growing form of online crime, in which fraudsters trick people into giving their credentials to bogus websites; a second is through the increasing importance of security usability; and a third comes through the psychology-and-economics tradition. The promise of this multidisciplinary research programme is a novel framework for analysing information security problems\u2014one that is both principled and effective.\n      </p>", "The authors examine whether the administrative location of an economics department in a business versus liberal arts school alters the character of the economics program provided to undergraduate majors. To test this hypothesis, they constructed a curricular character index (CCI) based on a detailed accounting of assorted dimensions of an economics major. The CCI served as the dependent variable in a regression model that controlled for other institutional attributes that could influence curricular character. The sample of 148 primarily undergraduate institutions was selected to impose some semblance of a \"ceteris paribus\" environment. Contrary to earlier findings, the empirical results strongly indicate that the administrative location of an economics department in business versus liberal arts schools significantly changes the character of the program offered to majors.\n      </p>", "In 1995 and 2000, the authors surveyed academic economists in the United States to establish how economics is taught in four types of undergraduate courses. The authors report overall findings from the 2000 survey and compare these results with the aggregate findings for respondents from all types of colleges and universities in the 1995 survey. The basic finding is that, despite some indications of increased emphasis and interest in teaching over this period, the teaching methods in these courses have changed very little over the past five years and are still dominated by \"chalk and talk\" classroom presentations.\n      </p>", "Experimental economics and social psychology share an interest in a widening subset of topics, relying on similar lab-based methods to address similar questions about human behavior, yet dialogue between the two fields remains in its infancy. We propose a framework for understanding this disconnect: The different approaches the disciplines take to translating real-world behavior into the laboratory create a \"gap in abstraction,\" which contributes to crucial differences in philosophy about the roles of deception and incentives in experiments and limits cross-pollination. We review two areas of common interest--altruism and group-based discrimination--which demonstrate this gap yet also reveal ways in which the two approaches might be seen as complementary rather than contradictory.\n      </p>", "The author describes an introductory economics course in which all of the reading material is drawn from the Great Books of Western Civilization.

Their call for more open debate on \"the relative strengths and limitations of the DCE method, particularly when applied in health settings\" is warranted. However, their paper has only added to part of this debate in that it focuses on the application of choice experiments in the health sector but says little on the strengths and limitations of the DCE method in general. We argue that while the criticisms posed by Bryan and Dolan rightly challenge the manner in which DCEs have been applied in health economics, such criticism does not challenge the theoretical/methodological basis of DCEs per se.\n      </p>", "There is a wide variety of ethical arguments for public financing of health care that share a common structure built on a series of four logically related propositions regarding: (1) the ultimate purpose of a human life or human society; (2) the role of health and its distribution in society in advancing this ultimate purpose; (3) the role of access to or utilisation of health care in maintaining or improving the desired level and distribution of health among members of society, and (4) the role of public financing in ensuring the ethically justified access to and utilisation of health care by members of society. This paper argues that economics has much to contribute to the development of the ethical foundations for publicly financed health care. It focuses in particular on recent economic work to clarify the concepts of access and need and their role in analyses of the just distribution of health care resources, and on the importance of economic analysis of health care and health care insurance markets in demonstrating why public financing is necessary to achieve broad access to and utilisation of health care services.\n      </p>", "The relationship between political economy and population economics involves many important issues such as the roles of voters, interest groups, families, and social policy.

This editorial explores four sets of issues facing researchers who wish to employ DCE techniques: (a) normative issues about how data from DCE studies might be used to inform policy, (b) psychological issues concerning the meaningfulness of the data generated, (d) technical issues relating to how the data are generated and (d) issues relating to the generalisability of the data from DCE studies. Given current uncertainties surrounding these issues, it is our view that more caution and greater circumspection towards DCE is appropriate at this stage.\n      </p>", "Economists have lately been called upon not only to analyze markets, but to design them. Market design involves a responsibility for detail, a need to deal with all of a market's complications, not just its principle features. Designers therefore cannot work only with the simple conceptual models used for theoretical insights into the general working of markets. Instead, market design calls for an engineering approach. Drawing primarily on the design of the entry level labor market for American doctors (the National Resident Matching Program), and of the auctions of radio spectrum conducted by the Federal Communications Commission, this paper makes the case that experimental and computational economics are natural complements to game theory in the work of design. The paper also argues that some of the challenges facing both markets involve dealing with related kinds of complementarities, and that this suggests an agenda for future theoretical research.\n      </p>", "Although sludge management costs constitute an important part of wastewater treastment costs, data on the economics of sludge handling and disposal have been inadequate or inconsistent.

Bayesian decision theory and economic surplus analysis have been suggested as possible approaches to evaluate that information. This article takes a critical look at the strengths and weaknesses of combining those approaches for empirical evaluation of agricultural economics research. It presents three case studies, utilizing prior and posterior probabilities elicited from key decision makers. Direct application of the probabilities to a simple set of states and actions is best suited to situations involving a single policy-making center, or a consensus decision-making process.\n      </p>", "The author discusses the following seven issues affecting assessment of undergraduates in universities: decisionmaking and the selection of tests, the use of written and oral assignments to measure learning, the characteristics of grades and portfolios for evaluating students, opportunities for self-assessment and feedback to instructors, retention of learning and the testing for higher-ordered thinking, the psychology of students in the economics classroom, and the development of new tests as public goods.

It opens up the \"black box\" of the brain, much as organizational economics opened up the theory of the firm. Neuroscientists use many tools-including brain imaging, behavior of patients with brain damage, animal behavior and recording single neuron activity. The key insight for economics is that the brain is composed of multiple systems which interact. Controlled systems (\"executive function\") interrupt automatic ones. Brain evidence complicates standard assumptions about basic preference, to include homeostasis and other kinds of state-dependence, and shows emotional activation in ambiguous choice and strategic interaction.\n      </p>", "The authors present the initial development of a student learning inventory (SLI) that is specific to economics. This approach, which is based on the student experience of learning (SEL) literature, emphasizes aspects of prior knowledge in the learning history of entering first-year students. Preliminary insights from a first SLI suggest that on entry to university, students show considerable variation in their perceptions of what economics is and what economists do. From the SEL perspective, such variation affects student learning. It is argued that continued development of an economic-specific SLI may result in a better understanding of students' learning engagement with economics and ultimately assist instructors in better understanding student learning difficulties and increase student success in first-year economics.\n      </p>", "L.

The paper then questions whether or not policy makers should trouble to engage in inflation targeting. It is shown that there does exist a Post Keynesian case for inflation targeting, but that the appropriate inflation target that emerges from Post Keynesian economics suggests that far too much attention is currently being paid to inflation and that more of policy makers' attention should be devoted to output (and, by extension, employment) targeting.\n      </p>", "We are now suffering through economic problems that are worse than those that buffeted us 35 years ago, when the Eastern Economic Association was born. Since then, we have not made a great deal of progress toward methods of observation and analysis that would make economics a truly empirical science and would provide a means to better policy. Much if not most of the profession is still mired in the traditional ways of doing micro (sitting in a chair and making it up) and macro (pretending the economy is a single person, writ large). Factionalism in the profession, based on political leanings, is still rife. Behavioral and experimental economists assume we can learn what we need to know about businesses from watching students playing games made up by their professors.

The belief that economies run according to universal \"laws of motion,\" however, is shown to be based on a variety of rationalist thinking that -- while widely held -- is inadequate for explaining lived human experience. Feminist scholarship in the philosophy of science and economics has brought to light some of the biases that have supported the mechanistic worldview. Possible alternatives to the \"an economy is a machine\" include \"an economy is a creative process\" and \"an economy is an organism.\" Such metaphors are intellectually defensible as guides to scientific inquiry and provide a richer ground for moral imagination.\n      </p>", "The importance of evaluating multiple resource values on rangelands is demonstrated in this study of California's 3.0 million hectares of oak-covered (Quercus spp.) hardwood rangelands.

Hunting revenue and cost functions are derived from a survey of commercial hunting clubs, and are based on oak cover, hunter success variables, hunter demographics, advertising, livestock density, and club size. The interrelationship of these resource values is shown in output from an optimal control model that incorporates these production functions. Oak trees are gradually cleared for situations where cattle are the only economic product, whereas a residual tree canopy is maintained for cases where firewood and hunting enterprises are considered. In addition, cattle stocking is higher and net profitability is lower for the cattle only management scenario when compared with a multiple use management scenario. The development of these multiple use production functions allows the full range of resource management options to be considered.\n      </p>", "Computer simulation was used to determine the effects of wild elk (Cervus elaphus) on available forage, cattle herd size, and ranch gross margin in southwestern Montana beef cow-calf production systems. Data collected from 5 southwestern Montana ranches were used to develop input parameters for bio-economic models of elk forage harvest and beef production. Input parameters described ranch resources, animal inventories, and animal management. Cattle herd size ranged from 241 to 1147 head. Elk numbers varied by season within ranch and ranged from 49 to 421 head. Ranches were simulated as currently managed with elk present and with 10, 20, 30, and 100% of the elk removed. Simulated management scenarios were replicated 10 times. Data from each ranch were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. Cattle herd size, gross margin, and available forage significantly (P &lt; 0.05) increased when all elk were removed; however, the magnitude of these effects differed among ranches. Removal of all elk permitted cattle herd size to increase from 7 to 32% across ranches. Annual costs of elk on the 5 ranches (i.e., increase in gross margin from elk removal) ranged from $5,949 to $21,152. On an AUM basis, elk costs ranged from $8.55 to $14.51. Three management alternatives were evaluated for their potential to recover elk costs: Montana's Block Management Program, coordinated exchange of forage use, and leasing of hunting access. For each ranch, at least one of these management strategies could recover all estimated costs of providing elk habitat. Elk can significantly reduce profits for cow-calf ranches in southwestern Montana. Elk impacts on beef enterprise profits are closely associated with efficiency of resource use by cattle-i.e., ranches with lower unit costs of production lose more gross margin by providing forage for elk compared to ranches with higher production costs. /// Simulaci\u00f3n por computadora fue usada para determinar los efectos del alce silvestre (Cervus elaphus) en forraje disponible, tama\u00f1o del hato de ganado, y margen bruto del rancho en sistemas de producci\u00f3n vaca- becerro en el suroeste de Montana. Los datos recolectados de 5 ranchos del suroeste de Montana fueron usados para desarrollar par\u00e1metros de entrada para modelos bio-econ\u00f3micos del consumo de forraje del alce y la producci\u00f3n de ganado de carne. Los par\u00e1metros de entrada describieron los recursos del rancho, inventario y manejo de animales. El tama\u00f1o del hato de ganado vari\u00f3 de 241 a 1147 cabezas. El n\u00famero de alces vari\u00f3 por temporada en el rancho y fluctu\u00f3 entre 49 a 421 cabezas. Los ranchos fueron simulados tanto como si el alce estuviera presente como si este hubiera sido retirado de los mismos. Escenarios de administraci\u00f3n simulados fueron repetidos 10 veces. Los datos fueron analizados por procedimientos de m\u00ednimos cuadrados, contabilizando los efectos del alce. El tama\u00f1o del hato de ganado, el margen bruto, y el forraje disponible increment\u00f3 significativamente (P &lt; 0.05) cuando los alces fueron retirados; aunque la magnitud de estos efectos fue diferente entre ranchos. El retirar todos los alces permiti\u00f3 que el tama\u00f1o del hato de ganado se incrementara de 7 a 32% entre los diferentes ranchos. Los costos anuales del alce en los 5 ranchos (e.g., incremento en el margen bruto por el retiro del alce) variaron de US$ 5,949 a US$ 21,152. Sobre la base de unidades animal por mes (UAM), los costos del alce variaron de US$ 8.55 a US$ 14.51. Tres alternativas de manejo fueron evaluadas por su potencial para recuperar los costos del alce: programa de administraci\u00f3n por bloque de Montana, intercambio coordinado de uso de forraje, y renta por acceso a la caza del alce. Para cada rancho, al menos una de estas estrategias podr\u00eda recuperar todos los costos estimados de proveer un h\u00e1bitat para el alce. El alce puede reducir significativamente las ganancias de ranchos vacabecerro en el suroeste de Montana. Los efectos del alce en empresas de ganado de carne est\u00e1n asociados con la eficiencia del uso de los recursos por el ganado (e.g., ranchos con bajos costos unitarios de producci\u00f3n pierden mas margen bruto al proveer forraje para el alce, comparados con ranchos con altos costos de producci\u00f3n).\n      </p>", "The publication records (1980-1986) of U.S. Ph.D.-granting economics departments are used to rank departments in industrial economics. Princeton, Cal Tech, Harvard, Yale, and Northwestern demonstrate the strongest and most consistent publishing performances. Also examined are the departmental publication records in each of the 16 subfields of industrial economics and the publication records of the leading individual researchers. The results indicate that the overall reputation of a department does not always reflect faculty strength in industrial economics.\n      </p>", "The study of capital structure has increasingly gained importance in strategic management research. Paradigms derived from organizational economics have also gained popularity in explaining firm actions. Agency theory and transaction cost economics represent two such paradigms that rely on the notion of market imperfections. Notwithstanding the similarities between them, these two offer different explanations of the role of debt and equity in a firm. The governance abilities of the financing structures and the nature of assets of the firm provide two key sources of differences. Viewing capital structure from transaction cost economics gives rise to predictions that are contradictory to those presented by agency theory. It is argued that the extant evidence mainly supports the transaction cost viewpoint. Two organizational phenomena-leveraged buyouts and product diversification-are used to highlight the comparison.\n      </p>", "Thorstein Veblen is the acknowledged founder of the original (old) institutional economics (OIE). Later contributors include John R. Commons, Clarence Ayres, Walton Hamilton, Rexford Tugwell, and, it is argued, John Kenneth Galbraith. Galbraith's insistence that economics address the social predicament and pass the \"test of anxiety\" is consistent with the pragmatism of OIE. Indeed, Galbraith epitomizes the OIE in his blending social scientist with social reformer. Galbraith's treatment of technology and institutions is reminiscent of Veblen's celebrated dichotomy, as is his emphasis on power and the \"conventional wisdom,\" and his insistence that the social economy is ever evolving, whereby the economic problem is not static but processual, which mandates continuous social reform efforts.\n      </p>", "We present three classroom exercises designed to explore issues of fairness and equity in economics. In each exercise, students put economics in context as they consider the art of economics in addition to the science. The active learning nature of the exercises involves students as they consider (1) the free-rider problem, (2) the contrast between democratic and free-market ideals, and (3) externalities. Each exercise, including discussion, will fit into a 50-minute class period. The author has used the exercises in introductory microeconomics courses, in classes of 30 to 50 students.\n      </p>", "The authors examine the effectiveness of different teaching techniques using a unique data set that allows them to match student and instructor characteristics to assess their impact on students' interest in economics. They find that devoting less class time to lecture and more to discussion is effective for all types of students. However, the magnitude of the effects of these two techniques varies considerably by type of student, as does the impact of several other teaching techniques. They conclude that using a variety of teaching techniques is the most successful strategy to appeal to the broad range of learning styles adopted by \"good\" students.\n      </p>", "The author analyzes the types of metaphors that are used to describe the Internet in issues of Wired magazine from before and after the dot-com collapse to understand the perceptions and expectations of some of the actors involved in the shaping of the Internet. In addition, the metaphors deployed in economics and geophysiology are used to demonstrate how metaphors can influence public debate, policy, and theory. The author argues that metaphors do not simply have a descriptive function but that they also carry normative connotations. Language, alongside social practices and material objects, is an important tool in attempts to construct the future. Six overlapping metaphorical themes are identified: revolution, evolution, salvation, progress, universalism, and the \"American dream.\" A critical analysis of these metaphors, informed by a critique of the metaphors used in economics and geophysiology, leads the author to challenge the universalist claims made by some Internet enthusiasts for the inclusive potential of the Internet.\n      </p>", "This editorial provides a review of the current ways in which health economics is impacting on policy and reviews some of the key ethical and value-judgmental issues that commonly arise in and as a result of the work of economists. It also briefly highlights the contributions of the authors of this special issue of the journal, all of which illustrate how economists have approached ethical issues in health service policy (both in its financing and its delivery), and some of which explore the major methodological matters that arise and go on to discuss their potential as sources of conflict or harmony with other approaches to the same questions.\n      </p>", "This paper interprets Weintraub's book, How Economics Became a Mathematical Science, to suggest why Keynes's General Theory has never had any real impact on the theories and models proposed by rigorous mainstream economic theorists. What is meant by \"rigor\" and \"proof\" in mathematical analysis? Mathematicians' and economists' views about these concepts keep changing. Debreu taught economists about axiomatics, formalism, and rigor as the Bourbaki mathematicians reconstructed the meaning of these terms. As a result, mainstream economic theory has lost any connection with the real world. Weintraub's analysis shows that the mathematical scientist emperor of mainstream economics is without clothes.\n      </p>", "This article reviews Bob Tollison's conjoint contributions to the burgeoning area of the economics of religion, underscoring his integration of public choice and interestgroup themes into the microeconomic analysis of faith-based organizational architecture, institutional decision making and doctrinal innovation. Beginning with study of the medieval Catholic Church, moving forward to the Protestant Reformation and beyond, it supplies a timeline of developments and the major findings of each phase of his research program.\n      </p>", "Kenneth Boulding, in \"A Reconstruction of Economics\" (1950) for a population perspective as the foundation of economic theory, argued that a reconstruction of economics is required to address the problem of true uncertainty. The microeconomic side of this argument is elaborated here, exploring the limitations of marginal analysis in the face of uncertain windfall gains and losses. A comparison of renewable and nonrenewable resource populations demonstrates that potential windfall gains and losses may bias decision-making, despite true uncertainty regarding their likelihood. This approach is shown to be related to Keynes's analysis of liquidity preference in the face of true uncertainty.\n      </p>", "This paper was prepared as concluding remarks presented at a symposium, \"Ecological economics: building a new paradigm for sustainability,\" organized by R.

Undergraduate enrollments increased significantly while graduate enrollments were unchanged on average. Overall, agricultural economics departments became much larger relative to the average size of colleges of agriculture. Despite some changes in expectations concerning future growth areas, most programs appear to have been successful in meeting students' demands.\n      </p>", "Transaction cost economics (TCE) is one of the leading perspectives in management and organizational studies, yet debate continues regarding its empirical support. In this paper, we take stock of the large body of extant research and provide a systematic assessment of empirical evidence. In all, 308 statistical tests from 63 articles, selected according to a set of clear criteria, were examined across various dimensions. We assess not only the level of empirical support for the theory, but also the degree of paradigm consensus present in the empirical literature. Our analysis shows that results are mixed: while we found support in some areas (e.g., with regard to asset specificity), we also found considerable disagreement on how to operationalize some of TCE's central constructs and propositions, and relatively low levels of empirical support in other core areas (e.g., surrounding uncertainty and performance). We conclude that a more thorough empirical grounding of the theory's foundation is crucial to its future development, and offer several strategies for doing this.\n      </p>", "This article examines the economics of institutions approach which purports to explain the rise of sovereign territorial states as the prevalent unit in the international system. According to this institutional analysis, sovereign territorial states emerged as the dominant unit because they were more efficient than other political arrangements in the international system. This argument frames the failure of most non-western policies to become sovereign territorial states by the beginning of the twentieth century as an instance in which institutional structures were effective neither at meeting individuals' goals, nor at resolving collective action dilemmas, particularly with regard to security and economic exchange. Applying that argument to a nineteenth-century African kingdom, I find that the factors which explain the assigning of colonial, not sovereign, status to that kingdom are of a traditional economic origin, with cultural biases and relative military capability coming into play when economic competition tightened.\n      </p>", "The authors examined the potential differences between problem-based learning (PBL) and traditional instructional approaches in building knowledge of macroeconomic concepts and principles in high school students. Using data from 252 economics students at 11 high schools and controlling for individual characteristics, most notably verbal ability, they found modest evidence that, in the aggregate, PBL increased learning of macroeconomics at the high school level as compared with traditional classes. They found strong evidence of an instructional interaction with teachers such that, for some teachers, students' learning of macroeconomics increased using PBL but, for others, learning increased using more traditional instructional methods. Still other teachers saw no significant difference in learning under the two instructional strategies. The results suggest that problem-based instruction can improve student learning if instructors who are well trained in both the PBL technique and economics implement it.\n      </p>", "The implications of separability in production are examined using duality. Restrictions on the profit function implied by separability of the production function, and vice versa, are derived in a simple way. These restrictions are then calculated for commonly used classes of functional forms. Then the method is used to test separability of the profit function using experimental production data. The hypothesis that the profit function was separable (plant nutrients from spacing unit costs) could not be rejected. This implies that an aggregate price index for nutrients is appropriate.\n      </p>", "Israel M. Kirzner is the 2006 winner of The International Award for Entrepreneurship and Small Business Research. In this essay, we present and evaluate his main contributions to the economics of entrepreneurship. The focus is on how Kirzner defines the entrepreneurial function. In order to better understand his theory, we posit Kirzner's notion of an entrepreneur in the Austrian tradition. In so doing we emphasize that this concept opens up different perspectives as compared to the neoclassical theoretical framework. The three areas of economic policy, justice and freedom, and economic growth are discussed. We also show why the Kirznerian entrepreneur makes these issues relevant. Perhaps most importantly, Kirzner has made the Austrian School intelligible for non- Austrians. By bridging the chasm between Austrian and mainstream thinking, the crucial role of entrepreneurship and the individual entrepreneur has become visible to a much broader audience.\n      </p>", "The author has chosen three major topics in development economics for a discussion on how to teach the subject: the concepts and measurement of development, models of growth and development, and the international aspects of economic development. For the concepts of development, it is important to emphasize the coherence of the topics to be studied. In teaching models of growth and development, he suggests that the classical models, the Marxian model, the Harrod-Domar models, and the Neoclassical model be discussed in the context of technology versus capital as a major determinant of growth and development. The role of labor, employment, and human capital would be discussed in the context of the Lewis-Ranis-Fei model, the Harris-Todaro model, and the New Growth theory. The international aspects should be given due emphasis in the economic development syllabus with a thorough discussion on trade, investment, and finance in this connection.\n      </p>", "Departments use student evaluations of teaching (SETs) with little evidence that evaluation forms and procedures measure or contribute to teaching quality. SETs in agricultural economics and related departments in the United States and Canada are examined here in a resource allocation framework. Empirical models are estimated which characterize faculty reliance on SETs and faculty satisfaction with SET forms. We find that departmental reliance on SETs increases with faculty participation, that faculty have specific preferences for SET form and content, and that improvements in SETs are more likely to result from increasing the quality rather than the quantity of SET questions.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Maximum animal production would have occurred at a stocking rate greater than any imposed in the study in all years except 1982. Increased variable costs should drive stocking rates down while increased selling price would provide an incentive to increase stocking rates. Mean grazing time of animals stocked at light, moderate, and heavy rates was 410, 436, and 504 minutes/day, respectively. Mean resting time was 206, 174, and 106 minutes/day, respectively. Rams under light, moderate, and heavy stocking rates walked 2.1, 2.4, and 3.1 km/day, respectively. Diet IVDMD was highest early in the grazing season and lowest in the nongrowing season, and was not affected by stocking rates. Early in the spring, diet diversity was low, increased during active growth, and then declined as the season advanced. Selectivity was lowest when forage was abundant. Dry matter intake varied with season in 1985 but not 1986. There was less opportunity to be adaptive under heavy than under light stocking, resulting in a stocking rate by season interaction in 1986. Under heavy stocking, forage intake (G/kg LW/min) was 61 and 83% of intake under light and moderate stocking, respectively, and forage intake per km walked was 71 and 84%, respectively.\n      </p>", "1. Leaf life span (LLS) is one of the traits involved in the leaf economics spectrum (ranging from fast acquisition to efficient conservation of resources). How it relates to nutrient resorption efficiency (REFF), another key component of resource conservation, is still under debate. Here we test how leaf traits related to leaf economy, mass loss during senescence and REFF covary among species differing in resource use, and how they respond to nitrogen limitation. 2. Leaf traits were assessed for 18 species differing in successional status and in resource use, grown in a common-garden experiment under limiting and non-limiting N supply. 3. As expected, leaf traits and nutrient REFF vary with species successional status: early successional species have high rates of resource acquisition with high specific leaf area and live-leaf phosphorus concentrations, whereas late successional species have an efficient nutrient conservation with long LLS and high nutrient REFF. Leaf life span decreased under non-limiting N conditions, while nitrogen REFF was unchanged. 4. Leaf mass loss can alter assessment of nutrient REFF. Nutrient REFF was controlled by nutrient concentration in dead leaves and hence represents a process, distinct from leaf longevity, that leads to resource conservation.\n      </p>", "This paper introduces the important concept of a biophysical perspective on economics into the business ethics literature. The biophysical perspective recognizes that ecological processes determine what can be done in an economy and how best to do it. A biophysical perspective places the economic system into a larger context of the ecologic system. This changes the perception of ethical issues by identifying a larger scope of management decisions. The paper examines the changing ethical landscape in such issues as biotechnology, planned obsolescence, productivity, and international trade. The paper also examines the shift in mindset associated with the shift in economic framework. It draws on the literature on cognitive structures and moral imagination to show this new perspective can actually raise the bar for ethical decision-making and behavior. The pattern is that the ethical behavior associated with a biophysical economic framework has a greater scope of responsibility with the benefit that the required ethical behavior leads to better long-term decision making.\n      </p>"], "words": {"essay": {"number": 3, "prob": 2.4843794641193497e-05}, "all": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "concept": {"number": 1, "prob":
