It was selected by the editor as having the information for the widest audience of this Journal. The chapter includes two topics. The first encourages teachers to convert current lecture materials to Web-ready formats and use these for in-classroom lecture presentations. The second deals with issues of creating multimedia classrooms.\n      </p>", "The trend towards Multimedia technology in Education is exemplified by the growing number of \"multimedia ready\" classrooms. Besides using the conventional computer-based training techniques, courseware has included multimedia capabilities, such as graphics, sound, animation, and video clips. This paper illustrates the development of such multimedia courseware. Additionally, this courseware employs sound instructional and learning strategies; thereby making the courseware not only educational, but also captivating. The other unique feature of the courseware is its adaptability. Teachers who are not computer experts can use the \"Teacher\" module to modify and add content to the courseware. By selecting the predefined objects, and/or filling in a form, the teachers can create simple animation by using the module. Another good feature is the ease of customizing the content in different languages. This is illustrated by the translation of a module in CHEMMAT into Chinese.\n      </p>", "There are a series of issues that people designing multimedia for educational purposes should consider. These include, among others, the salience of the voice of the author, the balance between the seductive nature of the medium and the substantive content of the message, and the way(s) in which the navigational tools either promote or constrain the learening and teaching of the content. This paper explores some of these questions and suggests how the answers to them depend on the pedagogic ideology and philosophy of the creators of the software.\n      </p>", "Multimedia content is a central component of on-demand training and education delivered over the World Wide Web. Supporting asynchronous collaboration around educational multimedia is potentially a significant tool for delivering online educational content effectively. A multimedia annotation system tightly integrated with e-mail provides a powerful platform on which to base such functionality. In this paper we describe a series of studies of such a system. First, we built a prototype annotation system and refined it based on results of laboratory tests. We then extended the system to support asynchronous collaboration for on-demand training and studied its effectiveness in two corporate training courses, assessing student experience, instructor experience, and user interface appropriateness. Having identified possibilities for enhancing engagement and collaboration with the tool, we conducted another set of laboratory studies. Through this iterative process we are creating a platform and identifying processes for its use, which enable students and instructors to exploit the advantages of asynchronous education while compensating for the reduction in face-to-face interaction.\n      </p>", "Text is the predominant form of organizational information. Comprehending text-based information requires intensive cognitive processing effort on the part of readers. Drawing on multimedia literature, this study identified a characteristic of multimedia presentations, namely complementary cues, which have the potential to improve the comprehensibility of organizational information. A set of hypotheses about the benefits of multimedia over text-based presentations was generated based on the theoretical perspective that we developed. These predictions were tested through a laboratory experiment using a simulated multimedia intranet. Results show that multimedia facilitates the retention and subsequent recall of explanative information but not of descriptive information. Explanative information is organized facts connected by their underlying functional relationships. Descriptive information consists of isolated facts without an explanation of the relationships between these facts. The ability to retain and recall explanative information, in turn, leads to a greater ability to make correct inferences about new organizational situations.\n      </p>", "Technology has changed drastically in the last few decades and is profoundly affecting the way in which geography is recorded, studied, and communicated. One of the developments affecting the discipline is multimedia, the use of more than one medium-text, still graphics, sound, animation, video-to represent and convey information. Interactive multimedia gives the user control over the order in which to see or hear that information. In its current use, multimedia implies the use of a computer and almost always implies interactivity as well. While multimedia opens doors for geographers to discover and communicate, it also raises issues of cost, control, effectiveness, accessibility, and potential negative intellectual outcomes. Like other technological developments, it will have an impact. We can pay attention to it, guiding its use and lessening its negative effects, but we cannot and should not stop its development.\n      </p>", "How can animation be used to promote learner understanding of scientific and mathematical explanations? In this review, we examine the role of animation in multimedia learning (including multimedia instructional messages and microworld games), present a cognitive theory of multimedia learning, and summarize our program of research, which has yielded seven principles for the use of animation in multimedia instruction. These include the multimedia principle (present animation and narration rather than narration alone), spatial contiguity principle (present on-screen text near rather than far from corresponding animation), temporal contiguity principle (present corresponding animation and narration simultaneously rather than successively), coherence principle (exclude extraneous words, sounds, and video), modality principle (present animation and narration rather than animation and on-screen text), redundancy principle (present animation and narration rather than animation, narration, and on-screen text), and personalization principle (present words in conversational rather than formal style). Animation can promote learner understanding when used in ways that are consistent with the cognitive theory of multimedia learning.\n      </p>", "Multimedia INfOrmation Systems (MINOS) manage largely unformatted data such as text, image, voice, attributes, and programs. This paper presents the motivation, the hardware tools, the important issues, and the problems involved in the design and implementation of a multimedia object server testbed. The testbed will allow us to study the impact of various design decisions and algorithms on system performance, the most successful of which will be integrated in the final implementation of distributed MINOS. The distributed architecture proposed is based on the client server model, where an optical disk-based subsystem serves as the archivai component and where the presentation manager of the client subsystem includes handling of the internal structure, external logical organization, and browsing through multimedia objects.\n      </p>", "In this paper, we explore how the application of multimedia design principles may inform the development of educational multi-user virtual environments (MUVEs). We look at design principles that have been shown to help learners manage cognitive load within multimedia environments and conduct a conjectural analysis of the extent to which such principles can help manage cognitive load in the highly immersive \"beyond multimedia\" environments that 3-D educational MUVEs represent. We frame our discussion as a design practice analysis of the River City MUVE, a science inquiry environment that has middle school students collaborating to develop and test hypotheses regarding illnesses sweeping a virtual town. We analyze the current River City interface design using a framework describing cognitive overload scenarios and associated approaches to manage cognitive load. We also discuss the potential difficulties that may be seen as multimedia principles are applied to 3-D MUVEs. Our discussion describes a blueprint for research implementations that we are undertaking to systematically investigate the effect of an educational MUVE interface design based on multimedia principles\u2014implementations that we hope will provide an action framework for other MUVE researchers to use in their own studies.\n      </p>", "An increasing number of computer applications today use multimedia content such as images, sound, and video over distributed networks of computers. Often, a dispersed set of users, with varying demands, requires ongoing access to tins content. Effective placement of th\u00e8 multimedia content at diff\u00e9rent locations/processors thus becomes essential to ensure acceptable quality of service at a reasonable cost. Achieving this requires the consid\u00e9ration of a set of issues quite diff\u00e9rent from that required for traditional data distribution. These include (a) scale, both in terms of individuai objects and in aggregate, (b) importance of form or appearance, making resolution levels an important, controllable variable, and (c) the temporal dimension, placing stringent demands on response time. These concerns make distribution of multimedia content more than a straightforward extension of traditional distribution approaches. We develop a model and a supporting approach to facilitate effective distribution of multimedia content, focusing on multimedia applications in corporate intranets. The model consists of multiple criteria to reflect different aspects of quality of service and cost which we formulate by leveraging variance in resolution levels to capture trade-offs among these criteria. Since the multiple-criteria allocation model is NP-complete, we propose a d\u00e9cision support approach that g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e2tes locally efficient solutions using designer-specified targets and evaluates them using fuzzy-set-based heuristics. The complete model and the approach have been implemented in a prototype to ensure feasibility. We demonstrate use of the prototype for a m\u00e9dical imaging application that illustrates applicability and usefulness of our proposais.\n      </p>", "Expert systems and multimedia are being incorporated into organizations at increasing rates because, while being independently developed, they possess capabilities appropriate for integration with each other. This paper examines the potential for such integration, providing support to users beyond the capabilities of each independently used technology. An integrated system, essential to the city of Los Angeles during the 1992 riots and the 1994 earthquake, is examined to demonstrate the usefulness and benefits of expert systems and multimedia integration. The potential for this integration is further explored by examining issues related to an integration framework where the two technologies support each other. Three integrated prototype systems are reviewed to promote the legitimacy of expert systems and multimedia integration. Preliminary findings conclude that this integration will offer benefits to various applications.\n      </p>", "With the advent of multimedia and intranet technologies, managers and information systems designers face a new challenge: how to capture and present information using a variety of representation formats (text, graphics, audio, video, and animations) so that members of an organization can make better sense out of the information available. In this study, we develop a task-representation fit model to generate several predictions about the potential of multimedia to alleviate the limitations of text-based information in the context of individual decision makers utilizing organizational data and test them in a laboratory experiment. Results support the task-representation fit relationships predicted. For analyzable tasks, text-based representation and multimedia representation are equally effective in reducing perceived equivocality levels. For less-analyzable tasks, only multimedia representation was instrumental in reducing perceived equivocality levels.\n      </p>", "Strong movements in both education research and education reform are emphasizing that teaching should encourage student activity rather than simply aim knowledge in the general direction of a student audience. Yet video, at least in its traditional technological forms, is passive. How can teachers make effective use of an apparently ineffective medium? What role can video best play in new multimedia instructional systems? This article reviews research on learning through television in order to make practical suggestions. Specific examples use two widely distributed series, Against All Odds: Inside Statistics and Statistics: Decisions Through Data.\n      </p>", "This study investigated the relationship of cognitive and demographic variables to learning outcomes from a multimedia Goal-Based Scenario (GBS) lesson on DNA. The demographic variables under investigation were gender, ethnicity, prior science coursework in college and high school, final score in current chemistry course, and prior experience with computers. The cognitive variables under study were logical thinking ability, spatial ability, and disembedding ability. The subjects for this study were a total of 488 college students enrolled in introductory chemistry classes for nonmajors at one of four participating institutions in the United States and Canada. All subjects completed content pre-and posttests, a demographic questionnaire, and three cognitive tests: Test of Logical Thinking, Hidden Figures Test, and Purdue Visualization of Rotations Test. Students completed Whodunnit?, a multimedia GBS developed to teach basic biochemistry concepts pertaining to DNA. Logical thinking ability was the only cognitive variable to show a relationship with learning outcomes. There was no relationship between gender or ethnicity and academic outcomes. The number of science courses completed in high school was a significant predictor of academic outcomes. A relationship was observed between course rank and learning outcomes, as students with final course grades in the upper quartile of the sample scored significantly higher on the posttest than those in all other quartiles.\n      </p>", "While interest in interactive multimedia continues to grow, thus far its activities have been driven more by technological capacity than research and theory. Typically, guidelines for interactive multimedia design are based not upon empirical evidence, but on the intuitive beliefs of designers. In this article, relevant research and theory are organized within an overarching framework, and their principles and implications for the design of interactive multimedia are derived.\n      </p>", "Successful implementation of IT-enabled change requires good management of the change process and of the various sources of resistance that typically accompany the introduction of such change. As a result, helping managers better understand the dynamics of organizational processes is an important objective for IS and IT educators. The EIS Simulation is a new computer-based multimedia simulation that allows managers to experience the process of introducing an EIS in a fictitious organization. It has been used extensively over the last two years with groups of management students and executives. The paper presents the simulation and discusses its potential pedagogical benefits, possible extensions, and use in a research context. More generally, the EIS Simulation provides a first step in the development of a new generation of pedagogical tools: computer-based organizational games exploiting the potential of multimedia and object-oriented technology to provide managers with realistic experiential learning environments.\n      </p>", "In this article, I offer evaluation criteria for librarians, teachers, parents, and others who are responsible for selecting and providing multicultural multimedia materials (text, sound, and graphics). These criteria can be used to evaluate multicultural content in the context of building library collections, developing programs and readers' advisories, providing Internet links or bookmarking World Wide Web pages, weeding collections, and other activities that entail the assessment of the quality of multicultural multimedia. Previously published guidelines and criteria available to evaluate multicultural materials, whether print or multimedia, were developed for specific types of materials, audiences, or multicultural content and, as such, are limited in their usefulness. The proposed criteria require the examination of four components: objectivity, language, subject mastery, and resources. These criteria are designed to be applied broadly in evaluating multicultural content of any multimedia, for any audience and level of coverage, and in any language.\n      </p>", "Zale Corporation once melted down most of its damaged, returned, or repossessed jewelry, resulting in substantial lost revenues. It was determined that additional revenue could be produced from salvageable jewelry if the value of the items could be accurately determined. This meant the jewelry had to be appraised by experienced gemologists to determine the most profitable disposition. The gemologists' productivity suffered because the appraisal was extremely labor intensive. To address this problem, an automated multimedia system utilizing electronically linked measuring instruments, voice recognition, and interconnected LAN databases was developed. Although the unique voice recognition feature of the system was later abandoned, the use of the system enhanced productivity. This paper describes the systems development, its subsequent evolution, and the lessons learned from the process.\n      </p>", "This research explores how multimedia vividness and the use of computer-based social cues can influence involvement with technology and decision-making outcomes. An experiment is conducted that examines the effect that increased levels of vividness (text, voice, and animation) and decision aid personality have on decision-making involvement. In addition, the influence of two individual differences, gender and computer playfulness, on decision aid involvement are investigated. The cost-benefit framework of decision making and related research on consumer information processing provide the theoretical foundation for the study and suggest how increased involvement may influence decision making. Several decision-making outcomes are measured, including decision effort, decision quality, satisfaction with the decision aid, and understanding of the decision aid. Findings indicate that personality similarity (between the user and the decision aid) and computer playfulness result in increased involvement with the decision aid. In addition, women report higher levels of involvement with the decision aid. Increased levels of multimedia vividness are found to have a contradictory effect, with animation actually reducing involvement with the decision aid. The findings are discussed in terms of theoretical contributions and practical interface design implications.\n      </p>", "Multimedia exploration programs have diferent purposes than task-oriented computer-based training (CBT) programs. The multimedia learning process may be more important than its learning product, with the student accessing a rich base of information and symbol systems in a more idiosyncratic manner. The amount and structure of information in an exploratory environment also differs from task- or objectives-based programs. These process and structure differences necessitate special types of task analysis approaches. When meeting with the subject-matter expert, the instructional designer may find it helpful to use scenarios and knowledge mapping tools, and to employ variable consultation strategies. This article outlines some tools and tactics to facilitate the knowledge elicitation process in multimedia design by facilitating communication between the designer and subject matter expert (SME).\n      </p>", "This article is a review of the multimedia software package ActivStats for SPSS, a program that teaches introductory statistics concepts and methods using activities that contain narration and animation, video, simulation, and interactive experiments. Using evaluation criteria from the statistics education and instructional technology literature, we consider the usefulness of this software based on a framework of how students learn statistics. Our recommendations about how to best use ActivStats for introductory students as well as limitations of the review conclude the article.\n      </p>", "The World Wide Web and emerging multimedia tools and software provide students with unprecedented opportunities to comprehend authentic texts and learn new vocabulary by using and creating annotations with written and spoken text and visual information. The present study examines the effects of pictorial (videos, images) and verbal (Spanish definitions, English translations) glosses/annotations on vocabulary learning and comprehension of an authentic literary text. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: 1) control (without access to glosses), 2) choice-lookup (access to verbal and pictorial glosses), 3) forced-lookup (required to consult all available verbal and pictorial glosses). Choice and forced-lookup groups performed significantly better on the vocabulary test and summary than the control group. No statistically significant differences in performance were found between choice and forced-lookup groups.\n      </p>", "An empirical study was undertaken to evaluate second language learning with a videodisc named Vi-Conte. The 78 subjects were post-secondary students and adults and belonged either to a control group, a video-control group or an experimental group. The research methodology is presented as well as analyses of learners' navigational patterns, strategies, gains in vocabulary items, changes in attitude and global evaluation of the videodisc. Suggestions for the development of adaptive learning environments are made based on these findings.\n      </p>", "As part of NASA's overall plan to create increased learning opportunities related to its scientific and technical enterprises, we developed a successful model for research scientists to participate in educational content creation. We used this model to create multimedia resources designed to improve science and mathematics skills in students and improve public awareness of science through the results of the Hubble Space Telescope. The model places scientists in partnership with teachers, graphic artists, writers, and multimedia Web developers. Teams were led by professional content developers and multimedia production chiefs. We used a systematic production cycle including specification, project definition, frequent reviews, and several testing periods that has proven to generate robust but flexible resources. Local \" outreach\" scientists and other scientists drawn from the community participated in the content creation at various stages, with well specified roles. The model was used successfully to create curriculum support materials, a traveling museum exhibit, press releases, and a website for the public.\n      </p>", "When the Federal Communications Commission considered revamping its policies, many political activists argued that media conglomerates had failed to meet their duties to protect freedom of speech. Moveon's dispute with CBS over its proposed Superbowl advertisement and Michael Moore's quarrel over distribution of his documentary, Fahrenheit 911, are cases in point. In matters of pure entertainment, the public expect companies to avoid offensive programming. The press, on the other hand, may well be forced to offend some audience members in order to create a viable forum for political dissent. As journalism and entertainment are increasingly inter-linked, an in depth moral analysis of the media corporation and its obligations becomes increasingly important. I explore Kantian, Utilitarian, and Rawlsian analyses of corporate obligation in the aforementioned cases. I then examine whether or not these results suggest anything more generally about the sorts of mission statements and ethical policies that ought to be endorsed by media conglomerates and whether non-business institutions also require changes. Ultimately, I suggest that at a minimum, media institutions should view the duty to promote the representation of diverse views in a democracy as an imperfect moral and civic duty rather than making programming decisions solely by reference to profit. Ideally, greater access to media access should not be increased for the most powerful unless doing so at the same time increases free speech opportunities for those who currently have the least access.\n      </p>", "The objective of this paper is to discuss how active student learning is possible with the aid of a CAI package for a subject such as \"Strength of Materials.\" Multimedia is the latest innovation that can be utilized to improve learning. In this study, multimedia components such as hypertext, sound, graphics, video, and animation are implemented in a CAI package. These capabilities can capture students' attention, and can also illustrate the application of knowledge to real world problems more effectively than traditional teaching methods. The other features of this package include guided examples, theory, and application tests. Guided examples show the students problem solving techniques, and provide feedback according to their responses. The theory and application tests enable the teacher to gauge the students' understanding of the subject matter. Students who do well in the theory test are eligible to attempt the application test, which poses real-world engineering problems. The lesson that can be concluded from this study is that students' problem solving skills can be improved with the aid of CAI which emphasizes anchored instructions. However, to achieve maximum benefit, students also need to possess independent learning skills.\n      </p>", "Evaluation of online training is a necessity to its future as a viable alternative method to classroom training. The purpose of Study 1 was to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiencies of online training as it compared to current classroom training with Nebraska Law Enforcement Training Center's (NLETC's) Jail Management trainees. Trainees were randomly assigned to receive either online or classroom training. Learning, motivation, and attitudes were measured for instructional effectiveness. Instructional time and cost/benefit calculations were used as measures of efficiencies. Results indicated, as predicted, that online training is as effective an instructional method as classroom training, and more efficient than classroom training. No meaningful learning differences occurred between the two groups, but online training was completed in almost half the time of classroom instruction and at a lesser cost. However, the classroom group reported higher motivation and positive feelings concerning their instruction than did the online group. Study 2 experimentally examined learning, instructional time, motivation, and attitude advantages of multimedia included in the Jail Management online training courses. Although hypothesized that video would enhance learning, motivation, and attitude, there were no differences in UNL student participants' test scores or surveys scores whether they received training with text only, audio with the text, or video with the text. Only instructional time differed among the groups.\n      </p>", "In a given social context, artistic creation comprises a set of processes, which relate to the activity of the artist and the activity of the spectator. Through these processes we see and understand that the world is vaster than it is said to be. Artistic processes are mediated experiences that open up the world. A successful work of art expresses a reality beyond actual reality: it suggests an unknown world using the means and the signs of the known world. Artistic practices incorporate the means of creation developed by science and technology and change forms as they change. Artists and the public follow different processes of abstraction at different levels, in the definition of the means of creation, of representation and of perception of a work of art. This paper examines how the processes of abstraction are used within the framework of the visual arts and abstract painting, which appeared during a period of growing importance for the processes of abstraction in science and technology, at the beginning of the twentieth century. The development of digital platforms and new man-machine interfaces allow multimedia creations. This is performed under the constraint of phases of multidisciplinary conceptualization using generic representation languages, which tend to abolish traditional frontiers between the arts: visual arts, drama, dance and music.\n      </p>", "This paper examines the way in which the current arrangements for public consultation, in the process of environmental assessment, could be improved by the application of multimedia techniques. The task undertaken was to design a low budget portable system that would help planning authorities and developers to communicate the complex environmental issues associated with large-scale development. The design has the capacity to use techniques such as visualisation, animation and sound. Although still in the stages of formulation, the discussion of the conceptual framework, and the range of software employed, should be of interest to those considering such an approach to the enhancement of public involvement in environmental decision making.\n      </p>", "In order to contribute some aspects regarding the optimization of multimedia learning environments, we have developed a chemistry lecture that is called \"CHEMnet\" and provide it for free via the internet. As an introduction to general and inorganic chemistry, \"CHEMnet\" is directed to first year university students as well as to high school students. We plan to attain some information on the use and efficiency of multimedia teaching and learning software with \"CHEMnet\". The structure and features of \"CHEMnet\" and numbers and characteristics of its use are represented in this article.\n      </p>", "In their book \"Laws of the Game: How the Principles of Nature Govern Chance\", Manfred Eigen and Ruthild Winkler describe balance, growth and evolution in nature and in human society as the result of chance and law. These elements, however, are also typical features of games, e.g. the game of dice, which is based on specific rules; games can thus, in turn, simulate and demonstrate the laws of nature in the process of evolution. The authors' multimedia project picks out one of the strategies identified by Eigen and Winkler, the game called 'Selection', and visualizes it by using a variety of approaches in pictorial presentation and music. On this basis, the authors were able to develop their own artistic definitions and statements.\n      </p>", "This study investigated the cognitive processes involved in learning information presented in multimedia and text format using electroencephalographic (EEG) measures. Thirty-eight students (19 gifted, and 19 average) learned material presented with text (TEXT); text, sound, and picture (PICTURE); and text, sound and video (VIDEO), while their EEG was recorded. Alpha power, which is inversely related to mental effort, was analyzed. For the TEXT presentation, the alpha power measures showed higher amplitudes (less mental activity) over the occipital and temporal lobes, and less alpha power (higher mental activity) over the frontal lobes. The results support the assumption that the VIDEO and PICTURE presentations induced visualization strategies, whereas the TEXT presentation mainly generated processes related to verbal processing. The results further showed that gifted students displayed less mental activity during all three formats of presentation. These differences were especially pronounced for the VIDEO format. No gender-related differences in EEG patterns related to the format of presentation were observed.\n      </p>", "The CASCADE-MUCH system was designed to help teacher-designers in Shanghai, China with the development of instructional scenarios for multimedia curricula. After four rounds of prototyping, a summative evaluation was carried out to assess practicality. Results showed that the system was practical for the intended target users in Shanghai and also had potential for users in other contexts. The purpose of this article is to present the design process of the CASCADE-MUCH program and discuss how the evolutionary prototyping approach improved program quality and contributed to the designer's knowledge growth.\n      </p>", "Using the methodology of a formative experiment (Jacob, 1990), this study investigated how a computer-based instructional intervention (creating multimedia reviews of books) might be implemented to achieve a valued pedagogical goal in literacy instruction (increasing the amount and diversity of elementary students' independent reading). Consistent with formative experiments, the following questions were addressed: (a) What factors in the educational environment enhance or inhibit the intervention's effectiveness in achieving the pedagogical goal? (b) How can the intervention and its implementation be modified during the experiment to achieve more effectively the pedagogical goal? (c) What unanticipated positive or negative effects does the intervention produce? (d) Has the educational environment changed as a result of the intervention? Diverse quantitative and qualitative data were gathered during 2 academic years in 4 fourth-grade and 5 fifth-grade classrooms in 3 schools. Major findings include that the success of the intervention was related to the mediating effects of using technology, changes in the interactions among students and teachers, the administrative climate of a school, teachers' perceptions of their technological expertise, and students' engagement in relation to their reading ability. Also discussed are what unanticipated effects were observed and the extent to which the respective classroom environments were changed by the intervention. /// [Spanish] Mediante el uso de un experimento formativo (Jacob, 1990), este estudio investig\u00f3 la forma en que una intervenci\u00f3n pedag\u00f3gica basada en la computadora (creando revisiones multimedia de libros) podr\u00eda implementarse para alcanzar un objetivo pedag\u00f3gico valioso en la ense\u00f1anza de la lectoescritura (aumentando la cantidad y diversidad de las lecturas independientes de estudiantes primarios).

The Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML) is introduced as the theoretical base for the hypotheses. The principles of multimedia and coherence from the CTML are used to hypothesize about the effectiveness of graphics embedded in TMC environments. Comprehension and transfer are used as dependent measures. Three TMC interface treatments were considered (no graphic, irrelevant graphic, relevant graphic). Hierarchical analysis of covariance (HANCOVA) comparing TMC treatments indicated no significant differences in comprehension; however, transfer scores for the TMC teams with context-relevant graphics were significantly higher than the other TMC teams. Although adding graphics to the collaborative interface improves the level of understanding developed within a group, the graphics need to be context relevant to be effective. These findings support the coherence and multimedia principles and provide guidance for designers of TMC environments.\n      </p>", "The surviving texts of many of Shakespeare's plays include what might be termed a \"performance crux\": a moment that is puzzling to the director and actors, and which calls for some kind of stage business to justify or explain action. Sometimes the director's response is simply to remove the passage. This paper will look at a crux of this kind, and discuss how a modern, multimedia electronic edition can provide tools for the reader or actor to explore the possibilities both of the basic text and the performance that grows from it. In Romeo and Juliet there is an awkward moment when Friar Lawrence flees the tomb and deserts Juliet as he hears people approach. The plot requires that he be present as she awakens and absent as she commits suicide, but Shakespeare is not often as arbitrary as the received text (Quarto 2) makes him: \"Come go good Iuliet, I dare no longer stay. Exit.\" By comparing this moment with Quarto 1 (the first published version of the text), Shakespeare's source, later adaptations, and some modern performances, the paper will discuss the mutual illumination of text and performance.\n      </p>", "A long-standing pedagogical concern in public administration education is the development of graduates who can think critically and solve problems. This is especially true in the area of budgeting and financial management, a field of endeavor where no single framework is adequate for organizing all knowledge. Classroom methods emphasizing lecture over learning do not sufficiently equip graduates for real-world participation in public budgeting. Rather, successful knowledge transfer is the result of extensive involvement with concepts, something that best occurs when educators are integrators of the learning experience and students take an active part in the process. Multimedia technology can play an important synergetic role in the development of graduates with the skills needed to face the ongoing challenges posed by the complexity and diversity of today's budgetary environments. This article addresses two themes: (1) public budgeting and financial management as an ill-structured knowledge domain and (2) the potentiality of instructional software to help students learn conceptually demanding material.

The types of data across these problems included free text, parallel text, an image collection, remote sensing imagery, and network packets. A strategy for approaching the analysis of these diverse types of data is described. A key part of the challenge is mapping the analytic results back into the original domain and data setting. Additionally, a common computational bottleneck encountered in each of these problems is diagnosed as analysis tools and algorithms with unbounded memory characteristics. This experience and the analysis suggest a research and development path that could greatly extend the scale of problems that can be addressed with routine data analysis tools. In particular, there are opportunities associated with developing theory and functioning algorithms with favorable memory-usage characteristics, and there are opportunities associated with developing methods and theory for describing the outcomes of analyses for the various types of data.\n      </p>", "Dans le secteur du multim\u00e9dia, l'introduction de la nouvelle technologie num\u00e9rique, de l'interactivit\u00e9 et des r\u00e9seaux d'information, bouleverse plusieurs industries.

With greater design freedom comes complexity. The standard answer to the problems of too much choice, disorientation, and complex navigation is thought to lie in the way we design the interactivity in a system. Unfortunately, the theory of interactivity is at an early stage of development. After critiquing the decision cycle model of interaction \u2014 the received theory in human computer interaction \u2014 I present arguments and observational data to show that humans have several ways of interacting with their environments which resist accommodation in the decision cycle model. These additional ways of interacting include: preparing the environment, maintaining the environment, and reshaping the cognitive congeniality of the environment.

We elicited utilities for Gaucher disease using a multimedia implementation of the time trade-off, standard gamble, and a conceptually different, largely untested approach, the risk-risk trade-off, from those who are healthy, those with a chronic illness and those with Gaucher disease. The risk-risk trade-off produced significantly lower utilities than the other two preference assessment methods and had the poorest test-retest reliability. The respondent's self-rated current health state utility was the most important determinant of utility values elicited by the time trade-off and standard gamble for the hypothetical health states. Our results do not support the use of our implementation of the risk-risk trade-off method. In eliciting preferences for hypothetical health states from the general population, the subjective rating of a respondent's own health state should be considered in determining representative population groups.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "This paper advances the understanding of absorptive capacity for assimilating new knowledge as a mediating variable of organization adaptation. Many scholars suggest a firm's absorptive capacity plays a key role in the process of coevolution (Lewin et al., this issue). So far, most publications, in following Cohen and Levinthal (1990), have considered the level of prior related knowledge as the determinant of absorptive capacity. We suggest, however, that two specific organizational determinants of absorptive capacity should also be considered: organization forms and combinative capabilities. We will show how these organizational determinants influence the level of absorptive capacity, ceteris paribus the level of prior related knowledge. Subsequently, we will develop a framework in which absorptive capacity is related to both micro- and macro-coevolutionary effects. This framework offers an explanation of how knowledge environments coevolve with the emergence of organization forms and combinative capabilities that are suitable for absorbing knowledge. We will illustrate the framework by discussing two longitudinal case studies of traditional publishing firms moving into the turbulent knowledge environment of an emerging multimedia industrial complex.\n      </p>", "The extant picture-learning research does not address confusing word pairs that are not concrete (e.g., in and into).

A preliminary experiment shows that though there are significant differences in consumers' perceived ability to evaluate product quality before purchase between search and experience goods in traditional retail environments, these differences are blurred in online environments. An analysis of the online behavior of a representative sample of U.S. consumers shows that consumers spend similar amounts of time online gathering information for both search and experience goods, but there are important differences in the browsing and purchase behavior of consumers for these two types of goods.

The psychology literature has portrayed first impression bias as a virtually \"inherent\" human bias. Drawing from multimedia literature, this study identifies several characteristics of multimedia presentations that have the potential to alleviate first impression bias. Based on this literature, a set of predictions was generated and tested through a laboratory experiment using a simulated multimedia intranet. Half of the 80 subjects were provided with a biased cue. Subjects were randomly assigned to four groups: (1) text with first impression bias cue, (2) multimedia with first impression bias cue, (3) text without biased cue, and (4) multimedia without biased cue. The experimental task involved conducting a five-year performance appraisal of a department head. The first impression bias cue was designed to provide incomplete and unfavorable information about the department head, but the information provided subsequently was intended to be favorable of his performance. Results show that the appraisal score of the text with biased cue group was significantly lower than the text only (without biased cue) group. On the other hand, the appraisal score of the multimedia with biased cue group was not significantly different from the multimedia only (without biased cue) group.

The issues examined are related to (a) how well vocabulary is learned incidentally when the goal is reading comprehension, (b) the effectiveness of different types of annotations for vocabulary acquisition, and (c) the relationship between look-up behavior and performance on vocabulary tests. The results showed a higher rate of incidental learning than expected (25% accuracy on production tests, 77% on recognition tests), significantly higher scores for words that were annotated with pictures + text than for those with video + text or text only, and a correlation between looking up a certain annotation type and using this type as the retrieval cue for remembering words.\n      </p>", "Learners are often overwhelmed by the complexity of realistic learning tasks, but reducing this complexity through traditional Instructional Design (ID) methods jeopardizes the authenticity of the learning experience.

In this paper we explore this potential in three ways: (a) through an analysis of particular learner needs when learning and working collaboratively with others outside of face-to-face situations; (b) through an analysis of different forms of conferencing environments, including desktop multimedia environments, relative to their effectiveness in terms of meeting learner needs for distributed collaboration; and (c) through reporting the results of a formative evaluation of a prototype desktop multimedia conferencing system developed especially for the support of collaborative learning. Via these analyses, suggestions are offered relating to the functionalities of desktop multimedia conferencing systems for the support of collaborative learning, reflecting new developments in both the technologies available for such systems and in our awareness of learner needs when working collaboratively with one other outside of face-to-face situations.\n      </p>", "This article offers some advice on how to give a presentation, primarily by describing common problems (myths).

The DVD allows students to learn about cutting edge research in physical chemistry while making connections to the theoretical concepts learned in lecture. PCIP-DVD allows students to build verbal and pictorial models of the experiments, instrumentation, and data that can be integrated with the material covered in lecture. For each of the modules implemented students were tested in a pre/post test fashion over content related objectives. For every module the students demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in their understanding.\n      </p>", "Eye-tracking technology allows for the determination of the exact location of the point of gaze of a subject's eye. This study sought to take advantage of this ability to determine how students attend to science related photographs. Pre-service science teachers were shown a PowerPoint&#153; Presentation with embedded photographs. The photographs were classified according the Pozzer and Roth (2003) classification scheme. Special focus was given to the photographs classified as complimentary, most highly integrated with the text, and decorative, the least integrated with the text. A second variable, accompanying audio narration, was integrated into the study design. Analysis indicated complimentary photographs received significantly more attention from the subjects. The effect of audio narration was to blur this distinction as students spent a greater amount of time on the given slides. Using eye-tracking technology, this study was able to confirm that students' devote more attention to highly relevant photographs.\n      </p>", "Many Spanish-language classrooms rely largely on \"authentic\" technological resources such as videos, CD-ROMs, and World Wide Web sources to bring culture into the classroom. There is often a discrepancy between those who decide what educational technology will be used and those who are charged with implementing it. The technical expertise of these two groups often falls short of that which is required to use the technology in question. These technologies, especially the World Wide Web, often reinforce the international dominance of English language and North American culture. Users must give critical consideration to both the term \"authenticity\" and the sources of \"authentic\" materials. The importance of teachers' roles in guiding students to question \"authenticity\" and its sources cannot be underestimated.\n      </p>", "This study examined visual information processing and learning in classrooms including both deaf and hearing students. Of particular interest were the effects on deaf students' learning of live (three-dimensional) versus video-recorded (two-dimensional) sign language interpreting and the visual attention strategies of more and less experienced deaf signers exposed to simultaneous, multiple sources of visual information. Results from three experiments consistently indicated no differences in learning between three-dimensional and two-dimensional presentations among hearing or deaf students. Analyses of students' allocation of visual attention and the influence of various demographic and experimental variables suggested considerable flexibility in deaf students' receptive communication skills. Nevertheless, the findings also revealed a robust advantage in learning in favor of hearing students.\n      </p>", "Many advertisers adopt the integrated marketing communications perspective that emphasizes the importance of synergy in planning multimedia activities. However, the role of synergy in multimedia communications is not well understood. Thus, the authors investigate the theoretical and empirical effects of synergy by extending a commonly used dynamic advertising model to multimedia environments. They illustrate how advertisers can estimate and infer the effectiveness of and synergy among multimedia communications by applying Kalman filtering methodology. Using market data on Dockers brand advertising, the authors first calibrate the extended model to establish the presence of synergy between television and print advertisements in consumer markets. Second, they derive theoretical propositions to understand the impact of synergy on media budget, media mix, and advertising carryover. One of the propositions reveals that as synergy increases, advertisers should not only increase the media budget but also allocate more funds to the less effective activity. The authors also discuss the implications for advertising overspending. Finally, the authors generalize the model to include multiple media, differential carryover, and asymmetrical synergy, and they identify topics for further research.\n      </p>", "This article advances a continuing line of research that investigates the potential of hypermedia resources and scaffolding for supporting problem-based social studies and developing critical reasoning. Our line of inquiry consists of a series of generative design experiments that informs problem-based curriculum development. Our findings suggest that expert guidance may be embedded into the learning environment to give students conceptual and strategic road maps that assist them in understanding the process of disciplined inquiry. However, our results also emphasize the difficulties in managing the cognitive challenges posed by ill-structured social problems and suggest limits to the embedded support that can be provided for complex thinking. Complex conceptual tasks may require spontaneous support that can only be provided by a skilled teacher. We suggest that embedded scaffolds may be used to support teachers by reducing the amount of spontaneous scaffolding they must do in an ill-structured environment and discuss other steps that might be taken to encourage problem-based inquiry.\n      </p>", "La ley del amor (1995), le second roman de la Mexicaine Laura Esquivel, est habilement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 comme le premier roman multim\u00e9dia de l'histoire.

The study is framed by emergent, sociocultural, and critical race perspectives. Qualitative methods are used to determine the amount and quality of science discourse that emerged in three urban classrooms. Results show culturally relevant texts engage students and teachers in high levels of classroom discourse that is rich in science content. Students are also successful on the science section of a computer-based assessment, suggesting culturally relevant multimedia is effective in science instruction. Findings also reveal the use of culturally relevant multimedia supports science inquiry and changes the social norms and discourse dynamics in classrooms when issues of racial injustice are addressed.\n      </p>", "THE AUTHOR EXAMINES THE IMPLICATIONS OF TRAVERSING ARTISTIC MEDIA through a discussion of her process in working with \"The Grimm Tale\" (or the Story of the Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was).

The project is looking for ways in which ICTs can be used to empower and strengthen the voices of the poor. Community multimedia centers are an extension of UNESCO's long-standing work with community radio, inspired by the increasingly important role played by new digital technologies. Community multimedia centers like the one in Tansen, Palpa District, Nepal, combine traditional community media-in Tansen's case video, cable TV, and print-with new media tools such as computers and the Internet. The goal is to explore ways in which Tansen can use ICTs as dynamic development tools: to bring more voices, cultural forms, ideas, and issues into the community's media space, and to provide poor, marginalized youth with new skills and opportunities. The combination of established local media such as community TV with new technologies like the Internet opens up great possibilities to link small, comparatively inaccessible towns and villages such as Tansen to new global networks. New media are not only powerful tools for producing content, they are also gateways to ever-expanding information and knowledge resources.\n      </p>", "The Center for Performing Arts and Technology at the University of Michigan is developing the Creation Station, a workstation-based software package that will provide the artist advanced sound synthesis and graphics capabilities, as well as the tools necessary to create multimedia pieces of art.

It is affected not only by learners' internal knowledge structures, but by the external constraints of the learning environment as well (Kozma, 1991). This article examines how different internal learner characteristics (e.g., prior knowledge, self efficacy and interest) and different external constraints (e.g., learner control, instructional design and level of control) influence the learning process. Specifically, we address learning from a variety of multimedia environments such as video, hypertexts, kiosks and other hypermedia within a schema theoretic approach that incorporates a constructivist view.\n      </p>", "We examined a number-line metaphor presented using interactive multimedia as a means of helping students build connections between an arithmetic procedure and their existing conceptual knowledge. Elementary school children learned to add and subtract signed numbers through a computer-based multimedia program over 4 training sessions. Participants received 64 example problems presented only in symbolic form (single-representation [SR] group) or in symbolic, visual, and verbal forms (multiple-representation [MR] group). In Experiment 1, compared to the SR group, the MR group (a) showed a larger pretest-to-posttest gain for high-achieving students but not for low-achieving students, (b) showed a greater gain on difficult problems but not easy problems, (c) learned faster during training, and (d) showed a greater pretest-to-posttest reduction in the use of conceptual bugs reflecting conceptually confusion between negative signs and subtraction operators. In Experiment 2, high spatial ability students in the MR group outperformed low spatial ability students on pretest-to-posttest gain. Productive learning with MRs is strongest when working memory is not overloaded, so cognitive load and MR theories can be reconciled.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

A multivariate analysis of variance was conducted with three independent variables-small group or individualized format, inductive or deductive design of instruction, and match of learner style to instruction-and four dependent variables-content scores, observation skill scores, overall satisfaction, and attitude toward learner control of instruction. Scores on the observation skills evaluation were significantly higher when the student's learning style was matched with the design of instruction. Satisfaction and attitude outcomes were significantly different for format: students in the small group were more satisfied, while those using the individual learning station were more strongly agreed that they controlled the pace and sequence of their own instruction. Content scores were not significantly different.

Use of an interactive multimedia (IM) computer program designed to help students acquire and retain a deeper understanding of works of art is compared to traditional slide study. Analysis of students' written responses to works of art revealed that IM users searched more extensively for information, demonstrated both more understandings and misunderstandings, and experienced carryover effects from the first experiment to the second.

This article develops a theoretical model on the behavioral consequences of modality\u2010specific resources for spoken and written information. The model predicts antagonistic effects of reduced interference versus reduced integration of verbal information presented across the two modalities, as compared to within a single modality. Three experiments compare unimodal to multimedia messages containing either a mix of modalities or information presented bimodally. The results provide qualified support for the model in the realm of item\u2010specific versus relational memory and elaboration. Compared to unimodal presentations, alternating the presentation modality decreases relational processing but can increase item\u2010specific processing. Furthermore, a simultaneous bimodal presentation format increases recognition memory but does not appear to affect relational processing or item\u2010specific elaboration.\n      </p>"], "words":
