Among the reasons for this are the condemnation, stigma and ambiguous legal status of sex work. This paper describes work carried out by two feminist NGOs in Brazil, Mulher e Sa\u00fade (MUSA) in Belo Horizonte and Coletivo Feminista Sexualidade e Sa\u00fade in S\u00e3o Paulo, to promote sexual and reproductive health for sex workers. MUSA's project \"In the Battle for Health\", was begun in 1992; sex workers were trained as peer educators and workshops were offered on self-care for sex workers and their clients. In S\u00e3o Paulo, the Coletivo project \"Get Friendly with Her\", begun in 2002, offers clinic consultations and self-care workshops on sexuality, contraception, STI/HIV prevention and self-examination. Health care needs during menstruation and unhealthy vaginal practices led to promotion of the diaphragm as a contraceptive, for prevention of reproductive tract infection and to catch menstrual blood. Meeting the sexual and reproductive health needs of sex workers depends on the promotion of their human rights, access to health care without discrimination, and attention to psychosocial health issues, alcohol and drug abuse, and violence from clients, partners, pimps and police. /// La recherche et les interventions de sant\u00e9 publique ont n\u00e9glig\u00e9 les besoins en sant\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9sique des professionnelles du sexe et se sont presque exclusivement concentr\u00e9es sur la pr\u00e9vention des IST et du VIH, notamment en raison de la condamnation et de la stigmatisation attach\u00e9es \u00e0 la prostitution, ainsi que de l'ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 de son statut juridique.

In examining these investors' reaction to the prospect and subsequent policies of the left-wing Lula government, the article considers Mosley's (2003, Global Capital and National Governments, Cambridge, New York, Melbourne: Cambridge University Press) conclusions regarding the strength and breadth of the bond market's influence on emerging market governments. The data show that international bond market investors did not exit Brazil before the elections, putting in question whether they were the source of the rise in the cost of government borrowing that Mosley and others see as indicative of the market's strength. This suggests that our understanding of the actors responsible for market movements remains incomplete. The article, therefore, challenges the idea, common within international political economy, of 'the market' as a single entity, with common actions and policy preferences. The data presented strongly suggest 'the market' is in reality made up of multiple, heterogeneous actors, often lacking any unity of opinion or purpose. After Lula's election victory, market prices recovered and the data show that international investors increased their investments in Brazil, despite slower policy implementation than market practitioners desired and the new government's social agenda. This supports a questioning of the true breadth of investors' policy interests and, therefore, influence.\n      </p>", "Four new species of Cayaponia are described and illustrated: three from Brazil (C. cogniauxiana, C. nitida and C. rugosa) and one from Brazil and Bolivia (C. ferruginea).\n      </p>", "We provide keys, descriptions, illustrations, full synonymies, maps, and a list of specimens examined for species of Megalastrum found in Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay.

The average number of collections per square kilometer in Brazil is 0.59, a number well below with the ideal index of three collections per square kilometer and indicates a need for more intensive collection efforts, especially in view of the land-use pressures causing loss of vegetational types before their floristic composition is known.

Advances in our understanding of the nitrogen cycle and the impacts of anthropogenic activities on regional to global scales is largely hindered by the paucity of information about nitrogen inputs from human activities in fast-developing regions of the world such as the tropics. In this paper, we estimate nitrogen inputs and outputs in Brazil, which is the world's largest tropical country. We determined that the N cycle is increasingly controlled by human activities rather than natural processes. Nitrogen inputs to Brazil from human activities practically doubled from 1995 to 2002, mostly because of nitrogen production through biological fixation in agricultural systems. This is in contrast to industrialized countries of the temperate zone, where fertilizer application and atmospheric deposition are the main sources of anthropogenic nitrogen. In Brazil, the production of soybean crops over an area of less than 20 million ha, was responsible for about 3.2 Tg N or close to one-third of the N inputs from anthropogenic sources in 2002. Moreover, cattle pastures account for almost 70% of the estimated 280 \u00d7 10\u2076 ha of agricultural land in Brazil and potentially fix significant amounts of N when well managed, further increasing the importance of biological nitrogen fixation in the nitrogen budget. Much of these anthropogenic inputs occur in the Brazilian savannah region (Cerrado), while more urbanized regions such as the state of S\u00e3o Paulo also have high rates of nitrogenous fertilizer inputs. In the Amazon, rates of anthropogenic nitrogen inputs are relatively low, but continuing conversion of natural forests into cattle pasture or secondary forests potentially add a significant amount of new nitrogen to Brazil given the vast area of the region. Better measurements of biological fixation rates in Brazil are necessary for improving the nitrogen budgets, especially at a more refined spatial scale.\n      </p>", "This paper questions the cultural neutrality of modernization and globalization policies that are imposed by major international monetary agencies. The authors propose that the structural adjustment policies imposed by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund are predominantly guided by the concept of developmental association. Guided by this concept, the dominant countries and agencies perceive all developing countries to be merely cultural variations of the same problem that assumes all countries require the same solutions. Through an analysis of the failures of World Bank programs in Brazil and other developing countries, the authors argue for greater recognition of the problems inherent in imposing cosmopolitan and global solutions on local contexts. The authors conclude that globalized solutions for local contexts are inappropriate when they are formulated out of ignorance of the local culture and context.\n      </p>", "A new species of Podostemaceae, Podostemum irgangii, from the states of Santa Catarina and Paran\u00e1, Brazil, is described and illustrated.

The wind in the area is predominantly from the northeast, especially in summer, which is upwelling favorable. Reversals of the wind direction are frequent and intense during the winter, due to the passage of frontal systems. The offshore circulation is dominated by the Brazil Current, which flows southward meandering around the 200 m isobath. Significant shelf-break upwelling has being associated with Brazil Current cyclonic meanders. To assess the relative importance of the two processes in the pumping of South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) onto the continental shelf, three cases are analyzed: (1) wind-driven upwelling; (2) upwelling induced by Brazil Current meanders and (3) both effects acting together. The results show that in the coastal area upwelling/downwelling is mainly caused by the wind, whereas the cyclonic meanders of the Brazil Current are the dominant mechanism in the generation of vertical velocities over the shelf break and slope. This meander-induced upward motion brings the SACW to shallower depths, where it is influenced by the wind. In this situation, when both effects act together, the SACW penetrates all the way to the coast.\n      </p>", "We describe a new species of Aratinga-A. pintoi (Sulfur-breasted Parakeet)-from open areas on the northern bank of the lower Amazon River in the state of Par\u00e1, Brazil.

At present there are locust/grasshopper outbreaks in at least five Brazilian States, including Mato Grosso, Para\u00edba, Rio Grande do Norte, and Pernambuco. Although climatic conditions play an important role in locust outbreaks, the major factors that have originated this problem in Brazil are related to changes in land management, deforestation, introduction of new crops, and to some extent the lack of monitoring and vigilance once the outbreaks are suppressed. As a result of the implementation of locust/grasshopper control campaigns in Mato Grosso (1984-1988) and Rio Grande do Sul (1991-92), it has become evident that the locust/grasshopper problem in Brazil needs a different approach. To deal properly with the situation the Government needs to establish an integrated locust/grasshopper control program, but little is known about alternative control methods, and in some cases even the ecology of the species is poorly understood. Preliminary studies on biological control and ecology of several species involved are being carried out at present in Brazil in order to undertake a long term project to establish an integrated locust/grasshopper control program.

Case studies of Brazil and Colombia describe how health sector reforms, e.g. decentralisation and managed competition among health insurers and service providers, have influenced promotion strategies. The experience of Profamilia Colombia with registration of a dedicated product and providing emergency contraception within its national network of clinics, with a focus on staff training and work with young people, is described. In Brazil, BEMFAM's study of different modalities for offering emergency contraception, e.g. through contractual agreements with municipalities and its own clinics, is highlighted. /// La contraception d'urgence, dont l'efficacit\u00e9 est prouv\u00e9e depuis pr\u00e8s de 30 ans, demeure sous-utilis\u00e9e.

Juss.) M\u00fcll. Arg., whose center of diversity is the Amazon basin, is the major source of commercial rubber in the world. In the 1970s, the need for new Hevea germplasm arose from the realization that there was a gradual erosion of the genetic variability of the rubber clones in many natural rubber plantations. This erosion occurred because most of the clones in cultivation were derived from the few surviving seeds collected in 1876 by Henry Wickham. Therefore, to broaden the genetic base of the major producers of natural rubber, it became necessary to undertake an expedition to the Amazon basin to obtain materials for the 'gene pool' in these populations. This expedition, called \"Germplasm 81,\" was organized in four stages. Initially, there was a 1976 seminar organized by the International Rubber Research and Development Board (IRRDB); then, in 1977, a Hevea workshop took place, also organized by the IRRDB. A preliminary mission by IRRDB officials to several countries in South America and the Caribbean followed in 1978. Finally, the Germplasm exercise by scientists from IRRDB countries (Cote d'Ivoire, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria, and Thailand), China, and Brazil took place from January to April of 1981. A 'dummy run' to test the viability of seeds from Manaus, Brazil, was undertaken in 1979. The Germplasm collection covered three Brazilian states: Acre, Mato Grosso, and Rond\u00f4nia. Collection teams traveled into the remotest parts of the Amazon rain forests looking for high-yielding and disease-resistant trees from which to collect seeds, budwood, and seedlings growing around the trees. Three teams collected a total of 64,256 seeds, 1413 meters of budwood, and 1160 seedlings. Following agreements with the Brazilian government, collected seeds were divided on a 50-50 basis between IRRDB and Brazil. Materials for Brazil were retained in Manaus, while those for the IRRDB were initially sent to Britain for phytosanitary treatment and then to Guadeloupe for further quarantine in 1982, before being sent to Asian and African reception centers. Scientists who participated in the exercise had to undergo quarantine in a temperate country for at least one week before returning to their research institutions. This quarantine was an attempt to avoid the spread of the deadly South American leaf blight (SALB) disease. This disease has prevented Brazil from becoming a major world producer of natural rubber, despite attempts made by Goodyear and Firestone Rubber Companies, as well as Henry Ford in the early 1900s.\n      </p>", "Campomanesia simulans, a new species from the states of Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais, Brazil, is described and illustrated.\n      </p>", "Allagoptera brevicalyx from Bahia, Brazil, is described.

Some 2,000 women from poor social strata, whose health condition was poor, were being seen every day in the last two years of the programme, including new consultations and women with a previous attendance returning. Women were attended first by nurse-assistants, who had been trained to screen for the most frequent gynaecological problems, and then a physician. Because doctors spent less time with each patient, four times as many women could be seen. Programmes were set up for the diagnosis and treatment of gynaecological cancers, STDs, HIV/AIDS, hypertension and other degenerative disorders such as diabetes. Screening and treatment programmes for cervical and breast cancer achieved significant improvements in the stage at which a diagnosis was made, allowing more lives to be saved.

Mark-recapture techniques provided detailed information on age structure, population dynamics, biomass, and patterns of reproduction for six species of oryzomyine rodents (Oecomys bicolor, Oecomys concolor, Oryzomys capito, Oligoryzomys eliurus, Rhipidomys mastacalis, and Nectomys squamipes) and two species of marsupials (Didelphis albiventris and Gracilinanus agilis). Different species show distinctive patterns of population increase and reproductive activity, with some maintaining stable populations throughout the year and others having a boom-and-bust pattern. Those that show pronounced differences in population size at different times of the year generally reach their lowest population levels during the region's pronounced dry season. Among the smaller-bodied species, the great majority of mammalian biomass on the study area is contained in the rodents. If the larger-bodied species are included, however, the marsupials comprise most of the biomass. Most species did not appear to be long-lived. Only D. albiventris persisted on the grid for &gt;12 months; the majority of species lasted &lt;6 months.

A total of 70 land systems based on climate, landscape and soils have been identified in the region, but it remains to be seen if the distribution and structure of the plant communities support these divisions. The aim of this work was to compare the floristic and structural similarity of cerrado sensu stricto within and between three physiographic units, named Pratinha, Veadeiros and S\u00e3o Francisco, which contain six land systems in central Brazil and cover 10 degrees of latitude and five degrees of longitude. The woody vegetation of 15 selected sites of the cerrado sensu stricto physiognomy was surveyed under a standardized methodology. The number of species per site varied from 55 to 97, with most sites having around 60 to 70 species, and Shannon's diversity indices ranged from 3.44 to 3.73, with most sites around 3.5 suggesting high alpha diversity. S\u00f8rensen's floristic similarity index was high, with all Figures above 0.5 between the sites in the same land system in each physiographic unit but low between sites in different land systems in the Veadeiros. Czekanowski similarity indices were lower than S\u00f8rensen's in the comparisons due to a high structural differentiation between the sites. There is a large overlap in species occurrence in the sites but the size of their populations is very different at each site. Therefore, the high beta diversity is mostly due to differences in abundance of species between sites. The sites were separated by physiographic units, considering the first three divisions of TWINSPAN classification. The first axis of DCA ordination showed a gradient going from the cerrado on deep soils in Pratinha, through to those on sandy soils in S\u00e3o Francisco and ending on the shallower soils of the Veadeiros. Land systems conformed well with the floristic and structural variations of the vegetation, indicating their potential use in designing a network of conservation areas in the cerrado region and as a basis for decision-making on management.\n      </p>", "This study interprets critical stages in the changing design and landscape of urban squares, or pra\u00e7as, in Brazil and assesses the circumstances of their cultural-historical production.

A discriminant analysis indicated that femoral pores and scales around the tail are the best discriminators among Brazilian species of Cnemidophorus. A na\u00efve Bayesian network constructed with categorical (mostly coloration) variables indicated that the new species had high conditional probabilities of dorsolateral fields absent, vertebral field spotted, and paravertebral lines absent. The analyses revealed clear distinctions between species of Cnemidophorus that range north and south of the the Amazon River. The new species may have evolved as a result of vicariance, following the isolation of peripheral enclaves of Cerrado in southwestern Amazonia after the late Pleniglacial.

Whether women gave birth vaginally or by caesarean section was medically prescribed, with women's own preferences taking second place. Some were advised that caesarean section was the only option with HIV in pregnancy; others were told it should be used only for medical indications, even if the woman wanted to be sterilised at the same time. The women in Porto Alegre were less likely to get a sterilisation than those in S\u00e3o Paulo, even with caesarean section, as sterilisation was not encouraged locally. Many of the women who accepted a caesarean had been convinced before they gave birth that it was the best choice for them, either because it reduced the risk of perinatal HIV transmission or because it facilitated tubal ligation, or both. However, after they gave birth, the women judged their experience of delivery and the post-partum period mainly in comparison to previous deliveries, and many of them viewed the birth experience with HIV as more difficult than previous deliveries and worse than they had expected. /// Les femmes enceintes s\u00e9ropositives re\u00e7oivent des informations m\u00e9dicales et des prescriptions qui influencent l'exp\u00e9rience de la grossesse et de l'accouchement.

Conventional results suggest that low and stable inflation environments lead to low levels of exchange rate pass-through and thus contribute to weakening the 'fear of floating' phenomenon experienced by some developing countries. In spite of lower pass-through effects, the Brazilian Central Bank has maintained high interest rates in order to control the exchange rate. This paper suggests that 'fear of inflation' provides justification for the central bank's persistent 'fear of floating.'\n      </p>", "Twenty-seven taxa of bats from late Pleistocene fossils originated from five caves in Bahia, Brazil. In one cave, humeri of Mormoops megalophylla were dated radiometrically to 20,060 \u00b1 290 years ago. In another cave, a cranium of Desmodus rotundus was found adhering to the underside of a coprolite of a sloth (Nothrotherium) that had a radiometric age of 12,200 \u00b1 120 radiocarbon years ago. Among taxa represented by the fossils were one extinct species (Desmodus draculae), the first South American fossil records for Mimon bennettii, Furipterus horrens, and Tadarida brasiliensis, and the first Brazilian fossil records for M. megalophylla, Phyllostomus discolor, Diphylla ecaudata, and Nyctinomops macrotis. All caves but one occur within the semiarid Caatinga biome today. However, fossil occurrences of several species (M. megalophylla, M. bennettii, and Eptesicus fuscus), which today select moister habitats or humid caves, suggest that conditions in the area during part of the late Pleistocene were wetter than at present.\n      </p>", "Corporate governance is an issue of growing importance in developing economies, as many firms pass through significant transformations due to the combined forces of sociopolitical changes, technological progress and economic trends toward globalization. These elements, along with the structural characteristics of developing economies such as less developed capital markets and governmental interventionism, draw a picture for corporate governance practices that many, in some aspects, be fundamentally different from the practices found in European or North American contexts.

In this article, I scrutinize the discourse that asks, \"How can we be racist when so many of us are mixed?\" I argue that racial discourses are embedded in everyday interactions, but are often codified or masked. \"Race\" is especially pertinent to sexuality, yet the two have hardly been analyzed together. In fact, it is not the belief in a racial democracy that is at the heart of Brazilian racial hegemony, but rather the belief that Brazil is a color-blind erotic democracy.

Although research has shown that the least amount of interference compatible with safety is the paradigm to follow, vaginal birth is still being treated as if it carries a high risk to women's health and sexual life in Brazil. This paper describes the impact of the intervention model on women's birth experience, and discusses how the organisation of public and private maternity services in Brazil influences the quality of obstetric care. Brazil is known for high rates of unnecessary caesarean section (\"the cut above\"), performed in over two-thirds of births in the private sector, where 30% of women give birth. The 94.2% rate of episiotomy (\"the cut below\") in women who give birth vaginally, affecting the 70% of poor women using the public sector most, receives less attention. A change in the understanding of women's bodies is required before a change in the procedures themselves can be expected.

It is based on a survey of the 500 largest companies in these nations. The findings reveal many similarities between these countries. Among other things, it emerges that most companies give consideration to ethics in business and have adopted some kind of formal or informal ethical policies. Regardless of whether or not they have a CES, companies agree that ethical conduct must be taken into account when selecting, appraising and promoting personnel as an important ethical policy. There is a growing tendency to draw up formal corporate ethics documents. These documents are perceived, first and foremost, as supporting the development of corporate culture. Most respondents believe that primary responsibility for ethical issues in the company rests with the CEO. Finally, the findings indicate that most companies that devote more resources to communicating and implementing CESs have two or more formal ethics documents. The main differences between the countries included in the study concern the emphasis given to specific aspects, such as avoiding misconduct or taking ethical criteria into account when selecting personnel. The emphasis is greatest in countries where corruption seems most prevalent.\n      </p>", "We describe a new species of Tantilla (Serpentes: Colubridae) from the highlands (\"campos rupestres\") of the Serra do Cip\u00f3, Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil.

This species is superficially similar to C. timandroides from northeastern and southeastern Brazil, but differs in having petiolate leaves with glandular margins, persistent stipules, conspicuous racemose inflorescences, staminate flowers having externally glabrous sepals and 3 stamens, and pedicellate pistillate flowers. The systematic position of C. dissectistipulatus relative to the sections of Croton is discussed.\n      </p>", "The study was carried out in 16 gaps produced by bamboo clump death (Merostachys riedeliana Rupr. ex Doell) in a semideciduous mesophytic forest in the Santa Genebra County Reserve (22\u00b049\u203245\" S and 47\u00b006\u203233\" W), Campinas, SP, south-eastern Brazil. All shrub and tree individuals in the gap with height \u2265 0.50 m were sampled. The floristic similarity among the colonizing vegetation in these gaps and in gaps produced by treefall was assessed by the Jaccard similarity index and cluster analysis. The colonization process of these gaps was found to be similar to that in gaps formed by treefall, but this colonization only began after the bamboo clump death. The gap area varied from 35 m\u00b2 to 454 m\u00b2, but small gaps predominated. In the set of gaps, 3677 individuals were sampled belonging to 40 families, 83 genera and 114 species. The families with the greatest species richness in the gaps were Myrtaceae (10), Euphorbiaceae (9) and Solanaceae and Rubiaceae (8 each). The species with the greatest number of individuals in the gaps were the pioneers Celis tala Gillies ex Planchon and Croton priscus Muell. Arg. and the shade-tolerant shrubs Actinostemon klotschii (Muell. Arg.) Pax, Polygala klotzschii Chod., Psychotria hastisepala Muell. Arg. and Galipea multiflora Engl. Late secondary species predominated because of the greater number of small gaps. The gaps formed by bamboo clump death contributed to the successional and structural organization of the forest, creating suitable environments for colonization by shrub and tree species of the different successional groups.\n      </p>", "Several geopolitical factors, aggravated by worries of global warming, have been fueling the search for and production of renewable energy worldwide for the past few years. Such demand for renewable energy is likely to benefit the sugarcane ethanol industry in Brazil, not only because sugarcane ethanol has a positive energetic balance and relatively low production costs, but also because Brazilian ethanol has been successfully produced and used as biofuel in the country since the 1970s. However, environmental and social impacts associated with ethanol production in Brazil can become important obstacles to sustainable biofuel production worldwide. Atmospheric pollution from burning of sugarcane for harvesting, degradation of soils and aquatic systems, and the exploitation of cane cutters are among the issues that deserve immediate attention from the Brazilian government and international societies. The expansion of sugarcane crops to the areas presently cultivated for soybeans also represent an environmental threat, because it may increase deforestation pressure from soybean crops in the Amazon region. In this paper, we discuss environmental and social issues linked to the expansion of sugarcane in Brazil for ethanol production, and we provide recommendations to help policy makers and the Brazilian government establish new initiatives to produce a code for ethanol production that is environmentally sustainable and economically fair. Recommendations include proper planning and environmental risk assessments for the expansion of sugarcane to new regions such as Central Brazil, improvement of land use practices to reduce soil erosion and nitrogen pollution, proper protection of streams and riparian ecosystems, banning of sugarcane burning practices, and fair working conditions for sugarcane cutters. We also support the creation of a more constructive approach for international stakeholders and trade organizations to promote sustainable development for biofuel production in developing countries such as Brazil. Finally, we support the inclusion of environmental values in the price of biofuels in order to discourage excessive replacement of natural ecosystems such as forests, wetlands, and pasture by bioenergy crops.\n      </p>"], "words": {"consider": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "taxa": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "over": {"number": 1, "prob":
