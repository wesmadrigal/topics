{"total_words": 700, "documents": ["The articles in this special issue of Relations industrielles/ Industrial Relations are the first that the journal has published about ergonomics. Accordingly, the present article has two objectives: to define the object of study, the objectives and the methodology that are characteristic of ergonomics; and to highlight the common points and possibilities of collaboration between industrial relations and ergonomics. The interest inherent in a collaboration between these two disciplines is explained, among other things, by a \"historical coincidence\". On the ergonomics side, a period that concentrated on developing concrete ways of collaborating with technical disciplines like engineering, computing and architecture has given way to a focus on \"work organization\" and the \"social management aspect of ergonomics intervention\". At the same time, industrial relations has developed a more pronounced interest in the practical management problems that are posed by micro-organizational processes within firms, namely, the informal work activities of operators. Three specific forms of future collaboration between ergonomists and industrial relations specialists are proposed.\n      </p>", "Objectives This study evaluated the effect of an intensive ergonomie approach and education on workstation changes and musculoskeletal disorders among workers who used a video display unit (VDU). Methods A randomized controlled design was used. The subjects (N= 124) were allocated into three groups (intensive ergonomics, ergonomie education, reference) using stratified random sampling. The evaluation involved questionnaires, a diary of discomfort, measurements of workload, and an ergonomie rating of the workstations. The assessments were made 2 weeks before the intervention and after 2 and 10 months of followup. Results The intensive and training groups showed less musculoskeletal discomfort than the reference group after 2 months of follow-up. Positive effects on discomfort were seen primarily for the shoulder, neck, and upper back areas. No significant differences were found for the strain levels or prevalence of pain. After the intervention the ergonomie level was distinctly higher in the intensive ergonomie group than in the education or reference group. Conclusions Both the intensive ergonomics approach and education in ergonomics help reduce discomfort in VDU work. In attempts to improve the physical ergonomics of VDU workstations, the best result will be achieved with cooperative planning in which both workers and practitioners are actively involved.\n      </p>", "Objectives The effectiveness of the implementation of participatory ergonomics intervention to reduce physical work demands in construction work was studied. Methods In a cluster randomized controlled trial, 10 bricklaying companies were randomly assigned either to an intervention group (N=5) or a control group (N=5). The intervention strategy used a consultant-guided sixstep approach in which company stakeholders participated. Bricklayers and bricklayers' assistants in the intervention group (N=65) and the control group (N=53) were followed for 6 months, and their use of four ergonomic measures (adjusting work height when picking up bricks and mortar, adjusting work height for bricklaying at a wall side, mechanizing brick transport, and mechanizing mortar transport) was compared. The use of the ergonomic measures was assessed from worksite observations and questionnaires at baseline and after 6 months. The workers' and employers' behavioral change phases were determined by questionnaires and interviews, respectively. Performance indicators were assessed for the intervention from the researchers' observations during the implementation process and through questionnaires completed by the workers. Results The strategy had no statistically significant effect on the use of any of the four ergonomic measures, at either the cluster or the individual level. None of the companies in the intervention group passed through all six steps of the intervention. Process outcomes suggest that the ability to use ergonomic measures increased. In bricklaying, self-efficacy and skills to adapt the work height on the scaffolding improved significantly. Conclusions The intervention did not lead to greater use of ergonomic measures in bricklaying or the transport of materials. Performance indicators of intervention and the corresponding behavioral change phases of stakeholders can help to detect essential elements of such intervention.\n      </p>", "Summary points Understanding human limitations early in the development of medical devices can reduce errors and avoid performance problems exacerbated by stress and fatigue Using ergonomics in a design process can reduce the costs of procuring and maintaining products Ergonomics can minimise the incidence of injury or longer term malaise from poor working environments An ergonomics task analysis can help identify key components of surgical skill, ensuring that students have affordable, appropriate, valid, and reliable training\n      </p>", "This article describes how to build a nonparametric regression model for the prediction of human motions using motion capture data. The method works by selecting a few similar motions from a database and then averaging them. An appropriate parameterization is developed for representing the motions composed of the trajectories of the endpoints such as the hands and stretch pivot coordinates to represent the interior joints such as the shoulders or knees. Within this representation, local averaging may sensibly occur while preserving specified constraints like the length of the body segments and final location of the endpoints. A nearest neighbor regression like method is developed and a cross-validation procedure implemented for selecting the best number of neighbors and appropriate notions of similarity in the motions selected for averaging. The methodology is illustrated with the development of a prediction model for two-handed standing lifts with applications to ergonomics.\n      </p>", "Although the human retina can code many object images simultaneously, observers are often aware of only a tiny fraction of this information. These processing limitations of the visual brain have evolved to prioritize particularly relevant features of a scene while ignoring other irrelevant features. However, such selectivity has its drawbacks. In information-rich environments, such as driving a car or landing an aircraft, vision can fail to cope, and accidents can result. Accordingly, much recent research in psychophysics and ergonomics has examined how display characteristics affect our ability to process multiple features of the visual environment simultaneously. The majority of these experiments has found that performance can be optimized by combining several features into one visual 'object'. In contrast, several recent studies from my own laboratory have found the opposite pattern, indicating that information sources can often be more efficiently processed when they belong to separate objects. Indeed, these data suggest that the number of objects has no general effect on our perceptual performance. Instead, I argue for a two-pathway approach to understanding human visual capacities, and suggest that this approach may have important implications for a diverse range of display technologies, including cockpit displays.\n      </p>", "Ergonomics is the study of human beings in their work environment. It is a science of great relevance to equipment designers and managers, and has many applications in industry and society. Understanding the principles of ergonomics can greatly assist in implementing the 'first-time-right' approach in systems design. In view of our large population, high unemployment and abundance of material resources, the principles of ergonomics can be successfully used in selecting technology appropriate for our conditions.\n      </p>", "The texts (and talk) of engineers take different forms. In this essay, I present and critique several texts written for different purposes and audiences but all intended to convey to the reader the technical details of whatever they are about\u2014whether a textbook passage describing the fundamental behavior of an electrical component, a journal article about a mathematical technique intended for use in design optimization, a memo to co-workers within a firm about a heat transfer analysis of a remotely sited building, or a general introduction to the field of? ergonomics? My aim is to explore how the ways in which engineers describe and document their problems and projects frame what they accept, display and profess as useful knowledge. In this I am particularly interested in how engineers envision the 'users' of, or participants in, their productions. Like science, engineering texts are written as if they were timeless and untainted by socio-cultural features. However, a technical treatise is not devoid of metaphor or creative rendering of events; there is always a narrative within which worldly data and instrumental logic is embedded\u2014but it is a story in which the passive voice prevails, history is irrelevant, and the human actor or agent is painted in quantitative parameters fitting the occasion. Whether this rhetoric can be sustained in the face of challenges to traditional ways of doing engineering is an open question.\n      </p>", "Thermal manikins are a fairly standard tool in environmental ergonomics. As they can provide a rapid, accurate, and reproducible simulation of the physical processes of dry heat loss to the environment, their main application is in the study of neutral or cold conditions at relatively low activity levels. Thermal manikins provide a good estimate of the total dry heat loss from the body and the distribution of heat flow over the body surface. In a standard environment, these measures can be used to describe the thermal characteristics of clothing. With standard clothing, complex thermal environments, eg, as in vehicles, can also be quantitatively compared and evaluated. Future developments include improved simulation of evaporative heat loss; improved software for simulating internal heat transfer, heat storage, and vasoconstriction; reactive programs with target total heat loss; empirical equations predicting manikin response to temperature, air velocity, etc; and standard techniques for testing diving and survival suits.\n      </p>", "In 1998, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health convened a conference of researchers interested in the ergonomics of agricultural workers. Participants included 20 representatives from universities, state governments, private agricultural and insurance companies, migrant worker organizations, agricultural industry organizations, and the Agricultural Extension Service. The attendees divided into three groups and brainstormed about research ideas and dissemination methods related to ergonomics for farm workers. The groups separately reported that interventions, cost-benefit analyses, and cultural belief systems were the main topics that needed to be researched to reduce physical risk factors for musculoskeletal disorders. The participants also presented ideas for disseminating information to farm owners and workers.\n      </p>", "This article discusses the importance of job analysis tools for training in the context of participatory ergonomic processes. It explains the major principles and challenges in the design of these tools for short-cycle repetitive tasks and for long-cycle varied tasks. The intervention framework is described and the proposed tools are presented and related to the literature. The participants' difficulties with the tools developed in both contexts studied are summarized. The discussion suggests that these difficulties are partly related to the company context and raises questions about the data relevant for the evaluation of solutions in the case of non-repetitive tasks. Este documento discute la importancia de los instrumentos de an\u00e1lisis del trabajo como instrumentos de formaci\u00f3n en el marco de la ergonom\u00eda participativa.

Se describe el marco de intervenci\u00f3n; los instrumentos propuestos son presentados y ubicados con respecto a la literatura. Son resumidas las dificultades de los participantes con respecto a los instrumentos desarrollados en los contextos estudiandos. La discusi\u00f3n sugiere que esas dificultades son parcialmente relacionadas al contexto de la compa\u00f1\u00eda y plantea cuestiones sobre la informaci\u00f3n pertinente para la evaluaci\u00f3n de soluciones en el caso de tareas no repetitivas.\n      </p>", "Functional responses are encountered when units are observed over time. Although the whole function itself is not observed, a sufficiently large number of evaluations, as is common with modern recording equipment, are assumed to be available. Functional regression analysis relates the smooth functional response, y(t), to known covariates, x, by a linear combination of parameter functions, \u03b2(t), which are to be estimated. The model takes the standard form, y(t)=x&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;\u03b2 (t)+\u03b5 (t). This approach provides an alternative to standard longitudinal data methods used in the biological sciences, where less and noisier data necessitate parametric modeling. The methodology is illustrated by an application in ergonomics.\n      </p>", "Context: Many safety initiatives have been transferred successfully from commercial aviation to health care. This article develops a typology of aviation safety initiatives, applies this to health care, and proposes safety measures that might be adopted more widely. It then presents an economic framework for determining the likely costs and benefits of different patient safety initiatives. Methods: This article describes fifteen examples of error countermeasures that are used in public transport aviation, many of which are not routinely used in health care at present. Examples are the sterile cockpit rule, flight envelope protection, the first-names-only rule, and incentivized no-fault reporting. It develops a conceptual schema that is then used to argue why analogous initiatives might be usefully applied to health care and why physicians may resist them. Each example is measured against a set of economic criteria adopted from the taxation literature. Findings: The initiatives considered in the article fall into three themes: safety concepts that seek to downplay the role of heroic individuals and instead emphasize the importance of teams and whole organizations; concepts that seek to increase and apply group knowledge of safety information and values; and concepts that promote safety by design. The salient costs to be considered by organizations wishing to adopt these suggestions are the compliance costs to clinicians, the administration costs to the organization, and the costs of behavioral distortions. Conclusions: This article concludes that there is a range of safety initiatives used in commercial aviation that could have a positive impact on patient safety, and that adopting such initiatives may alter the safety culture of health care teams. The desirability of implementing each initiative, however, depends on the projected costs and benefits, which must be assessed for each situation.\n      </p>", "This work is centred around the definition of problems posed by the ergonomics study of typists chairs. The results showed that secretarial work does not consist of a single task but is in fact made up of a variety of activities. A chair designed for this kind of work should take into consideration the variety of activities and the transition from one activity to another. With this in mind the principal factors to take into account are seat height, position and shape of the back support, the presence or not of arm rests and their structure. It has become evident that the recommandations given in the literature are not in agreement mainly resulting from the lack of anthropom\u00e9trie studies and the data published being based on theoretical rather than experimental criteria.

The two main innovations being introduced in combination were (1) integrating traditional workplace health protection (e.g., ergonomics, industrial hygiene) with health promotion (e.g., assisting workers in improving health behaviors) and (2) introducing a bottom-up participatory model for engaging employees in innovative iterative design efforts to enhance both components of this integrated program. In the program, which was modeled after participatory ergonomics programs, teams of workers engage in the iterative design of workplace interventions to address their prioritized health concerns with the support of a multilevel steering committee. The integrated approach being tested can complement existing worksite safety and health initiatives and promote organizational learning, with expected synergistic effects.\n      </p>", "Few, if any, regulations over the past decade have received as much publicity or engendered such controversy as the ergonomics regulation of the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA). Some may see the ergonomics rule as the paradigmatic instance of procedural hurdles holding up and eventually destroying a regulation. This article examines the role that procedure played in the ergonomics rulemaking. Lessons are drawn from an analysis of the four publicly available versions of the regulation and interviews with seven high-ranking officials at OSHA and the Small Business Administration. Of the procedural hurdles faced by OSHA, the notice-and-comment requirement had the largest impact on the final rule. OMB review and requirements to conduct a cost-benefit analysis served largely as a fire alarm to political overseers, and the required small business panel had largely symbolic effects. The more traditional control of congressional budgetary oversight had the greatest effect by delaying the rule for three years, and thus eventually doomed OSHA's attempts to regulate.\n      </p>", "Le vocable d'Ergonomie cognitive (EC) est apparu, voici maintenant une quinzaine d'ann\u00e9es, pour donner une identit\u00e9 \u00e0 une communaut\u00e9 scientifique en voie d'organisation. Depuis, cette communaut\u00e9 s'est \u00e9tendue et son objet d'\u00e9tude s'est progressivement d\u00e9fini dans un contexte d'o\u00f9 les tensions ne sont pas absentes. Cet article ne pr\u00e9tend pas imposer une d\u00e9finition du domaine, comme celle d'une orthodoxie sans appel. Bien au contraire, il s'efforce d'ouvrir un d\u00e9bat, en tentant de d\u00e9crire les aspects les plus saillants du domaine, tel qu'il se pr\u00e9sente actuellement, tout en proposant des \u00e9volutions qui peuvent para\u00eetre souhaitables. Relevant directement de l'Ergonomie, mais revendiquant toutefois une certaine individualit\u00e9, l'EC en h\u00e9rite de la pr\u00e9occupation essentielle de construire et d'appliquer des connaissances susceptibles d'am\u00e9liorer les conditions du travail (en l'occurrence, du travail cognitif, par opposition \u00e0 des aspects plus physiologiques, qui sont, bien entendu, \u00e9galement importants). Dans la tradition de l'Ergonomie des Syst\u00e8mes Hommes-Machines, l'EC se concentre plus particuli\u00e8rement sur les interactions entre l'homme et son environnement de travail cognitif. Dans cet environnement s'ins\u00e8rent \u00e9galement les aspects collectifs du travail, que renforce la complexit\u00e9 croissante des syst\u00e8mes de production. Cette paternit\u00e9 \u00e9vidente ne doit toutefois pas faire perdre de vue que l'EC est historiquement issue d'un courant de recherche davantage ancr\u00e9 dans l'Informatique : l'\u00e9tude des Interactions Homme-Ordinateur (hci : Human-Computer Interaction). Bien que les deux communaut\u00e9s s'entrem\u00ealent, l'EC se distingue de ce courant en ne se restreignant pas \u00e0 l'\u00e9tude des interactions avec les ordinateurs : l'environnement cognitif du travailleur ne se limite \u00e9videmment pas aux ordinateurs, m\u00eame si ces derniers y prennent une place de plus en plus grande. L'EC s'inscrit \u00e9galement dans le vaste champ, en pleine expansion, des Sciences de la Cognition (SC). L'EC est un domaine pluridisciplinaire qui doit b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des interactions entre les disciplines des SC : psychologie, informatique, linguistique, neurosciences, etc. Mais, dans ce champ, elle apporte une originalit\u00e9 irr\u00e9ductible, celle de privil\u00e9gier le point de vue humain sur l'interaction, ce qui la distingue notamment du g\u00e9nie cognitif (cognitive engineering), davantage centr\u00e9 sur la machine. La psychologie cognitive est un appui majeur de l'EC, pour autant qu'une attention particuli\u00e8re soit d\u00e9volue aux outils cognitifs externes de l'activit\u00e9. Domaine d'application de la psychologie, l'EC est aussi un domaine de recherche original par rapport aux produits des m\u00e9thodologies du laboratoire. En situation de travail, les connaissances mises en oeuvre par le \u00ab sujet \u00bb dans les t\u00e2ches examin\u00e9es sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement mieux contr\u00f4l\u00e9es et mieux d\u00e9finies. Si, pour l'instant, les interactions entre l'EC et l'intelligence artificielle sont souvent, \u00e0 tort, r\u00e9duites \u00e0 l'extraction des connaissances et \u00e0 la mod\u00e9lisation cognitive de l'op\u00e9rateur humain, l'avenir reste certainement ouvert. L\"'amelioration des capacit\u00e9s de d\u00e9veloppement d'aides plus sophistiqu\u00e9es, utilisables et efficaces, ne manquera pas de faire porter une plus grande attention sur les r\u00e9els besoins d'aide qu'ont les op\u00e9rateurs. On sera aussi amen\u00e9 \u00e0 adopter plus largement le point de vue de la coop\u00e9ration, beaucoup plus riche que celui de la simple interaction. A r\u00e9duire trop outrageusement le travail informatis\u00e9 \u00e0 l'utilisation de logiciels, on perd de vue que l'ctivit\u00e9 de travail d\u00e9passe largement l'utilisation de logiciels. C'est bien pourquoi il serait dangereux que l'EC soit trop concentr\u00e9e sur l'environnement informatique du travail. Comme toute science appliqu\u00e9e, l'EC rencontre les difficult\u00e9s inh\u00e9rentes \u00e0 la prise en compte de la complexit\u00e9, sans pouvoir se r\u00e9fugier dans les paradigmes exp\u00e9rimentaux de la recherche dite de base, dont la validit\u00e9 \u00e9cologique (cognitive) reste souvent douteuse. Elle renvoie forc\u00e9ment aux disciplines qui la composent des connaissances sur les situations complexes et oriente vers des r\u00e9ductions exp\u00e9rimentales plus pertinentes. Comme tout domaine pluridisciplinaire, l'EC se doit d'am\u00e9liorer la communication entre diverses disciplines. En particulier, dans une perspective pragmatique, elle est amen\u00e9e \u00e0 composer des crit\u00e8res d'\u00e9valuation de diff\u00e9rentes origines, pour avancer vers la satisfaction d'un objectif d'optimisation des syst\u00e8mes hommes-machines. Pour ce faire, elle s'aappuie non seulement sur les disciplines de la cognition, mais aussi sur les disciplines plus techniques qui traitent des contenus de connaissances que la cognition repr\u00e9sente et traite. Initiating a debate on Cognitive Ergonomics (CE), this paper tries to give an account of the state of this multidisciplinary domain, which is made from opposing interests and forces. What is the nature and purpose of CE? We argue it focuses on interaction between workers and their cognitive environments, with the aim of improving work conditions, from the human viewpoint. What are its methodologies and techniques, its applications and products? We stress the originality of this domain which is dealing with complexity and multidisciplinary evaluation criteria. How is it related to its neighbouring disciplines? We consider CE as a multidisciplinary field and show the similarities and differences with Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Cognitive Science.\n      </p>", "Objectives: To examine the efficacy of a participatory ergonomics intervention in preventing musculoskeletal disorders among kitchen workers. Participatory ergonomics is commonly recommended to reduce musculoskeletal disorders, but evidence for its effectiveness is sparse. Methods: A cluster randomised controlled trial among the 504 workers of 119 kitchens in Finland was conducted during 2002\u20132005. Kitchens were randomised to an intervention (n = 59) and control (n = 60) group. The duration of the intervention that guided the workers to identify strenuous work tasks and to seek solutions for decreasing physical and mental workload, was 11 to 14 months. In total, 402 ergonomic changes were implemented. The main outcome measures were the occurrence of and trouble caused by musculoskeletal pain in seven anatomical sites, local fatigue after work, and sick leave due to musculoskeletal disorders. Individual level data were collected by a questionnaire at baseline and every 3 months during the intervention and 1-year follow-up period. All response rates exceeded 92%. Results: No systematic differences in any outcome variable were found between the intervention and control groups during the intervention or during the 1-year follow-up. Conclusions: The intervention did not reduce perceived physical work load and no evidence was found for the efficacy of the intervention in preventing musculoskeletal disorders among kitchen workers. It may be that a more comprehensive redesign of work organisation and processes is needed, taking more account of workers' physical and mental resources.\n      </p>", "This paper discusses a number of approaches to modeling some aspects of the ergonomics of bumblebee colonies and should be regarded as a prolegomenon to the modeling of insect societies. I have raised many more questions than are answered. My intent has been to formulate these questions in precise terms. A concisely posed question is, however, only the first step toward understanding a phenomenon; the value of a model lies not only in its capacity to explain the unknown but also to suggest new experiments. If the models developed herein provoke such experimentation, my efforts will have been amply rewarded.\n      </p>", "Les principaux courants de l'ergonomie contemporaine sont analys\u00e9s et illustr\u00e9s, en particulier \u00e0 partir des communications au dernier Congr\u00e8s de l'Association internationale d'Ergonomie (Paris, juillet 1991) : l'ergonomie classique des \u00ab Human Factors \u00bb , \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance anglo-saxonne, l'ergonomie centr\u00e9e sur l'activit\u00e9 des op\u00e9rateurs, pr\u00e9sente surtout dans les pays francophones, et enfin les tentatives r\u00e9centes de la \u00ab Macroergonomie \u00bb pour fonder l'ergonomie sur des bases plus larges que le poste de travail.

The latter trend is criticised not because of its objectives but because of the models and methods used. Proposals for a research programme to integrate \"micro\" and \"macro\" are outlined.\n      </p>", "Musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and mental health are all associated with the physical and psychosocial conditions of work, as well as with individual health behaviors. An integrated approach to workplace health-promotion programs should include attention to the work environment, especially in light of recent findings that work organization influences so-called lifestyle or health behaviors. Macroergonomics provides a framework to improve both physical and organizational features of work and, in the process, to empower individual workers.

Methods\u2014The consultative team identified, assessed, and recommended controls for manual handling and other injury risks. Data on injuries counted before and after implementation of the team's recommendations were obtained for the cleaning services study group, an orderly services comparison group, as well as cleaners from a peer hospital and for the State of Western Australia. Evaluation of the four groups was undertaken 3 years after the end of the study period, to allow maturation of the costs of the claims (adjusted to July 1998 consumer price index) and hours lost from work. Results\u2014Statistical analysis showed that implementation of the recommendations significantly reduced numbers and rates of injury, but not the severity of injury, in the cleaning services study group. There was no difference in numbers or severity of injuries for the comparison groups before and after implementation of the recommendations. Conclusions\u2014The recommendation of the consultative team can produce a meaningful and sustained reduction in rates of injury within an at risk population. The results support a consultative approach to reducing workplace injuries from manual handling. The team process has potential for application to occupational groups at risk of exposure to other types of hazards.\n      </p>", "In a study of a colony of Bombus vosnesenskii, the nest contents and net inflow and net outflow of sugar and pollen were analyzed at different times during the colony cycle. When the founding queen of the colony was active and the larva/worker ratio was .92 the new queens (34% of 400 colony adults) did not forage for either pollen or nectar, and they removed both from the colony's food stores. Sugar stores were about 5.6 times the daily inflow, and pollen stores were only one fourth the daily inflow. Later, when the founding queen had died and the colony had an 11.5 larva/worker ratio, new queens constituted 60% of the colony population (43 bees) and were the primary providers of both pollen and nectar for the remaining drone brood. On the average, individual new queens brought in twice the amount of sugar per foraging trip as workers.

Arising from the accumulated impact of daily work activities on the body, these injuries do not fall neatly within either the \"accident\" or \"disease\" categories which comprise workers' compensation laws. As a result, courts and legislatures have struggled to properly evaluate workers' compensation claims for these injuries. This Note looks at the legal treatment of cumulative trauma injuries in light of the \"original bargain\" of workers' compensation, where workers give up a tort remedy against their employers in exchange for guaranteed, but limited, compensation for work-related injuries. In doing so, this Note undertakes a comprehensive comparison of litigated cumulative trauma cases in the tort and workers' compensation systems. Ultimately, this Note argues that judges must use the original bargain as an interpretative lens when deciding cumulative trauma cases, and points to ergonomics--the science of the workplace--as a significant new tool for determining whether such injuries are work-related.\n      </p>", "Ergonomie cognitive et fiabilit\u00e9 de la cognition, \u2014 Bien que les statistiques globales en cette mati\u00e8re doivent \u00eatre prises avec pr\u00e9caution, il est clair que ce qu'on a coutume de qualifier d'erreur humaine s'est accru avec l'introduction des nouvelles technologies.

Statistical data show that, as new technologies have been invading work situations, the occurrence of \"human errors\" has been increasing. This stresses the prominent role of human cognition, hence also reliability of cognition. Cognitive Ergonomics, which attempts to consider system design with the characteristics of the joint cognitive system (operator and machine) as a frame of reference, is the best approach to this question. A methodology to assess the reliability of cognition is outlined, which combines task analysis (specifying the needs for both operational and assistance support) and reliability analysis (on an approximate cognition basis).\n      </p>", "This ergonomie survey comprised 163 small workplaces with a total of 2,400 employees. In 1976 the establishments reported 15 cases of job-related low-back pain and two cases of upper arm conditions to the insurance companies. Poor work postures related to musculoskeletal strain occurred in all the workplaces surveyed, but the faults differed considerably from those usually encountered in medium-sized and large companies. In small enterprises the jobs can be alternated and are varied, and thus the effects of temporary strenuous postures and movements are alleviated. Characteristically, the production and environmental layout of the small establishments often seems to be temporary and poorly planned, at least from an ergonomic point of view. The concept of ergonomics and its practical applications are not as familiar in small workplaces as in larger ones. A greater part of the problems detected could have been avoided if ergonomic know-how had been available. Be it as it may, most failures could be easily reduced or even eliminated by the promotion of ergonomic information and training among proprietors and employees. From the health point of view the most notable ergonomic problems were those associated with materials handling, i.e., manual lifting and carrying. Only 20 % of the lifting conditions fulfilled recommendations. Some 400 jobs would have required supplementary items, most commonly an auxiliary work top or a seat for resting. Most ergonomic problems were encountered in industrial places of work. Ergonomic faults and defects rarely imperil health and safety, but they quite often affect welfare and comfort at work. It is suggested that the staff providing occupational health services should, in the context of their visits to a place of work, survey the work conditions also from an ergonomic point of view and alert the establishment to ergonomic problems. They should also help to review plans for new, expanded, or remodelled facilities. Lifting and carrying postures and the opportunity for relaxation need the most medical attention, particularly in monotonous jobs, precision work, and other jobs causing sustained exertion to one part of the body.\n      </p>", "Long-term epidemiologic studies on large numbers of night and rotating shift workers have suggested an increase in the incidence of breast and colon cancer in these populations. These studies suffer from poor definition and quantification of the work schedules of the exposed subjects. Against this background, the pathophysiology of phase shift and phase adaptation is reviewed. A phase shift as experienced in night and rotating shift work involves desynchronization at the molecular level in the circadian oscillators in the central nervous tissue and in most peripheral tissues of the body. There is a change in the coordination between oscillators with transient loss of control by the master-oscillator (the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus, SCN) in the hypothalamus. The implications of the pathophysiology of phase shift are discussed for long-term health effects and for the design of ergonomic work schedules minimizing the adverse health effects upon the worker.\n      </p>", "The collection and handling of colony resources such as food, water, and nest construction material is often divided into subtasks in which the material is passed from one worker to another. This is known as task partitioning. When material is transferred directly from one individual to another, queueing delays frequently occur because individuals must sometimes wait for a transfer partner. A stochastic simulation model was written to study the effect of colony size on these delays. Queueing delay decreases roughly exponentially with colony size because stochastic fluctuations in the arrival of individuals are lower in larger colonies. These results support empirical studies of Polybia occidentalis and other theoretical studies of honeybees. The effect of the relative number of individuals in the two subtask groups was also studied. There is a unique optimal ratio of the number of workers associated with each of the subtasks that simultaneously minimizes mean queueing delay and maximizes colony nectar\u2010processing rate. Deviations from this optimal ratio, for example, as a result of forager mortality or changes in nectar productivity that affect foraging trip duration, increase mean queueing delays greatly, especially in smaller colonies.\n      </p>", "The collection and handling of colony resources such as food, water, and nest\u2010construction material is often divided into subtasks in which the material is passed from one worker to another. This is known as task partitioning. If tasks are partitioned with direct transfer of material between foragers and receivers, queueing delays can occur as individuals search or wait for a transfer partner. Changes in environmental conditions and relative number of foragers and receivers affect these delays as well as colony ergonomic efficiency. These delays are used in recruitment in both honeybees and Polybia wasps. This study investigates the distribution of queueing delays and the information content and quality of those delays using a stochastic\u2010simulation model. Information quality increases with colony size. When the relative proportions of foragers and receivers are suboptimal, the group in excess has better information. Individuals can increase information quality of delays by two mechanisms: averaging over consecutive trips and averaging over multiple transfers within a trip where direct transfer occurs. We suggest that multiple transfer occurs in the honeybee in order to improve information quality.\n      </p>", "Les pratiques de recherche en ergonomie cognitive, visant l'acquisition et la validation de connaissances de conception, exigent de sp\u00e9cifier des probl\u00e8mes de conception, pour que ces connaissances puissent faire la preuve de leurs capacit\u00e9s \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre ces probl\u00e8mes.

Cognitive Ergonomics research practices of acquiring and validating design knowledge require the specification of design problems, such that this knowledge can be shown to solve these problems. Operational problems are rejected as appropriate expressions for the acquisition, but not for the application, of such knowledge. There is a need, then, to develop a specification of design problems for research, problems nevertheless having a relationship with operational problems. This paper describes and illustrates a framework for expressing such Cognitive Ergonomie design problems, using an air traffic management-like micro-world. A design problem is expressed informally as: to design users interacting with computers to perform effective work. The illustration includes both framework models (that is, design problem; worksystem; domain; performance; and operator domain representation) and their operationalisation as data. The paper concludes that, because they are less complex, microworlds may be a better initial development environment for specifying design problems for Cognitive Ergonomics research, than either operational or macro-worlds.\n      </p>", "Notice and comment provisions in agency rulemaking provide an important mechanism for the public to contribute to policy. Yet there is limited research on how interest groups participate in this process. California's passage of an ergonomics standard in 1997, the only current state statute in the country, provides a useful, high salience policy case for examining public commentary. Between an initially proposed comprehensive standard and the enactment of a much weaker regulation occurred the largest public response in California's state Occupational Safety and Health Administration history. Through a detailed content analysis of the notice and comment submissions we identify features of participation and claims-making that differ between business and nonbusiness submissions. Business groups were the large majority of participants and also presented a disproportionate amount of evidence, using an \"abstract-technical\" policy frame to assert the illegitimacy of the ergonomics standard. Labor, public health organizations and private citizens represented less than one-third of the participants and relied primarily on experiential information and a \"concretized-moral\" characterization of policy issues in support of the standard. The existence of these distinct \"interpretive communities\" that mobilize different resources raises questions about whether public commentary can fulfill its purported \"democratic accountability\" purpose as well as underline the limitations of appealing to scientific expertise for solving complex policy problems.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The study population comprised gainfully employed (&gt;17 hours per week) men and women in the municipality of Norrt\u00e4lje, altogether 392 cases and 1,511 controls. Cases were defined as persons seeking care because of neck or shoulder disorders by any caregiver in the region. The study began in 1994 and continued to 1997. We assessed physical and psychosocial exposures by questionnaires and interviews. The pattern of seeking care for neck or shoulder disorders differed between men and women. Among men, work with vibrating tools [relative risk (RR) = 1.6], not having a fixed salary (RR = 1.9), and low demands in relation to competence (RR = 1.5) were the strongest risk indicators obtained in analyses stratified for age and previous symptoms. Among women, repetitive hand or finger movements (RR = 1.6), constrained sitting (RR = 1.6), not having a fixed salary (RR = 2.0), and solitary work (RR = 1.8) were the strongest risk indicators. A large proportion of the general population was exposed to several of these moderately harmful conditions, and their concomitant effect may explain the high incidence of neck and shoulder disorders in the general working population.\n      </p>", "International research and practices are reviewed with regard to cultural, social, economic, health, and physical-technological features of needs, standards, and codes regulating the residential environment.

We examined behavioral repertoires, behavioral correlates of adult development, and spatial distributions within the hive to explore the mechanisms that produce behavioral variation among middle-age honey bees (Apis mellifera). Individually labeled undertakers, guards, food storers, and wax workers exhibited a broad range of task-related behavior, but bees tagged as undertakers were more likely to subsequently remove a corpse from the hive and handle a corpse compared to other middle-aged bees. The activity level of undertakers was similar to other task groups, suggesting that undertaking specialists were neither hyper-active \"elites\" nor quiescent \"reserves\" that become active only when a dead bee stimulus is present. Undertakers also were more likely to remove debris and to remain in the lower region of the hive or near the entrance, even when not engaged in corpse removal; both preferences may promote colony efficiency by reducing inter-task travel times. Guards and undertakers were less likely to perform behavior normally associated with young bees compared to food storers and wax workers. Undertakers and guards also initiated foraging at earlier ages than the other task groups. These results suggest that undertakers and guards may be slightly developmentally advanced compared to food storers and wax workers. There also was evidence for lifetime differences in behavioral preferences which could not be explained by differences in adult development. Bees tagged as undertakers were more likely to subsequently remove a dead bee during their entire pre-foraging career compared to other task groups or members of their general age cohort. Differences in both the rate of adult development and individual behavioral preferences, both of which may be subject to genetic and environmental influences, are important determinants of inter-individual variation among honey bees of middle age.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "The analysis of caste ratios and their effect on colony efficiency can be approached by linear programming models. In the formulation offered here, account has been taken of certain general features of organization and behavior peculiar to insect societies; selection was assumed to be at the colony level; and the optimization goal was given as the maximum production of new queens and males by a mature colony whose size has an upper limit characteristic of the species. Even in their elementary form, the linear models here produced some interesting new conclusions, among which are the following: 1. Different kinds of contingencies, for which distinct behavioral responses are evolved (e.g., invasion by enemies, larval hunger, nest fouling), will be met by the colony as a whole in such a way that each kind of contingency causes about the same amount of reduction in average queen production. 2. Castes, including both physical variants and temporal behavioral stages, will tend to be proliferated in evolution until there is one and only one distinct caste specialized to meet each contingency. 3. The weight of workers belonging to a given caste at a given moment will increase in evolution according to the frequency and importance of the contingency to which it is specialized. 4. Under most, but not all, circumstances, it is of advantage to the colony progressively to increase the degree of specialization of each caste. 5. The more specialized the caste becomes, and in general the more efficient it becomes, the less will be its representation in the colony. This inverse relation between ability and numbers, which is a consequence of selection at the colony level, is the direct opposite of what would be predicted from selection at the level of the individual organism. 6. Proliferation of castes should be countered by those contingencies whose changes in frequency through time are poorly autocorrelated and paced so as to be difficult to track genetically. Certain changes in the environment can result in a caste being dropped, a result that at first seems paradoxical. This is due to the fact that, even though the caste is still the best one to handle a contingency that continues to be important, its presence nonetheless results in lowered efficiency of the colony as a whole. 7. The more specialized a caste has become, the less likely it is to be dropped from the optimal mix due to fluctuation in the environment. This, too, is the opposite of what would be expected if selection were operating at the level of the organism rather than at the colony level. 8. Certain empirically determined qualities of physical castes in ants and termites are consistent with the result of this ergonomic theory and, for the moment at least, seem best explained by it.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Wilson's paper is an interesting example of a current trend in evolutionary theory, in which methods of economic analysis become useful. The survival and diffusion of colonies of social insects is measured essentially by the number of virgin queens surviving. The colonies are endangered by various contingencies. The different castes in the colony have different comparative advantages in dealing with the different contingencies. Each insect in the colony imposes a cost of maintenance which may be measured roughly by its weight, and the weights differ among castes. Survival of a given number of virgin queens in the face of the different contingencies can be achieved by varying combinations of the different castes. Presumably the colony structure most fit to survive is that in which the numbers in the different castes minimize the total weight of the colony for given survival of virgin queens. This gives rise to a linear programming problem whose solution has biologically interesting implications for the degree of specialization of the different castes and for their proportions. Resource scarcity is a common characteristic of the biological world, of which humans are part. It is therefore not surprising that the same modes of analysis find applications in both biology and economics. After all, Charles Darwin has reported that the idea of natural selection came to him from a reading of Malthus. What the economist must envy in the biologist and possibly seek to emulate is the array of qualitative and quantitative data to check his or her theories and guide the development of new ones.\n      </p>", "Social organization is generally assumed to increase colony efficiency and survival; however, little quantitative information is available to support this assumption. Polymorphism is an important aspect of labor division in colonies of the fire ant, Solenopsis invicta. Our objective was to investigate the effect of fire ant polymorphism on brood production efficiency. We set up standardized polymorphic colonies with a full range of worker sizes and artificial monomorphic colonies that contained only small, medium or large workers respectively. Polymorphic colonies produced brood at about the same rate as colonies composed of only small workers (Fig. 2A). Colonies composed of only medium workers produced about 30% less brood, and colonies composed of only large workers produced little or no brood at all. This pattern was independent of colony size; however, smaller colonies (0.75 g, live weight) produced almost twice as much brood per gram of workers as larger colonies (3.0 g). Additional experiments revealed that the size of workers in the artificial monomorphic colonies affected all stages of brood rearing. Large workers not only inhibited the development of early and late instar larvae (Fig. 4), but also reduced the queen's oviposition rate (Fig. 3). Brood production efficiency on an energetic basis was determined by dividing the grams of brood produced per unit time by the energetic costs expended for the maintenance and production of each worker size class. Worker maintenance costs were estimated from respiration, while production costs were determined from the caloric content of worker tissue divided by their average longevity. Worker respiration per milligram body weight decreased about 40% as body size increased (Fig. 5). Large workers lived about 50% longer than small workers (Fig. 6) and contained 9% more energy per milligram of tissue (Fig. 7). Energetic efficiency in polymorphic colonies was approximately 10% higher than in colonies composed of only small workers (Fig. 9). In other words, when food supplies are limiting, polymorphism may offer a slight advantage in brood production.\n      </p>", "This article presents the methodology and results of an experimental study which had for goal the evaluation of the effectiveness and the simplicity of a multi-functional wrist-watch operated by voice as compared to a similar watch operated by push buttons.

Our findings highlight that \"management\" is not a monolithic entity and managerial structures are often marked by divisions in priorities, including health and safety.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

(NUMMI) is a GM-Toyota joint venture that has been lauded by some for achieving performance based on high employee involvement, and criticized by others for intensifying work and harming workers. In 1993, OSHA cited NUMMI for paying insufficient attention to ergonomic issues during the introduction of a new car model. The authors analyze the origins of NUMMI's ergonomic problems and the responses of the company, union, and regulators. They also discuss a more ergonomically successful model introduction two years later. This case suggests that although employee involvement does not eliminate all divergence of interests between management and workers, it can change the terms of that divergence. When management reliance on employee involvement is complemented by strong employee voice and strong regulators, managers may find it in their interest to improve safety as a means of maintaining high employee commitment and thereby improving business performance.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Speed of implementation requires that these designs be constructed in a virtual world. Digital human models are required for these virtual worlds for the exploration of vehicle and manufacturing designs from an ergonomic perspective. This article provides an overview of the ergonomic issues and statistical methods for human motion modeling. We first describe methods for modeling the basic elements of motion, decomposed into univariate curves, three-dimensional trajectories, and orientation trajectories. We then present methods for combining the components of the motion into a coherent whole. Two application examples in truck driver behavior and sheet metal assembly illustrate the methodology.\n      </p>", "Noise and vibration were measured in the cabs of 35 locomotives from 15 locomotive series. Noise exposure was estimated from measurements of \u00c1-weighted equivalent noise levels with personal noise dose meters. For the evaluation of the frequency and fluctuation level, noise samples were recorded under different operating conditions. Forty-five percent of the measured equivalent noise levels exceeded 85 dB during a measuring period of 0.5\u2014 2 h. Vibration was measured from the seat of the locomotive cab, at the foot of the seat, and at the floor level. The most harmful vibration was detected between 1 and 3 Hz of the 1/3 octave band, the 8-h risk limit of ISO standard 2631 often being exceeded in this range. The thermal climate in 20 locomotive cabs was evaluated under both summer and winter conditions with the measurement of temperature, velocity, relative humidity of the air, and globe temperature. The results were compared with the international comfort and health standards for climatic conditions. The analyses indicated nonuniform air temperature and draft in the cabs. These discomforts were caused by the cold air flow and the low surface temperature of the windows in winter. The thermal climate parameters often exceeded the comfort limit in summer. Diesel exhaust constituents were measured in the air of four roundhouses and of nine cabs during a trip. Four constituents with the highest dilution coefficients were chosen for measurement, namely, oxides of nitrogen, acrolein, formaldehyde, and total dust. The Finnish threshold limit values of these substances were not exceeded. The highest values were obtained in the sheds, where the exposure times were very short. Ergonomie surveys utilizing spatial measurements, observation, photography, and interviews were made for the ten most common Finnish locomotive series in order to provide for recommendations both for the design of new locomotive types and for the modification of those in use. The features requiring the most urgent attention were connected with climbing in and out of the cab, as well as with the design of the seats, the controls, and the instrument board. The steps were usually in an upright angle, positioned at unequal intervals, and slippery; therefore the ascent and descent were dangerous. The seats were defective in design and poorly adjustable. The seat of the locomotive assistant was unfeasible in many cabs. The arrangement of the dials on the instrument board was often confusing.Many of the controls were far from the engineer and inadequately designed.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "We experimentally tested whether foraging strategies of nectar-collecting workers of the honeybee (Apis mellifera) vary with colony state. In particular, we tested the prediction that bees from small, fast growing colonies should adopt higher workloads than those from large, mature colonies. Queenright \"small\" colonies were set up by assembling 10 000 worker bees with approximately 4100 brood cells. Queenright \"large\" colonies contained 35 000 bees and some 14 500 brood cells. Thus, treatments differed in colony size but not in worker/brood ratios. Differences in workload were tested in the context of single foraging cycles. Individuals could forage on a patch of artificial flowers offering given quantities and qualities of nectar rewards. Workers of small colonies took significantly less nectar in an average foraging excursion (small: 40.1 \u00b1 1.1 SE flowers; large: 44.8 \u00b1 1.1), but spent significantly more time handling a flower (small: 7.3 \u00b1 0.4 s; large: 5.8 \u00b1 0.4 s). When the energy budgets for an average foraging trip were calculated, individuals from all colonies showed a behavior close to maximization of net energetic efficiency (i.e., the ratio of net energetic gains to energetic costs). However, bees from small colonies, while incurring only marginally smaller costs, gained less net energy per foraging trip than those from large colonies, primarily as a result of prolonged handling times. The differences between treatments were largest during the initial phases of the experimental period when also colony development was maximally different. Our results are at variance with simple models that assume natural selection to have shaped behavior in a single foraging trip only so as to maximize colony growth.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Along with ergonomie factors, such as forceful and repeated exertion and certain postures, vibration has been cited as a factor of chronic nerve and tendon disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome and tendinitis. The arguments for the contribution of vibration come from epidemiologic studies, clinical case analyses, and studies of shortterm effects. It is well established that vibration stimulates muscle contraction, which is called the tonic vibration reflex. It is also known that vibration reduces tactility and that tactility affects the amount of force exerted to hold or manipulate a given object. For localized vibration exposure of the hand and arm to occur, the hand must grip a vibrating object. Vibration may increase the risk of chronic tendon and nerve disorders by increasing the force exerted in repetitive manual tasks. This close relationship between force and vibration, and difficulties in measuring force and vibration in manual work, makes it very difficult to determine their relative contributions in epidemiologic and clinical studies.\n      </p>"], "words": {"pollen": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "ergonomie": {"number": 4, "prob": 3.312505952159133e-05}, "all": {"number": 1,
