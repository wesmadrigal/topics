Update logic is an example of a logical framework which takes the dynamics of drawing inferences into account by modelling information growth as discarding of possibilities. This paper shows how information logics like update logic can fruitfully be studied by linking their dynamic principles to static 'correctness descriptions'. Our theme is exemplified by providing a sound and complete HoarelPratt style deduction system for update logic. The Hoare/Pratt correctness statements use modal propositional dynamic logic as assertion language and connect update logic to the modal propositional logic S5. The connection with S5 provides a clear link between the dynamic and the static semantics of update logic. The fact that update logic is decidable was noted already in [2]; the connection with S5 provides an alternative proof. The S5 connection can also be used for rephrasing the validity notions of update logic and for performing consistency checks.

FAs extend RAs by a binary fork operator and are axiomatized by adding three equations to RAs equational axiomatization. A proper FA is an algebra of relations where the fork is induced by an injective operation coding pair formation. In contrast to RAs, FAs are representable by proper ones and their equational theory has the expressive power of full first-order logic. A square semantics (the set of arrows is \u1d4e x \u1d4e for some set \u1d4e) for arrow logic was defined by Y. Venema. Due to the negative results about the finite axiomatizability of representable RAs, Venema provided a non-orthodox finite axiomatization for arrow logic by adding a new rule governing the applications of a difference operator.

On the basis of a bimodal structure we also provide a semantics for intuitionistic stable sets.\n      </p>", "We add a limited but useful form of quantification to Coalition Logic, a popular formalism for reasoning about cooperation in game-like multi-agent systems. The basic constructs of Quantified Coalition Logic (QCL) allow us to express such properties as \"every coalition satisfying property P can achieve \u03c6\" and \"there exists a coalition C satisfying property P such that C can achieve \u03c6\". We give an axiomatisation of QCL, and show that while it is no more expressive than Coalition Logic, it is nevertheless exponentially more succinct. The complexity of QCL model checking for symbolic and explicit state representations is shown to be no worse than that of Coalition Logic, and satisfiability for QCL is shown to be no worse than satisfiability for Coalition Logic. We illustrate the formalism by showing how to succinctly specify such social choice mechanisms as majority voting, which in Coalition Logic require specifications that are exponentially long in the number of agents.\n      </p>", "In this paper two different natural deduction systems for hybrid logic are compared and contrasted.

Moreover, we explore a connection between the master modality and hybrid logic: We show that if attention is restricted to bidirectional frames, then the expressive power of the master modality is exactly what is needed to translate the bounded fragment of first-order logic into hybrid logic in a truth preserving way.

This representation has an important application \"towards dynamic quantum logic\", namely in describing the temporal indeterministic propagation of actual properties of physical systems.

Algorithmic logic is the study of basic statements concerning algorithms and the algorithmic rules of inference between such statements. As shown in [1], the threat of paradoxes, such as the Curry paradox, requires care in implementing rules of inference in this context. As in any type-free logic, some traditional rules will fail.

As such it was created by mathematicians. Not regarding its anticipations in Scholastic logic and in the rationalistic era, its continuous development began with George Boole's The Mathematical Analysis of Logic of 1847, and it became a mathematical subdiscipline in the early 20th century. This style of presentation cuts off one eminent line of development, the philosophical development of logic, although logic is evidently one of the basic disciplines of philosophy. One needs only to recall some of the standard 19th century definitions of logic as, e.g., the art and science of reasoning (Whateley) or as giving the normative rules of correct reasoning (Herbart). In the paper the relationship between the philosophical and the mathematical development of logic will be discussed. Answers to the following questions will be provided: 1. What were the reasons for the philosophers' lack of interest in formal logic? 2. What were the reasons for the mathematicians' interest in logic? 3. What did \"logic reform\" mean in the 19th century? Were the systems of mathematical logic initially regarded as contributions to a reform of logic? 4. Was mathematical logic regarded as art, as science or as both?\n      </p>", "The topic of this paper is the question whether there is a logic which could be justly called the logic of inference. It may seem that at least since Prawitz, Dummett and others demonstrated the proof-theoretical prominency of intuitionistic logic, the forthcoming answer is that it is this logic that is the obvious choice for the accolade. Though there is little doubt that this choice is correct (provided that inference is construed as inherently single-conclusion and complying with the Gentzenian structural rules), I do not think that the usual justification of it is satisfactory. Therefore, I will first try to clarify what exactly is meant by the question, and then sketch a conceptual framework in which it can be reasonably handled. I will introduce the concept of 'inferentially native' logical operators (those which explicate inferential properties) and I will show that the axiomatization of these operators leads to the axiomatic system of intuitionistic logic. Finally, I will discuss what modifications of this answer enter the picture when more general notions of inference are considered.\n      </p>", "We show the faithful embedding of common knowledge logic CKL into game logic GL, that is, CKL is embedded into GL and GL is a conservative extension of the fragment obtained by this embedding.

Another important application is to obtain a Gentzen-style sequent calculus formulation of CKL and its cut-elimination.

In this paper we eliminate this dilemma, providing a way for maintaining both. Via the introduction of the \"missing\" disjunctions in the lattice of properties of a physical system while inheriting the meet as a conjunction we obtain a complete Heyting algebra of propositions on physical properties. In particular there is a bijective correspondence between property lattices and propositional lattices equipped with a so called operational resolution, an operation that exposes the properties on the level of the propositions. If the property lattice goes equipped with an orthocomplementation, then this bijective correspondence can be refined to one with propositional lattices equipped with an operational complementation, as such establishing the claim made above. Formally one rediscovers via physical and logical considerations as such respectively a specification and a refinement of the purely mathematical result by Bruns and Lakser (1970) on injective hulls of meet-semilattices. From our representation we can derive a truly intuitionistic functional implication on property lattices, as such confronting claims made in previous writings on the matter.

In order to do so, two systems are put forward so that the notions of pragmatic validity and pragmatic truth can be accommodated.

Order for him is not based on the concepts of logic but is instead revealed through an ideal notational series. He states that logic is \"transcendental\".
