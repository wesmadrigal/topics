{"total_words": 1368, "documents": ["Scholars from diverse fields have begun to study the intersection of emotion and law. The notion that reason and emotion are cleanly separable-and that law rightly privileges and admits only of the former-is deeply engrained. Law and emotion scholarship proceeds instead from the belief that the legal relevance of emotion is both significant and deserving of (and amenable to) close scrutiny. It is organized around six approaches, each of which is defined and discussed: emotion-centered, emotional phenomenon, emotion theory, legal doctrine, theory of law, and legal actor. Drawing on the analytic value of the proposed taxonomy, any exploration of law and emotion should strive to identify which emotion(s) it takes as its focus; distinguish implicated emotion-driven phenomena; explore relevant and competing theories of the emotions; limit itself to a particular type of legal doctrine; expose underlying theories of law; and make clear which legal actors are implicated. Directions for future research are discussed and cross-disciplinary collaboration encouraged.\n      </p>", "Much has been written about how law as an institution has developed to solve many problems that human societies face. Inherent in all of these explanations are models of how humans make decisions. This article discusses what current neuroscience research tells us about the mechanisms of human decision making of particular relevance to law. This research indicates that humans are both more capable of solving many problems than standard economic models predict, but also limited in ways those models ignore. This article discusses how law is both shaped by our cognitive processes and also shapes them. The article considers some of the implications of this research for improving our understanding of how our current legal regimes operate and how the law can be structured to take advantage of our neural mechanisms to improve social welfare.\n      </p>", "Now, twenty years on, what is law and literature in the face of the shift from graphic to visual, from text to image, from fiction to film?\n      </p>", "Several studies have investigated whether unilateral divorce laws raised divorce rates, with mixed results. This paper asks whether unilateral, and no-fault, divorce laws influenced family formation. Besides their interest to policy makers, such effects may help theorists understand the mechanisms through which laws affect behavior. The results suggest that no-fault laws slightly reduced fertility, and unilateral divorce modestly increased divorce and legitimacy. However, the pattern of effects is not consistent with any of the hypotheses reviewed, and the estimated magnitudes suggest that changes in divorce law were not a major cause of changing family structure.\n      </p>", "This paper describes experimental results of equilibrium partitioning of several significant paint solvents and formaldehyde between air and water to quantify the potential for capturing and retaining the constituents in spraybooth scrubber water during automotive painting. The compounds studied are toluene, n-butanol, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl propyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl amyl ketone, butyl cellosolve, butyl cellosolve acetate, butyl carbitol, and n-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone. A set of field data collected at a Ford Motor Company assembly plant was also analyzed to determine whether data were consistent with the equilibrium phenomenon. The primary findings include: (a) There were more than six orders of magnitude difference in the Henry's law constants among the solvents studied. A solvent with a smaller constant is less easily stripped from water. The Henry's law constants decrease in the following order: toluene and xylenes &gt; methyl ethyl ketone &gt; n-butanol &gt; butyl cellosolve acetate &gt; butyl cellosolve &gt; formaldehyde &gt; butyl carbitol &gt; n-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone. (b) Field data showed accumulation of n-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone and stable concentrations of butyl carbitol, butyl cellosolve, and n-butanol in the paint-sludge pit water during a 2-month period. Stable concentrations indicate a continuous, balanced capture and stripping of the solvents. Data were consistent with measured Henry's law constants. (c) The low Henry's law constant for formaldehyde is the result of the fact that it is hydrated when dissolved in water.\n      </p>", "This article examines a variety of ways in which social scientists make cultural argument about the law, including (1) holding culture as the independent variable to explain variations in law, (2) taking law as an independent variable to explain culture, or (3) considering law as culture. The authors explore each general strategy and its advantages and disadvantages in turn and argue that the law as culture perspective is one of the most interesting recent developments in sociolegal thought.\n      </p>", "Martial law is thought to be not a complete absence of law, nor a special kind of law - a scheme of legal regulation - but, rather, an absence of law prescribed by law under the concept of necessity - a legal black hole, but one created, perhaps even in some sense bounded, by law. A. V. Dicey claimed that martial law in this sense is 'unknown to the law of England,' which is 'unmistakable proof of the permanent supremacy of the law under our constitution.' This article explores Dicey's claim against the backdrop of the legal events that followed Governor Edward John Eyre's proclamation of martial law in reaction to the Jamaica uprising of 1865 and his ruthless suppression of the uprising. It might seem that these events, as well as later experience, show that Dicey was na\u00efvely wrong. But the article argues that a proper understanding of the jurisprudential issues and of that experience support his view.\n      </p>", "John Wigmore's list of Legal Novels\u2014really several lists compiled over the first thirty years or so of the twentieth century\u2014helped to generate the modern embodiment of the Law and Literature movement. The bibliographical element, although of course controversial as the Law and Literature canon developed through multiple debates about what should and should not be read and discussed, proved essential in locating a group of stories that lawyers were to live with throughout their professional careers. More than bibliographical, however, Wigmore's accompanying text stressed the democratization through great literature of a legal profession otherwise prone to misunderstanding the human realities with which it was theoretically always concerned. A defined group of fictional narratives\u2014stories about law, lawyers, trials, statutes\u2014was to reawaken in the legal reader the attachment to democratic values conveyed by literature through its acute awareness of human needs and the failure of great institutions to serve them. This essay marks the thirtieth anniversary of its author's update of the Wigmore list. I trace the very active debates that have informed Law and Literature since that 1976 Northwestern Law Review article, and I celebrate the expansion to foreign shores of knowledge about Wigmore, as Law and Literature proponents both home and abroad have embraced Wigmore's democratic impulse for law.\n      </p>", "Globalization of law may be defined as the worldwide progression of transnational legal structures and discourses along the dimensions of extensity, intensity, velocity, and impact. We propose that a theory of the global penetration of law will require at least four elements\u2014actors, mechanisms, power, and structures and arenas. A comparison of four approaches to globalization and law\u2014world polity, world systems, postcolonial globalism, and law and economic development\u2014indicates considerable variation in perceived outcomes and gaps in explanation, but with possible complementarities in both outcomes and explanatory factors. Research demonstrates that globalization is variably contested in several domains of research on law: (a) the construction and regulation of global markets, (b) crimes against humanity and genocide, (c) the diffusion of political liberalism and constitutionalism, and (d) the institutionalization of women's rights. We propose that the farther globalizing legal norms and practices are located from core local cultural institutions and beliefs, the less likely global norms will provoke explicit contestation and confrontation. Future research will be productively directed to where and how global law originates, how and when global norms and law are transmitted and enforced, and how global-local settlements are negotiated.\n      </p>", "How are general relations of law and morality typically conceived in an environment of Anglo-saxon common law? This paper considers some classical common law methods and traditions as these have confronted and been overlaid with modern ideas of legal positivism. While classical common law treated a community and its morality as the cultural foundation of law, legal positivism's analytical separation of law and morals, allied with liberal approaches to legal regulation, have made the relationship of legal and moral principles more complex and contested. Using ideas from Durkheim's and Weber's sociology, I argue that the traditional common law emphasis on an inductive, empirical treatment of moral practices has continuing merit, but in contemporary conditions the vague idea of community embedded in classical common law thought must be replaced with a much more precise conceptualisation of coexisting communities, whose moral bonds are diverse and require a corresponding diversity of forms of legal recognition or protection.\n      </p>", "The two-dimensional turbulent wall jet on a flat surface without free stream is analysed at a large Reynolds number, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions. The open mean equations of the turbulent boundary layer are analysed in the wall and wake layers by the method of matched asymptotic expansions and the results are matched by the Izakson-Millikan-Kolmogorov hypothesis. In the overlap region, the outer wake layer is governed by the velocity defect law (based on Um, the maximum velocity) and the inner layer by the law of the wall. It is shown that the overlap region possesses a non-unique solution, where the power law region simultaneously exists along with the log law region. Analysis of the power law and log law solutions in the overlap region leads to self-consistent relations, where the power law index, \u03b1, is of the order of the non-dimensional friction velocity and the power law multiplication constant, C, is of the order of the inverse of the non-dimensional friction velocity. The lowest order wake layer equation has been closed with generalized gradient transport model and a closed form solution is obtained. A comparison of the theory with experimental data is presented.\n      </p>", "An interesting fact about customary international law is that the only way you can propose an amendment to it is by breaking it. How can that be differentiated from plain law-breaking? What moral standards might apply to that sort of international conduct? I propose we use ones analogous to the ordinary standards for distinguishing civil disobedients from ordinary law-breakers: would-be law-makers, like civil disobedients, must break the law openly; they must accept the legal consequences of doing so; and they must be prepared to have the same rules applied to them as everyone else.\n      </p>", "In this article I explore ways of reading Mesopotamian legal records as narratives and so derive insights into Mesopotamian legal, social, and cultural norms.

Five specific translational barriers (relevance/litigation dynamics, complexity, framing, judicial and administrative skepticism, and inadequate demand) are identified. If researchers on health care quality want to have an impact on competition law and policy they must confront and overcome these translational barriers.\n      </p>", "Through an examination of the innovative halakhic efforts of the French rabbinate during the nineteenth century to resolve tensions and contradictions between civil and Jewish law in the thorny area of marriage, this article sheds light on the extent to which French rabbis were prepared to harmonize Judaism with French civic norms. I first analyze rabbinic responses to clandestine religious marriages, which were illegal according to French law but technically valid according to Jewish law. I then discuss the efforts of the French rabbinate to harmonize conflicts between Jewish and civil law that arose from the collective naturalization of Algerian Jewry in 1870. Finally, I address two controversial rabbinic proposals for the harmonization of Jewish and civil divorce following the reinstitution of civil divorce during the Third Republic. As I show, in addressing the problems of clandestine marriages, recalcitrant brothers-in-law, and recalcitrant spouses, the religious leaders of French Jewry exercised moderation as they did in other religious matters.\n      </p>", "Codes of medical ethics issued by professional organizations typically contain statements affirming the importance of confidentiality between patients and health-care practitioners. Seldom, however, is the confidentiality obligation depicted as absolute. Instead, exceptions are noted, the most common of which is that health-care professionals are justified in breaching the confidence of a patient if required by law to do so. Reasons that might be given to support this exception are critically discussed in this paper. The conclusion argued for is that this is not a legitimate exception to the confidentiality rule.\n      </p>", "This paper discusses several issues at the intersection of law and brain science. It focuses principally on ways in which an improved understanding of how evolutionary processes affect brain function and human behaviour may improve law's ability to regulate behaviour. It explores sample uses of such 'evolutionary analysis in law' and also raises questions about how that analysis might be improved in the future. Among the discussed uses are: (i) clarifying cost-benefit analyses; (ii) providing theoretical foundation and potential predictive power; (iii) assessing comparative effectiveness of legal strategies; and (iv) revealing deep patterns in legal architecture. Throughout, the paper emphasizes the extent to which effective law requires: (i) building effective behavioural models; (ii) integrating life-science perspectives with social-science perspectives; (iii) considering the effects of brain biology on behaviours that law seeks to regulate; and (iv) examining the effects of evolutionary processes on brain design.\n      </p>", "Relations between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law are often depicted as conflictual despite a paucity of research on their interaction. A 1985 exploratory study of 44 mothers-in-law and 55 daughters-in-law in two-generation farm or ranch families found that differences in goals and values and lack of communication skills were frequent problems. Contrary to expectations, however, living in close proximity did not increase the stress levels of either group of women. These and other findings should be useful to extension agents and other applied professionals as they plan programs for and counsel these individuals.

This brief article attempts to explain how to decode such references and thus get to the reports. Those wishing to pursue the matter further are referred to more detailed explanations. This article deals primarily with English case law and is up to date as of December 1987.\n      </p>", "In order to clarify the relationship between morality and law, it is necessary to define both concepts precisely. Cultural realities refer to concepts which are more specifically defined if we focus towards the genealogy of those realities, that is to say, their motivation, function and aim. Should we start from legal anthropology, comparative law and history of law, law arises as a social technique which coactively imposes ways of solving conflicts, protecting fundamental values for a society's co-existence. Values subject to being protected are proposed by morality, the latter making subordination of law to morality inevitable. This explains that a great number of modern constitutions include a reference to fundamental moral values, that is to say, they have explicitly positivised moral contents. Legal reasoning, at all levels and expressions, needs to appeal to the aforementioned values. Constitutional reasoning, international law, legislative activity and judicial practice are studied to verify the latter. This subordination of law to morality sets out a serious problem: moralities are cultural realities which are only valid for a specific society. In order for law not to fall in a not very rational legal relativism, law should not be subordinated to morality, but to ethics, the latter understood as cross-cultural morality. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was a step forward in this sense.\n      </p>", "The so-called \"Chinese view of law\" is but one among many ways of understanding law in early China. Early Chinese thinkers held varied views of law's origins in nature or culture, its relationship to the sacred, and its connection with sagehood. Confucians tended to present law as an artificial and ineffective instrument for the promotion of moral order. In contrast, Mohist and Huang-Lao thinkers consistently viewed law as a natural and effective tool for the moral rectification of society when wielded by the sagely ruler, but differed in their conceptions of the sacred and the nature of the cosmic order. /// On parle souvent de \" La perspective chinoise sur la loi \" comme si elle \u00e9tait unique. Cependant, les penseurs chinois anciens avaient plusieurs perspectives diff\u00e9rentes sur les origines naturelles ou culturelles des lois et sur leurs rapports avec le sacr\u00e9 et avec la sagesse. Les Confuciens pr\u00e9sentaient surtout la loi comme un moyen artificiel et inefficace de promouvoir l'ordre moral. Au contraire-quoique les Mohistes et les Huanglaos aient eu des notions tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rentes du sacr\u00e9 et de l'ordre cosmique-les deux voyaient surtout la loi comme un outil naturel et efficace qu'un roi \u00e9clair\u00e9 pouvait utiliser pour rectifier les m\u0153urs.\n      </p>", "Since the passage of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and more recent Federal legislation, managers, regulators, and attorneys have been busy in sorting out the legal meaning of fairness in employment. While ethical managers must follow the law in their hiring practices, they cannot be satisfied with legal compliance. In this article, we first briefly summarize what the law requires in terms of fair hiring practices. We subsequently rely on multiple perspectives to explore the ethical meaning of fairness in hiring. Ethical fairness underlies the law and regulations in this area, but goes beyond them as well. We conclude by demonstrating that ethical hiring practices enable managers to make better hiring decisions.\n      </p>", "The Trafficking Victims 'Protection Act of 2000 has been presented as an important tool in combating the exploitation and abuse of undocumented workers, especially those forced into prostitution. Through a close reading of the legislation and the debates surrounding its passage, this article argues that the law makes strategic use of anxieties over sexuality, gender, and immigration to further curtail migration. The law does so through the use of misleading statistics creating a moral panic around \"sexual slavery,\" through the creation of a gendered distinction between \"innocent victims\" and \"guilty migrants,\" and through the demand that aid to victims be tied to their willingness to assist in the prosecution of traffickers. As a result, the legislation is less a departure from, than of a piece with, other recent antisex and antiimmigrant policies.\n      </p>", "The traditional law of the Ede in Vietnam is valuable in a number of ways: it provides insights into the ethnic society and culture of the Ede; it illustrates the original cultural heritage of the Ede; and it preserves folk knowledge for governing a community. For every society, the stability of the basic village organization is very important. The more modern a society becomes, the more attention is paid to the problem of local management. This article shows that traditional law was and is an important aspect of village management among the Ede.\n      </p>", "Gordon Tullock critiques two specific aspects of the common law system: the adversary system of dispute resolution and the common law process of rulemaking, contrasting them with the inquisitorial system and the civil law systems respectively. Tullock's general critique is straightforward: litigation under the common law system is plagued by the same rent-seeking and rent-dissipation dynamics that Tullock famously ascribed to the process of legislative rent-seeking. The article concludes that Tullock's critique of the adversary system appears to be stronger on both theoretical and empirical grounds than his critique of the common law system of rulemaking.\n      </p>", "This article attempts to familiarize family professionals with how family law has been applied to stepfamilies and discusses how social science research findings may assist in the process of legal reform. Family law is reviewed in the areas of: a) stepparents' financial support of stepchildren (both during marriage and after termination of the remarriage) and b) stepparent custody and visitation following termination of the remarriage. After evidence is presented that suggests adjustment to stepfamilies may be related to legal issues, some tentative recommendations for legal reform are made.\n      </p>", "Ehrenberg presented the simple law-like relationship log(w) = 0.8h + 0.4 \u00b1 0.04 between the weight and height of children aged 5-13 years. Several researchers have confirmed that this relationship holds, irrespective of the child's ethnic, racial, gender and social class. In anthropometry, a weight-height relationship is used to measure the nutritional status of children. For this purpose, the World Health Organization have adopted the National Center for Health Statistics population as the international reference population. The relationship between the World Health Organization-National Center for Health Statistics anthropometric standards and Ehrenberg law-like relationship is examined. Differences between the weight-for-height relationship in anthropometry and the law-like relationship between weight and height for children are small and can be attributable to functional differences. It is found that an Ehrenberg law-like relationship can be extended to include children who are under 5 years old. Criteria for using the law-like relationship to assess the nutritional status of these children are thus suggested. The criteria are evaluated using anthropometric data of a sample of 513 children from a rural district of Botswana. The results indicate that the proposed method of using the law-like relationship to assess nutritional status is much simpler and at least as reliable as the existing methods in anthropometry.\n      </p>", "What is the Constitution? John Marshall says fundamental law, not as the alloy of compromise Alexander Hamilton intended \"merely to regulate the general political interests of the nation,\" but as the puritanical fulfillment in law of the Paulist prescription \"to come out among them and be separate.\" As Marshall admonished, \"if a law be in opposition to the constitution, if both the law and the constitution apply to a particular case,\" the resolution must conform to the \"constitution disregarding the law.\" This is the accepted and universally acclaimed meaning of breaking the law in America. Yet as Socrates rhetorically inquired, and the Framers dogmatically insisted, whence could a constitution derive if not from the self, \"what is government itself but the greatest of all reflections of human nature?\" If it is also true that \"justice is the end of government . . . the end of civil society,\" so it must also be in the beginning of man in man, his self-recognition as just. The Constitution, thus framed, is the latter-day mirror in which every man sees himself as \"paramount\" justice, privileged no less than John Marshall, to say what the law is for himself and against all others.\n      </p>", "This article analyzes the relationship between daughters-in-law and mothers-in-law in upper-middle-class families in urban South Korea. The relationship is a process in which competing patriarchal and gender ideologies are called upon. As nuclearization of the family increases, daughters-in-law and mothers-in-law no longer share a common residence. However, this does not mean that families are reduced to their most elementary nuclear form and achieve independence from extended kin. Rather, nuclear family members are deeply involved in the lives of extended kin and, at the same time, they are influenced by the latter. It is no coincidence that daughters-in-law and mothers-in-law take important, yet different roles in kin-work. This article argues that changing relationships between daughters-in-law and mothers-in-law do not simply concern two female family members. They exemplify many dimensions of the rapidly industrializing society and highlight the dialectic interplay between patriarchal and late-capitalistic ideologies.\n      </p>", "Methods suggested by LeQuesne for eladistic analysis under Dollo's Law in the sense of Crowson are shown to be inappropriate, as they may lead to clustering by symplesiomorphy.

It quibbles with the reliance on American models of scholarship in derivative European Law and Literature research as well as with much American work. The latter assumes the universality of the adversarial trial system, the ubiquity of the debate about how to interpret the Constitution, and the variety of social and civil rights issues such interpretation entails as well as the common law tradition of arguing through precedent. To explore the limitations inherent in prevailing modes of scholarship, the essay compares the story lines that inflect three nations' modes of conducting Law and Literature. It concludes by describing scholarly dead ends in Law and Literature as well as points of expansion. The latter include the move to regard law as a cultural practice and to embrace the visual and the aesthetic in a more generous notion of the literary.\n      </p>", "The House of Lords in F v West Berkshire Health Authority [1989] considered the lawfulness of providing care and treatment for a mentally incapacitated adult. They did not, however, directly consider the use of restraint to enable the provision of care in the face of resistance from the patient. The law has since had good cause to give consideration to this important issue. This paper establishes the present law in the context of using restraint to deliver care. Although the legal principles established have derived from what might be considered to be \"hard cases\", life-and-death cases, they apply to all aspects of routine medical, dental and nursing care. Further, the paper considers the recent government proposals and the effect those proposals may have on the routine care of such patients.\n      </p>", "Context: Obesity constitutes a major public health challenge in the United States. Obesogenic environments have increased owing to the consumption of calorie-dense foods of low nutritional value and the reduction of daily physical activity (e.g., increased portion sizes of meals eaten in and out of the home and fewer physical activity requirements in schools). Policymakers and public health practitioners need to know the best practices and have the competencies to use laws and legal authorities to reverse the obesity epidemic. For instance, statutes and regulations at the federal, state, and local levels of government have been implemented to improve nutritional choices and access to healthy foods, encourage physical activity, and educate consumers about adopting healthy lifestyles. Methods: In an effort to understand the application of laws and legal authorities for obesity prevention and control, in June 2008 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention convened the National Summit on Legal Preparedness for Obesity Prevention and Control. An outcome of this summit will be the publication of the proceeding's white papers written by eight law and subject-matter experts with substantive contributions from summit participants, which will identify actionable options that sectors and organizations at various jurisdictional levels can consider adopting. Findings: Law has played a critical role in the control of chronic diseases and the behaviors that lead to them. The use of a systematic legal framework-the use of legislation, regulation, and policy to address the multiple factors that contribute to obesogenic environments-can assist in the development, implementation, and evaluation of a variety of legal approaches for obesity prevention and control. Conclusions: Although public health-focused legal interventions are in an early stage and the direct and indirect impact they may have on the obesity epidemic is not yet understood, efforts such as the summit and white papers should help determine potentially viable legal interventions and assess their impact on population-level change.\n      </p>", "Traditional tests searching for human influence in data assume that, barring such influence, first significant digits (FSD) are uniformly distributed. More recent tests rely on Benford's law, postulating that lower digits are more likely than higher ones. I show that both patterns belong to a family arising from mixtures of uniforms, and characterize the FSD patterns for a one-parameter subset of the family. I also show that all family members exhibit decreasing FSD probabilities.

The only base-invariant distributions are shown to be convex combinations of two extremal probabilities, one corresponding to point mass and the other a log-Lebesgue measure. The main tools in the proof are identification of an appropriate mantissa \u03c3-algebra on the positive reals, and results for invariant measures on the circle.\n      </p>", "The relationship between law and violence is paradoxically structured: law is the opposite of violence, since legal forms of decision-making disrupt the spell of violence generating more violence. At the same time, law is itself a kind of violence; because it imposes a judgment that determines its \"subject\" like a curse. This article reads tragedy (notably Aesychylus's Oresteia and Sophocles' King Oedipus) as articulating this paradoxical entwinement between law and violence and uses this tragic insight for a critical discussion of Benjamin's \"Critique of Violence.\"\n      </p>", "This article engages both the \"construction of nature\" thesis and the project of legal geography to examine law as a culturally significant site wherein \"nature\" is produced. Because the meaning of \"nature\" is often a function of its contrasts with the category \"human,\" to participate in the construction of one is, almost by definition, to participate in the construction of the other. After discussing law as a site of cultural production in general terms, this article surveys a range of legal contexts in which the nature/human distinction is a central conceptual-political concern. These contexts include nature as externality (wilderness), animality (bestiality), and corporeality (reproductive technologies and the involuntary medication of inmates).

Locke followed Grotian natural law in constructing a just-war theory of slavery. Unlike Grotius, though, he severely restricted the theory, making it inapplicable to America. It only fit resistance to \"absolute power\" in Stuart England. Locke was nonetheless an agent of British colonialism who issued instructions governing slavery. Yet they do not inform his theory--or vice versa. This creates hermeneutical problems and raises charges of racism. If Locke deserves the epithet \"racist,\" it is not for his having a racial doctrine justifying slavery. None of this makes for a flattering portrait. Locke's reputation as the champion of liberty would not survive the contradictions in which new world slavery ensnared him. Evidence for this may be found in Locke's reception, including by Southern apologists for slavery.\n      </p>", "This chapter discusses the concept of class in an important subfield, the sociology of law. Class, a pivotal institution of society, was central to the earliest studies of legal institutions and of law and inequality in particular. More recently, class has played a less important role. This chapter argues for the continuing importance of class and provides examples of its potential use in contemporary sociolegal research. The first part reviews early work that employed class and instrumental models of the state. Grounded, anti-formal models of law provided a contrasting view. Following wider trends in the discipline, sociology of law turned from structural models to theories of law as an ideology, and most recently, as reviewed in the second part, to law as an element of consciousness and experience. While acknowledging the value of contemporary research that documents a deeply textured, paradoxical, and nuanced analysis of the role of law in society, the third part argues for theorizing the link between experience and context, including the role of social class, and presents a research agenda for a sociology of law, where the relationship between law and class is considered both as institution and experience.\n      </p>", "Far from being an Ivory Tower distraction, answering the ancient question of what the Sirens sang leads us to the narrative origins of our law.\n      </p>", "This article examines the distinction between public and private international law, arguing that it is not reflective of an organic, natural or inevitable separation. Rather, the distinction is presented as an analytical construct that evolved with the emergence of the bourgeois state. The public/private distinction provided the ideological conditions for the emergence of liberal market economies and, in law, formed the foundation for territorially individuated state authority. However, contemporary developments in capitalist production and finance are reconfiguring the private and public spheres and contributing to the empirical decline of the distinction. The distinction remains very powerful symbolically, however; this is attributed to the influence of neoliberal ideology that asserts the superiority of private law in the regulation of international commerce. An alliance between private and public authorities who are united in their commitment to the expansion of capitalism through disembedding international commerce from national, social and democratic controls is advancing this ideology and contributing to the troubling and paradoxical exercise of public authority by private actors.\n      </p>", "A new law has been passed by the Danish Parliament, establishing an ethical council.

Here, compliance with Murray's law was tested in the stem photosynthesizer Psilotum nudum, a seedless vascular plant. Psilotum nudum was chosen because the central stele does not provide structural support, which means that Murray's law is applicable, and because its simple shoot structure resembles the earliest vascular plants. Murray's law predicts that the sum of the conduit radii cubed ( $\\Sigma r^3$ ) should decrease in direct proportion with the volume flow rate (Q) to maximize the hydraulic conductance per unit vascular investment. Agreement with Murray's law was assessed by estimating the transpiration rate distal to a cross-section, which should determine Q under steady state conditions, and comparing that with the $\\Sigma r^3$ of that cross-section. As predicted, regressions between the $\\Sigma r^3$ of the cross-section and Q resulted in a linear relationship with a y-intercept that was not different from zero. Two more rigorous statistical tests were also unable to reject Murray's law. Psilotum nudum plants also increased their conductance per investment by having more conduits distally than proximally, which is more efficient hydraulically than equal or declining conduit numbers distally.\n      </p>", "This paper considers the complex interplay between ideologies of the law and of the state with reference to the enforcement of the Shops Act (1950) by one district council. The complex and contradictory manner of law, when mediated by a spatially-specific state apparatus, is explored. Emphasis is placed on the complex organizational nature of the state, the form that conflict over the actions of the state can take, and the charged and potentially contradictory ideological context within which the state operates. It is argued that ideologies of the law and procedures of the state serve to simultaneously constrain and enable the local state.\n      </p>", "Advances in evolutionary biology, experimental economics and neuroscience are shedding new light on age-old questions about right and wrong, justice, freedom, the rule of law and the relationship between the individual and the state. Evidence is beginning to accumulate suggesting that humans evolved certain fundamental behavioural predispositions grounded in our intense social natures, that those predispositions are encoded in our brains as a distribution of probable behaviours, and therefore that there may be a core of universal human law.\n      </p>", "Obesity is the costliest preventable health problem in the United States.

Traditional views in such disciplines as philosophy, religion, law, psychology and economics have differed over the role and usefulness of intuition and emotion in judging blameworthiness. Cognitive psychology and neurobiology provide new tools and methods for studying questions of normative judgment. Recently, a consensus view has emerged, which recognizes important roles for emotion and intuition and which suggests that normative judgment is a distributed process in the brain. Testing this approach through lesion and scanning studies has linked a set of brain regions to such judgment, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and posterior superior temporal sulcus. Better models of emotion and intuition will help provide further clarification of the processes involved. The study of law and justice is less well developed. We advance a model of law in the brain which suggests that law can recruit a wider variety of sources of information and paths of processing than do the intuitive moral responses that have been studied so far. We propose specific hypotheses and lines of further research that could help test this approach.\n      </p>", "Using data from a representative sample of middle-aged married persons, we compare men's and women's contact and assistance to older parents-in-law and parents. Women have more visits and phone contact with their parents than do men, and men talk on the phone more with their in-laws than do women. There are no gender differences in assistance patterns. Multivariate analysis shows that women contact and help parents more than in-laws, whereas for men there are no such differences. There is little direct evidence that the presence of one set of parents affects relations with the other. Our findings suggest that although women clearly give priority to relations with their own parents, men experience pulls in both directions.\n      </p>", "The paper offers a time-series test of Thirlwall's Law for Brazil during the 1890-1973 period. The results confirm the existence of a long-run relationship between Brazilian gross domestic product (GDP), terms-of-trade, and world income, as Thirlwall's Law predicts. In addition, an error correction model is estimated, which shows that adjusting toward Thirlwall's Law equilibrium explains a substantial part of total variation of real GDP in the short run.\n      </p>", "In 1964 the Ivory Coast codified its civil law and applied it equally to all persons in that multi-ethnic country. Evidence gathered in 1972-74 and 1982 shows that not all persons in the population are aware of or follow the new law. Women seem less cognizant of the law than men; certain ethnic groups seem less adherent to the law than others. The Diouia women queried are less comfortable with and less likely to use the law than their B\u00e9t\u00e9 neighbors in Gagnoa, Ivory Coast. Several explanations for this are possible including the groups' relative educational levels, religious affiliations and ethnic backgrounds. The explanations posited here concern ethnicity and these groups' social, politicai, and economic positions in Ivory Coast society.\n      </p>", "Centered on the controversy that erupted over a proposal to include men in the adultery law in the 1935 revised criminal code, this article demonstrates the role of public opinion in legal reform and reveals a new public urgency in the Republic to regulate male sexuality. The debate over the adultery law pitted women's groups, which invoked the Guomindang-endorsed discourse of equality between men and women to oppose retention of the late imperial law that punished only wives for adultery, against lawmakers, who sought to protect a man's relationship with his concubine\u2014now considered adulterous\u2014from the law. As the debate expanded, commentators expressed increasing concern over the threat posed by male adultery to family, society, and nation. In the end, the activism of women's groups and public consensus on the need to regulate male sexuality combined to pressure lawmakers to include men in the adultery law.\n      </p>", "Critical path models concerning project management (i.e. PERT/CPM) fail to account for work force behavioral effects on the expected project completion time In this paper, we provide a modelling framework for project management activities, that ultimately accounts for expected worker behavior under Parkinson's Law.

The developed model helps to examine the effects of information release policies on subcontractors of project activities, and to develop managerial policies for setting appropriate deadlines for series or parallel project activities.\n      </p>", "In \"Democracy and Tradition,\" Jeffrey Stout contends that American constitutional democracy constitutes a well-functioning moral and political tradition that is not hostile to religion, although it does not depend on any specifically religious claims. I argue that Stout's contention is supported by a consideration of the great common law subject of contracts, as taught to first-year law students across the United States. First, I demonstrate how contract law can fruitfully be understood as a Maclntyrean tradition. Second, I illustrate the moral richness of this tradition, and the mutually interpreting nature of rules and facts, by close attention to one particularly colorful case, Syester v. Banta. I conclude by suggesting that both religious and secular ethicists might find common law cases in general and contract law cases in particular to be a source of moral reflection that is substantively rich without being religiously divisive.\n      </p>", "This study investigates the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law relationship among black women. Subjects were 75 black middle-income women. Results indicate that phone contact with the mother-in-law, the interpersonal behavior \"wanted inclusion,\" and a compliant problem solving strategy with the mother-in-law significantly predicted mother-in-law adjustment. Women, however, are most likely to use an assertive problem solving strategy, and are more compliant with mothers than with mothers-in-law. Findings are discussed in terms of their implications to mother-in-law adjustment.\n      </p>", "In this paper I argue that competition law risks undermining institutional incentives toward higher corporate environmental performance. Firms are increasingly expected to influence the environmental standards of companies they invest in, lend to, or insure. This may be jeopardized if they are competing for those businesses, particularly in markets with information asymmetries. I examine the environmental implications of market competition, competition between regulators, and the particular case of insurance markets in which insurers fulfill both a market and a quasi-regulatory role. The core of the paper concerns an ongoing dispute between the European Commission and a group of mutual, non-profit-making marine insurers known as Protection and Indemnity (P&amp;I) Clubs, into which shipowners pool their environmental and other third-party liabilities. The Clubs try to allocate costs fairly so that the \"polluter pays,\" providing an incentive to minimize risk. Fourteen of these Clubs, containing about 90 percent of the world's merchant fleet, enter into a further scale of mutuality by collectively reinsuring one another. Mutuality at both scales, they claim, is dependent upon them not competing for members by setting unfairly low rates. The European Commission argues, in turn, that this agreement contravenes European competition law. Through an analysis of this case I demonstrate a potential conflict between competition law and \"private\" environmental regulation. I conclude by discussing the consequences of drawing disciplinary boundaries between policy areas and questioning the conceptualization of the economy which underpins competition law.\n      </p>", "This essay is an attempt to understand the significance of Barth's redefinition of the \"law/gospel\" rubric for political theology. Barth's thought is exposited at length, and illumined by comparison with Luther and Calvin. Luther emphasizes the distance between gospel and the law, distinguishing between serving God in the secular regiment, and serving Christ in the spiritual regiment. He thereby challenges the improper relation of state and church, but does so in a manner that can lead to a passive dualism. Calvin holds that preaching the law to the state includes preaching the gospel; thus, the church has a positive vision against which it can evaluate the state's service to God in Christ. This leads, however, to the danger of a 'clerical guardianship' of the state. Barth finds a positive connection between the two governments in the fact that both communities are based in Christ, in whom the gospel is their law. This grounds his high view of the state as predecessor to the heavenly kingdom, as well as a prophetic mission of the church to the state. This does not lead to a new Christendom, however, first, because Barth hopes not for a kingdom wrought by human hands, but for the Theocracy of God, and second, because Barth sees the fallen reality of both church and state, the state pagan and violent, and the church a poor witness. In the end, though Barth makes a strong case for supporting theological critique of the state, while avoiding Constantinianism, he is unable to solve the problem of how to connect the gospel and the law in the civil community.\n      </p>", "The history, empirical evidence and classical explanations of the significant-digit (or Benford's) law are reviewed, followed by a summary of recent invariant-measure characterizations. Then a new statistical derivation of the law in the form of a CLT-like theorem for significant digits is presented. If distributions are selected at random (in any \"unbiased\" way) and random samples are then taken from each of these distributions, the significant digits of the combined sample will converge to the logarithmic (Benford) distribution. This helps explain and predict the appearance of the significant-digit phenomenon in many different empirical contexts and helps justify its recent application to computer design, mathematical modelling and detection of fraud in accounting data.\n      </p>", "A strong law of large numbers for linear combinations of order statistics is proved under integrability conditions only.

The boundary-layer equations are solved in similarity form. The resulting similarity solutions for shear-thickening fluids are shown to have a finite-width crisis resulting in the prediction of a finite-width boundary layer. A secondary viscous adjustment layer is required in order to smooth out the solution and to ensure correct matching with the far-field boundary conditions. In the case of shear-thinning fluids, the similarity forms have solutions whose decay into the far field is strongly algebraic. Smooth matching between these inner algebraically decaying solutions and an outer uniform flow is achieved via the introduction of a viscous diffusion layer.\n      </p>", "In this paper, we suggest a new perspective, where Newton's second law of motion is replaced by a more general law which is a better approximation for describing the motion of seemingly rigid macroscopic bodies. We confirm a finding of Willis that the density of a body at a given frequency of oscillation can be anisotropic. The relation between the force and the acceleration is non-local (but causal) in time. Conversely, for every response function satisfying these properties, and having the appropriate high-frequency limit, there is a model which realizes that response function. In many circumstances, the differences between Newton's second law and the new law are small, but there are circumstances, such as in specially designed composite materials, where the difference is enormous. For bodies which are not seemingly rigid, the continuum equations of elastodynamics govern behaviour and also need to be modified. The modified versions of these equations presented here are a generalization of the equations proposed by Willis to describe elastodynamics in composite materials. It is argued that these new sets of equations may apply to all physical materials, not just composites. The Willis equations govern the behaviour of the average displacement field whereas one set of new equations governs the behaviour of the average-weighted displacement field, where the weighted displacement field may attach zero weight to 'hidden' areas in the material where the displacement may be unobservable or not defined. From knowledge of the average-weighted displacement field, one obtains an approximate formula for the ensemble averaged energy density. Two other sets of new equations govern the behaviour when the microstructure has microinertia, i.e. where there are internal spinning masses below the chosen scale of continuum modelling. In the first set, the average displacement field is assumed to be observable, while in the second set an average-weighted displacement field is assumed to be observable.\n      </p>", "Although the influence of law in shaping human use of land and water has long been recognized, the role of geographic factors in the resolution of legal disputes involving such resources is less appreciated. When the outcome of litigation or administrative procedures depends upon accurate understanding of geographic context and uncertainties, and such understanding is flawed, the legal process may become a faltering, costly exercise in futility. Such has been the case with the 20-year battle over the fate of Sears Island, a sizable tract of undeveloped coastal Maine at the head of Penobscot Bay. This controversy has reflected competition between economic and environmental goals in coastal zone management, the issue of local versus nonlocal control of resources, and the uneasy interaction of geography and law in the process of environmental impact assessment under the National Environmental Policy Act.\n      </p>", "Despite efforts to diversify faculty in predominantly White institutions, most law schools remain predominantly male and Caucasian.

The author also points out the mechanisms that scholars of color in law schools have used in an effort to combat racial and gender discrimination.\n      </p>", "We consider the impact of different choice-of-law regimes on the evolution of formal law. We follow an evolutionary approach to explain possible patterns of legal harmonization and competition. Some of them predict the universal diffusion of a single rule, even though not necessarily efficient.

The emergence of such lex mercatoria may further undermine the legislative incentives to switch to more efficient rules.\n      </p>", "Verdoorn's Law implies that the process of growth is a cumulative one with the \"manufacturing advanced\" economies growing at the expense of their \"less-advanced\" counterparts.

The findings indicate that the law holds in the case of Greece and that the spatial models (and the spatial-error one, in particular) perform better than the conventional ones. The results indicate that, in the long run, the process of \"cumulative causation\" can and does slow down in favor of the less-advanced regions.\n      </p>", "This article explores how children's literature sheds light on common understandings and background assumptions about the Anglo\u2013North American concept of the rule of law. Three popular texts from children's literature\u2014Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, Norton Juster's The Phantom Tollbooth, and J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\u2014offer a familiar basis from which to consider the social imaginary of the rule of law. Each text acts as its own case study disclosing troubling deficiencies in a fictional public law order and prompting a consideration of the rule of law's compatibility with command and control modes of rule, a reflection about its minimum moral content, and its relationship with substantive conceptions of justice such as human rights discourses. The author argues that these three encounters with fictional legal orders contribute to the social construction of the rule of law as a political good, a public discourse, and a constitutive component of democratic citizenship.\n      </p>", "The proposition that high levels of stress in daughters-in-law in two-generation farm families are correlated with the daughters-in-law's lack of integration into the extended family and family business systems was tested. Quality of the relationship with in-laws, a measure of integration into the extended family system, was significantly negatively correlated with stress. Perceived lack of decision-making responsibility, a measure of integration into the family business system, was also correlated with high stress levels. Implications for educators, business people, and family practitioners, as well as suggestions for future research, are discussed.\n      </p>", "One unprobed strand of Canada-U.S. racial history demanding examination and explanation is law's obfuscated role of collusion with race--a role that more often than not has aided and abetted racism and racial discrimination. Knowledge of this historical complicity and duplicity between law and race constitutes a precondition for understanding the \"material reality\" of the racism that daily blights and scars the lifescapes of Blacks in Canada today. Diasporic literacy demands that we start opening up the Canadian record so as to better comprehend how law as an institution has so often behaved with impunity and continues to operate as if there were nothing about Black people worth honoring! Though in matters of racism and racial discrimination we in Canada have experienced the law too often as a sword of oppression and so seldom as a shield of protection, law nevertheless remains too precious a tool for Black people to abandon.\n      </p>", "Alexandre Lefebvre's The Image of Law: Deleuze, Bergson, Spinoza presents a challenge to neo-Kantian liberal jurisprudence (represented by Hart, Dworkin, and Habermas) as well as a novel theory of judgment. Lefebvre constructs a \"dogmatic image of law\" out of a Kantian heritage discerned in key works of twentieth-century jurisprudence: the representative figures all think judgment according to Kantian categories and locate the act of adjudication in an act of subsumption. Deploying Deleuze's critique of the representational image of thought in a new context, Lefebvre claims that another mode of judgment\u2014one that would not stifle creativity and novelty by subjecting the unfamiliar to the logic of the familiar\u2014is possible. Bergson's theories of perception and memory are substantially reconfigured for a juridical context, and the virtuality of the law is assessed from this vantage point. Lefebvre argues that a theory of judgment based not on subsumption but rather on Bergsonian \"attention\" and the Deleuzian \"encounter\" provides new insight into the machinations of adjudication and the law more generally. Lefebvre's intervention is criticized for failing to engage with Deleuze and Guattari's work on law, Anglophone critical legal work, and Lacan's theory of desire and Law, all of which would have enhanced the breadth of the study. It remains, nevertheless, a significant contribution to theoretical jurisprudence and the philosophy of judgment.\n      </p>", "The contemporary Thai Theravada Buddhist monks Buddhadasa Bhikkhu and Phra Prayyudh Payutto espouse a version of natural law thinking in which the norms of good behavior derive from the nature of the world, specifically its features of conditionality, causality, karma and interdependence.

This paper (1) develops the notion of natural law in their thinking and (2) critically evaluates these ideas as a foundation for ethical thought, specifically asking whether such ideas recognize something of value in the individual per se and in individual freedom and, in an interdependent world, how one can challenge injustice or a brutal government.\n      </p>", "International trade models often postulate the existence of a representative price, i.e., the price which prevails at all markets.

Some suggest that our emerging understanding of the physical causes of human (mis)behaviour will have a transformative effect on the law. Others argue that new neuroscience will provide only new details and that existing legal doctrine can accommodate whatever new information neuroscience will provide. We argue that neuroscience will probably have a transformative effect on the law, despite the fact that existing legal doctrine can, in principle, accommodate whatever neuroscience will tell us. New neuroscience will change the law, not by undermining its current assumptions, but by transforming people's moral intuitions about free will and responsibility. This change in moral outlook will result not from the discovery of crucial new facts or clever new arguments, but from a new appreciation of old arguments, bolstered by vivid new illustrations provided by cognitive neuroscience. We foresee, and recommend, a shift away from punishment aimed at retribution in favour of a more progressive, consequentialist approach to the criminal law.\n      </p>", "Although many species possess rudimentary communication systems, humans seem to be unique with regard to making use of syntax and symbolic reference. Recent approaches to the evolution of language formalize why syntax is selectively advantageous compared with isolated signal communication systems, but do not explain how signals naturally combine. Even more recent work has shown that if a communication system maximizes communicative efficiency while minimizing the cost of communication, or if a communication system constrains ambiguity in a non-trivial way while a certain entropy is maximized, signal frequencies will be distributed according to Zipf's law. Here we show that such communication principles give rise not only to signals that have many traits in common with the linking words in real human languages, but also to a rudimentary sort of syntax and symbolic reference.\n      </p>", "There are two optima for maximizing hydraulic conductance per vasculature volume in plants. Murray's law (ML) predicts the optimal conduit taper for a fixed change in conduit number across branch ranks. The opposite, the Yarrum optimum (YO), predicts the optimal change in conduit number for a fixed taper. We derived the solution for YO and then evaluated compliance with both optima within the xylem of compound leaves, where conduits should have a minimal mechanical role. We sampled leaves from temperate ferns, and tropical and temperate angiosperms. Leaf vasculature exhibited greater agreement with ML than YO. Of the 14 comparisons in 13 species, 12 conformed to ML. The clear tendency towards ML indicates that taper is optimized for a constrained conduit number. Conduit number may be constrained by leaflet number, safety requirements, and the fact that the number of conduits is established before their diameter during development. Within a leaf, ML compliance requires leaf-specific conductivity to decrease from petiole to petiolule with the decrease in leaf area supplied. A similar scaling applied across species, indicating lower leaf-specific petiole conductivity in smaller leaves. Small leaf size should offset lower conductivity, and petiole conductance (conductivity/length) may be independent of leaf size.\n      </p>", "The law as a means of sociopolitical control in colonial states has gained significance as an issue in the recent historiography of Africa. This article discusses the making of a criminal case in colonial Kaoko, northwestern Namibia in the 1920s and 30s. It focuses on the problem of African voice and narrative and the ways in which they have been transformed into written evidence in the course of legal investigation. It demonstrates that the archival documents which emerged from this case require careful methodological scrutiny if they are to be used for the reconstruction of the region's past. It goes beyond colonial law as constituting a particular discourse to conceive colonial law as a space for intervention and agency for both colonized and colonizers. The central argument raised in the article is that while the South African administration in northwestern Namibia allegedly aimed at prosecuting culprits and securing evidence for their transgressions, men and women in Kaoko used colonial law as an arena for the negotiation of social and political issues. Concerned with the case's impact on the configuration of gender, the article shows how colonial law became both a site of male representation and power, and a space for female contestation of male claims to sociopolitical mastery.\n      </p>", "This article uses Hans Kelsen's theory of a legal system to take a fresh look at European Community law, and the relationship between the European Community, its Member States, and international law. It argues that the basis of the Community's legal legitimacy is indeterminate, and offers a model to accommodate that indeterminacy. This model is founded on a constructivist approach suggested to be particularly useful in the EC context. Using this approach, it is argued that the concepts of system, autonomy and sovereignty in the Community can only be understood through the recognition of a plurality of viewpoints, and that it is crucial, in describing the Community, to distinguish between a concept per se and the choice to adopt that concept.\n      </p>", "The imperative of judicial deference is arguably the primary driver of the Supreme Court's prisoners' rights jurisprudence. Yet taken as a body, the cases in this area reveal no principled basis for determining when deference is justified, what forms it may legitimately take, or the proper limits on its use. Instead, the mere mention of \u201cdeference\u201d has emerged as a catch-all justification for curtailing both the burden on prison officials to ensure constitutional prisons and prisoners' prospects for recovery even for arguably meritorious claims. The role of deference in prison law merits a more in-depth treatment than I am able to offer here. This essay is simply a first cut at the issue. As such, it does three things. First, it identifies three main forms that deference takes in this area and provides examples of the deployment of each. Second, it highlights moments in the PLRA cases where the Court has opted not to defer, and offers a preliminary hypothesis as to why this might be. Third and finally, it calls for a theory of deference for the prison law context, i.e., for the development of principles to guide judicial deference in prison law cases and to set appropriate limits on its use.\n      </p>", "Within the framework of individual developmental theory and intergenerational ambivalence, we exam- ined the complex dynamics of the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law relationship.

The women described the ambivalence many of them felt as they searched for their place in the family. Findings suggest that women of all ages may benefit from education about this critical relationship and need to develop skills to express themselves to their mothers-in-law/ daughters-in-law to facilitate adequate management of the ambivalence prevalent in this relationship.\n      </p>", "In order responsibly to decide whether there ought to be an international legal right of secession, I believe we need an account of the morality of secession. I propose that \"territorial\" and \"political\" societies have a moral right to secede, and on that basis I propose a regime designed to give such groups an international legal right to secede. This regime would create a procedure that could be followed by groups desiring to secede or by states desiring to resolve the issue of secession. It would give territorial political societies a legally recognized liberty to conduct a plebiscite on secession, and, assuming such a plebiscite is won by the secessionist side, a qualified right in international law to create a state without interference. Alan Buchanan has argued that proposals of this sort would create \"perverse incentives.\" I argue that there is no good reason to believe this. The point is to allow the legal regulation of secession in cases where there are active secessionist movements with legitimate moral claims, and to attempt to dampen the desire for secession in cases where secessionist sentiment is not well grounded in social and geographic reality.\n      </p>", "Objective: To assess the print media coverage of California's smokefree bar law in the state of California. Design: Content analysis of newspaper, trade journal, and magazine items. Subjects: Items regarding the smokefree bar law published seven months before and one year following the implementation of the smokefree bar law (June 1997 to December 1998). Items consisted of news articles (n = 446), opinion editorials (n = 31), editorials (n = 104), letters to the editor (n = 240), and cartoons (n = 10). Main outcome measures: Number and timing of publication of items, presence of tobacco industry arguments or public health arguments regarding law, positive, negative, and neutral views of opinion items published. Results: 53% of items published concerning the smokefree bar law were news articles, 47% were opinion items. 45% of items regarding the smokefree bar law were published during the first month of implementation. The tobacco industry dominated coverage in most categories (economics, choice, enforcement, ventilation, legislation, individual quotes), except for categories public health used the most frequently (government role, tactics, organisational quotes). Anti-law editorials and letters to the editor were published more than pro-law editorials and letters. Region of the state, paper size, presence of local clean indoor air legislation, and voting on tobacco related ballot initiatives did not have an impact on the presence of opinion items. Conclusions: The tobacco industry succeeded in obtaining more coverage of the smokefree bar law, both in news items and opinion items. The tobacco industry used historical arguments of restricting freedom of choice and economic ramifications in fighting the smokefree bar law, while public health groups focused on the worker protection issue, and exposed tobacco industry tactics. Despite the skewed coverage, public health groups obtained adequate attention to their arguments to keep the law in effect.\n      </p>", "To ascertain which conditions nurses believe should be in a law allowing active voluntary euthanasia (AVE). Design\u2014Survey questionnaire posted to registered nurses (RNs). Setting\u2014Australian Capital Territory (ACT) at the end of 1996, when active voluntary euthanasia was legal in the Northern Territory. Survey Sample\u2014A random sample of 2,000 RNs, representing 54 per cent of the RN population in the ACT. Main Measures\u2014Two methods were used to look at nurses' opinions. The first involved four vignettes which varied in terms of critical characteristics of each patient who was requesting help to die. The respondents were asked if the law should be changed to allow any of these requests. There was also a checklist of conditions, most of which have commonly been included in Australian proposed laws on AVE. The respondents chose those which they believed should apply in a law on AVE. Results\u2014The response rate was 61%. Support for a change in the law to allow AVE was 38% for a young man with AIDS, 39% for an elderly man with early stage Alzheimer's disease, 44% for a young woman who had become quadriplegic and 71% for a middle-aged woman with metastases from breast cancer. The conditions most strongly supported in any future AVE law were: \"second doctor's opinion\", \"cooling off period\", \"unbearable protracted suffering\", \"patient fully informed about illness and treatment\" and \"terminally ill\". There was only minority support for \"not suffering from treatable depression\", \"administer the fatal dose themselves\" and \"over a certain age\". Conclusion\u2014Given the lack of support for some conditions included in proposed AVE laws, there needs to be further debate about the conditions required in any future AVE bills.\n      </p>", "In this article a hypothesis is developed and tested that asserts that avoidance between son-in-law and mother-in-law is associated with culturally expected economic interaction between these relatives. On the grounds of both the correlation that was found and an analysis of the participants' views on son-in-law/mother-in-law avoidance, the custom is interpreted as a device for distinguishing the son-in-law/mother-in-law relationship from the husband-wife relationship in societies where these relationships tend to be similar as far as their economic aspect is concerned. The final part of the article seeks to identify the conditions that give rise to economic interaction between son-in-law and mother-in-law.\n      </p>", "Egyptian agriculture is heavily regulated by laws and administrative regulations. This paper explores some of the economic implications of two laws that are widely violated: the land allotment to cotton and the imposed quota for rice. Logit and probit models are utilized to assess factors which are associated with law violations in two villages. Violators of both laws tend to be poorer, have less owned land, have fewer number of land pieces, have fewer cattle, and are located nearer the free village markets than the nonviolators.\n      </p>", "The legal reform initiated during the Republican period brought sweeping changes to Chinese criminal law. Among those changes were increased discretionary powers afforded to judges when determining sentences. An examination of homicide cases in the Republican courts shows that when new Republican-era laws contradicted notions of justice carried over from late imperial society, jurists were able to use these newly expanded powers at sentencing to re-create Qing rulings and thereby bring Republican-era criminal justice closer to the judicial norms of the late imperial period.\n      </p>", "Arguments concerning law and social change call for a relationship between legitimacy, the rule of law, and respect for rights. To the extent that a government is subject to the rule of law, the human and civil rights of its citizens are advanced. When citizens can bring disputes concerning rights to court rather than fight in the streets, the rule of law is enhanced. Respect for rights and the rule of law are likely to make a government more acceptable and hence more legitimate. A basic requirement of legitimacy is that government advance everyone's share of primary social goods, their opportunity to participate in society and hence their basic rights. Rights are not only statements of ideals or entitlements but goals and tools for pursuit of those goals, means for pursuing law reform, advancing the rule of law, and enhancing society's legitimacy.\n      </p>", "The biogenetic law is restated in a falsifiable form; given an ontogenetic character transformation, from a character observed to be more general to a character observed to be less general, the more general character is primitive and the less general advanced. The law, as restated, may be generally valid. In any case, the ontogenetic argument is a valid direct technique of character phylogeny; the anatomical argument (\"outgroup comparison\") is an indirect technique, the paleontological argument is of uncertain status. Falsification of all three types of arguments is explored in an analysis of L. Agassiz's concept of \"threefold parallelism.\" Neoteny is a falsifier not of the biogenetic law, but of character phylogeny-of all three arguments. Phylogenetic reconstruction in its entirety appears to be an extrapolation of the orderliness of development.\n      </p>", "This paper examines a problematic occurrence of translation in Chaucer's Man of Law's Tale, specifically when Custance is understood by the Northumbrians as she speaks in her 'corrupt Latin' tongue. The paper argues that Custance's being understood is best explained by recognizing the tale's reliance on the hagiographical trope of xenoglossia, the sudden, miraculous ability to speak or understand a foreign language. By emphasizing the ambiguous nature of this moment of translation, however, Chaucer exposes the narrative conventions of different genres (saint's life, chronicle history, and romance) that allow foreign speakers to be understood through very different means.\n      </p>", "Freedom of expression is guaranteed by international treaties, but countries differ significantly in their view of the meaning of \"free expression\" and how it should be protected. Before the emergence of the Internet, each country could workably set its own ceiling for the protection of expression without having an adverse impact on other countries that might make a different choice. The borderless nature of the Internet makes it more difficult for despots and dictators to limit the access of their citizens to information from outside their countries' borders. But the conflict represented by this medium expresses itself in legitimate disputes over the application of national law. Each nation must apply its own rules of law without diminishing the freedoms available to citizens of other states. This article suggests that nations focus on applying the law of the country in which speech originates, following the view of the European Union.\n      </p>", "Let $\\{(\\Omega, \\mathscr{A}, \\mu_n), n \\geqq 1\\}$ be a sequence of probability spaces. Blum and Pathak [Ann. Math. Statist. 43 (1972) 1008-1009] proved a zero-one law for permutation invariant sets $A \\epsilon \\mathscr{A}^\\infty$; which includes the zero-one laws of Hewitt and Savage [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 80 (1955) 470-501] and Horn and Schach [Ann. Math. Statist. 41 (1970) 2130-2131] as special cases. The proper reason for this is shown to be the fact that the set of measures admitting the zero-one law of Blum and Pathak coincides with the set of all strong limit points of measures admitting the zero-one law of Horn and Schach.\n      </p>", "Discussions of Nazi law in legal philosophy are most commonly concerned with how the Nazis's use of law as a means to persecute their opponents demonstrates the essential amorality of law. Attention is often also paid to the institutional debasements and interpretive excesses that characterized the operation of the Nazi political courts. Within these discussions, however, little or no consideration is given to the specificities of the Jewish experience of Nazi law, nor to the fact that the role of law in determining the nature and quality of Jewish life stopped short of the extermination program. In this article, the author seeks to correct this neglect by exploring the questions for legal philosophy, as well as for scholarship that probes the connections between law and the Holocaust, that arise from an examination of the Jewish experience of Nazi law. Drawing primarily upon the thought of the mid- twentieth-century legal philosopher Lon L. Fuller, the author investigates what the apparent shift from legality to terror within the Nazi persecution of the Jews might reveal not only about the institutional features of that persecutory program but also about the nature of legality more generally.\n      </p>", "The essay defends the thesis that law has an inherently moral aspect. To the extent that law governs, one enjoys a degree of freedom (understood as independence from the power of another) which could exist in no other way. The essay responds to Kramer's criticisms of this argument, presented in an earlier issue of the University of Toronto Law Journal. It is suggested that Kramer misrepresents the argument in several respects. Once his misrepresentations are cleared out of the way, his position is revealed as being weak and confused.\n      </p>", "Consider a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with the underlying distribution in the domain of attraction of a stable distribution with an exponent in (0, 2]. Define the trimmed sums as the partial sums excluding r largest observations in magnitude, where r is a fixed integer. This paper proves that Chover's law of the iterated logarithm holds for the trimmed sums.\n      </p>", "This paper describes the different dimensions of the relation between moral reflection and legislative processes. It discusses some examples of the institutionalisation of moral reflection. It is argued that the relation between ethics and law is still an actual and relevant question. Ethics also has to reflect on its own role in political life. The paper defends the relevance of a theological perspective on the relation between law and ethics. In the last part it is argued that the modality of relation between ethics and law depends on the specific character of social domain.\n      </p>"], "words": {"essay": {"number": 4, "prob":
