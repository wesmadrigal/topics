{"total_words": 373, "documents": ["This paper aims to provide insight on whether bicycling for everyday travel can help US adults meet the recommended levels of physical activity and what role public infrastructure may play in encouraging this activity. The study collected data on bicycling behavior from 166 regular cyclists in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area using global positioning system (GPS) devices. Sixty percent of the cyclists rode for more than 150 minutes per week during the study and nearly all of the bicycling was for utilitarian purposes, not exercise. A disproportionate share of the bicycling occurred on streets with bicycle lanes, separate paths, or bicycle boulevards. The data support the need for well-connected neighborhood streets and a network of bicycle-specific infrastructure to encourage more bicycling among adults. This can be accomplished through comprehensive planning, regulation, and funding.\n      </p>", "This paper presents results from a study that examines the relationship between travel mode choice and geographic knowledge among third graders in Davis, California. Using methods that include personal interviews and mental mapping, the study explores whether children who primarily use active modes of travel (specifically bicycling) have a different spatial understanding of the community than their peers who rely on passive travel modes (e.g., riding in cars with adults). The findings suggest that children with more bicycling experience are able to recall more details of their community than those with less bicycling experience. Further, the extensive bikers may progress to higher stages of spatial development at a younger age than their peers with less bicycling experience. With this study, we hope to provide community leaders with a broader understanding of the implications of encouraging active travel among children.\n      </p>", "Most research on perceptual--motor development has focused on changes occurring during infancy and toddlerhood. In this paper, we describe our work on the development of perceptual--motor development during late childhood and early adolescence in the context of an important applied problem: bicycling across traffic-filled roads. Specifically, we have examined the gaps between cars that children and adults accept when bicycling across intersections, using an immersive, interactive bicycling simulator. This work highlights both methodological advances in using immersive, interactive virtual environments to study perceptual--motor functioning as well as theoretical advances in understanding the problem of moving the self in relation to other moving objects. We conclude with ideas for future research and practical implications of this work.\n      </p>", "The bicycle was at the heart of a strong citizens' movement for Good Roads in the nineteenth century. By the end of the twentieth century, it had re-emerged as a signifier for a new, ecologically based urban radicalism. Critical Mass bike rides, starting in San Francisco in 1992, spread throughout the world and anchored a new renaissance of bicycling and bicycling politics.\n      </p>", "The studio photographs of women bicyclists sent in by the readers of the German women's bicycling magazines Draisena and Die Radlerin in the latter half of the 1890s are read as evidence that an Early German New Woman was busy defining emancipation independently from the organized women's movement long before the New Woman of the 1920s. The photographic evidence of the magazines helps elucidate the terms \"emancipation\" and the \"New Woman\" in relation to bicycling and corrects historical scholarship that too easily conflates these terms with sport and the German women's movement, primarily due to the ubiquity of turn-of-the century bicycle advertisements.\n      </p>", "Providing safe, convenient places for walking and bicycling can reduce barriers to participating in regular physical activity. We examined bicycle-and pedestrianrelated investments authorized by federal transportation legislation in 3,140 counties in the United States by region, population size and urbanization, social and economic characteristics, and indicators of travel-related walking and bicycling. From 1992 to 2004, states and counties implemented 10,012 bicycle-and pedestrian-related projects representing $ 3.17 billion in federal expenditures. We found disparities in implementation and system-building outcomes according to population size and location and social and economic indicators. Counties characterized by persistent poverty (odds ratio=0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.53-0.91) or low educational status (odds ratio=0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.52-0.84) were less likely to implement projects. Three key policy recommendations for improving public health outcomes are drawn from this research: Improved data tracking, more explicit linkages between transportation projects and public health, and improved planning assistance to underserved communities are all seen as essential steps.\n      </p>", "A number of states passed legislation in the 1990s requiring youths to wear helmets when riding bicycles. The effect of this legislation on bicycling fatalities is examined by subjecting data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System to a panel analysis, using a control-group methodology. A helmet law reduces fatalities by about 15 percent in the long run, less in the short run. There is no evidence of spillover effects (to adults) or substitution effects (youths choosing other methods of transportation) associated with implementation of a helmet law. Through 2000, existing helmet laws have saved 130 lives. If all states had adopted helmet laws in 1975, more than 1500 lives would have been saved. \u00a9 2004 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.\n      </p>", "Active commuting (non-motorized transport) to school can be an important source of physical activity for children and adolescents. This research examined sociodemographic, family, and environmental characteristics associated with active commuting to or from school among 3,451 US adolescents aged 12-17 years, who responded to the 2005 California Health Interview Survey. Logistic regression results indicated that those more likely to actively commute were males, Latinos, from lower-income families, attending public school, living in urban areas, and living closer to school. Adolescents without an adult present after school and those whose parents know little about their whereabouts after school were also more likely to actively commute. Parental walking for transportation and perceptions of neighborhood safety were not associated with adolescent active commuting. Important family and individual correlates of walking or biking to school among adolescents were identified, even after adjusting for distance to school and urbanicity.\n      </p>", "This study examined gap choices and crossing behavior in children and adults using an immersive, interactive bicycling simulator. Ten- and 12-year-olds and adults rode a bicycle mounted on a stationary trainer through a virtual environment consisting of a street with 6 intersections. Participants faced continuous cross traffic traveling at 25 mph or 35 mph and waited for gaps they judged were adequate for crossing. Children and adults chose the same size temporal gaps, but children left far less time to spare between themselves and the approaching vehicle when they crossed the intersection. Relative to adults, children delayed in getting started and took longer to reach the roadway. Discussion focuses on developmental changes in how children coordinate self movement with object movement.\n      </p>", "Exposure to ultrafine particles (UFPs) from vehicle exhaust has been related to risk of cardiovascular and pulmonary disease and cancer, even though exposure assessment is difficult. We studied personal exposure in terms of number concentrations of UFPs in the breathing zone, using portable instruments in six 18-hr periods in 15 healthy nonsmoking subjects. Exposure contrasts of outdoor pollution were achieved by bicycling in traffic for 5 days and in the laboratory for 1 day. Oxidative DNA damage was assessed as strand breaks and oxidized purines in mononuclear cells isolated from venous blood the morning after exposure measurement. Cumulated outdoor and cumulated indoor exposures to UFPs each were independent significant predictors of the level of purine oxidation in DNA but not of strand breaks. Ambient air concentrations of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of \u2264 10 \u03bcm ( PM10), nitrous oxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and/or number concentration of UFPs at urban background or busy street monitoring stations was not a significant predictor of DNA damage, although personal UFP exposure was correlated with urban background concentrations of CO and NO2, particularly during bicycling in traffic. The results indicate that biologic effects of UFPs occur at modest exposure, such as that occurring in traffic, which supports the relationship of UFPs and the adverse health effects of air pollution.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Disinfection by-products in swimming pool water may, however, be associated with adverse effects on various reproductive outcomes. We examined the association between swimming in pregnancy and preterm and postterm birth, fetal growth measures, small-for-gestational-age, and congenital malformations. Methods: We used self-reported exercise data (swimming, bicycling, or no exercise) that were prospectively collected twice during pregnancy for 74,486 singleton pregnancies. Recruitment to The Danish National Birth Cohort took place 1996\u20132002. Using Cox, linear and logistic regression analyses, depending on the outcome, we compared swimmers with physically inactive pregnant women; to separate a possible swimming effect from an effect of exercise, bicyclists were included as an additional comparison group. Results: Risk estimates were similar for swimmers and bicyclists, including those who swam throughout pregnancy and those who swam more than 1.5 hours per week. Compared with nonexercisers, women who swam in early/mid-pregnancy had a slightly reduced risk of giving birth preterm (hazard ratio = 0.80 [95% confidence interval = 0.72\u20130.88]) or giving birth to a child with congenital malformations (odds ratio = 0.89 [0.80\u20130.98]). Conclusions: These data do not indicate that swimming in pool water is associated with adverse reproductive outcomes.\n      </p>", "Objective: The aim of the present paper was to give insight into the practical consequences of using either single-level or multilevel regression analyses on data from research on environmental determinants of physical activity. Methods: For this purpose, results from single-level and multilevel regression analyses on comparable attributes of the environment were compared using a combination of individual and aggregated data, merged at the neighbourhood level. Results: Using only individual level data, applying multilevel instead of single-level analyses did not substantially influence the results. However, ignoring the multilevel structure of our data by applying single-level in stead of multilevel analyses resulted in statistically significant associations for all the environmental attributes under study. Moreover, using information on environmental attributes at both the individual and the contextual level to adjust associations at one level for the other level showed that associated environmental attributes tend to be associated either at the individual or at the contextual level. Conclusions: These results stress the importance for reviews and meta-analyses of recording type of measurement and type of analytical strategy used and incorporating them in the review process. Using advanced multilevel designs will still only partly solve the methodological issues involved in studying environmental attributes associated with physical activity, but it will help in disentangling this complex relationship. Therefore, it is recommended that, whenever there is a presumably relevant grouping (context; eg neighbourhoods) in a study, a multilevel approach should at least be considered.\n      </p>", "The researchers undertook to identify the factors that are most likely to influence children's intentions to use bicycle helmets. To determine the most important intention influencing factors, a random sample of 797 students in grades 4 through 6 completed a self-administered questionnaire concerning their beliefs about helmet use. They were asked about their perceptions of the risk of riding bicycles unprotected, the severity of possible head injuries, and about other bicycle-safety related behaviors. Factors that best predicted the student's intentions to use bicycle helmets involved both behavioral beliefs and normative beliefs. Analysis of factors influencing those with low intentions to use helmets, compared to those with high intentions, suggests the most effective messages that health planners can provide preadolescents to influence them to use helmets. They are that helmet use is fun and attractive, helmets provide a new look and a sporting image, and friends approve of and value this behavior. Parents, and particularly mothers, can reinforce their children's intentions to use helmets and their involvement should be encouraged.\n      </p>", "More than 20 states have adopted laws requiring youths to wear a helmet when riding a bicycle. We confirm previous research indicating that these laws reduced fatalities and increased helmet use, but we also show that the laws significantly reduced youth bicycling. We find this result in standard two-way fixed-effects models of parental reports of youth bicycling and in triple-difference models of self-reported bicycling among high school youths that explicitly account for bicycling by youths just above the age threshold of the helmet law. Our results highlight important intended and unintended consequences of a well-intentioned public policy.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "           ", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Communities are traditionally built with one transportation mode and user in mind\u2014the adult automobile driver. Recently, however, there has been an international focus on the trip to school as an opportunity to enhance children's independent active travel. Several factors must be considered when designing programs to promote walking and bicycling. This paper examined the influence of child sex on caregivers' decisions about travel mode choice to school.\n         Caregivers of children in grades three to five from ten California Safe Routes to School communities were surveyed on their child's normal travel mode to school and factors that determined travel decisions. Results indicate that the odds of walking and bicycling to school are 40 percent lower in girls than boys; however, this relationship is significantly moderated by the caregiver's own walking behavior. The findings suggest that programs that focus on increasing children's active travel to school should consider multiple influences on health behavior, including the neighborhood physical activity of parents.\n      </p>", "Objective Several, but not all, studies have observed increased risks of testicular germ cell cancer (TGCC) associated with bicycling and other recreational activities. To further examine whether physical activity (PA) in adolescence is associated with TGCC risk, the authors conducted a case-control study in western Washington State. Methods Cases (n = 391) were men diagnosed with TGCC, who were identified through a population-based cancer registry. Controls (n = 1,023) were men identified from the general population in western Washington State by using random digit telephone dialing. Participants were queried about various specific PA in grades 7-12 including bicycling, horseback riding, competitive sports, physical education class, as well as moderate, vigorous, and sedentary activities in general. Results In multivariate analyses, bicycling, vigorousintensity activities, and sedentary activities were not associated with TGCC risk, while horseback riding and wrestling were associated with decreased risks, and moderate-intensity activities, soccer, basketball, and intermediate duration of competitive activities were associated with increased risks. Conclusions The lack of internal consistency of the findings within the current study and of findings among prior studies suggests that PA contributes little, if any, to the risk of TGCC.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Bicycling is a popular recreational activity and a principal mode of transportation for children in the United States, yet about 300 children die and 430,000 are injured annually. Wearing a bicycle helmet is an important countermeasure, since it reduces the risk of serious brain injury by up to 85%. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have funded state health departments to conduct bicycle helmet programs, and their effectiveness has been evaluated by monitoring community bicycle helmet use. Although it would appear that measuring bicycle helmet use is easy, it is actually neither simple nor straightforward. The authors describe what they have learned about assessing helmet use and what methods have been most useful. They also detail several key practical decisions that define the current CDC position regarding helmet use assessment.

We evaluated the reliability of a self-administered PAQ designed to assess total (24 h) current and historical physical activity at age 15, 30, and 50 years, which was completed by a subgroup of 303 women aged 56\u201375 years from the Swedish Mammography Cohort (SMC). Total physical activity covered occupational and household activity as well as walking/bicycling, exercise, and inactivity (sitting watching TV/reading). Reliabilities (1-year test\u2013retest) of continuous activity measures in metabolic equivalents were evaluated using an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC); classification consistency was evaluated using sensitivity and specificity statistics. The ICC for total current physical activity was 0.69; for specific types of activities the ICC ranged from 0.49 to 0.59; for historical physical activity, the reliabilities for total activity ranged from 0.75 for age 50 to 0.81 for age 30 years, being substantial for occupational activities (ICC = 0.73\u20130.75), and fair to moderate for inactivity (ICC = 0.31\u20130.60).

Over a 1-year period, data from a questionnaire, 7-day activity records and accelerometers were obtained from a subset of 116 women between the ages of 56 and 75 years from the population-based Swedish Mammography Cohort. We estimated concordance correlations as measure of validity, deattenuated for intraindividual variation in the reference method. Deattenuated concordance correlations comparing total daily activity measured by the questionnaire with the accelerometers and the records were 0.38 (95% CI: 0.22-0.54) and 0.64 (95% CI: 0.45-0.83), respectively. Validity of leisure-time activity (walking/ bicycling and exercise) and inactivity (watching TV/reading) estimates comparing the records with the questionnaire were 0.42 (95% CI: 0.22-0.62) and 0.52 (95% CI: 0.36-0.69), respectively.

The study was limited to reviews for 580 books appearing in Book Review Digest (BRD) and Book Review Index (BRI) between 1970 and 1980. It was found that these major review indexing sources have not kept pace with the tremendous growth of interest in sports books. With the exception of 1971, the number of sports books published each year since 1970 has increased, but every year since 1970 has seen a decrease in the percentage of sports books reviewed. Out of the total sample of 580 books, BRD contained only 1 book review that was not also in BRI. The number of books on the fastest growing sports being reviewed has increased more than the number of most popular sports books being reviewed. Of the total sample, 36 percent were reviewed by sources indexed by BRI, 8 percent by sources indexed by both BRI and BRD, and 0.2 percent by sources indexed by BRD.\n      </p>", "Background: In epidemiological studies abundant physical activity has been related to decreased breast cancer risk, though the results have been inconsistent. The purpose of this paper was to study the association of physical activity at leisure and commuting to work and incidence of breast cancer. Methods: The study cohort consisted of 30,548 female participants of the Finnish adult health behaviour survey, based on annual random samples of Finns aged 15-64, collected in 1978-1993. By the end of 1995, 332 breast cancer cases had been diagnosed in the cohort. Relative risks of breast cancer were adjusted for age at survey, body mass index (BMI), education, length of follow-up, parity and age at first birth using Poisson regression models. Results: Compared to women exercising less than once a week, the adjusted relative risk of breast cancer for women exercising once a week was 0.80 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.58-1.10), for women exercising 2-3 times per week 0.92 (95% CI: 0.78-1.22) and for women exercising daily 0.01 (95% CI: 0.72-1.42). Women who reported commuting, walking or bicycling to work 30 min or more daily had slightly lower adjusted risk of breast cancer (RR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.62-1.24) than women working at home, being unemployed or driving a car to working place. Conclusion: Although a small protective effect of regular physical activity for breast cancer incidence was found in physical activity when commuting to work, the role of the physical activity in breast cancer prevention is still an open question.\n      </p>", "Ecotourism in protected areas is growing rapidly all around the world. Although the benefits of ecotourism are well described, it is not a panacea for solving the complex human needs and resource-capacity paradox in protected areas, unless it is well planned and managed. The notion of ecotourism in legally protected areas is relatively new in Turkey, and therefore none of Turkey's 39 national parks has an ecotourism master plan. The purpose of this study is to analyze the ecotourism potential and to generate initial recommendations for establishing an ecotourism framework for Gallipoli Peninsula Historical National Park (GPHNP) in \u00c7anakkale, Turkey. Three basic research steps are followed: analysis, evaluation, and synthesis. Natural, cultural, and historical features of GPHNP are presented, and a set of recommendations are provided with respect to ecotourism in the study area. Results indicate that the national park has substantial potential for ecotourism activities such as bird-watching, photo safari, wildlife watching, sportfishing, bicycling, scuba diving, farming tourism, flora tourism, trekking, and horseback riding through nature; and this potential is not sufficiently utilized in the current context. The recommendations include that the national park's war history, biological diversity, coastal morphology, and climate should be promoted holistically, and awareness of them should be raised. The topography and other landscape attributes of the park must be protected and sustained.\n      </p>", "Background: Physical inactivity and exposure to air pollution are important risk factors for death and disease globally. The built environment may influence exposures to these risk factors in different ways and thus differentially affect the health of urban populations. Objective: We investigated the built environment's association with air pollution and physical inactivity, and estimated attributable health risks. Methods: We used a regional travel survey to estimate within-urban variability in physical inactivity and home-based air pollution exposure [paritculate matter with aerodynamic diameter \u2264 2.5 \u03bcm (PM2.5), nitrogen oxides (NO x), and ozone (O\u2083)] for 30,007 individuals in southern California. We then estimated the resulting risk for ischemie heart disease (IHD) using literature-derived dose-response values. Using a cross-sectional approach, we compared estimated IHD mortality risks among neighborhoods based on \"walkability\" scores. Results: The proportion of physically active individuals was higher in high-versus low-walkability neighborhoods (24.9% vs. 12.5%); however, only a small proportion of the population was physically active, and between-neighborhood variability in estimated IHD mortality attributable to physical inactivity was modest (7 fewer IHD deaths/100,000/year in high- vs. low-walkability neighborhoods). Between-neighborhood differences in estimated IHD mortality from air pollution were comparable in magnitude (9 more IHD deaths/100,000/year for PM2.5 and 3 fewer IHD deaths for O\u2083 in high-vs. low-walkability neighborhoods), suggesting that population health benefits from increased physical activity in high-walkability neighborhoods may be offset by adverse effects of air pollution exposure. Policy Implications: Currently, planning efforts mainly focus on increasing physical activity through neighborhood design. Our results suggest that differences in population health impacts among neighborhoods are similar in magnitude for air pollution and physical activity. Thus, physical activity and exposure to air pollution are critical aspects of planning for cleaner, healthpromoting cities.\n      </p>", "The need for high-performance protective clothing systems in space, polar, and underwater operations and in industrial environments has stimulated research in clothing physiology. New, sophisticated measurement methods, some of which are going to be international standards, have facilitated this research. Measurements with subjects have validated manikin data, but have also provided information about the dynamic character and the individual variability of thermal properties of clothing under conditions encountered in the field. Manikin measurements of the basic thermal properties of clothing (insulation and evaporative resistance) have to be corrected to apply to the user situation, due to the effects of wind, posture, body movement, and moisture absorption. Evaporative heat transfer is better defined and should be incorporated in heat exchange models and thermal indices. Important aspects of clothing physiology remain to be investigated.\n      </p>", "Background: Automobile exhaust contains precursors to ozone and fine particulate matter (PM &lt;\u0331 2.5 \u00b5rn in aerodynamic diameter; PM\u2082.\u2084), posing health risks. Dependency on car commuting also reduces physical fitness opportunities. Objective: In this study we sought to quantify benefits from reducing automobile usage for short urban and suburban trips. Methods: We simulated census-tract level changes in hourly pollutant concentrations from the elimination of automobile round trips &lt;\u0331 8 km in 11 metropolitan areas in the upper midwestern United States using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. Next, we estimated annual changes in health outcomes and monetary costs expected from pollution changes using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Benefits Mapping Analysis Program (BenMAP). In addition, we used the World Health Organization Health Economic Assessment Tool (HEAT) to calculate benefits of increased physical activity if 50% of short trips were made by bicycle. Results: We estimate that, by eliminating these short automobile trips, annual average urban PM\u2082.\u2084 would decline by 0.1 pg/m\u00b3 and that summer ozone (O) would increase slightly in cities but decline regionally, resulting in net health benefits of $ 4.94 billion/year [95% confidence interval (CI): $0.2 billion, $13.5 billion), with 25% of PM \u2082 . \u2084 and most O\u2083 benefits to populations outside metropolitan areas. Across the study region of approximately 31.3 million people and 37,000 total square miles, mortality would decline by approximately 1,295 deaths/year (95% CI: 912, 1,636) because of improved air quality and increased exercise. Making 50% of short trips by bicycle would yield savings of approximately $3.8 billion/year from avoided mortality and reduced health care costs (95% CI: $2.7 billion, $5.0 billion]. We estimate that the combined benefits of improved air quality and physical fitness would exceed $8 billion/year. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that significant health and economic benefits are possible if bicycling replaces short car trips. Less dependence on automobiles in urban areas would also improve health in downwind rural settings.\n      </p>", "Each year in the United States, 280 children die from bicycle crashes and 144,000 are treated for head injuries from bicycling. Although bicycle helmets reduce the risk of head injury by 85 percent, few children wear them. To help guide the choice of strategy to promote helmet use among children ages 5 to 16 years, the cost effectiveness of legislative, communitywide, and school-based approaches was assessed. A societal perspective was used, only direct costs were included, and a 4-year period after program startup was examined. National age-specific injury rates and an attributable risk model were used to estimate the expected number of bicycle-related head injuries and deaths in localities with and without a program. The percentage of children who wore helmets increased from 4 to 47 in the legislative program, from 5 to 33 in the community program, and from 2 to 8 in the school program. Two programs had similar cost effectiveness ratios per head injury avoided. The legislative program had a $36,643 cost and the community-based one, $37,732, while the school-based program had a cost of $144,498 per head injury avoided. The community program obtained its 33 percent usage gradually over the 4 years, while the legislative program resulted in an immediate increase in usage, thus, considering program characteristics and overall results, the legislative program appears to be the most cost-effective. The cost of helmets was the most influential factor on the cost-effectiveness ratio. The year 2000 health objectives call for use of helmets by 50 percent of bicyclists. Since helmet use in all these programs is less than 50 percent, new or combinations of approaches may be required to achieve the objective.\n      </p>", "Objective-The aim was to describe the sex and socioeconomic differences in patterns of physical activity at work and in leisure time of men and women aged 36 years, and to investigate factors in childhood and adolescence which predict high rates of participation in sports and recreational activities in later life. Design-Data collected in childhood, adolescence, and at 36 years on members of a national prospective birth cohort study were used. Setting-The population sample was resident in England, Scotland, and Wales. Subjects-A stratified sample of about 3500 men and women was studied regularly from birth until 43 years. Measurements and main results-More men than women reported high rates of sports and recreational activities, gardening, and do-it-yourself. In contrast women reported higher rates of bicycling and walking. Higher levels of education were associated with frequent participation in sports. Individuals often engaged in one type of activity without necessarily engaging in other types. Those who were most active in sport had been above average at sports in school, more outgoing socially in adolescence, had fewer health problems in childhood, were better educated, and had more mothers with a secondary education than those who were less active. Conclusions-Studies that examine the relationship between physical activity and chronic disease should consider a broad range of pursuits rather than extrapolating from only one area of physical activity, and in their explanations should take account of the possible role of childhood characteristics. The findings suggest the importance of developing skills and habits in childhood as well as of encouraging healthier exercise habits in adults who may have had few opportunities or low motivation previously.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

A consistently high quality water supply is extremely important because reports of an outbreak of waterborne disease would have dramatic economic repercussions for this mountain community. The existing treatment system needed to be upgraded, but climatic restrictions and cost considerations dictated that construction be completed quickly and cost effectively. The water district selected a package treatment plant to provide a traditional treatment train of flocculation, sedimentation, and filtration. The plant is easy to operate and has enabled the district to make efficient use of its two sources of supply. Crested Butte es un balneario recreacional de invierno y verano en el sur del estado de Colorado, de r\u00e1pido crecimiento, que atrae a los amantes de la naturaleza debido a su esqu\u00ed alpino y n\u00f3rdico, pesca, monta\u00f1ismo, caminos para andar en bicicleta y otras actividades recreacionales.

To date, no studies have explored interactions between neighborhood walkability and air pollution exposure. Methods: We estimated concentrations of nitric oxide (NO), a marker for direct vehicle emissions), and ozone (O\u2083) and a neighborhood walkability score, for 49,702 (89% of total) postal codes in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. NO concentrations were estimated from a land-use regression model, O\u2083 was estimated from ambient monitoring data; walkability was calculated based on geographic attributes such as land-use mix, street connectivity, and residential density. Results: All three attributes exhibit an urban\u2013rural gradient, with high walkability and NO concentrations, and low O\u2083 concentrations, near the city center. Lower-income areas tend to have higher NO concentrations and walkability and lower O\u2083 concentrations. Higher-income areas tend to have lower pollution (NO and O\u2083). \"Sweet-spot\" neighborhoods (low pollution, high walkability) are generally located near but not at the city center and are almost exclusively higher income. Policy Implications: Increased concentration of activities in urban settings yields both health costs and benefits. Our research identifies neighborhoods that do especially well (and especially poorly) for walkability and air pollution exposure. Work is needed to ensure that the poor do not bear an undue burden of urban air pollution and that neighborhoods designed for walking, bicycling, or mass transit do not adversely affect resident's exposure to air pollution. Analyses presented here could be replicated in other cities and tracked over time to better understand interactions among neighborhood walkability, air pollution exposure, and income level.\n      </p>", "Objectives: To investigate associations between physical activity and endogenous sex hormones after menopause with a special focus on confounding and effect modification by body mass index (BMI). Methods: A cross-sectional study among 1,260 postmenopausal women was conducted. Generalized linear models were used to compare levels of total leisure-time physical activity, sports activities, bicycling, and walking with levels of sex hormones and sex-hormone-binding-globulin (SHBG). Results: Higher sports activity levels were significantly associated with lower levels of estrone and total and free testosterone in multivariate adjusted models. After additional adjustment for BMI, associations with estrone and free testosterone were attenuated; the association with total testosterone remained unchanged. No physical activity variable was significantly related to total and free estradiol, androstenedione, or SHBG. We did not observe effect modification by BMI. Conclusions: Sports activities may lead to lower levels of estrone and testosterone in postmenopausal women. While effects on estrone and free testosterone seem to be largely mediated by BMI, effects on total testosterone appear to be mainly independent of BMI. The BMI-independent effects on these hormones (especially on total testosterone) could at least partly explain why physical activity has been frequently reported to be preventive for postmenopausal breast cancer, even after accounting for BMI.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "A la fin du XIXe si\u00e8cle, l'\u00e9mancipation des femmes, en particulier celle des femmes des classes moyennes, posait probl\u00e8me.

Many commentators feared the \"feminist\" drive for increased legal rights, autonomy, and educational and professional opportunities threatened national security and social stability by drawing women away from their \"natural\" domestic roles as mothers and wives. Hopes and fears associated with the \"new woman\" were intimately tied to the bicycle, for women cyclists, with their masculine clothing (bloomers) and their conquest of speed, space, freedom, and pleasure, symbolized female emancipation and equality between the sexes. Throughout the fin de si\u00e8cle a highly charged debate centered around the cycling bourgeoise raged among French doctors and hygienists, the press, bourgeois bicycling \"experts\", and numerous social commentators. Anchored in contemporary fears about French cultural, demographic, military, and \"racial\" decadence, this debate reflected and helped shape French ideas about gender, specifically the relationship between leisure and sports on the one hand and masculinity, feminity, and sexuality on the other. By 1914, with the support of the French cycle industry which saw women as a vast new consumer market, and with the exception of competitive cycling, middle-class women had successfully asserted their right to cycle as they pleased.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "           ", "           ", "Wi-Fi marries Internet-based networking and radio broadcasting. Although still nascent, the technology is wildly popular. Geography is a central consideration in the functioning of Wi-Fi technology. Yet, its influence is just beginning to be investigated. Examination of the space of Wi-Fi poses problems as wireless data traffic is invisible to the eye and its underlying apparatus is impromptu and veiled to traditional geographic inquiry. A scheme for detecting Wi-Fi infrastructure and transmissions and analyzing their geographic properties is introduced in this article. The application of the scheme to the study of Wi-Fi geography in Salt Lake City, Utah, is described. A dense network of impromptu Wi-Fi infrastructure is found to permeate the city's built environment and the urban area has been blanketed in a fog of Wi-Fi transmissions without any centralized organization. This Wi-Fi cloud is surprisingly resilient to network and physical problems, although the early signs of geographically systematic throughput difficulties are evident in parts of the urban area. Wi-Fi appears to offer a solution to last-mile problems in the city and bucks the trend for polarization of the population on either side of a digital divide, at least for those with access to Wi-Fi-enabled hardware. Wi-Fi was found to strengthen existing urban geography. Activity is most prominent in the city's traditional commercial core. However, Wi-Fi also reaches out to interstitial and peripheral parts of the city. Although commercial penetration of Wi-Fi misses the traditional tourist and retail areas of the city, public Wi-Fi is being used to encapsulate and reinforce civic space in the city. /// \u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u5e7f\u64ad\u548c\u4ee5\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u7f51\u7edc. \u867d\u7136\u8fd8\u5904\u4e8e\u840c\u82bd\u72b6\u6001, \u8fd9\u9879\u6280\u672f\u5df2\u7ecf\u975e\u5e38\u6d41\u884c. \u5730\u7406\u5b66\u662f\u8fd0\u4f5c\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u6280\u672f\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u8003\u8651\u73af\u8282. \u7136\u800c, \u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u624d\u521a\u521a\u5f00\u59cb\u88ab\u5b66\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u67e5. \u7814 \u7a76\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c06\u6784\u6210\u95ee\u9898, \u56e0\u4e3a\u65e0\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u91cf\u662f\u8089\u773c\u770b\u4e0d\u89c1\u7684, \u5176\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u5668\u5177\u662f\u5373\u5174\u7684, \u4e5f\u662f\u4f20 \u7edf\u7684\u5730\u7406\u8c03\u67e5\u6240\u4e0d\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u7684. \u8fd9\u7bc7\u6587\u7ae0\u5c06\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e00\u4e2a\u63a2\u6d4b\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u7cfb\u7edf, \u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5730\u7406 \u7279\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6848. \u8fd9\u9879\u65b9\u6848\u5f62\u5bb9\u4e86\u76d0\u6e56\u57ce, \u72b9\u4ed6\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u5730\u7406\u6027\u8d28. \u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6574\u4e2a\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u6e17\u900f\u7740\u4e00 \u7f51\u7a20\u5bc6\u5373\u5174\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd. \u57ce\u5e02\u5730\u533a\u88ab\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u5305\u88f9\u7740. \u867d\u7136\u5730\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u541e \u5410\u91cf\u7684\u56f0\u96be\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u5e02\u533a\u65e9\u5df2\u663e\u73b0, \u7136\u800c\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u7269\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u4ee4\u4eba\u60ca\u8bb6. \u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f3c\u4e4e\u662f \u6700\u540e\u4e00\u82f1\u91cc\u95f4\u9898\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u529e\u6cd5. \u6b64\u5916, \u81f3\u5c11\u5728\u90a3\u4e9b\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u5177\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u529f\u80fd\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u5730\u533a, \u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc \u4e5f\u52a0\u6df1\u4e86\u4eba\u53e3\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u9e3f\u6c9f\u4e24\u6781\u5316\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf. \u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u52a0\u5f3a\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u5730\u7406. \u6700\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u7684 \u6d3b\u52a8\u533a\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u5546\u4e1a\u6838\u5fc3. \u7136\u800c, \u65e0\u7ebf \u7f51\u7edc\u4e5f\u6e17\u5165\u5230\u4e86\u4ee5\u95f4\u8d28\u548c\u5468\u8fb9\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u5dff\u533a. \u867d\u7136\u5546\u4e1a\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u672a\u80fd\u6e17\u900f\u5230\u57ce\u5e02\u91cc\u4f20\u7edf\u65c5\u6e38\u548c\u96f6\u552e\u4e1a\u7b49\u9886\u57df, \u516c\u5171\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u5df2\u88ab\u7528\u6765\u6982\u62ec\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u91cc\u516c\u6c11\u7a7a \u95f4. /// Wi-Fi se une a las redes basadas en Internet y a la radiodifusi\u00f3n.

The paper will draw on urban built environment characteristics from a number of Michigan municipalities, including Detroit, Ann Arbor, Birmingham, East Lansing and Okemos.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

When distance-overcoming costs are monetary, a positive income-distance function is predicted, and studies in several Anglo-American cities have provided some confirmation. If expenses are made to be temporal, the model forecasts a negative relationship because the opportunity cost of commuting is directly variable with income. A study was conducted in Piracicaba (pop. 125,000), Brazil, and neither positive nor negative income-distance functions were encountered for any of the transportation differentiated groups. The findings indicate that the prevalence of walking, bicycling and other commuting modes which consume large amounts of time does not adequately explain the \"non-western\" residential pattern (negative income-distance to the Central Business District function) which is common in many Latin American cities. The results also suggest that hypotheses which consider spatial relationships between residences and sites other than the place of work may prove to be more fruitful (1).\n      </p>", "Cette \u00e9tude est consacr\u00e9e \u00e0 la pratique des loisirs d'adultes dans le cadre d'associations sportives ou culturelles de la ville de Ch\u00e2tillon-sur-Seine, chef-lieu de canton d'environ 6 000 habitants, situ\u00e9 au carrefour de la Bourgogne et de la Champagne cette cit\u00e9 fait un peu figure de capitale administrative, commerciale, industrielle et agricole dans la r\u00e9gion environnante. La population active pr\u00e9sente une majorit\u00e9 de professions \u00e0 revenus modestes : ouvriers, employ\u00e9s, salari\u00e9s agricoles, artisans... Une certaine expansion d\u00e9mographique a son revers dans l'abandon de la r\u00e9gion par les jeunes les plus qualifi\u00e9s. Cette ambivalence a des r\u00e9percussions sur la structure et le fonctionnement des associations de loisir que par ailleurs le snotables et autorit\u00e9s municipales favorisent dans le souci de leur faire jouer un r\u00f4le dans l'expansion socio-\u00e9conomique de la cit\u00e9. Ces associations de loisir, coordonn\u00e9es et soutenues par un Office municipal des sports et de la culture cr\u00e9\u00e9 en 1965 regroupent les activit\u00e9s telles que : la p\u00eache, la chasse \u2014 dans des cadres sociaux divers, chasse en Icaine, en for\u00eat et chasse \u00e0 courre \u2014, le football, le pyclisme, la gymnastique et le handball, l'\u00e9quitation, le tennis, l'a\u00e9ro-club, la boule, le billard, l'arch\u00e9ologie, la philat\u00e9lie, la musique d'ensemble pratiqu\u00e9e dans le cadre de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e0 vocations diverses : harmonie, batteriefanfare, majorettes, trompes de chasse, enfin les loisirs \u00e9ducatifs (cours de langues, cin\u00e9-club, club-photo, cours de dessin et de poterie, etc.). Ces associations dont le si\u00e8ge \u2014 hormis la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de chasse \u00e0 courre \u2014 est Ch\u00e2tillon, int\u00e9ressent plus ou moins tel ou tel secteur de la population, n\u00e9anmoins elles sont toutes li\u00e9es les unes aux autres en r\u00e9seaux sociaux. Leur structure sociale, d\u00e9mographique, culturelle, pr\u00e9sente des analogies ou isomorphismes \u00e9vidents avec celle de la communaut\u00e9 ch\u00e2tillonnaise prise dans son ensemble : recrutement mal ais\u00e9 \u00e0 cause de l'exode des jeunes, absence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des salari\u00e9s agricoles au sein de ces associations, rejet des ouvriers, employ\u00e9s, jeunes aux revenus modestes par certaines associations au sein desquelles le poids des groupes sociaux privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s est particuli\u00e8rement fort, r\u00f4le effac\u00e9 des femmes, mises \u00e0 l'\u00e9cart des ouvriers dans les fonctions dirigeantes. On observe des correspondances entre la pratique professionnelle et la pratique des loisirs. Enfin le loisir n'est pas toujours une activit\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9e : aux vis\u00e9es p\u00e9cuniaires directes (sp\u00e9culation des philat\u00e9listes par exemple) s'ajoutent de la part des dirigeants des vis\u00e9es \u00e9lectorales et politiques, parfois commerciales. Ces associations constituent un sous-syst\u00e8me du syst\u00e8me social ch\u00e2tillonnais, mais elles sont aussi, \u00e0 de multiples niveaux, partie prenante du syst\u00e8me global fran\u00e7ais. This study is devoted to the leisure occupations of adults that are practiced within athletic and cultural clubs in the small town of Chatillon-s/Seine, a country seat of about 6 000 (inhabitants) situated at the march between Burgundy and Champagne. This small town plays the role of administrative, commercial, industrial and agricultural center for the country. Active population is contained mainly in the small-income brackets : workers, clerks, field-hands, craftsmen... Demographic growth has its reverse side in the young and skilled leaving the county. This double edged gift has repercussions on the structure and functioning of leisure associations which leading townsmen and town authorities encourage in the hope that they might play a part in the socio-economic growth of the town. These leisure associations, coordinated and supported by a Town Athletics and Culture Office in existence since 1965, offer such activities as fishing, various kinds of shooting and hunting, soccer, bicycling, calisthenics, handball, riding, tennis, flying, french bowling, billiard, archeology, stamp-collecting, musical ensembles of various sorts (mostly winds), \u00ab majorettes \u00bb, educative pastimes (foreign languages, film-clubs, photogiaphy, drawing, pottery, etc. Excerpt for the stag-hunting society, all have their seats in Chatillon ; they are of more or less interest to different segments of the population, but nevertheless are all linked together by social networks. Their social, demographic, cultural structure offers patent analogies or isomorphics to the structure of the community as a whole. They have difficulties in recruiting owing to youth exodus, and fields hands are conspicnously absent of them. Some, those where the privileged have a particularly heavy weight, reject workers, clerks and the unmoneyed young. Women play little to no role, and workers are kept out of the leading positions in them. There are correlations between professional activities and leisure activities. Hobbies and past times are not always gratuitous play : they may yield money (to stave collectors) they may also, to local leaders, yield notes and/or political or commercial influence. These associations are a sub-system of the town social system ; they are also sub-systems at different levels, of the larger, national, social system.\n      </p>", "           ", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
