{"total_words": 349, "documents": ["Objective: To assess the content of two cigar \"lifestyle\" magazines, \"Cigar Aficionado\" and \"Smoke\". Design: Content analysis of cigar focused articles. Subjects: Cigar focused articles (n = 353) from \"Cigar Aficionado\" and \"Smoke magazines\". Main outcome measures: Primary focus; mention of health effects, environmental tobacco smoke, or scientific research; quotation and description of individuals; characteristics such as sex, age, ethnicity, smoking status, affiliation, and stance towards cigars; and overall image of cigars. Results: Cigar business-focused articles were the largest category (40%, n = 143), followed by articles about cigar events (12%, n = 42). Notable were articles featuring cigar benefits to raise money for health charities. Celebrities were featured in 34% (n = 121) of articles and 96% (n = 271) favoured cigar use. Only four (1%) articles featured health effects of cigars as a primary focus. Conclusions: \"Cigar Aficionado\" and \"Smoke\" broke new ground in tobacco marketing by combining promotion of product, lifestyle, and industry in the same vehicle and linking the medium directly to product related events that extended its reach. The creation and marketing of new tobacco use sites challenges the increasing \"isolation\" of smokers, and positions cigar use as a socially welcome relief from restrictions. Public health advocates should anticipate and challenge other new tobacco marketing vehicles as communications technologies advance and public spaces for smoking shrink.\n      </p>", "A number of crystalline and optically isotopic inorganic materials are used in the manufacture of reconstituted tobacco sheets. These sheets, used primarily in inexpensive cigars, often contain diatomaceous earth, which exists in part in the silica mineral form cristobalite, a known fibrogen. Diatom fragments with this crystalline form have been observed in the main smoke stream of cigars made with these tobacco sheets.\n      </p>", "Chemical data are presented from a comparison study of the smoke of cigarettes and little cigars. The tobacco products and their mainstream smokes were analyzed for a number of toxic constituents in an effort to define \"smoke inhalability.\" This issue has particular public health importance because the difference in the inhalability of cigar and cigarette smoke is generally assumed to account for the differences in the health risk to the individual smoker.\n      </p>", "Objective: Previous research suggests that bidi, cigar, and marijuana use may be interrelated, but to date, this hypothesis has not been empirically tested. Methods: We explored the relationships among use of these products using data from 17,429 youths who completed the 2001 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse. Variables of interest included demographics, tobacco use (i.e., cigarettes, cigars), marijuana use, and blunting (i.e., cigars filled with marijuana). Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) for past-month bidi use were generated for each variable; regression models were also generated separately by race/ethnicity. Results: Overall, 1.1% of the youths surveyed reported past month bidi use; higher prevalence was noted for those who were past-month users of cigarettes (4.6%), cigars (7.0%), marijuana (5.8%), and blunts (7.3%). Logistic regression yielded significant odds ratios for all tobacco products, marijuana, and blunts, with the greatest odds associated with past-month cigarette use. Interestingly, the pattern varied notably by race. Among white youth, the greatest odds for past-month bidi use were associated with cigarette use (AOR=3.9), while among black youth the greatest odds were associated with blunting (AOR=9.5). Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that the use of cigars and blunts is highly associated with bidi use among youths and these patterns differ by race/ethnicity. Tobacco control efforts that target youths must address other tobacco products and marijuana and should be tailored appropriately and effectively, with consideration of racial, ethnic, and cultural variations.\n      </p>", "Objective: To estimate the extent to which cigarette smokers who switch to cigars or pipes alter their risk of dying of three smoking related diseases-lung cancer, ischaemic heart disease, and chronic obstructive lung disease. Design: A prospective study of 21 520 men aged 35-64 years when recruited in 1975-82 with detailed history of smoking and measurement of carboxyhaemoglobin. Main outcome measures: Notification of deaths (to 1993) classified by cause. Results: Pipe and cigar smokers who had switched from cigarettes over 20 years before entry to the study smoked less tobacco than cigarette smokers (8.1 g/day v 20 g/day), but they had the same consumption as pipe and cigar smokers who had never smoked cigarettes (8.1 g) and had higher carboxyhaemoglobin saturations (1.2% v 1.0%, P&lt;0.001), indicating that they inhaled tobacco smoke to a greater extent. They had a 51% higher risk of dying of the three smoking related diseases than pipe or cigar smokers who had never smoked cigarettes (relative risk 1.51; 95% confidence interval 0.96 to 2.38), a 68% higher risk than lifelong non-smokers (1.68; 1.16 to 2.45), a 57% higher risk than former cigarette smokers who gave up smoking over 20 years before entry (1.57; 1.04 to 2.38), and a 46% lower risk than continuing cigarette smokers (0.54; 0.38 to 0.77). Conclusion: Cigarette smokers who have difficulty in giving up smoking altogether are better off changing to cigars or pipes than continuing to smoke cigarettes. Much of the effect is due to the reduction in the quantity of tobacco smoked, and some is due to inhaling less. Men who switch do not, however, achieve the lower risk of pipe and cigar smokers who have never smoked cigarettes. All pipe and cigar smokers have a greater risk of lung cancer than lifelong non-smokers or former smokers.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "", "", "", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Design: Using data (n = 2615) from the West of Scotland Twenty-07 Study, separately by gender, crosssectional associations between respondents' perceptions of neighbourhood (perceived absence of goods, incivilities and physical environmental problems) and the likelihood of being a current smoker and the amount smoked were examined. Results: Perceived neighbourhood problems are associated with the likelihood of smoking but mainly among those with the most negative view of the local neighbourhood. Perceptions of the provision of neighbourhood amenities seems to be more strongly associated with women's than men's smoking status, whereas the perceived quality of the local neighbourhood appears to be a better predictor of men's smoking.

Setting: Minnesota, USA. Interventions: The 12 contests reported here differed somewhat over time and communities, but key elements were present in nearly all. Smoking was validated prior to entry and quitting was validated among potential prize winners. A large grand prize such as a family vacation was typically offered along with six to ten lesser prizes. Results: Contest participation varied substantially, ranging from 1% to 5% of the eligible smokers in the community. Contest outcomes tended to be encouraging with self-reported six to eight month abstinence rates of 21% to 24% in the first three contests but a somewhat less favourable outcome in the most recent contest. Conclusions: MHHP Quit and Win contests produced positive but variable outcomes both in proportions of smokers reached in the community and in abstinence among contest participants. The contest model has been widely disseminated. Contests may have significant impact in their own right and may increase interest in additional cessation options including more formal help programmes.\n      </p>", "           ", "These varieties, still cultivated in a primitive manner, may have value for hybridizing with Burley and Virginia tobaccos.

The study was conducted in the north eastern United States from 1980 to 1983. All subjects were 40-54 years of age, and none had smoked cigarettes for at least two years. Among men who had never smoked cigarettes the relative risk of myocardial infarction for those who smoked at least five cigars a day, compared with not smoking cigars and pipes and allowing for other risk factors, was estimated to be 1.7 (95% confidence interval 0.6 to 4.8). Among ex-smokers of cigarettes the corresponding estimate for those who smoked at least five cigars a day was 4.5 (2.2 to 9.2). The estimates for men who smoked fewer cigars, or pipes, were closer to 1.0 and not significant. Men who stop smoking cigarettes and switch to at least five cigars a day apparently continue to have an increased risk of myocardial infarction, possibly because they continue to inhale the smoke.\n      </p>", "Objective: To track trends in cigar smoking and assess perceptions of cigar related health risks among Massachusetts adults. Design: A random digit dial telephone survey conducted in 1993 and a subsequent monthly random digit dial survey conducted March 1995 to June 2000. Participants: 4733 adults who completed the 1993 survey and 14 868 adults who completed the monthly survey between 1995 and 2000. Main outcome measures: Trends in current and experimental cigar use and perceptions of health risks. Results: Current cigar usage increased significantly among men aged 18-34 years between 1993 (5.8%) and 1997-98 (18.2%), but began to decrease in 1999-2000 (13.5%). Young men were much more likely than older men or women of any age to have experimented with cigars in the year before interview, but this trend appears to have decreased slightly since 1998. Young male cigar smokers were increasingly those who never smoked cigarettes. Former cigarette smokers were not smoking cigars in greater numbers. Cigar smokers were roughly three times as likely as those who do not smoke cigars to believe cigars are a safer alternative to cigarettes, and that perception did not appear to change much over time. Conclusion: Cigar usage increased dramatically among young men in Massachusetts in conjunction with national increases in sales and marketing of cigars, but now appears to be decreasing.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Methods: We undertook a pooled analysis of the data on men from six published case-control studies from Denmark, France, Germany, and Spain, to assess the association between pipe and cigar smoking and bladder cancer, and to compare it with the risk from cigarette smoking. Complete history of tobacco smoking was ascertained separately for cigarettes, cigars, and pipe. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated after adjusting for age, study, and employment in high-risk occupations. Results: The pooled data set comprised 2279 cases and 5268 controls, of whom 88 cases and 253 controls smoked only cigars or pipe. The OR for pure cigarette smoking was 3.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.9-4.2), that for pure pipe smoking was 1.9 (95% CI 1.2-3.1) and that for pure cigar smoking was 2.3 (95% CI 1.6-3.5). The increase in the OR of bladder cancer that was observed with duration of smoking was non-significantly lower for cigars than for cigarettes. Conclusion: Our results suggest that smoking of cigars and pipe is carcinogenic to the urinary bladder, although the potency might be lower than for cigarettes.\n      </p>", "Objective: Youth use of cigars has increased in the USA. Understanding brand preference among youth could help explain the attraction to cigars, and develop prevention strategies. This study reports on youth characteristics associated with preferences for cigar brands.

The brands preferred by over 5% of cigar users were Phillies (overall prevalence: 31.0% 95% confidence interval (Cl) 27.9% to 34.3%), Black &amp; Mild (12.3%, 95% Cl 9.8% to 15.4%), Garcia y Vega (11.4%, 95% Cl 9.3% to 13.8%), Swisher Sweets (9.6%, 95% Cl 7.6% to 12.2%), Backwoods (6.1%, 95% Cl 4.6% to 8.1%), and nonlisted brands (16.4%, 95% Cl 14.0% to 19.0%). Male cigar smokers were significantly more likely than females to prefer five brands: Backwoods, Dutch Masters, Garcia y Vega, Phillies, and Swisher Sweets, while females were more likely to prefer Black &amp; Mild and non-listed brands. Brand preferences were also distinguished by self, friends' and siblings' tobacco use, race/ethnicity, parents' education and cigar use, GPA (grade point average), college plans, and community type. Urban students were more likely to prefer Black &amp; Mild; students whose parents smoke cigars preferred non-listed brands. Conclusions: Youth prefer certain brands, most notably Phillies. Particular brands are preferred by particular youth subgroups, raising the possibility of selective marketing toward these groups.\n      </p>", "           ", "The internet is fast becoming a new battleground between tobacco control advocates and pro-tobacco forces, and this new media will certainly have a greater impact on tobacco use behaviour in the future. This paper reviews how the internet can encourage youth smoking by providing youth access to tobacco products and offering content that glamorises smoking lifestyle and culture, particularly in hundreds of websites and chat rooms. These sites feature pictures of celebrity smokers, provide information about smoking in movies, and provide smoking advice to teen smokers. In contrast, youth smoking is discouraged on online grassroots advocacy and countermarketing websites. Although these strategies show promise, more research is needed to evaluate their impact. Recommendations are made for future research to study pro-smoking internet content and ways to counteract it, as well as to monitor the online activities of the tobacco companies. Finally, some of the challenges in addressing tobacco related internet content are discussed.\n      </p>", "Objectives: This study evaluates the effect of a 5 New Taiwan Dollar (NT$5) Health and Welfare Tax increase on the consumption of domestic and imported cigarettes and cigars. Methods: Using statistics published annually from 1971 through 2000, we set up a model based on the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) demand model to estimate price and expenditure elasticity coefficients of cigarettes and cigars. Results: Our results showed that the price elasticity coefficients for domestic and imported cigarettes were -0.644 and -0.822. The consumption of imported cigarettes was reduced by 7.51 packs per capita, and the consumption of domestic cigarettes was reduced by 15.21 packs per capita. Total per capita consumption of cigarettes was reduced by 22.72 packs (18%). Conclusions: From the public health and financial perspectives, the increase in this excise tax on tobacco to the Taiwan government will have significant effect in reducing cigarette consumption; it will also generate additional tax revenues.\n      </p>", "Both cigar and cigarette tobacco produce an increase in the number of goblet cells in the rat trachea and intrapulmonary airways over a six-week period. The increase in goblet cells is similar for the two types of tobacco; in both it is proportional to increase in dose and greatest in the proximal intrapulmonary airways.\n      </p>", "The smoke of English cigarettes (flue-cured tobacco) greatly shortens the life of rats and damages the respiratory system, whereas that of the cigar (air-cured tobacco) is relatively harmless. This bears out two of the principal features in the 1971 Report of the Royal College of Physicians, which draws attention to the large number of premature deaths in cigarette smokers and the comparative safety of smoking cigars.\n      </p>", "To help in clarifying the conflicting data on the role of tracheobronchial microflora in chronic bronchitis, the tracheobronchial microflora of a homogeneous group of clinically stable patients with chronic obstructive bronchitis was characterized by transtracheal aspiration. Their mean percentage ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 sec to the forced vital capacity was 45%. The results were that (1) a bacterial tracheobronchial microflora was present in only 50% of the patients, (2) viridans streptococci were the bacteria most frequently isolated, and (3) the presence or absence of a tracheobronchial microflora was significantly associated with the amount of present cigarette smoking. The fact that patients who smoked less than one pack per day were most likely to have a sterile tracheobronchial tree (P = 0.015) implied that there was a critical amount of cigarette smoke that impaired the clearance and/or detoxification of bacteria from the tracheobronchial tree and that it must have been persistently present.\n      </p>", "Using original survey data from Spain, this paper assesses the determinants of smoking behavior. This study examines the effect on smoking of the most diverse set of risk measures ever considered: lung cancer, relative lung cancer risks, lung disease, heart disease, relative heart disease risks, lost life expectancy to smokers, and various risk measures for passive smoking. Smoking measures include cigarette smoking, the number of cigarettes smoked, and pipe and cigar smoking. Primary smoking risks have a more consistent negative effect on smoking than perceived passive smoking risks.\n      </p>", "Five ex-cigarette smokers and five primary pipe and cigar smokers each smoked a large cigar. Carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) and plasma nicotine levels were measured. In the ex-cigarette smokers mean COHb rose from 2\u00b79% to 9\u00b76% and plasma nicotine from 79\u00b70 nmol/l to 281 nmol/l (12\u00b78-45\u00b76 ng/ml). This response was similar to that of cigarette smokers smoking cigarettes, which indicated that the subjects had inhaled and absorbed significant amounts of nicotine. In the primary pipe and cigar smokers the mean COHb rose from 0\u00b78% to 1\u00b70% and the plasma nicotine from 21 nmol/l to 32 nmol/l (3\u00b74-5\u00b72 ng/ml), indicating neither significant inhalation nor significant nicotine absorption. Since ex-cigarette smokers do not seem to lose their habit of inhaling when they change to cigars, measures aimed at persuading smokers to switch to cigars will have little effect on their health. Pipe and cigar smokers who have never smoked cigarettes do not inhale, which probably accounts for their reduced incidence of coronary heart disease and lung cancer. But they also appear not to absorb nicotine, which suggests that nicotine is absorbed largely from the lung and that the buccal mucosa is unimportant. It also raises the interesting question of why primary pipe and cigar smokers do smoke.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "During the second half of the eighteenth century the Spanish Crown monopolised the tobacco industry in its American colonies, creating vertically integrated organisations which included factories for the production of cigars and cigarettes. A detailed analysis of the regulations, organisation and policies applied during the Peruvian viceroyalty suggests that Bourbon officials were effective managers. The monopoly was successful at curbing contraband and extracting rents. The evolution of monopoly policies, however, reflected political constraints on the Crown's efforts to raise revenues. The archival evidence suggests that Bourbon officials closed the tobacco factories in Peru in 1791 as a result of public opposition.\n      </p>", "A population based study of 388 cases of bladder cancer including papillomas and 787 controls in Greater Copenhagen confirmed the role of smoking in the aetiology of bladder cancer. Significantly increased relative risks were found for persons who had smoked only cigarettes (RR = 2\u00b79; both sexes combined) and for mixed smokers including cigarettes (RR = 3\u00b76; both sexes combined). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed significant influences of the amount (pack years) of cigarettes smoked and a reduced risk among persons who had stopped smoking. No significant effects of smoking pipe or cigars/cigarillos were apparent, and the present study does not confirm previous suggestions of associations between the smoking of cigars/cigarillos and bladder cancer in Denmark. Only a slight increase in relative risk with the amount smoked was found. The influence of smoking on bladder cancer risk was similar for tumours in stages T\u2081 and T\u2082\u208b\u2084 at diagnosis and also for tumours of grades 1-2 and grades 3-4 at diagnosis.\n      </p>", "           ", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "           ", "This paper uses Kennan's (1988) model to separately identify supply-side and demand-side dynamics in US import data. Dynamics arise from both autocorrelated shocks to supply- and demand-side fundamentals, and from lagged adjustment to these shocks. The model consists of a pair of partial adjustment models in which consumers and producers each attempt to follow a stochastic target level of imports subject to a quadratic adjustment cost. The model is applied to quarterly data on US imports of seven narrowly defined commodities: Autos, Beer, Cameras, Wine, Cigars, Tea, and Soap. Two main results emerge. First, adjustment costs are important on both sides of the market. Second, supply-side adjustment costs are larger than demand-side adjustment costs.\n      </p>", "In a random sample of 25 129 Swedish men who responded to a questionnaire on smoking habits in 1963 the cause specific mortality was followed through 1979. In the cohort, 32% smoked cigarettes, 27% a pipe, and 5% cigars. There were clear covariations (p&amp;lt;0\u00b7001) between the amount of tobacco smoked and the risk of death due to cancer of the oral cavity and larynx, oesophagus, liver, pancreas, lung, and bladder as well as due to bronchitis and emphysema, ischaemic heart disease, aortic aneurysm, and peptic ulcer. Pipe smokers showed similar risk levels to cigarette smokers. There was a close to linear increase in lung cancer risk in relation to the amount of tobacco smoked for cigarette, pipe, and cigar smokers, respectively. An increasing risk of ischaemic heart disease with amount smoked was seen among both cigarette and pipe smokers. A similar fraction of inhalers in Swedish cigarette and pipe smokers may explain the similarity in risks.\n      </p>", "The Fermi surface of beryllium has been determined experimentally by studying the de Haas-van Alphen effect of single crystals in pulsed magnetic fields. The de Haas-van Alphen frequency (proportional to the extremal area of the Fermi surface normal to the field) was measured as a function of field direction. Consideration of the hexagonal symmetry of the Brillouin zone (discussed in the Appendix) shows that only six distinct classes of frequency variation with field direction are possible, and these considerations are used to deduce the locations and forms of the various sheets of the Fermi surface. The Fermi surface is found to consist of hole and electron surfaces of equal volume (each containing 0.162 carrier per atom). The hole surface is somewhat like a coronet, i.e. a ring of six smoothed tetrahedra joined by small necks lying in the central (0001) plane of the first double Brillouin zone, and the electron surface is a set of six roughly ellipsoidal surfaces (cigars) lying on the vertical edges of the second double zone. Detailed shapes and sizes are deduced for the coronet and cigars such that the extremal areas of cross-section are consistent to within 1% of those obtained from the observed de Haas-van Alphen frequencies. No oscillations of frequency corresponding to the outer (0001) orbit round the coronet were, however, observed; a study of the field dependence of amplitude of the oscillations from the coupled orbit round the cigar shows that this absence can be explained by magnetic breakdown of the {1010} band gap. The model described is in good agreement with the predictions of recent band structure calculations, and is consistent with other experimental evidence.\n      </p>", "The smoking habits of 1501 cigarette smokers attending 28 general practitioners in five group practices in London were assessed. Prevalence of smoking, daily cigarette consumption, and the use of cigars, untipped cigarettes, and hand-rolled cigarettes were lower in the women. After controlling for consumption the proportions of men and women who smoked every day were similar. Women who smoked 20 or more a day were similar to men in their self-reported inhaling habits and use of low-nicotine cigarettes. The results suggest that women differ from men in those aspects of smoking that are determined pre-dominantly by social factors but that their smoking habits become similar when pharmacological motivation takes over. This apparently occurs when consumption reaches about 20 cigarettes a day, when smoking almost inevitably becomes a regular event and the sex differences disappear.\n      </p>", "Native to the Americas, tobacco was during the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries disseminated throughout the world with little recognition of its pathogenic powers. But as cigarette smoking became the foremost addictive practice during this century, it generated such massive epidemics of lung cancer, coronary heart disease, and dozens of other diseases that tobacco was finally recognized to be the chief environmental hazard to health. In the United States during this century alone, the smoking of 26 trillion cigarettes, 556 billion cigars, and consumption of 25 billion pounds of \"manufactured tobacco\" has produced: more than 2.7 million deaths from lung cancer, more than 7 million deaths from cardiovascular disease, and more than 14 million deaths from all forms of tobaccosis. In the world, its population now smoking 5 trillion cigarettes annually and consuming millions of tons of tobacco in other forms, the tobacco death toll is probably at least 3 million annually and more than 50 million this century.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Design - The Oslo study is a prospective, cohort study of the epidemiology and preventive aspects of cardiovascular diseases in middle aged men. Screening started in May 1972 and results after 18 years of follow up are reported. Participants - There were 16 209 men aged 40-49 years, of whom 16 173 had no stroke history. Eighty five men died from stroke, of whom 48 were daily cigarettes smokers, 7 were pipe and cigar smokers, 15 smoked cigarettes and pipe or cigars daily, 11 were previous cigarette smokers, and 4 had never smoked cigarettes. Main results - Results of proportional hazards regression analysis adjusted for age, diastolic blood pressure, and glucose concentration showed the following rate ratios (RR) (95% confidence interval) of smoking groups compared with those who had never smoked or had previously smoked: combined cigarette and cigar or pipe smokers, RR=6.1 (3.0,12.5); cigarettes only, RR=4.1 (2.3,7.4); and pipe and/or cigars only RR=2.2 (0.9,5.5). The overall, age adjusted risk of smoking cigarettes daily was 3.5 and was found to increase with increasing cigarette consumption. Regardless of their smoking group, stroke cases had increased diastolic (DBP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) when compared with men who had not had a stroke. The absolute differences in DBP and SBP between stroke cases and others for never and previous cigarette smokers versus daily smokers were twice as large: DBP, 12.1 mmHg versus 6.5 mmHg respectively and SBP, 16.0 mmHg versus 7.1 mmHg respectively. A high BMI increased the risk of fatal stroke of never and previous cigarette smokers. Men being treated for hypertension at the time of screening had three times the crude risk of fatal stroke of men who were not taking hypertensive treatment. Conclusions - Daily cigarette smoking increased the risk of fatal stroke three and a half times. Combined cigarette and pipe or cigar smoking had a higher risk than smoking cigarettes only. An increased risk was found in relation to increased daily cigarette consumption.\n      </p>", "The excavations of 1982 at Kintampo rock shelter no. 6 are described and the results correlated with those of Flight (1976). The sequence demonstrates an overlap between the Punpun and Kintampo culture ceramic traditions and a progressive introduction of diagnostically Kintampo traits. Decreasing residential mobility is also indicated. Analysis of the organic remains, while casting doubt on earlier identifications of domestic Bos and cultivated cowpea, suggests progressive clearing of the forest such as would have occurred with horticulture and the confirmed herding of an ovicaprid. Earlier interpretations of Kintampo culture origins are reviewed in the light of the new evidence and all available radiocarbon dates, and it is tentatively concluded that the culture emerged in central Ghana through coalescence of autochthonous and northern elements. /// Les fouilles de 1982 \u00e0 l'abri-sous-roche Kintampo-6 sont d\u00e9crites et les r\u00e9sultats compar\u00e9s \u00e0 ceux de Flight (1976).

Design: Data from three years (1988, 1990, and 1992) of the General Household Survey, a continuing cross-sectional survey of the general population living in private households in Great Britain. Subjects: Adult ever-smokers of cigarettes. Main outcome measure: Rate of smoking cessation, as indexed by ex-smokers as a percentage of ever-cigarette smokers, and counting those who have switched from cigarettes to pipes or cigars not as ex-smokers but as continuing smokers. Results: In each year men had higher rates of smoking cessation overall than women, but this difference was accounted for by differences in the age structure of male and female ever-smoking populations. After age-adjustment, the odds of cessation in women compared with men did not differ significantly in any year (odds ratios 0.94, 0.92, and 0.98 in 1988, 1990, and 1992, respectively). Young women had higher cessation rates than young men, and middle-aged men had higher cessation rates than middle-aged women. These differences remained after adjustment for a variety of family and socio-economic variables bearing on the likelihood of cessation. Conclusions: The idea that women in general give up smoking less than men is a myth, but there are real gender differences in particular age groups that need explanation.

A total of 399 cases with histologically confirmed prostate cancer and 476 population controls, 45-70 years of age, gave face-to-face interviews and provided adequate smoking histories. We analyzed the effects of smoking cigarettes only and of smoking cigars, or pipes, or both, with or without cigarettes, on the risk of prostate cancer. Overall, the associations between smoking cigarettes and prostate cancer were weak and compatible with no effect; the associations with cigar and pipe smoking were stronger. Among men with high body mass index, however, we found appreciable associations between cigarette smoking and prostate cancer risk. A history of ever smoking daily was associated with an odds ratio of 2.31 (95% confidence interval = 1.09-4.89). Risk increased with the amount smoked per day and with the duration of smoking. Taken together, the findings of increased risk associated with cigar and pipe smoking and the findings of increased risk associated with cigarette smoking among obese men suggest that tobacco smoking may be a risk factor for prostate cancer.\n      </p>", "Objective: Investigate the association between tobacco use and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Methods: Tobacco-use data were collected during in-person interviews in a population-based case-control study of NHL (N = 1593 patients, N = 2515 controls) conducted in the San Francisco Bay Area between 1988 and 1995. Odds ratios (ORs) for HIV-negative participants were obtained from adjusted unconditional logistic regression models stratified by sex. Results: NHL was not associated with overall tobacco use, intensity or duration of cigarette smoking in women or men. However, ORs were increased for NHL among men who used any non-cigarette tobacco alone (OR = 1.7), non-cigarette tobacco and cigarettes (OR = 1.4), multiple types of non-cigarette tobacco alone (OR = 2.1) and smokeless tobacco alone (OR = 4.0). In analyses stratified by sex and age, ORs for NHL associated with cigarette smoking in general were above unity among those aged \u226560 years. ORs for follicular lymphoma were increased in men who used cigarettes and other tobacco, cigars alone and smokeless tobacco alone. Diffuse large-cell lymphoma in men was associated with use of cigarettes and other tobacco, and multiple types of non-cigarette tobacco. Conclusion: Our data do not support an association between overall tobacco use and all NHL in women or men. Further analyses are warranted in larger studies to evaluate non-cigarette tobacco use, tobacco-related biologic markers and genetic factors in the development of NHL.\n      </p>", "A survey conducted by mail was made to obtain information on inhalation in relation to type and amount of smoking. The proportion of men who said that they inhaled: (1) increased with amount of smoking and decreased with age, (2) was very much higher for cigarette smokers than for cigar and pipe smokers, and (3) was much higher for men who smoked only cigarettes than for men who smoked both cigarettes and cigars. The proportion of men who said that they inhale differed very little between those smoking filter tip cigarettes and those smoking non-filter tip cigarettes. A test was made to determine whether the wording of the letter of transmittal enclosed with the questionnaires, the organization from which the questionnaires were sent, the presence or absence of a postage stamp on the envelope enclosed for reply, or the failure of some men to reply had an influence on the findings. It appeared that these factors made very little difference in the percentage distribution of responses to questions on smoking habits. However, a larger percentage of the addressees replied when a return envelope with a postage stamp attached was enclosed than when a business reply envelope not requiring a postage stamp was enclosed. The wording of the letter of transmittal also seemed to have some influence on the percentage of replies.\n      </p>", "Tobacco smoking has long been identified as the most important risk factor for upper aero-digestive tract cancers. To investigate the effect of different tobacco types and the benefit of smoking cessation, we analyzed data from a case-control study of 784 cases of mouth, pharynx, and larynx cancers and 1,578 non-cancer controls in three metropolitan hospital areas in Brazil. Subjects were interviewed as to their smoking and drinking habits, demographics, environmental exposures, occupational history, health characteristics, and diet. Controlling for total tobacco and alcohol consumption, risks for ex-smokers compared with current smokers decreased substantially with time since cessation of the habit. Compared with never smokers, ex-smokers of &gt;20 years had a relative risk (RR) of 1.98 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.0-3.8] for all upper aero-digestive tract cancers. RRs for long-term (&gt;20 years) ex-smokers tended to be lower for mouth (RR = 1.61) and pharynx (RR = 1.52) than for larynx (RR = 3.63) cancers. The benefit of quitting was strongest for commercial cigarettes (RR = 1.45, 95% CI = 0.7-3.0) for ex-smokers of &gt;10 years, as compared with smoking of black tobacco (RR = 2.57, 95% CI = 1.4-4.6), cigars (RR = 2.59, 95% CI = 0.6-11.6), and pipe tobacco (RR = 3.40, 95% CI = 1.3-8.8).\n      </p>", "In 1966, a cohort of White males aged 35 or over, who were policy-holders with the Lutheran Brotherhood Insurance Society (United States), completed a mail questionnaire on tobacco use, diet, and demographic characteristics. During the 20 years of follow-up, 219 lung cancer deaths occurred. Besides the strong relationship with cigarette smoking, we observed an effect on lung cancer risk among current users of cigars or pipes who were nonsmokers of cigarettes (relative risk [RR] = 3.5, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 1.0-12.6) or who were past/occasional users of cigarettes (RR = 2.7, CI = 1.4-5.3). In addition, elevated risks (from 1.5 to 2.6) of lung cancer were found among craftsmen and laborers, with the highest risks among subjects who worked in the mining or manufacturing industry. No association between current (as of 1966) use of beer or hard liquor and lung cancer was observed, although past users were at elevated risk. An inverse association between lung cancer and intake of fruits was observed, and risks of lung cancer were lower among persons in the highest dietary intake quintiles of vitamins A and C. Except for oranges, however, none of the inverse associations with fruits or dietary nutrients had statistically significant trends. The findings from this cohort study add to the evidence of an adverse effect of cigar/pipe smoking and possibly protective effect of dietary factors on lung cancer risk.\n      </p>", "We present a qualitative analysis of students' written narratives of gender norm violation projects-for example, women smoking cigars, repairing cars, wearing moustaches; men doing housework, carrying purses, wearing nail polish, crying in public-in terms relevant to theoretical literature that problematizes heterosexuality. We show that routinely unquestioned heteronormative expectations and proscriptions that exist as background context in contemporary culture come to the fore when traditional gender boundaries are crossed. Further, we show that heteronormativity itself is gendered via the homosexualization of disruptive men and heterosexualization of disruptive women. This article discusses and compares how compulsory heterosexuality operates differently for women and men. We describe and give examples of different ways in which students and others sexualize even unexplicitly sexual actions and appearances. These tactics of sexualization include homophobic disclaimers, homophobic labeling, and heterosexualization. The concept \"heterogender\" best captures these common ways of interpreting gender norm violations. We discuss findings in terms of the importance of empirical inquiry to a primarily theoretical literature, the fact that gender differences are actively maintained, and the distinction between institutionalized and experienced heterosexuality. Our findings generally support radical feminist, cultural feminist, and queer theories of gender inequality, all of which focus on enforced heterosexuality.\n      </p>", "Several entries in an account-book written in 1649 by the Dutch minister R. Junius show that tobacco smoking was known to some aboriginal groups in the middle of the 17th century. The cultivation - as well as the consumption - of Nicotiana tabacum was probably adopted in various ways and at different times by the natives, who may have obtained the seeds not only from Dutch catechists, but also from Spanish colonists, Japanese traders, or Chinese immigrants. Only scanty information about the spread of the plant and its use was provided by Chinese annalists and western travellers of the 18th and 19th century, but when Japanese anthropologists extended their fieldwork to the remotest regions of the island between 1909 and 1919, tobacco growing and smoking was common to all the 'tribes' not yet dominated by Chinese civilization: Atayal, Saisiat, Sediq, Thao, Tsou, Kanakanabu, Saaroa, Ami, Rukai, Bunun, Puyuma, and Paiwan. Up to now the Ami seem to be most sophisticated in handling tobacco, differentiating two qualities and two ways to utilize the leave. Generally, as among the other aboriginal groups, seedlings are grown in seed-beds before being tansplanted to the field; the buds are removed and the leaves of the lower part ofthephnt are plucked away in several phases, to be dried, but neither cured nor fermented. Tobacco is usually smoked in pipes made of bamboo or wood, only the Ami also smoking cigars. Among all the native groups tobacco is of no ntual and almost no social significance\n      </p>", "Measurements have been made of the total electronic attenuation \u03b1 , in the low temperature limit, of longitudinal ultrasound propagating along the $\\langle 0001\\rangle,\\langle 10\\overline{1}0\\rangle \\ \\text{and}\\ \\langle 11\\overline{2}0\\rangle $ directions in pure magnesium, zinc and cadmium crystals. In magnesium this attenuation was obtained from data taken from 1.2 to 80 K and in zinc and cadmium from the application of the critical magnetic field in the superconducting state at 0.1 K. In the high-frequency limit \u03b3 is proportional to the frequency of the sound \u03bd and values of N = lim (\u03b1 /\u03bd) have been found by extrapolation from measurements between 30 and 450 MHz. For magnesium N=0.20\u00b1 0.01 dB cm-1 MHz-1 for all three propagation directions; in zinc N = 1.29, 0.143 and 0.067 dB cm-1 MHz-1 (\u00b1 5%) for sound propagation along $\\langle 0001\\rangle,\\langle 10\\overline{1}0\\rangle \\ \\text{and}\\ \\langle 11\\overline{2}0\\rangle $ directions respectively. For cadmium the corresponding values are 0.99, 0.165 and 0.048 dB cm-1 MHz-1(\u00b1 5%). The anisotropy in N is partly due to elastic anisotropy and partly to the Fermi surface geometry. In zinc and cadmium, our measurements are in agreement with the Fermi surface due to Stark &amp; Falicov (1967), in which the 'butterflies' and 'cigars' are absent. We have deduced average values of the deformation parameter Kx for magnesium, zinc and cadmium, using the theory of Pippard. We show that the deformation parameter for strains along the c-axis in zinc and cadmium is much greater than for strains in the basal plane, whereas magnesium is isotropic. Electron mean free paths lu deduced from the ultrasonic data are compared with those obtained from resistivity measurements on our samples. Anisotropies in lu are attributed partly to Fermi surface geometry and partly to small angle scattering.\n      </p>", "Objective: To assess tobacco use among Massachusetts public college students and compare students who attended high school in Massachusetts and were exposed to the Massachusetts Tobacco Control Program (MTCP) with students who attended high school outside Massachusetts and were unexposed to the programme. Design: Analysis of the 1999 Massachusetts College Alcohol Survey. Setting: Four year public colleges and universities in Massachusetts (n = 11). Subjects: 1252 randomly selected students (response rate 56%). Main outcome measures: Self report of current (past 30 day), past year, and lifetime use of cigarettes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco. Results: One third of students had used a tobacco product in the past month and 46.4% had used tobacco in the past year. Cigarettes accounted for most of this tobacco use. Total tobacco use was higher among males than females but cigarette smoking did not differ by sex. Tobacco use was lower among athletes and higher among students who used alcohol or marijuana. Current tobacco use was lower among public college students who had attended high school in Massachusetts compared with those who attended high school in another state (31.5% v 42.6%, p = 0.006). This difference persisted after adjustment for age, sex, race, parental education, and students' college residence (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 0.97, p = 0.034). Conclusion: Tobacco use is common among Massachusetts public college students. Students who were exposed to the MTCP during high school are less likely to use tobacco than their peers who were not exposed to this programme. The MTCP may have reduced tobacco use among this group of young adults.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t
