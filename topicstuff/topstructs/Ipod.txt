Most of the world's present continental margins which were formed during that 200 Ma period are `passive' margins lying within the interiors of lithospheric plates. Several models of rifting and evolution of these passive margins have been proposed. The objectives of Ipod include testing of these models by learning as much as we can about the history of rifting of passive continental margins, their internal structure, distribution of facies, subsidence history, and the nature of the transition and modification of the crust at the margin. These objectives cannot be attained by drilling alone, and geophysical surveying and analysis of samples from the drilling are essential parts of the overall programme.\n      </p>", "Podcasting offers music educators and their students the opportunity to share information, learn about technology, and communicate with the local community via the Internet.

This article contributes by examining how capabilities and bargaining power coevolve. As capabilities are developed, those who are favored by knowledge asymmetries make decisions that balance value creation potential against the rent appropriation regime, such as the organizational form in which the capability will be embedded. Using the example of Apple's development of the iPod, this article illustrates how stakeholders plan for rent appropriation as they assemble new capabilities \u2014 well before any value is actually created. Given that firm performance is an outcome of both capability development and rent appropriation, a robust theory must incorporate an understanding of how they coevolve. As such, the article highlights the need to integrate property rights theory with theories of value creation and governance costs as actors constantly make trade-offs along these dimensions.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "A brand strategy can be critical to the success of an innovation, particularly in the long term. There are times when a firm literally needs to brand an innovation or lose it. Without a successful branding strategy, an innovation can be short-lived\u2014diffusing into a confused marketplace with its impact dissipated\u2014or become another forgotten internal initiative. In such cases, branding can make all the difference. Branding, it should be emphasized, does not mean simply putting a name and logo on an innovation. Rather, it means making the brand an integral part of a coherent strategy, supported by actively managed and adequately funded brand-building programs. At the same time, not all innovations merit such a program and over-branding can pose business risks.\n      </p>", "When the translation termination factor Sup35 adopts the prion state, [PSI\u207a], the read-through of stop codons increases, uncovering hidden genetic variation and giving rise to new, often beneficial, phenotypes. Evidence suggests that prion induction involves a process of maturation, but this has never been studied in detail. To do so, we used a visually tractable prion model consisting of the Sup35 prion domain fused to GFP (PrD-GFP) and overexpressed it to achieve induction in many cells simultaneously. PrD-GFP first assembled into Rings as previously described. Rings propagated for many generations before the protein transitioned into a Dot structure. Dots transmitted the [PSI\u207a] phenotype through mating and meiosis, but Rings did not. Surprisingly, the underlying amyloid conformation of PrD-GFP was identical in Rings and Dots. However, by electron microscopy, Rings consisted of very long uninterrupted bundles of fibers, whereas Dot fibers were highly fragmented. Both forms were deposited at the IPOD, a biologically ancient compartment for the deposition of irreversibly aggregated proteins that we propose is the site of de novo prion induction. We find that oxidatively damaged proteins are also localized there, helping to explain how proteotoxic stresses increase the rate of prion induction. Curing PrD-GFP prions, by inhibiting Hsp104's fragmentation activity, reversed the induction process: Dot cells produced Rings before PrD-GFP reverted to the soluble state. Thus, formation of the genetically transmissible prion state is a two-step process that involves an ancient system for the asymmetric inheritance of damaged proteins and heritable changes in the extent of prion fragmentation.\n      </p>", "This study investigated the impact of technology-based advance organizers (TBAOs) on the academic performance of 240 4th grade English learners (ELs) participating in a science class in School in the Park (SITP), a museum-school collaboration. While SITP provides a rich, hands-on learning environment, ELs face significant linguistic challenges in their ability to access the dense academic language and concepts provided in SITP's English only curriculum, thus negatively impacting ELs' engagement and learning. The TBAOs were designed in response to this issue. The study investigated two forms of treatment: TBAOs viewed on individual handheld mobile devices (HMDs), specifically iPods; and, TBAOs viewed as a whole class on DVD. The study utilized both qualitative and quantitative data sources, including a pre-and posttest, hands-on and performance-based assessments, as well as focus interviews. Results showed a significant interaction effect between group assignment, language status and application assessments, indicating ELs performed significantly better in the treatment groups. Students who used the HMD instead of the DVD or no treatment improved their total scores significantly on hands-on, performance-based measurements. Differences between treatment and control groups' performance on pre-/posttests approached significance. Furthermore, students reported TBAOs supported learning by introducing new material, introducing and reviewing daily academic vocabulary, and helping them anticipate behavioral and procedural expectations of hands-on activities. Classroom and museum educators reported an increase in the treatment groups' motivation and engagement. The study provided important implications in the use and power of learner-controlled technology in supporting ELs' linguistic and academic success.\n      </p>", "The internet, the iPod, the cell phone, Kindle, blogs, computer games, and virtual realities mean that cultural economics has changed an enormous amount in just the last five years.

Yet the experience of Japanese manufacturing firms, who are well known for their high standards of quality performance, casts doubt upon this relationship. In fact, the inability of some Japanese high-technology firms to introduce radical and disruptive new technologies is in part due to the emphasis they have placed on product quality. By delaying the introduction of new technologies until their quality could be assured, they lost out to American firms who were willing to introduce new products and service features that met the needs of consumers, even though they were not free from deficiencies, such as Apple's iPod.

The specific issue of NFL telecasts was eventually resolved outside the public policy arena, but it raises a more general question: What \"monopolies\" should governments regulate? Antitrust laws in the United States arose from a desire to protect competition. However, public policy is beginning to apply them in marketplaces that are monopolies only in the sense that consumers perceive a lack of competition, even though, in actuality, competitors are free to operate. Examples range from the NFL to iPod to De Beers. The authors refer to the dominant suppliers in these markets as \"psychological monopolies\" created by consumer beliefs and feelings, not by economic reality. The authors argue that the regulation of such monopolies is misguided.\n      </p>", "A major faunal change occurred at the end of the Eocene in the deep Labrador Sea (DSDP Site 112). Predominantly agglutinated Eocene benthic foraminiferal assemblages are replaced by an Oligocene calcareous assemblage. This replacement correlates with similar changes in the Canadian margin and the North Sea where the exit of agglutinated foraminifera is associated with a change in depositional environment. In Site 112, however, lithology, percent carbonate, and percent organic carbon are relatively constant across the faunal change. Thus, at least in the deep sea, these properties may not be critical to the development of predominantly agglutinated assemblages. We infer that certain hydrographic properties (low oxygen, high CO2, low pH, and thus more corrosive waters) favor the development of agglutinated assemblages. We suggest that the replacement of agglutinated foraminifera in the deep Labrador Sea was due to a change in hydrographic properties. Seismic evidence from this region indicates initiation of northern sources of bottom water in the late Eocene to early Oligocene which may have resulted in a change in hydrography and the exit of agglutinated foraminifera. Despite diachrony of certain occurrences in Site 112 and the Canadian margin, compared with previously reported ranges of agglutinated taxa from the North Sea, European flysch basin, and the deep sea, agglutinated foraminifera are useful in the zonation of Labrador Sea sediments.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "The introductory statistics course has traditionally trageted consumers of statistics with the intent of producing a citizenry capable of a critical analysis of basic published statistics.

The success of this approach is predicated on providing data that the students see as real and relevant. Modern students, however, have a different view of data than did students of 10 or even 5 years ago.

The general pattern of geomagnetic field polarity reversals during late Neogene times is now well established, and the absolute age of major polarity transitions during the past 5 Ma or so has been determined from palaeomagnetic studies of radiometrically dated igneous rocks (see, for example, McDougall et al. 1977). Consequently, a comparison of the late Neogene polarity sequences identified in the sediments of NE Biscay and the NW African margins, with this `standard' polarity reversal time scale, allows the precise determination of sediment accumulation rates, and the times at which significant changes in these rates occurred. These comparisons have led to the recognition of a short but significant hiatus in early Pleistocene times in both areas. Such information has importance in evaluating the recent geological evolution of these margins. For earlier geological periods the correlation between the magnetic polarity time scale and the geological time scale is less well established but studies of the type described here can still provide important information on the timing of certain geological events recorded in the magnetic anomaly patterns of the oceanic lithosphere. For example, in the early Palaeogene sediments cored at Sites 403-405, off the SW Rockall continental margin, a sequence of magnetic reversals has been identified, which shows a good correlation with marine magnetic anomalies 22-24. Since anomaly 24 is the oldest recognizable anomaly in the Atlantic, and lies immediately adjacent to the continental margins, the biostratigraphic age of this anomaly, determined from the nannofossil and dinocyst zonal determinations at Site 404, provides important information on the date of initial rifting of Rockall (together with the rest of NW Europe) from Greenland. The Site 404 results indicate that this important tectonic event occurred in early Eocene times, at about 52 Ma B.P., rather than at 60 Ma B.P. as was originally proposed by Heirtzler et al. (1968). A further example of the potential value of this type of study is provided by the Cretaceous sediments cored at Sites 397, 398, 400A and 402A. A long section of predominantly normal polarity sediments at the latter three sites appears to correlate with the long Cretaceous interval of dominantly normal polarity identified in marine magnetic anomaly patterns. The combination of palaeomagnetic and biostratigraphic studies allows useful constraints to be placed on the maximum duration of this interval, and on the age of short reversals within and below it. This information has direct relevance to the interpretation of Mesozoic marine magnetic anomaly patterns in terms of the history of seafloor spreading and evolution of continental margins during the early stages of opening of the South Atlantic in Cretaceous times.\n      </p>", "           ", "Subduction is not only the counterpart process to seafloor spreading in the plate tectonic regime, but is also the major driving mechanism of plate motions.

The importance of recognizing the existence of two basic and contrasted modes in subduction, controlled by the strength of coupling between subducting and overriding plates, is demonstrated. The two modes are High Stress Chilean-type subduction and Low Stress Mariana-type subduction.

We also find that individuals who initially estimate their behavior in an ideal world subsequently make more realistic predictions.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

We present a two-country, two-good model with trade in stocks and bonds, and three types of disturbances: shocks to endowments, to the relative demand for home versus foreign goods, and to the distribution of income between labor and capital. With these shocks, optimal international portfolios are shown to be consistent with the stylized facts.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

These pigments are present in depositional areas receiving high inputs of terrestrially derived oxidized organic matter. Such areas include the Black Sea, the Bay of Biscay, the Blake-Bahama Basin, and slumped Miocene deposits off Cape Bojador on the west coast of Africa.\n      </p>", "The similarity between moral and visceral disgust is a current topic of debate. One method of investigating this issue has been to examine the use of language. Prior work has shown that the words disgust and anger are often used interchangeably to describe offense toward immoral behavior involving harm (autonomy violations), whereas \"grossed out\" is reserved for viscerally repulsive stimuli. Based on these findings we developed a questionnaire and tested 126 undergraduates for how they used the words disgusted, angry, grossed out, and morally right or morally wrong to rate various responses toward ethics of autonomy social situations. We found that grossed out was least endorsed for these transgressions and that ratings on this measure did not correspond to ratings of moral wrongness. Moreover, individual differences in visceral disgust sensitivity had no association with participants' evaluations or use of any of the descriptors. By contrast, ratings for angry and disgusted were equivalently and highly endorsed for autonomy violations, and the ratings given with these descriptors also corresponded to the ratings given for moral wrongness. These findings add to growing evidence that moral disgust is not visceral (gross) but rather appears to be representative of anger even though autonomy violations are often labeled as \"disgusting.\"\n      </p>", "Music has often been used to symbolize and express ontological experiences. This article explores a mode of nineteenth-century self-audition where music captures a glimpse of the freedom that lies at the core of the subject. This mode of listening has intensified with the development of modern technology and is still prevalent in constructing the identity of the self. The opera scene from the Shawshank Redemption not only is an example of this special effect, but provides a narrative of how music achieves this affect, creating an ideal and virtual self through sound technology.\n      </p>", "The Theoretically Audible, but Practically Inaudible Range (TAPIR) is sound in the highest bandwidth of human hearing; it is barely perceptible by most people but can be transmitted and received by stereotypical transducers. The authors suggest the potential of TAPIR sound as a new medium for music, sonic arts and mobile media.\n      </p>", "Many Japanese museums and other cultural institutions have been exploring ways to enrich visitors' experiences using new digital devices. This paper briefly describes some examples in Japan, ranging from a PDA, a mobile phone, podcasting, and an audio guide speakerequipped vest to a Quick Response (QR) code on a brochure for downloading a short video to a mobile phone. Cultural institutions in Japan continue to search for the most effective and engaging uses of modern technologies.\n      </p>", "Mobile phones have been steadily gaining appreciation among the museum community as a versatile tool. The new generation of mobile phones allows museums to imagine a whole new range of applications, including audiovisual personal tours and live-feed broadcasting. Personal tours using mobile phones are appealing to museum educators since patrons can use their own familiar equipment, thus eliminating the uncertainty and frustration of learning how to operate a new portable device. This, in turn, allows museums to focus on content quality rather than hardware maintenance. Mobile phones can also be used to deliver a lecture via live broadcast. Live broadcasting can connect galleries, schools, and even fossil sites globally with just a phone call; an exciting prospect for those involved in planning educational programs at museums. It can also promote collaborations among cultural and educational facilities.\n      </p>"], "words": {"code": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "particularly": {"number": 1, "prob":
