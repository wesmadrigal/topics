Large queens are significantly more likely to survive than small queens through the initial stages of colony founding. These differences in individual fitness correlates have corresponding effects on colony fitness. In species in which individual queens vary in fitness, sexual allocation ratios should incorporate the individual fitness functions.\n      </p>", "Various models purporting to explain natural hybrid zones make different assumptions about the fitness of hybrids. One class of models assumes that hybrids have intrinsically low fitness due to genetic incompatibilities, whereas other models allow hybrid fitness to vary across natural environments. We used the intrinsic rate of increase to assess lifetime fitness of hybrids between two species of montane plants Ipomopsis aggregata and Ipomopsis tenuituba planted as seed into multiple field environments. Because fitness is predicted to depend upon genetic composition of the hybrids, we included F1 hybrids, F2 hybrids, and backcrosses in our field tests. The F2 hybrids had female fitness as high, or higher, than expected under an additive model of fitness. These results run counter to any model of hybrid zone dynamics that relies solely on intrinsic nuclear genetic incompatibilities. Instead, we found that selection was environmentally dependent. In this hybrid zone, cytoplasmic effects and genotype-by-environment interactions appear more important in lowering hybrid fitness than do intrinsic genomic incompatibilities between nuclear genes.\n      </p>", "In well known formulations, political science, classical and neoclassical economics, and political economy have recognized as foundational a human impulse toward self-preservation. To employ this concept, modern social-sciences theorists have made simplifying assumptions about human nature and have then built elaborately upon their more incisive simplifications. Advances in biology, including advances in evolutionary theory, notably inclusive-fitness theory, have for decades now encouraged the reconsideration of such assumptions and, more ambitiously, the reconciliation of the social and life sciences. I ask if this reconciliation is feasible and test a path to the unification of politics and biology, called here \"political biology.\" Two new notions, \"fitness extraction\" and \"fitness exchange,\" are defined, then differentiated from each other, and lastly contrasted to cooperative gaming, the putative essential element of economics.\n      </p>", "Evolutionary theory predicts that a population in a new environment will accumulate adaptive substitutions, but precisely how they accumulate is poorly understood. The dynamics of adaptation depend on the underlying fitness landscape. Virtually nothing is known about fitness landscapes in nature, and few methods allow us to infer the landscape from empirical data. With a view toward this inference problem, we have developed a theory that, in the weak-mutation limit, predicts how a population's mean fitness and the number of accumulated substitutions are expected to increase over time, depending on the underlying fitness landscape. We find that fitness and substitution trajectories depend not on the full distribution of fitness effects of available mutations but rather on the expected fixation probability and the expected fitness increment of mutations. We introduce a scheme that classifies landscapes in terms of the qualitative evolutionary dynamics they produce. We show that linear substitution trajectories, long considered the hallmark of neutral evolution, can arise even when mutations are strongly selected. Our results provide a basis for understanding the dynamics of adaptation and for inferring properties of an organism's fitness landscape from temporal data. Applying these methods to data from a long-term experiment, we infer the sign and strength of epistasis among beneficial mutations in the Escherichia coli genome.\n      </p>", "Natural selection favors fitter variants in a population, but actual evolutionary processes may decrease fitness by mutations and genetic drift. How is the stochastic evolution of molecular biological systems shaped by natural selection? Here, we derive a theorem on the fitness flux in a population, defined as the selective effect of its genotype frequency changes. The fitnessflux theorem generalizes Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection to evolutionary processes including mutations, genetic drift, and time-dependent selection. It shows that a generic state of populations is adaptive evolution: there is a positive fitness flux resulting from a surplus of beneficial over deleterious changes. In particular, stationary nonequilibrium evolution processes are predicted to be adaptive. Under specific nonstationary conditions, notably during a decrease in population size, the average fitness flux can become negative. We show that these predictions are in accordance with experiments in bacteria and bacteriophages and with genomic data in Drosophila. Our analysis establishes fitness flux as a universal measure of adaptation in molecular evolution.\n      </p>", "The fitness effects of mutations on a given genotype are rarely constant across environments to which this genotype is more or less adapted, that is, between more or less stressful conditions. This can have important implications, especially on the evolution of ecological specialization. Stress is thought to increase the variance of mutations' fitness effects, their average, or the number of expressed mutations. Although empirical evidence is available for these three mechanisms, their relative magnitude is poorly understood. In this paper, we propose a simple approach to discriminate between these mechanisms, using a survey of empirical measures of mutation effects in contrasted environments. This survey, across various species and environments, shows that stress mainly increases the variance of mutations' effects on fitness, with a much more limited impact on their average effect or on the number of expressed mutations. This pattern is consistent with a simple model in which fitness is a Gaussian function of phenotypes around an environmentally determined optimum. These results suggest that a simple, mathematically tractable landscape model may not be quantitatively as unrealistic as previously suggested. They also suggest that mutation parameter estimates may be strongly biased when measured in stressful environments.\n      </p>", "1. Age at first breeding has a large influence on fitness and hence is crucial to the evolution of life-history strategies. Goshawks Accipiter gentilis start breeding aged 1-4 years. Using 30 years of data and both lifetime reproductive success (LRS) and \u03bb ind as a fitness estimate for 74 female goshawks, I showed that the optimal age at first reproduction was 3 years in this population. 2. Females that started to breed earlier had lower LRS and \u03bb ind, not because of reduced life span, but because of lower reproduction at early ages. 3. The constraint hypothesis, which states that foraging or other skills improve with age was the most likely explanation for the higher reproduction with increasing age. 4. Incorporating habitat heterogeneity provided the mechanism that explained not only the fitness cost to early maturity, but also why this cost was heterogeneous. Females starting to breed aged 1 suffered a very high fitness cost if they were in a bad-quality territory, but fitness costs were small when they were in a good-quality territory. This explains why I found evidence for a nonlinear selection pressure on age at first breeding. 5. Population density also affected whether a female started to breed early or not: over the study period, population density increased and the percentage of females starting to breed aged 1 decreased. 6. The optimal age at first breeding seems to be a trait affected by a complex interplay between cost and benefits of early reproduction mediated by habitat heterogeneity and population density.\n      </p>", "The use of the metaphors of general fitness and N-K spaces can assist in the understanding of the development of the physical landscape. Different modes of change can be viewed as different types of movement in, and distortions of, these phase spaces. Visualized in this manner landscape change can be viewed as both channelized, constrained and random.\n      </p>", "In addition to the familiar possibility of epistasis between nuclear loci, interactions may evolve between the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes in eukaryotic cells. We looked for such interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae genotypes evolved independently and asexually in the laboratory for 2000 generations, and in an ecologically distinct pathogenic S. cerevisiae strain. From these strains we constructed derivatives entirely lacking mitochondrial DNA and then used crosses to construct matched and unmatched pairings of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. We detected fitness effects of such interactions in an evolved laboratory strain and in crosses between the laboratory and pathogen strains. In both cases, there were significant contributions to progeny fitness of both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes and of their interaction. A second evolved genotype showed incompatibility with the first evolved genotype, but the nuclear and mitochondrial contributions to this incompatibility could not be resolved. These results indicate that cytonuclear interactions analogous to those already known from plants and animals can evolve rapidly on an evolutionary timescale.\n      </p>", "Two hypotheses have been considered in the literature regarding how anuran morphology reduces predation risk: by (1) improving escape swimming performance, or (2) using the tail as a lure to draw predator strikes away from the body of the tadpole. We investigated these hypotheses using a modification of the morphology, performance, and fitness path analysis of Arnold (1983, Am. Zool. 23:347-361). Indirect effects of morphology on fitness, as mediated by burst swimming speed, as well as direct paths from morphology to survival with dragonfly larvae were included in the path model. Tadpole morphology did affect burst swimming speed, however, burst swimming speed did not influence survival. Fast tadpoles were larger overall, had long tails, deep tail muscles, and proportionally small bodies. In addition, a shape trait similar to published descriptions of the tail lure morphology had a direct relationship with survival. Thus, only the tail lure effect was supported. This study documents the utility of analyzing multiple trait effects and demonstrates that including direct paths between traits and fitness in the morphology, performance, and fitness path model allows evaluation of alternative hypothesis of selection.\n      </p>", "During early adulthood, a phase in which the central nervous system displays considerable plasticity and in which important cognitive traits are shaped, the effects of exercise on cognition remain poorly understood. We performed a cohort study of all Swedish men born in 1950 through 1976 who were enlisted for military service at age 18 (N = 1,221,727). Of these, 268,496 were full-sibling pairs, 3,147 twin pairs, and 1,432 monozygotic twin pairs. Physical fitness and intelligence performance data were collected during conscription examinations and linked with other national databases for information on school achievement, socioeconomic status, and sibship. Relationships between cardiovascular fitness and intelligence at age 18 were evaluated by linear models in the total cohort and in subgroups of full-sibling pairs and twin pairs. Cardiovascular fitness, as measured by ergometer cycling, positively associated with intelligence after adjusting for relevant confounders (regression coefficient b = 0.172; 95% CI, 0.168-0.176). Similar results were obtained within monozygotic twin pairs. In contrast, muscle strength was not associated with cognitive performance. Cross-twin cross-trait analyses showed that the associations were primarily explained by individual specific, non-shared environmental influences (&gt; 80%), whereas heritability explained &lt; 15% of covariation. Cardiovascular fitness changes between age 15 and 18 y predicted cognitive performance at 18 y. Cox proportional-hazards models showed that cardiovascular fitness at age 18 y predicted educational achievements later in life. These data substantiate that physical exercise could be an important instrument for public health initiatives to optimize educational achievements, cognitive performance, as well as disease prevention at the society level.\n      </p>", "Consistently with the prediction that selection should deplete additive genetic variance $(V_{A})$ in fitness, traits closely associated to fitness have been shown to exhibit low heritabilities $(h^{2}=V_{A}/(V_{A}+V_{R}))$ . However, empirical data from the wild indicate that this is in fact due to increased residual variance $(V_{R})$ , rather than due to decreased additive genetic variance, but the studies in this topic are still rare. We investigated relationships between trait heritabilities, additive genetic variances, and traits' contribution to lifetime reproductive success (\u2248fitness) in a red-billed gull (Larus novaehollandiae) population making use of animal model analyses as applied to 15 female and 13 male traits. We found that the traits closely associated with fitness tended to have lower heritabilities than traits less closely associated with fitness. However, in contrast with the results of earlier studies in the wild, the low heritability of the fitness-related traits was not only due to their high residual variance, but also due to their low additive genetic variance. Permanent environment effects-integrating environmental effects experienced in early life as well as nonadditive genetic effects-on many traits were large, but unrelated to traits' importance for fitness.\n      </p>", "There is a current debate over the net fitness consequences of sexual selection. Do preferred males increase female fitness or are these males manipulating females for their own benefit? The evidence is mixed. Some studies find that mating with attractive males increases female fitness components, while others show that preferred males decrease measures of female fitness. In this study, we examined some of the fitness consequences of pre-copulatory sexual selection in Drosophila simulans. Virgin females were either paired with one male and given an opportunity for one copulation or were exposed simultaneously to two males. This allowed us to compare female preference (copulation latency) and fitness (longevity, lifetime productivity and rate of offspring production) both with and without the influence of male-male competition. When females had access to a single male, neither female longevity, productivity, nor short-term rate of productivity were associated with female preference, and although females mated more quickly with larger males, male size was also not associated with any female fitness measure. Inclusion of male-male competition showed that female longevity was negatively affected by preference, while productivity and rate of productivity was unaffected. This latter experiment also indicated that females preferred larger males, but again, male size was not associated with female fitness. These results indicate that females may not benefit from mating with preferred males, but they may incur survival costs.\n      </p>", "The costs of dispersal are an important factor promoting natal philopatry, thereby encouraging the formation of social groups. The red fox, Vulpes vulpes, exhibits a highly flexible social system and one that is thought to represent a possible stage in the evolution of more complex patterns of group-living. Although the potential benefits accruing to philopatric offspring have previously been studied in this species, the potential costs of dispersal have received less attention. We contrasted survival rates, nutritional status, injuries and reproductive output of dispersing and non-dispersing male and female foxes in an urban population to assess the relative costs of dispersal versus natal philopatry. Mortality rates were not significantly higher for dispersing foxes, either in the short-or long-term. There was no evidence of increased nutritional stress in dispersing individuals. Dispersing individuals did, however, exhibit greater levels of wounding, although this did not appear to affect survival. Dispersing females were more likely to miss a breeding opportunity early in their reproductive lifespan. In contrast, both dispersing and nondispersing males were unlikely to breed in their first year. We conclude that the major fitness component in females affected by dispersing is age at first reproduction.\n      </p>", "The population consequences of sexual selection remain empirically unexplored. Comparative studies, involving extinction risk, have yielded different results as to the effect of sexual selection on population densities make contrasting predictions. Here, we investigate the relationship between sexual dimorphism (SD) and population productivity in the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, using 13 populations that have evolved in isolation. Geometric morphometric methods and image analysis are employed to form integrative measures of sexual dimorphism, composed of variation in weight, size, body shape, and pigmentation. We found a positive relationship between SD and adult fitness (net adult offspring production) across our study populations, but failed to find any association between SD and juvenile fitness (egg-to-adult survival). Several mechanisms may have contributed to the pattern found, and variance in sexual selection regimes across populations, either in female choice for \"good genes\" or in the magnitude of direct benefits provided by their mates, would tend to produce the pattern seen. However, our results suggest that evolutionary constraints in the form of intralocus sexual conflict may have been the major generator of the relationship seen between SD and population fitness.\n      </p>", "Fitness interactions between loci in the genome, or epistasis, can result in mutations that are individually deleterious but jointly beneficial. Such epistasis gives rise to multiple peaks on the genotypic fitness landscape. The problem of evolutionary escape from such local peaks has been a central problem of evolutionary genetics for at least 75 years. Much attention has focused on models of small populations, in which the sequential fixation of valley genotypes carrying individually deleterious mutations operates most quickly owing to genetic drift. However, valley genotypes can also be subject to mutation while transiently segregating, giving rise to copies of the high fitness escape genotype carrying the jointly beneficial mutations. In the absence of genetic recombination, these mutations may then fix simultaneously. The time for this process declines sharply with increasing population size, and it eventually comes to dominate evolutionary behavior. Here we develop an analytic expression for Ncrit the critical population size that defines the boundary between these regimes, which shows that both are likely to operate in nature. Frequent recombination may disrupt high-fitness escape genotypes produced in populations larger than Ncrit before they reach fixation, defining a third regime whose rate again slows with increasing population size. We develop a novel expression for this critical recombination rate, which shows that in large populations the simultaneous fixation of mutations that are beneficial only jointly is unlikely to be disrupted by genetic recombination if their map distance is on the order of the size of single genes. Thus, counterintuitively, mass selection alone offers a biologically realistic resolution to the problem of evolutionary escape from local fitness peaks in natural populations.\n      </p>", "The evolution of resistance in response to pesticide selection is expected to be delayed if fitness costs are associated with resistance genes. The estimate of fitness costs usually involves comparing major growth traits of resistant versus susceptible individuals in the absence of pesticide. Ideally, a measure of changes in resistance allele frequency over several generations would allow the best estimate of the overall fitness cost of a resistance gene. In greenhouse conditions, we monitored the dynamics of the evolution of the frequencies of six herbicide-resistant mutations (acetolactate synthase, cellulose synthase, and auxin-induced target genes) in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana in a multigenerational study covering five to seven nonoverlapping generations. The microevolutionary dynamics in experimental populations indicated a mean fitness cost of 38%, 73%, and 94% for the ixr1-2, axr1-3, and axr2-1 resistances, respectively; no fitness cost for the csr1-1, and ixr2-1 resistances; and a transient advantage for the aux1-7 resistance. The result for the csr1-1 resistance contrasts with a cost of 37% based on total seed number in a previous study, demonstrating that single generation studies could have limitation for detecting cost. A positive frequency dependence for the fitness cost was also detected for the ixr1-2 resistance. The results are discussed in relation to the maintenance of polymorphism at resistance loci.\n      </p>", "The intersex genetic correlation for fitness (&lt;tex-math&gt;$r_{w}^{fm}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;), a standardized measure of the degree to which male and female fitness covary genetically, has consequences for important evolutionary processes, but few estimates are available and none have explored how it changes with environment. Using a half-sibling breeding design, we estimated the genetic (co)variance matrix (G) for male and female fitness, and the resulting &lt;tex-math&gt;$r_{w}^{fm}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;, in Drosophila serrata. Our estimates were performed in two environments: the laboratory yeast food to which the population was well adapted and a novel corn food. The major axis of genetic variation for fitness in the two environments, accounting for 51.3 per cent of the total genetic variation, was significant and revealed a strong signal of sexual antagonism, loading negatively in both environments on males but positively on females. Consequently, estimates of &lt;tex-math&gt;$r_{w}^{fm}$&lt;/tex-math&gt; were negative in both environments (- 0.34 and -0.73, respectively), indicating that the majority of genetic variance segregating in this population has contrasting effects on male and female fitness. The possible strengthening of the negative &lt;tex-math&gt;$r_{w}^{fm}$&lt;/tex-math&gt; in this novel environment may be a consequence of no history of selection for amelioration of sexual conflict. Additional studies from a diverse range of novel environments will be needed to determine the generality of this finding.\n      </p>", "Genetic incompatibilities and low offspring fitness are characteristic outcomes of hybridization between species. Yet, the creative potential of recombination following hybridization continues to be debated. Here we quantify the outcome of hybridization and recombination between adaptively divergent populations of the North American legume Chamaecrista fasciculata in a large-scale field experiment. Previously, hybrids between these populations demonstrated hybrid breakdown, suggesting the expression of adaptive epistatic interactions underlying population genetic differentiation. However, the outcome of hybridization ultimately rests on the performance of even later generation recombinants. In experiments that compared the performance of recombinant F6 and F2 generations with nonrecombinant F1 and parental genotypes, we observed that increasing recombination had contrasting effects on different life-history components. Lifetime fitness, defined as the product of survivorship and reproduction, showed a strong recovery of fitness in the F6. The overall gain in fitness with increased recombination suggests that hybridization and recombination may provide the necessary genetic variation for adaptive evolution within species. We discuss the mechanisms that may account for the gain in fitness with recombination, and explore the implications for hybrid speciation and phenotypic evolution.\n      </p>", "Negative epistasis in hybrid genomes commonly results in postzygotic isolation between divergent lineages. However, some genomic regions may be selectively neutral or adaptive in hybrids and thus may potentially cross species barriers. We examined postzygotic isolation between ecologically similar species of Louisiana Iris: Iris brevicaulis and I. fulva to determine the potential for adaptive introgression in nature. Line-cross analyses allowed us a general overview of the gene action responsible for fitnessrelated traits. We then used a QTL mapping approach to detect genomic regions responsible for variation in these traits. Although hybrid classes suffered reduced fitness for many traits, hybrid means were equivalent to at least one of the parental species in overall estimates of maternal and paternal fitness during the two years of the field study. The genetic architecture underlying the fitness-related traits varied across field site and year of the study, thus emphasizing the importance of the environment in determining the degree of postzygotic isolation and potential for introgression across natural hybrid zones.\n      </p>", "1 Relationships between plant population size, fitness and within-population genetic diversity are fundamental for plant ecology, evolution and conservation. We conducted meta-analyses of studies published between 1987 and 2005 to test whether these relationships are generally positive, whether they are sensitive to methodological differences among studies, whether they differ between species of different life span, mating system or rarity and whether they depend on the size ranges of the studied populations. 2 Mean correlations between population size, fitness and genetic variation were all significantly positive. The positive correlation between population size and female fitness tended to be stronger in field studies than in common garden studies, and the positive correlation between genetic variation and fitness was significantly stronger in DNA than in isoenzyme studies. 3 The strength and direction of correlations between population size, fitness and genetic variation were independent of plant life span and the size range of the studied populations. The mean correlations tended to be stronger for the rare species than for common species. 4 Expected heterozygosity, the number of alleles and the number or proportion of polymorphic loci significantly increased with population size, but the level of inbreeding FIS was independent of population size. The positive relationship between population size and the number of alleles and the number or proportion of polymorphic loci was stronger in self-incompatible than in self-compatible species. Furthermore, fitness and genetic variation were positively correlated in self-incompatible species, but independent of each other in self-compatible species. 5 The close relationships between population size, genetic variation and fitness suggest that population size should always be taken into account in multipopulation studies of plant fitness or genetic variation. 6 The observed generality of the positive relationships between population size, plant fitness and genetic diversity implies that the negative effects of habitat fragmentation on plant fitness and genetic variation are common. Moreover, the stronger positive associations observed in self-incompatible species and to some degree in rare species, suggest that these species are most prone to the negative effects of habitat fragmentation.\n      </p>", "Deleterious mutation accumulation has been implicated in many biological phenomena and as a potentially significant threat to human health and the persistence of small populations. The vast majority of mutations with effects on fitness are known to be deleterious in a given environment, and their accumulation results in mean population fitness decline. However, whether populations are capable of recovering from negative effects of prolonged genetic bottlenecks via beneficial or compensatory mutation accumulation has not previously been tested. To address this question, long-term mutation-accumulation lines of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, previously propagated as single individuals each generation, were maintained in large population sizes under competitive conditions. Fitness assays of these lines and comparison to parallel mutation-accumulation lines and the ancestral control show that, while the process of fitness restoration was incomplete for some lines, full recovery of mean fitness was achieved in fewer than 80 generations. Several lines of evidence indicate that this fitness restoration was at least partially driven by compensatory mutation accumulation rather than a result of a generic form of laboratory adaptation. This surprising result has broad implications for the influence of the mutational process on many issues in evolutionary and conservation biology.\n      </p>", "The complex interactions between genetic diversity and evolution have important implications in many biological areas including conservation, speciation, and mate choice. A common way to study these interactions is to look at heterozygosity-fitness correlations (HFCs). Until recently, HFCs based on noncoding markers were believed to result primarily from global inbreeding effects. However, accumulating theoretical and empirical evidence shows that HFCs may often result from genes being linked to the markers used (local effect). Moreover, local effect HFCs could differ from global inbreeding effects in their direction and occurrence. Consequently, the investigation of the structure and consequences of local HFCs is emerging as a new important goal in evolutionary biology. In this study of a wild threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) population, we first tested the presence of significant positive or negative local effects of heterozygosity at 30 microsatellites loci on five fitness components: survival, mating success, territoriality, length, and body condition. Then, we evaluated the direction and shape of total impact of local HFCs, and estimated the magnitude of the impacts on fitness using regression coefficients and selection differentials. We found that multilocus heterozygosity was not a reliable estimator of individual inbreeding coefficient, which supported the relevance of single-locus based analyses. Highly significant and temporally stable local HFCs were observed. These were mainly positive, but negative effects of heterozygosity were also found. Strong and opposite effects of heterozygosity are probably present in many populations, but may be blurred in HFC analyses looking for global effects only. In this population, both negative and positive HFCs are apparently driving mate preference by females, which is likely to contribute to the maintenance of both additive and nonadditive genetic variance.\n      </p>", "Protein evolution is crucial for organismal adaptation and fitness. This process takes place by shaping a given 3-dimensional fold for its particular biochemical function within the metabolic requirements and constraints of the environment. The complex interplay between sequence, structure, functionality, and stability that gives rise to a particular phenotype has limited the identification of traits acquired through evolution. This is further complicated by the fact that mutations are pleiotropic, and interactions between mutations are not always understood. Antibiotic resistance mediated by \u03b2-lactamases represents an evolutionary paradigm in which organismal fitness depends on the catalytic efficiency of a single enzyme. Based on this, we have dissected the structural and mechanistic features acquired by an optimized metallo-\u03b2-lactamase (M\u03b2L) obtained by directed evolution. We show that antibiotic resistance mediated by this enzyme is driven by 2 mutations with sign epistasis. One mutation stabilizes a catalytically relevant intermediate by fine tuning the position of 1 metal ion; whereas the other acts by augmenting the protein flexibility. We found that enzyme evolution (and the associated antibiotic resistance) occurred at the expense of the protein stability, revealing that M\u03b2Ls have not exhausted their stability threshold. Our results demonstrate that flexibility is an essential trait that can be acquired during evolution on stable protein scaffolds. Directed evolution aided by a thorough characterization of the selected proteins can be successfully used to predict future evolutionary events and design inhibitors with an evolutionary perspective.\n      </p>", "The role of balancing selection in maintaining genetic variation for fitness is largely unresolved. This reflects the inherent difficulty in distinguishing between models of recurrent mutation versus selection, which produce similar patterns of inbreeding depression, as well as the limitations of testing such hypotheses when fitness variation is averaged across the genome. Signatures of X-linked overdominant selection are less likely to be obscured by mutational variation because X-linked mutations are rapidly eliminated by purifying selection in males. Although models maintaining genetic variation for fitness are not necessarily mutually exclusive, a series of predictions for identifying X-linked overdominant selection can be used to separate its contribution from other underlying processes. We consider the role of overdominant selection in maintaining fitness variation in a sample of 12 X chromosomes from a population of Drosophila melanogaster. Substantial variation was observed for male reproductive success and female fecundity, with heterozygous-X genotypes exhibiting the greatest degree of variance, a rinding that agrees well with predictions of the overdominance model. The importance of X-linked overdominant selection is discussed along with models of recurrent mutation and sexually antagonistic selection.\n      </p>", "Empirical studies of life histories often ignore stochastic variation, despite theoretical demonstrations of its potential impact on life-history evolution. Here we use a novel approach to explore the effects of stochastic variation on life-history evolution and estimate the selection pressures operating on the monocarpic perennial Carlina vulgaris, in which flowering may be delayed by up to eight years. The approach is novel in that we use modern theoretical techniques to estimate selection pressures and the fitness landscape from a fully parameterised individual-based model. These approaches take into account temporal variation in demographic rates and density dependence. Analysis of 16 years' data revealed significant temporal variation in growth, mortality, and recruitment in our study population. Flowering was strongly size dependent and, unusually for such a species, also age dependent. Individual-based models of the flowering strategy, parameterized using field data, consistently underestimated the size at flowering, when temporal variation in demographic rates was ignored. In contrast, models that incorporated temporal variation in growth, mortality, and recruitment predicted sizes at flowering not significantly different from those observed in the field. Temporal variation in mortality, which had the largest effect on the flowering strategy, selected for increased size at flowering. An analytical approximation is presented to explain this result, extending the \"1-year look-ahead criterion\" presented in Rees et al. (2000). A fitness landscape generated by following the fate of rare mutant invaders with a broad range of alternative flowering strategies demonstrated that the observed parameters were adaptive. However, the fitness landscape reveals that approximately equal fitness is achieved by a broad range of strategies, providing a mechanism for the maintenance of genetic variation. To understand how the different parameters that defined our models determine the fitness of rare mutants, we numerically estimated the elasticities and sensitivities of mutant fitness. This demonstrated strong selection on a number of the parameters. Elasticities and sensitivities estimated in constant and random environments were significantly positively correlated, and both were negatively related to the standard error of the parameter. This last result is surprising and, we argue, reflects the genetic and phenotypic responses to selection.\n      </p>", "Many essential organelles and endosymbionts exhibit a strict matrilineal pattern of inheritance. The absence of paternal transmission of such extranuclear components is thought to preclude a response to selection on their effects on male viability and fertility. We overturn this dogma by showing that two mechanisms, inbreeding and kin selection, allow mitochondria to respond to selection on both male viability and fertility. Even modest levels of inbreeding allow such a response to selection when there are direct fitness effects of mitochondria on male fertility because inbreeding associates male fertility traits with mitochondrial matrilines. Male viability effects of mitochondria are also selectable whenever there are indirect fitness effects of males on the fitness of their sisters. When either of these effects is sufficiently strong, we show that there are conditions that allow the spread of mitochondria with direct effects that are harmful to females, contrary to standard expectation. We discuss the implications of our findings for the evolution of organelles and endosymbionts and genomic conflict.\n      </p>", "The relationships between quantitative and reproductive fitness traits in animals are of general biological importance for the development of population genetic models and our understanding of evolution, and of great direct economical importance in the breeding of farm animals. Two well investigated quantitative traits-body weight (BW) and litter size (LS)-were chosen as the focus of our review. The genetic relationships between them are reviewed in fishes and several mammalian species. We have focused especially on mice where data are most abundant. In mice, many individual genes influencing these traits have been identified, and numerous quantitative trait loci (QTL) located. The extensive data on both unselected and selected mouse populations, with some characterized for more than 100 generations, allow a thorough investigation of the dynamics of this relationship during the process of selection. Although there is a substantial positive genetic correlation between both traits in unselected populations, caused mainly by the high correlation between BW and ovulation rate, that correlation apparently declines during selection and therefore does not restrict a relatively independent development of both traits. The importance of these findings for overall reproductive fitness and its change during selection is discussed.\n      </p>", "As the ultimate source of genetic variation, spontaneous mutation is essential to evolutionary change. Theoretical studies over several decades have revealed the dependence of evolutionary consequences of mutation on specific mutational properties, including genomic mutation rates, U, and the effects of newly arising mutations on individual fitness, s. The recent resurgence of empirical effort to infer these properties for diverse organisms has not achieved consensus. Estimates, which have been obtained by methods that assume mutations are unidirectional in their effects on fitness, are imprecise. Both because a general approach must allow for occurrence of fitness-enhancing mutations, even if these are rare, and because recent evidence demands it, we present a new method for inferring mutational parameters. For the distribution of mutational effects, we retain Keightley's assumption of the gamma distribution, to take advantage of the flexibility of its shape. Because the conventional gamma is one sided, restricting it to unidirectional effects, we include an additional parameter, \u03c1, as an amount it is displaced from zero. Estimation is accomplished by Markov chain Monte Carlo maximum likelihood. Through a limited set of simulations, we verify the accuracy of this approach. We apply it to analyze data on two reproductive fitness components from a 17-generation mutation-accumulation study of a Columbia accession of Arabidopsis thaliana in which 40 lines sampled in three generations were assayed simultaneously. For these traits, U \u2243 0.1-0.2, with distributions of mutational effects broadly spanning zero, such that roughly half the mutations reduce reproductive fitness. One evolutionary consequence of these results is lower extinction risks of small populations of A. thaliana than expected from the process of mutational meltdown. A comprehensive view of the evolutionary consequences of mutation will depend on quantitatively accounting for fitness-enhancing, as well as fitness-reducing, mutations.\n      </p>", "Gene flow between crop fields and wild populations often results in hybrids with reduced fitness compared to their wild counterparts due to characteristics imparted by the crop genome. But the specifics of the evolutionary outcome of crop-wild gene flow may depend on context, varying due to local environmental conditions and genetic variation within and among wild populations and among crop lines. To evaluate context-dependence of fitness of F1 hybrids, sunflower crop lines were crossed with nine wild populations from across the northern United States. These crop-wild hybrids and their wild counterparts were grown under agricultural conditions in the field with and without wheat competition. Hybrids were far less fecund than wild plants, yet more likely to survive to reproduce. There was considerable variability among wild populations for fecundity and the specific crop line used to generate the crop-wild hybrid significantly affected fecundity. The fitness deficit suffered by crop-wild hybrids varied by population, as did the rankings of the crop-wild hybrids from three different crop lines. Wheat competition decreased fecundity and survival considerably and hampered seed production of wild plants more than that of hybrids. Genotype x environment interactions indicated that the response of fitness to competition differed by population. Consequently, the fitness of hybrids relative to wild plants varied considerably among wild populations and was not consistent across environments. Notably, relative fitness of hybrids was greater under competitive conditions. This research is the first study of its kind to demonstrate that the consequences of crop-wild gene flow are context dependent and contingent on the genetics of the specific wild populations and the local biotic and abiotic conditions.\n      </p>", "We examined genotype (G) by environment (E) interactions for fitness in mesic and xeric ecotypes of the self-fertilizing annual grass, Avena barbata and their recombinant inbred hybrid progeny. Fitness was assayed (1) in experimental water and nutrient treatments in the greenhouse and (2) in common gardens in each ecotype's native habitat. G x E interactions were significant in the greenhouse. Nevertheless, the same recombinant genotypes tended to have high fitness across all water and nutrient treatments. G x E interactions were less pronounced in the field, and were driven by the contrast between the uniformly low survivorship at the mesic site in 2004 and genetic variation in fitness at the other years/site combinations. Moreover, the mesic ecotype consistently outperformed the xeric in both field and greenhouse. Several of the recombinant genotypes outperformed the parents in the novel greenhouse treatments, but these genotypes did not outperform the mesic parent in field trials. Indeed, it is only in the comparison between field and greenhouse environments that there was a noticeable change in the identity of the most-fit genotype. The results provide evidence that hybridization can create genotypes that are better adapted to newer environments such as those imposed in our greenhouse experiments.\n      </p>", "Life-history theory predicts that parents produce the number of offspring that maximizes their fitness. In birds, natural selection on parental decisions regarding clutch size may act during egg laying, incubation or nestling phase. To study the fitness consequences of clutch size during the incubation phase, we manipulated the clutch sizes during this phase only in three breeding seasons and measured the fitness consequences on the short and the long term. Clutch enlargement did not affect the offspring fitness of the manipulated first clutches, but fledging probability of the subsequent clutch in the same season was reduced. Parents incubating enlarged first clutches provided adequate care for the offspring of their first clutches during the nestling phase, but paid the price when caring for the offspring of their second clutch. Parents that incubated enlarged first clutches had lower local survival in the 2 years when the population had a relatively high production of second clutches, but not in the third year when there was a very low production of second clutches. During these 2 years, the costs of incubation were strong enough to change positive selection, as established by brood size manipulations in this study population, into stabilizing selection through the negative effect of incubation on parental fitness.\n      </p>", "A key assumption in evolutionary studies of locomotor adaptation is that standard laboratory measures of performance accurately reflect what animals do under natural circumstances. One widely examined measure of performance is maximum sprint speed, which is believed to be important for eluding predators, capturing prey, and defending territories. Previous studies linking maximum sprint speed to fitness have focused on laboratory measurements, and we suggest that such analyses may be appropriate for some species and intraspecific classes, but not others. We provide evidence for a general inverse relationship between maximum laboratory sprint speed and the percentage of maximum capacity that animals use when escaping from a threat in the field (the model of locomotor compensation). Further, absolute values of field escape speed and maximum laboratory speed are not significantly related when comparing across a diverse group of Anolis and lacertid lizards. We show that this pattern of locomotor compensation holds both within (i.e., among intraspecific classes) and among lizard species (with some exceptions). We propose a simple method of plotting field escape speed (y-axis) versus maximum laboratory speed (x-axis) among species and/or intraspecific classes that allows researchers to determine whether their study organisms are good candidates for relating laboratory performance to fitness. We suggest that species that reside directly on, or near the \"best fitness line\" (field escape speed = maximum laboratory speed) are most likely to bear fruit for such studies.\n      </p>", "Because the range boundary is the locale beyond which a taxon fails to persist, it provides a unique opportunity for studying the limits on adaptive evolution. Adaptive constraints on range expansion are perplexing in view of widespread ecotypic differentiation by habitat and region within a species' range (regional adaptation) and rapid evolutionary response to novel environments. In this study of two parapatric subspecies, Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana and C. x. ssp. parviflora, we compared the fitness of population transplants within their native region, in a non-native region within the native range, and in the non-native range to assess whether range expansion might be limited by a greater intensity of selection on colonists of a new range versus a new region within the range. The combined range of the two subspecies spans a west-to-east gradient of declining precipitation in the Sierra Nevada of California, with ssp. xantiana in the west being replaced by ssp. parviflora in the east. Both subspecies had significantly higher fitness in the native range (range adaptation), whereas regional adaptation was weak and was found only in the predominantly outcrossing ssp. xantiana but was absent in the inbreeding ssp. parviflora. Because selection intensity on transplants was much stronger in the non-native range relative to non-native regions, there is a larger adaptive barrier to range versus regional expansion. Three of five sequential fitness components accounted for regional and range adaptation, but only one of them, survivorship from germination to flowering, contributed to both. Flower number contributed to regional adaptation in ssp. xantiana and fruit set (number of fruits per flower) to range adaptation. Differential survivorship of the two taxa or regional populations of ssp. xantiana in non-native environments was attributable, in part, to biotic interactions, including competition, herbivory, and pollination. For example, low fruit set in ssp. xantiana in the east was likely due to the absence of its principal specialist bee pollinators in ssp. parviflora's range. Thus, convergence on self-fertilization may be necessary for ssp. xantiana to invade ssp. parviflora's range, but the evolution of outcrossing would not be required for ssp. parviflora to invade ssp. xantiana's range.\n      </p>", "Spontaneous deleterious mutation has been measured in a handful of organisms, zlways under laboratory conditions and usually employing inbred species or gnotypes. We report the results of a mutation accumulation experiment with an outbred annual plant, raphanus raphanistrum, with lifetime fitness measured in both the field and the greenhouse. This Is the first study to report the effects of spontaneous mutation measured under field conditions. Two large replicate populations ($N_{e} \\approx 600$) were maintained with random mating in the greenhouse under relaxed selection for nine generations before the field aassay was performed and ten generations before the greenhouse assay. Each generation, every individual was mated twice, once as a pollen donor and once as a pollen recipient, and a single seed from each plant was chosen randomly to create the next generation. The ancestral population was maintained as seeds at 4\u00b0C. Declines in lifetime fitness were observed in both the field (1.7% per generation; P = 0.27) and the greenhouse (0.6% per generation; P = 0.07). Significant increases in sdditive genetic variance for fitness were found for stems per Day, flowers per stem, fruits per flower and seeds per fruit in the field as well as for fruits per flower in the greenhouse. Lack of significance of the fitness decline may be due to the short period of mutation accumulation, the use of outbred populations, or both. The percent declines in fitness are at the high end of the range observed in other mutation accumulation experiments and give some support to the idea that mutational effects may be magnified under harsher field conditions. Thus, measurement of mutational parameters under laboratory conditions may underestimate the effects of mutations in natural populations.\n      </p>", "The contribution of indirect fitness to inclusive fitness is expected to increase as the reproductive skew increases, with indirect fitness being the only component of inclusive fitness of sterile individuals in eusocial species. However, the relative contribution of indirect fitness to inclusive fitness has rarely been evaluated empirically. Using data from a long-term study (1962-2003), we show that female yellow-bellied marmots that have a later age of 1st successful reproduction incur a substantial loss of direct fitness with no corresponding gain in indirect fitness. Additionally, although females that survive to reproductive age but do not successfully reproduce have a greater indirect fitness than those that reproduce at least once, indirect fitness benefits of foregoing reproduction are insufficient to compensate for the loss of direct fitness resulting from later reproduction. Although indirect fitness composed 22.2% of the inclusive fitness of females that reproduced at least once, females that reproduced at least once had 2.3 times higher inclusive fitness than those that survived to reproductive age but never reproduced. These results suggest that, in yellow-bellied marmots and other species with similar life histories, the contribution of indirect fitness to inclusive fitness does not compensate for loss of direct fitness.\n      </p>", "1. Sustainable insect control requires effective management of the evolution of resistance to pesticides. Resistance management may ultimately depend on a range of diverse strategies. We explored how combining the use of a pathogen with an integrated pest management (IPM)-compatible pesticide, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), could affect the evolution of resistance. 2. We used fitness and laboratory selection experiments to explore whether the use of a nucleopolyhedrovirus could alter the rate of evolution of resistance to a Bt toxin. These results were incorporated into simulation modelling to investigate how pathogens could best be exploited in resistance management. 3. Simultaneous exposure to virus and Bt toxin (mixed sprays) reduced the fitness of Bt-resistant insects compared with treatments with toxin alone. Moreover, Bt resistance incurred additional fitness costs, in terms of egg fertility, in the presence of virus. 4. In a selection experiment with caged insects, spraying toxin-free refugia with virus slowed the evolution of resistance relative to unsprayed refugia, confirming the results of two fitness experiments that indicated that virus would increase the fitness costs of resistance. The impact of virus-mediated costs was explored further in simulation models. 5. Simulations showed that large virus-mediated fitness costs (a reduction in fecundity of 35%) with partially dominant inheritance could lead to effective resistance management with a Bt/virus rotation. Modest fitness costs could, however, markedly improve a rotation strategy with a pathogen that could replicate post-application. 6. Synthesis and applications. Mixed sprays of virus and resistance-prone pesticides such as Bt have the potential to slow the evolution of resistance within an integrated pest management context. However, the efficacy of mixed-spray strategies depends upon precise dosages and/or the presence of a spray-free refuge. In contrast, rotations of pesticides with pathogens that could replicate after application slow the evolution of resistance over a wider range of conditions and control insects cost-effectively. This efficacy is dependent on the co-occurrence of persistent pathogen and pesticide reducing the relative fitness of resistant individuals.\n      </p>", "Spatially structured environments may impact evolution by restricting population sizes, limiting opportunities for genetic mixis, or weakening selection against deleterious genotypes. When habitat structure impedes dispersal, low-productivity (less virulent) infectious parasites may benefit from their prudent exploitation of local hosts. Here we explored the combined ability for habitat structure and host density to dictate the relative reproductive success of differentially productive parasites. To do so, we allowed two RNA bacteriophage \u03a6 genotypes to compete in structured and unstructured (semi-solid versus liquid) habitats while manipulating the density of Pseudomonas hosts. In the unstructured habitats, the more-productive phage strain experienced a relatively constant fitness advantage regardless of starting host density. By contrast, in structured habitats, restricted phage dispersal may have magnified the importance of local productivity, thus allowing the relative fitness of the less-productive virus to improve as host density increased. Further data suggested that latent period (duration of cellular infection) and especially burst size (viral progeny produced per cell) were the phage \"life-history\" traits most responsible for our results. We discuss the relevance of our findings for selection occurring in natural phage populations and for the general evolutionary epidemiology of infectious parasites.\n      </p>", "We used experimental evolution to test directly the important and commonplace evolutionary hypothesis that adaptation, increased fitness within the selective environment, is accompanied by trade-off, a loss of fitness in other nonselective environments. Specifically, we determined whether trade-offs at high temperature generally and necessarily accompany genetic adaptation to low temperature. We measured the relative fitness increment of 24 lineages of the bacterium Escherichia coli evolved for 2,000 generations at 20\u00b0C and the relative fitness decrement of these lines at 40\u00b0C. Trade-offs at the higher temperature were examined for their generality, universality, quantitative relationship, and historical contingency. Considering all 24 lines as a group, a significant decline in fitness was found at 40\u00b0C (mean decline = 9.4%), indicating the generality of the trade-off effect. However, in a lineage-by-lineage analysis, only 15 of 24 showed a significant trade-off, and one lineage increased fitness at high temperature. Thus, although general, trade-offs were not universal. Furthermore, there was no quantitative association between the magnitude of adaptive fitness increment at 20\u00b0C and fitness decline at 40\u00b0C, and no effect of lineages' historical thermal environment on either their improvement at 20\u00b0C or the extent of their trade-off at high temperature. We do not yet know the underlying mechanisms responsible for the trade-off, but they are sufficiently prevalent to drive a general effect. However, approximately one-third of the experimental lineages achieved low-temperature adaptation without detectable high-temperature trade-offs; therefore, it cannot be necessary that every change conferring benefit in cold environments has a negative effect on function in warmer environments.\n      </p>", "Coevolutionary interactions are thought to play a crucial role in diversification of hosts and parasitoids. Furthermore, resource availability has been shown to be a fundamental driver of species diversity. Yet, we still do not have a clear understanding of how resource availability mediates the diversity generated by coevolution between hosts and parasitoids over time. We used experiments with bacteria and bacteriophage to test how resources affect variation in the competitive ability of resistant hosts and temporal patterns of diversity in the host and parasitoid as a result of antagonistic coevolution. Bacteria and bacteriophage coevolved for over 150 bacterial generations under high and low-resource conditions. We measured relative competitive ability of the resistant hosts and phenotypic diversity of hosts and parasitoids after the initial invasion of resistant mutants and again at the end of the experiment. Variation in relative competitive ability of the hosts was both time- and environment-dependent. The diversity of resistant hosts, and the abundance of host-range mutants attacking these phenotypes, differed among environments and changed over time, but the direction of these changes differed between the host and parasitoid. Our results demonstrate that patterns of fitness and diversity resulting from coevolutionary interactions can be highly dynamic.\n      </p>", "1. Several hypotheses for the adaptive basis of sex assume that genotypic fitness varies according to location in a spatially or temporally heterogeneous environment. This study aimed to measure genotype-environment interactions in fitness-related traits, and to compare locality and time as sources of interaction. 2. Clones of the bryozoan Celleporella hyalina were artificially propagated to give cohorts of genetically identical colonies which were reared in the field under three different water flow treatments, and over two seasonal periods. 3. The total number of zooids per colony, and the number of gonozooids alone, were both used as indices of clonal performance, measured at the end of each seasonal experiment. 4. By both zooid scores, clones varied greatly in mean performance, and thus in fitness. Correlations between fitness ranking in different environments were mostly positive, but many clones did show large shifts in rank order between environments. In autumn-winter some clones were of consistently high or low fitness in all three flow treatments, despite large treatment differences in mean zooid productivity. 5. Seasonal differences had a greater effect on fitness ranking than flow regime. This pattern was more pronounced when gonozooid number was used as the index of performance. 6. Disparities in clonal performance were reduced in the least productive environments. These conditions caused a greater reduction in performance in genotypes of high average fitness. 7. The performance of an individual clone within an environment was not always constant. In spring-summer, replicate colonies often differed considerably in growth rate, even when growing closely adjacent to each other. 8. The results illustrate the need for precise definitions of fitness, and for further experimental work to determine the niche breadth of individual clones and thus the relative intensity of competition within and between genotypes.\n      </p>", "Inclusive fitness maximization is a basic building block for biological contributions to any theory of the evolution of society. There is a view in mathematical population genetics that nothing is caused to be maximized in the process of natural selection, but this is explained as arising from a misunderstanding about the meaning of fitness maximization. Current theoretical work on inclusive fitness is discussed, with emphasis on the author's 'formal Darwinism project'. Generally, favourable conclusions are drawn about the validity of assuming fitness maximization, but the need for continuing work is emphasized, along with the possibility that substantive exceptions may be uncovered. The formal Darwinism project aims more ambitiously to represent in a formal mathematical framework the central point of Darwin's Origin of Species, that the mechanical processes of inheritance and reproduction can give rise to the appearance of design, and it is a fitting ambition in Darwin's bicentenary year to capture his most profound discovery in the lingua franca of science.\n      </p>", "Canalization is an abstract term that describes unknown developmental mechanisms that reduce phenotypic variation. A trait can be canalized against environmental perturbations (e.g., changes in temperature or nutrient quality), or genetic perturbations (e.g., mutations or recombination); this paper is about genetic canalization. Stabilizing selection should improve the canalization of traits, and the degree of canalization should be positively correlated with the traits' impact on fitness. Experiments testing this idea should measure the canalization of a series of traits whose impact on fitness is known or can be inferred, exclude differences among traits in the number of loci and alleles segregating as an explanation for the pattern of variability found, and distinguish between canalization against genetic and environmental variation. These conditions were met by three experiments within which the variation of fitness components among Drosophila melanogaster lines was measured and among which the genetic contribution to the variation among lines was clearly different. The canalization of the traits increased with their impact on fitness and did not depend on the degree of genetic differences among lines. That the flies used had been transformed by a P-element insert suggests that canalization was also effective against novel genetic variation. The results reported here cannot be explained by the classical hypothesis of reduction in the number of loci segregating for traits with greater impact on fitness and confirm that traits with greater impact on fitness are more strongly canalized. This pattern of canalization reveals an underappreciated role for development in microevolution. There is differential genetic canalization of fitness components in D. melanogaster.\n      </p>", "In every generation, the mean fitness of populations increases because of natural selection and decreases because of mutations and changes in the environment. The magnitudes of these effects can be measured in two ways: either directly, by comparing the fitnesses of selected and unselected populations, or indirectly, by measuring the additive variance of fitness and making use of the fundamental theorem of natural selection. The available data suggest that the amount by which natural selection increases mean fitness each generation (or degradation decreases mean fitness) will usually be between 0.1% and 30%; more tentatively, it is suggested that values will typically fall between 1% and 10%. These values can be used to set an upper limit of 5%-10% on the genetic advantage of mate choice.\n      </p>", "Estimates of the effects of herbivory on plant fitness based on female fitness alone may be misleading if plants experience either reduced or increased male fitness. Because there are many plants that produce more flowers following herbivory where seed set is unaffected or reduced, total fitness may be enhanced through the paternal component alone. Here we show that herbivory results in an increase in reproductive success due solely to an increase in paternal fitness in the monocarpic biennial Ipomopsis arizonica. These results suggest that overcompensation may be more common than presently thought, requiring a reexamination of the fitness consequences of herbivory for many plant species.\n      </p>", "The implications of sociobiology, and especially of \"inclusive fitness\" or \"kin-selection\" theory, to human family structures are explored. Kin-selection theory provides a model to formulate testable hypotheses predicting cooperation and conflict for categories of kinsmen; it also suggests an alternative way of looking at incest, endogamy, exogamy, rule of descent, and type of marriage in terms of such biological concepts as mating strategies, inclusive fitness, parental investment, and sexual dimorphism and bimaturism.\n      </p>", "Atriplex tatarica is a heterocarpic species of disturbed habitats. Seeds of Atriplex tatarica do not germinate immediately after shedding, but may remain in a dormant but viable state indefinitely. We investigated whether there were genetic and fitness differences between plants derived from seeds of the different fruit types germinated in different temperatures and salinities. Seeds that germinated in optimal and suboptimal conditions differed significantly in their genetic composition due, in part, to their source population. Seeds that germinated in the suboptimal conditions produced more homozygous plants. Plants that were primarily heterozygous were generated from nondormant fruit types as well as from fruits that germinated in the optimal conditions. Moreover, there was a positive correlation between the degree of heterozygosity and plant fitness measured as the mass of the stem and reproductive structures. In conclusion, the genetic variation of natural populations may be at least partly due to the ability of particular seed genotypes to germinate in the specific environmental conditions of a particular locality. In some circumstances, the process of differential germination may select not only for genetic variability but also for higher fitness if heterozygosity-fitness correlations are present.\n      </p>", "1. The relationship between the size of a female parasitoid and its fitness is a major element of models of optimal clutch size, of host species selection, of the evolution of siblicide in parasitoids and of some sex allocation models. 2. In estimating this relationship, usually only size-dependent longevity and/or fecundity is considered, neglecting differences in searching efficiency for hosts, although this is an important component of fitness. The relationship between a number of constraints and female size was studied in the parasitoid Aphaereta minuta. Larger females were found to have more eggs available, have larger eggs, live longer and have a higher searching efficiency within patches than small females, but searching efficiency for patches and travel speed were found to be independent of size. 3. The size-dependent constraints were combined into one fitness measure. To this end, the characteristics of a natural habitat were measured and, together with the relationships between female size and these constraints, incorporated into a dynamic programming model in order to calculate the fitness of females of different sizes. Fitness was found to increase linearly with female size. 4. Even from very accurate measures of the size-fitness relationship made under laboratory conditions it remains doubtful whether the relationship holds under field conditions. Three experiments to estimate the relationship between female size and fitness in the field were carried out, all showing an increase in fitness with female size. 5. Comparing the results from the field and the laboratory experiments indicates that fitness increases much more rapidly with increasing female size in the laboratory than under field conditions.\n      </p>", "We examined the relation between physical activity, physical fitness, and all-cause mortality in a national population-based study of Canadians. We followed men and women ages 20-69 years who had participated in the Canada Fitness Survey between 1981 and 1988. We assessed risk factors for 6,246 men and 8,196 women using multivariate Poisson regression analysis. At baseline, all subjects were asymptomatic according to self-reported screening questions for cardiovascular disease. Men who expended \u22650.5 kilocalories per kilogram of body weight per day (KKD) experienced a 20% decline in risk of mortality [rate ratio (RR) = 0.82; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.65-1.04] when compared with subjects expending &lt;0.5 KKD. We observed a 30% decline in risk of mortality among women expending \u22653.0 KKD relative to those expending &lt;0.5 KKD (RR = 0.71; 95% CI = 0.45-1.11). Similar patterns of risk were evident for both men and women when analyses were restricted to participation in nonvigorous activities. Those who perceived themselves to be of less than average fitness were at increased risk of mortality (male RR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.21-2.22; female RR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.21-2.26). Subjects with undesirable cardiorespiratory fitness levels were more likely to die, compared with those having recommended fitness levels (RR = 1.52; 95% CI = 0.72-3.18). Fifty-three per cent of men and 35% of women reported participating in a vigorous activity. The relation between daily energy expenditure and risk of mortality in these subjects could not be evaluated, as there were few deaths. Nonetheless, our results among participants reporting no vigorous activities support the hypothesis that there is a reduction in mortality risk associated with even modest participation in activities of low intensity.\n      </p>", "Hamilton's theory of kin selection is one of the most important advances in evolutionary biology since Darwin. Central to the kin-selection theory is the concept of inclusive fitness. However, despite the importance of inclusive fitness in evolutionary theory, empirical estimation of inclusive fitness has remained an elusive task. Using the concept of individual fitness, I present a method for estimating inclusive fitness and its components for diploid organisms with age-structured life histories. The method presented here: (i) allows empirical estimation of inclusive fitness from life-history data; (ii) simultaneously considers all components of fitness, including timing and magnitude of reproduction; (iii) is consistent with Hamilton's definition of inclusive fitness; and (iv) adequately addresses shortcomings of existing methods of estimating inclusive fitness. I also demonstrate the application of this new method for testing Hamilton's rule.\n      </p>", "We used a quantitative trait locus (QTL) approach to study the genetic basis of population differentiation in wild barley, Hordeum spontaneum. Several ecotypes are recognized in this model species, and population genetic studies and reciprocal transplant experiments have indicated the role of local adaptation in shaping population differences. We derived a mapping population from a cross between a coastal Mediterranean population and a steppe inland population from Israel and assessed F3 progeny fitness in the natural growing environments of the two parental populations. Dilution of the local gene pool, estimated as the proportion of native alleles at 96 marker loci in the recombinant lines, negatively affected fitness traits at both sites. QTLs for fitness traits tended to differ in the magnitude but not in the direction of their effects across sites, with beneficial alleles generally conferring a greater fitness advantage at their native site. Several QTLs showed fitness effects at one site only, but no opposite selection on individual QTLs was observed across the sites. In a common-garden experiment, we explored the hypothesis that the two populations have adapted to divergent nutrient availabilities. In the different nutrient environments of this experiment, but not under field conditions, fitness of the F3 progeny lines increased with the number of heterozygous marker loci. Comparison of QTL-effects that underlie genotype x nutrient interaction in the common-garden experiment and genotype x site interaction in the field suggested that population differentiation at the field sites may have been driven by divergent nutrient availabilities to a limited extent. Also in this experiment no QTLs were observed with opposite fitness effects in contrasting environments. Our data are consistent with the view that adaptive differentiation can be based on selection on multiple traits changing gradually along ecological gradients. This can occur without QTLs showing opposite fitness effects in the different environments, that is, in the absence of genetic trade-offs in performance between environments.\n      </p>", "While a considerable amount of attention has been devoted to the effects that increased ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation has on vegetative plant growth and physiological function, the impact that UV-B may have on plant fitness has been the focus of fewer studies, with attention given primarily to a few crop species. Further, the possible interactions between UV-B and additional potential stresses found in natural environments have rarely been studied experimentally. Because the reported effects of increased UV-B on plant growth and fitness have been highly variable, studies that focus on factors that may lead to these differences in results are important for the formulation of accurate predictions about future plant success under varying UV-B levels. We examined the effects of UV-B dose and intraspecific competition on growth, phenology, pollen production, pollination success, fruit and seed production, and offspring quality in two species of Phacelia. Increased UV-B was neutral or beneficial for all traits, while competition was neutral or detrimental. There were no significant interactions between UV-B and competition in the parental generation. Phacelia campanularia offspring were unaffected by parental competition, but derived indirect beneficial effects on germination, growth, and fitness traits from parental enhanced UV-B.\n      </p>", "Meta-analyses of published correlation coefficients between multilocus heterozygosity (MLH) and two fitness surrogates, growth rate and fluctuating asymmetry, suggested that the strength of these correlations are generally weak. A variety of plants and animals was included in the meta-analyses. A statistically homogeneous group of MLH-growth rate correlation coefficients that included both plants and animals yielded a common correlation of rz = 0.133. A common correlation of rz = -0.170 was estimated for correlations between MLH and fluctuating asymmetry in three species of salmonid fishes. These results suggest that selection, including overdominance, has at most a weak effect at allozyme loci and cast some doubt on the widely held notion that heterozygosity and individual fitness are strongly correlated.\n      </p>", "Organisms' environments are thought to play a fundamental role in determining their fitness and hence in natural selection. Existing intuitive conceptions of environment are sufficient for biological practice. I argue, however, that attempts to produce a general characterization of fitness and natural selection are incomplete without the help of general conceptions of what conditions are included in the environment. Thus there is a \"problem of the reference environment\"\u2014more particularly, problems of specifying principles which pick out those environmental conditions which determine fitness. I distinguish various reference environment problems and propose solutions to some of them. While there has been a limited amount of work on problems concerning what I call \"subenvironments\", there appears to be no earlier work on problems of what I call the \"whole environment\". The first solution I propose for a whole environment problem specifies the overall environment for natural selection on a set of biological types present in a population over a specified period of time. The second specifies an environment relevant to extinction of types in a population; this kind of environment is especially relevant to certain kinds of long-term evolution.\n      </p>", "A species is expected to occur where the prevailing biotic and abiotic conditions fall within its fundamental niche. Geographic range limits should, therefore, occur when the survival and fitness of individuals along ecological gradients is reduced to the point at which populations are no longer self-sustaining. Abrupt limits to a species' distribution are expected to reflect abrupt changes in the ecological conditions that cause sharp declines in fitness across the limit. We investigated the correlation between geographic variation in environment and fitness across the abrupt northern range limit of a coastal dune plant, Camissoniopsis cheiranthifolia (Onagraceae). In each of 64 plots distributed across five sites along a 200-km transect spanning the species' northern range limit (four within the range plus one beyond the limit), we measured plant community composition as a proxy for variation in biotic and abiotic environmental factors and lifetime fitness of genetically standardized experimental populations of C. cheiranthifolia. There was substantial variation in plant community composition among plots and sites across the range limit, and fitness of experimental plants covaried strongly with the first principal component of plant community composition. However, we did not detect an abrupt shift in plant community or the expected decline in fitness across the range limit. In fact, fitness and recruitment increased toward the limit and were relatively high beyond the limit. This suggests that habitat beyond the range did not occur outside of the species' fundamental niche. These results challenge niche-based explanations for range limits and suggest that hypotheses involving the finer-scale distribution of habitat patches or constraints on dispersal warrant more serious consideration.\n      </p>", "Optimal Defense Theory predicts that plants exposed to herbivory should allocate more resources to produce costly secondary metabolites in tissues with higher fitness values. To increase plant resistance, the secondary metabolites must have a negative impact on the preference and/or performance of herbivores. We tested the hypotheses that induction of secondary metabolites (phlorotannins) in a brown seaweed in response to grazing by herbivorous gastropods will differ between seaweed tissues with different fitness values (basal stipes and annual shoots), and that the subsequent change in food value will affect the fitness (growth and fecundity) of the gastropods. Induction of phlorotannins was significant in both tissue types but was more pronounced in basal stipes, which have a higher fitness value. Basal tissues also had significantly higher constitutive defense levels than did apical tissues. No effects of algal tissue type or grazing history on the growth rate of the gastropods were detected. However, the number of viable eggs was significantly lower for gastropods feeding on basal shoots, and there was a significantly lower proportion of viable eggs produced by gastropods that were offered previously grazed seaweed tissues. The results show that induced resistance, and its variation among different plant parts, can have significant negative effects on herbivore performance that may reduce future herbivore pressure and thus enhance plant fitness.\n      </p>", "Sex allocation theory assumes that a shift in allocation of resources to male function both increases male fitness and decreases female fitness. Moreover, the shapes of these fitness gain functions determine whether hermaphroditism or another breeding system is evolutionarily stable. In this article, I first outline information needed to measure these functions in flowering plants. I then use paternity analysis to describe the shapes of the fitness gain functions in natural populations of the hermaphroditic herb Ipomopsis aggregata. I also explore the relationships of male fitness (number of seeds sired) and female fitness (number of seeds produced) to the number of flowers produced by a plant. Plants with greater investment of biomass in the androecium, compared to the gynoecium and seeds, showed increased success at siring seeds, assumed by the models. That sex allocation trait, however, explained only 9% of the variance in estimates of male fitness. The shapes of the fitness gain functions were consistent with theoretical expectations for a hermaphroditic plant, but the model predicted a more female\u2010biased evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) allocation than was observed. These results lend only partial support the classical sex allocation model.\n      </p>", "We define a fitness concept applicable to structured metapopulations consisting of infinitely many equally coupled patches. In addition, we introduce a more easily calculated quantity R&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; that relates to fitness in the same manner as R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; relates to fitness in ordinary population dynamics: the R&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; of a mutant is only defined when the resident population dynamics converges to a point equilibrium and R&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is larger (smaller) than 1 if and only if mutant fitness is positive (negative). R&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; corresponds to the average number of newborn dispersers resulting from the (on average less than one) local colony founded by a newborn disperser. Efficient algorithms for calculating its numerical value are provided. As an example of the usefulness of these concepts we calculate the evolutionarily stable conditional dispersal strategy for individuals that can account for the local population density in their dispersal decisions. Below a threshold density x\u0303, at which staying and leaving are equality profitable, everybody should stay and above x\u0303 everybody should leave, where profitability is measured as the mean number of dispersers produced through lines of descent consisting of only non-dispersers.\n      </p>", "The \u03b1-proteobacteria Wolbachia infect a number of insect species and influence host reproduction to favour the spread of infected females through a population. The fitness effect of this infection is important in understanding the spread and maintenance of Wolbachia within and among host populations. However, a full elucidation of fitness effect requires careful control of host genetic background. Here, I transferred a single clone of Wolbachia (the wHa strain) into three genetically distinct isofemale lines of the fly Drosophila simulans using microinjection methodology. These lines carried one of the three described mitochondrial haplogroups (siI, siII or siIII) and differ in nuclear genome as well. Population cage assays showed that wHa-infected siIII flies enjoyed a dramatic fitness benefit compared to uninfected siIII. In contrast, wHa did not affect the fitness of siI or siII flies. This study points to the importance of host-by-symbiont interaction terms that may play an important role in organismal-fitness.\n      </p>", "Although fitness depends on both survivorship and fecundity, we tend to assume fecundity relates to fitness more directly than survivorship. In fact, several recent ecological studies suggest fitness depends more heavily on annual survivorship than annual fecundity for most taxa with lifespans longer than one year. These studies review elasticities of transition matrices for a broad range of taxa. Elasticities covary monotonically with selection gradients for demographic rates and are identical to selection gradients for traits rescaled to have mean values of zero and variance of one. For all taxa except semelparous perennial plants, adult survivorship has consistently higher elasticity than other suites of demographic rates. Fecundity only rarely has the highest elasticity. Thus, differences in yearly survival affect fitness disproportionately more than differences in yearly fecundity, even in many exponentially growing populations. This pattern reinforces the importance of interpreting the contribution of vital rates to fitness in the context of life history and population dynamics.\n      </p>", "The nature of epistasis has important consequences for the evolutionary significance of sex and recombination. Recent efforts to find negative epistasis as a source of negative linkage disequilibrium and associated long\u2010term advantage to sex have yielded little support. Sign epistasis, where the sign of the fitness effects of alleles varies across genetic backgrounds, is responsible for the ruggedness of the fitness landscape, with several unexplored implications for the evolution of sex. Here, we describe fitness landscapes for two sets of strains of the asexual fungus Aspergillus niger involving all combinations of five mutations. We find that \u223c30% of the single\u2010mutation fitness effects are positive despite their negative effect in the wild\u2010type strain and that several local fitness maxima and minima are present. We then compare adaptation of sexual and asexual populations on these empirical fitness landscapes by using simulations. The results show a general disadvantage of sex on these rugged landscapes, caused by the breakdown by recombination of genotypes on fitness peaks. Sex facilitates movement to the global peak only for some parameter values on one landscape, indicating its dependence on the landscape\u2019s topography. We discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy between our results and the reports of faster adaptation of sexual populations.\n      </p>", "Evolutionary biologists typically assume that the number of eggs fertilized or developing embryos produced is correlated with an individual's fitness. Using microsatellite markers, we document for the first time estimates of realized fitness quantified as the number of offspring surviving to adulthood in an insect under field conditions. In a territorial damselfly whose males defend tree hole oviposition sites, patterns of offspring survivorship could not be anticipated by adults. Fewer than half of the parents contributing eggs to a larval habitat realized any reproductive success from their investment. The best fitness correlate was the span over which eggs in a clutch hatched. Among parents, female fecundity and male fertilization success were poor predictors of realized fitness. Although body size was correlated with female clutch size and male mating success, larger parents did not realize greater fitness than smaller ones. The uncoupling of traditional fitness surrogates from realized fitness provides strong empirical evidence that selection at the larval stage constrains selection on mated adults.\n      </p>", "Hypothetical adaptive walks (i. e., morphological transformation series gaining increasing relative fitness) were simulated through a computer-generated domain for early vascular land plant morphologies to examine the relationship between the dynamics of adaptive walks and the topologies of fitness landscapes. A total of 15 hypothetical adaptive walks were simulated, assuming that relative fitness was based on performing one or more of four biological tasks: maximizing light interception, mechanical stability, and reproductive success, and minimizing total surface area. Morphologies occupying fitness peaks typically were similar to some early vascular land plant remains. The most stringent task (the minimization of total surface area) resulted in a few, comparatively small Y-shaped morphologies. Based on the 15 walks, the number of fitness peaks increased and their heights decreased as the number of tasks simultaneously performed increased. These results (which are consistent with prior computer-simulated walks treating light interception, mechanical stability, and reproductive success) suggest that the biological requirement to conserve water reduced the number of phenotypic options available to the earliest land plants, and that, once this adaptive hurtle was overcome, the simultaneous performance of two or more tasks, increased the number of phenotypic options with equivalent relative fitnesses that could be rapidly reached due to the comparatively small fitness differential between derived and ancestral morphologies.\n      </p>", "Individual animals differ in the way they cope with challenges in their environment, comparable with variation in human personalities. The proximate basis of variation in personality traits has received considerable attention, and one general finding is that personality traits have a substantial genetic basis. This poses the question of how variation in personality is maintained in natural populations. We show that selection on a personality trait with high heritability fluctuates across years within a natural bird population. Annual adult survival was related to this personality trait (behaviour in novel environments) but the effects were always opposite for males and females, and reversed between years. The number of offspring surviving to breeding was also related to their parents' personalities, and again selection changed between years. The observed annual changes in selection pressures coincided with changes in environmental conditions (masting of beeches) that affect the competitive regimes of the birds. We expect that the observed fluctuations in environmental factors lead to fluctuations in competition for space and food, and these, in association with variations in population density, lead to a variation in selection pressure, which maintains genetic variation in personalities.\n      </p>", "Theoretical analyses of inbreeding suggest that following an increased degree of inbreeding there may be a temporary recovery of fitness, because of selection either within or among inbred lineages. This is possible because selection can act more efficiently to remove deleterious alleles given the greater homozygosity of such populations. If common, recovery of fitness following inbreeding may be important for understanding some evolutionary processes and for management strategies of remnant populations, yet empirical evidence for such recovery in animals is scant. Here we describe the effects of single-pair population bottlenecks on a measure of fitness in Drosophila melanogaster. We compared a large number of families from each of 52 inbred lines with many families from the outbred population from which the inbred lineages were derived. Measures were made at the third and the 20th generations after the bottleneck. In both generations there was, on average, substantial inbreeding depression together with a highly significant variance among the inbred lines in the amount of fitness reduction. The average fitness of inbred lines was correlated across generations. Our data provide evidence for the possibility of recovery of fitness at two levels, because (i) the average fitness reduction in the F&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; generation was significantly less than in the F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; generation, which implies that selection within lines has occurred, and (ii) the large variance in inbreeding depression among inbred lines implies that selection among them is possible. The high variance in inbreeding depression among replicate lines implies that modes of evolution which require a low level of inbreeding depression can function at least in a fraction of inbred populations within a species and that results from studies with low levels of replication should be treated with caution.\n      </p>", "Climate warming is predicted to cause large-scale extinctions, particularly of ectothermic species. A striking difference between tropical and temperate ectotherms is that tropical species experience a mean habitat temperature that is closer to the temperature at which fitness is maximized (Topt) and an upper temperature limit for survival (Tmax) that is closer to Topt than do temperate species. Thus, even a small increase in environmental temperature could put tropical ectotherms at high risk of extinction, whereas temperate ectotherms have a wider temperature cushion. Although this pattern is widely observed, the mechanisms that produce it are not well understood. Here we develop a mathematical framework to partition the temperature response of fitness into its components (fecundity, mortality, and development) and test model predictions with data for insects. We find that fitness declines at high temperatures because the temperature responses of fecundity and mortality act in opposite ways: fecundity decreases with temperature when temperatures exceed the optimal range, whereas mortality continues to increase. The proximity of Topt to Tmax depends on how the temperature response of development mediates the interaction between fecundity and mortality. When development is highly temperature sensitive, mortality exceeds reproduction only after fecundity has started to decline with temperature, which causes fitness to decline rapidly to zero when temperatures exceed Topt. The model correctly predicts empirically observed fitness-temperature relationships in insects from different latitudes. It also suggests explanations for the widely reported phenological shifts in many ectotherms and the latitudinal differences in fitness responses.\n      </p>", "This paper assesses whether human communication systems undergo the same progressive adaptation seen in animal communication systems and concrete artefacts. Four experiments compared the fitness of ad hoc sign systems created under different conditions when participants play a graphical communication task. Experiment 1 demonstrated that when participants are organized into interacting communities, a series of signs evolve that enhance individual learning and promote efficient decoding. No such benefits are found for signs that result from the local interactions of isolated pairs of interlocutors. Experiments 2 and 3 showed that the decoding benefits associated with community evolved signs cannot be attributed to superior sign encoding or detection. Experiment 4 revealed that naive overseers were better able to identify the meaning of community evolved signs when compared with isolated pair developed signs. Hence, the decoding benefits for community evolved signs arise from their greater residual iconicity. We argue that community evolved sign systems undergo a process of communicative selection and adaptation that promotes optimized sign systems. This results from the interplay between sign diversity and a global alignment constraint; pairwise interaction introduces a range of competing signs and the need to globally align on a single sign-meaning mapping for each referent applies selection pressure.\n      </p>", "I assessed the relationship between the level of inbreeding, F, and fitness, and the effects of nonmaternal and maternal components of inbreeding on fitness in Phacelia dubia. I conducted two generations of controlled crosses and tested the performance of the F2 progeny in field and artificial conditions covering the whole life cycle. Inbreeding significantly decreased the individual contribution of seeds to the next generation in the field, but this decrease apparently is not enough to explain the maintenance of gynodioecy. The inbred progeny contributes significantly to the population genetic structure of P. dubia. Fitness estimates and fitness components tended to decrease, usually monotonically, with F. However, nonmonotonic relationships were found in male fitness components and, in some families, in fitness estimates, seed production per fruit, and establishment. Most of the inbreeding depression takes place at the level of seed establishment in the field, but, in artificial conditions the effects of inbreeding were similar at fecundity and establishment. I studied maternal and nonmaternal components of inbreeding by testing the effects of the relatedness of maternal grandparents and parents on the performance of the progeny. Both components affected fitness. Inbreeding depression was conditioned by the level of inbreeding of the maternal plant, but this interaction varied at different fitness components. Also, the magnitude and even the direction of the relationship between fitness and F changed as a result of the combined effects of maternal and nonmaternal components of inbreeding. Such interactions can render convex or concave fitness functions, giving in the latter case the appearance of a false purging. Maternal effects of inbreeding can result from several processes: maternal investment perhaps with serial adjustments during seed development, purging of recessive deleterious genes, and nucleocytoplasmic interactions. These results illustrate the importance of maternal effects of inbreeding, and the complex effects of inbreeding on fitness. A full understanding of the fitness consequences of inbreeding and, therefore, their potential implications in the evolution of breeding systems, should take into account male and female components as well as transgenerational effects in the context of the particular environment in which fitness is evaluated.\n      </p>", "Mating success in the western harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex occidentalis, increases with male size. We tested the hypothesis that increased mating success increases male fitness and the fitness of colonies that make large males by comparing the sperm content of males prior to and at the conclusion of the mating swarm. The number of sperm a male initially possesses is a function of male size, and large males transfer a greater proportion of their sperm than do small males. For colonies, the payoff per unit of investment is an increasing function of male size, and investment in large males is not equivalent to investing in a larger number of small males. Allocation ratios in species that show size variation in reproductives may need to be modified by the individual fitness functions.\n      </p>", "The initial rise of fitness that occurs with increasing temperature is attributed to Arrhenius kinetics, in which rates of reaction increase exponentially with increasing temperature. Models based on Arrhenius typically assume single rate\u2010limiting reactions over some physiological temperature range for which all the rate\u2010limiting enzymes are in 100% active conformation. We test this assumption using data sets for microbes that have measurements of fitness (intrinsic rate of population growth) at many temperatures and over a broad temperature range and for diverse ectotherms that have measurements at fewer temperatures. When measurements are available at many temperatures, strictly Arrhenius kinetics are rejected over the physiological temperature range. However, over a narrower temperature range, we cannot reject strictly Arrhenius kinetics. The temperature range also affects estimates of the temperature dependence of fitness. These results indicate that Arrhenius kinetics only apply over a narrow range of temperatures for ectotherms, complicating attempts to identify general patterns of temperature dependence.\n      </p>", "We examined the effects of size and spatial isolation of fens on the isozyme variability of 17 populations of Swertia perennis. This long-lived perennial is a locally abundant fen specialist in Switzerland, where wetlands have been strongly fragmented. Isozyme variability was comparable to other outcrossing plants (A = 1.53, $AP_p$ = 2.01, $P_p = 42.5$ , $H_o = 0.113$ , $H_e = 0.139$ ). F statistics indicated both inbreeding within and differentiation between populations ( $F_{IS} = 0.076$ , $F_{IT} = 0.194$ , $F_{ST} = 0.128$ ), with moderate gene flow between populations ( $N_em = 1.703$ ). Populations in small, isolated fens had reduced genetic variability and the highest within-population inbreeding coefficients (FIS). Isozyme variability was significantly associated with vegetative fitness traits (MANOVA), and the magnitude of leaf herbivory decreased as the percentage of polymorphic loci increased. These data suggest that the reduced genetic variability of S. perennis in small, isolated populations may reduce plant fitness, thereby increasing susceptibility to herbivore damage. Our study also shows that habitat fragmentation can reduce the genetic variability of populations of fairly common habitat specialists, which so far have attracted less conservation attention than rare species.\n      </p>", "It is commonly accepted that a life history which maximizes mean fitness also maximizes the reproductive value of each age class. By deriving explicit formulae for the derivatives of fitness and of reproductive value, I show that this equivalence can hold only under a very special set of conditions relating survival and fecundity at different ages. These conditions are neither intuitively obvious nor supported by the data available at this time. This suggests that the applicability of theory based on reproductive value maximization may be limited.\n      </p>", "Evolutionary models estimating phenotypic selection in character size usually assume that the character is invariant across reproductive bouts. We show that variation in the size of reproductive traits may be large over multiple events and can influence fitness in organisms where these traits are produced anew each season. With data from populations of two orchid species, Caladenia valida and Tolumnia variegata, we used Bayesian statistics to investigate the effect on the distribution in fitness of individuals when the fitness landscape is not flat and when characters vary across reproductive bouts. Inconsistency in character size across reproductive periods within an individual increases the uncertainty of mean fitness and, consequently, the uncertainty in individual fitness. The trajectory of selection is likely to be muddled as a consequence of variation in morphology of individuals across reproductive bouts. The frequency and amplitude of such changes will certainly affect the dynamics between selection and genetic drift.\n      </p>", "Field research was conducted at three locations in Iowa to determine the effectiveness of glyphosate for velvetleaf control in glyphosate-resistant soybean. Velvetleaf survival ranged from 46 to 81% when treated with 420 g ae/ha glyphosate, whereas survival ranged from 13 to 37% at the 840 g/ha rate. At two locations, velvetleaf survival was greater when treated at the 12- to 17-cm height compared with application to either 8- to 10- or 20- to 30-cm-tall plants. Growth of plants surviving glyphosate application was greatly reduced, with the high glyphosate rate reducing velvetleaf aboveground biomass by over 90% compared to untreated plants. A linear relationship between biomass and capsule number was observed for both control plants and plants surviving glyphosate, both having slopes of approximately one. Velvetleaf surviving glyphosate treatment should have minimal impact on soybean yield due to reduced growth; however, surviving plants may replenish the seed bank, leading to future management problems.\n      </p>", "1. A knowledge of the relationship between body size and fitness is very important in many models of parasitoid behaviourial ecology. We estimated this relationship for Achrysocharoides zwoelferi (Hymenoptera, Eulophidae), a parasitoid of leaf mining moths (Gracillariidae) on willow (Salix). 2. The size distribution of female wasps emerging from their pupae was compared with the size distribution of wasps caught while searching for hosts. A parametric statistical approach was used to obtain a function relating size to fitness. 3. Laboratory estimates of the influence of size on a component of fitness, longetivity, were obtained under two different sets of experimental conditions. 4. In the field, fitness increased rapidly with size over the first two-thirds of the observed size range, but plateaued (or possibly declined) in the last third of the range. 5. One laboratory experiment showed no effect of size on fitness while the other did show an effect although much weaker than that observed in the field. This suggests caution in using results from the laboratory in parameterising behavioural ecological models. 6. The results are compared with two other field estimates of the influence of size on fitness which show broadly similar patterns.\n      </p>", "The principles governing protein evolution under strong selection are important because of the recent history of evolved resistance to insecticides, antibiotics, and vaccines. One experimental approach focuses on studies of mutant proteins and all combinations of mutant sites that could possibly be intermediates in the evolutionary pathway to resistance. In organisms carrying each of the engineered proteins, a measure of protein function or a proxy for fitness is estimated. The correspondence between protein sequence and fitness is widely known as a fitness landscape or adaptive landscape. Here, we examine some empirical fitness landscapes and compare them with simulated landscapes in which the fitnesses are randomly assigned. We find that mutant sites in real proteins show significantly more additivity than those obtained from random simulations. The high degree of additivity is reflected in a summary statistic for adaptive landscapes known as the \"roughness,\" which for the actual proteins so far examined lies in the smallest 0.5% tail of random landscapes.\n      </p>", "The evolution of complex organisms is a puzzle for evolutionary theory because beneficial mutations should be less frequent in complex organisms, an effect termed \"cost of complexity.\" However, little is known about how the distribution of mutation fitness effects (f(s)) varies across genomes. The main theoretical framework to address this issue is Fisher's geometric model and related phenotypic landscape models. However, it suffers from several restrictive assumptions. In this paper, we intend to show how several of these limitations may be overcome. We then propose a model of f(s) that extends Fisher's model to account for arbitrary mutational and selective interactions among n traits. We show that these interactions result in f(s) that would be predicted by a much smaller number of independent traits. We test our predictions by comparing empirical f(s) across species of various gene numbers as a surrogate to complexity. This survey reveals, as predicted, that mutations tend to be more deleterious, less variable, and less skewed in higher organisms. However, only limited difference in the shape of f(s) is observed from Escherichia coli to nematodes or fruit flies, a pattern consistent with a model of random phenotypic interactions across many traits. Overall, these results suggest that there may be a cost to phenotypic complexity although much weaker than previously suggested by earlier theoretical works. More generally, the model seems to qualitatively capture and possibly explain the variation of f(s) from lower to higher organisms, which opens a large array of potential applications in evolutionary genetics.\n      </p>", "How parthenogenetic lineages arise from sexual ancestors may strongly influence their persistence over evolutionary time. Hybrid parthenogens often have elevated heterozygosity and ploidy, thus making it difficult to disentangle the influence of reproductive mode, hybridity and ploidy on their relative fitness. By comparing the relative fitness of both hybrid and non-hybrid parthenogens to their sexual ancestors, further insight may be gained into how these three factors influence the maintenance of sexual and parthenogenetic reproduction. In the present study, hybrid and non-hybrid parthenogenetic and sexual snails (Campeloma sp.) were compared for the following characteristics: female size-fecundity curves, offspring size, survivorship, and growth. Compared to nearby sexual populations, triploid hybrid parthenogens from the Florida Gulf coast have similar fecundity and offspring size, five-times higher survivorship, and 60% higher growth. Relative to nearby sexual populations, non-hybrid parthenogenetic C. limum from the Atlantic coast have significantly higher fecundity, smaller offspring size, similar survivorship and slightly lower growth. Given the considerable fitness advantages of parthenogens, especially hybrid parthenogens, it is enigmatic as to why these parthenogens occupy marginal natural habitats.\n      </p>", "Generally, effects of herbivory on plant fitness have been measured in terms of female reproductive success (seed production). However, male plant fitness, defined as the number of seeds sired by pollen, contributes half of the genes to the next generation and is therefore crucial to the evolution of natural plant populations. This is the first study to examine effects of insect herbivory on both male and female plant reproductive success. Through controlled field and greenhouse experiments and genetic paternity analysis, we found that foliar damage by insects caused a range of responses by plants. In one environment, damaged plants had greater success as male parents than undamaged plants. Neither effects on pollen competitive ability nor pollinator visitation patterns could explain the greater siring success of these damaged plants. Success of damaged plants as male parents appeared to be due primarily to changes in allocation to flowers versus seeds after damage. Damaged plants produced more flowers early in the season, but not more seeds, than undamaged plants. Based on total seed production, male fitness measures from the first third of the season, and flower production, we estimated that damaged and undamaged plants had equal total reproductive success at the end of the season in this environment. In a second, richer environment, damaged and undamaged plants had equal male and female plant fitness, and no traits differed significantly between the treatments. Equal total reproductive success may not be ecologically or evolutionarily equivalent if it is achieved differentially through male versus female fitness. Genes from damaged plants dispersed through pollen may escape attack from herbivores, if such attack is correlated spatially from year to year.\n      </p>", "Laboratory experiments were performed to quantify the combined effects of food abundance (low, high) and predation threat, imposed using a model fish (safe, risky) on fitness correlates (i.e. growth, time to emergence, adult body mass, fecundity, egg size) of the mayfly Baetis tricaudatus. These effects were determined by rearing larvae under different combinations of food abundance and predator threat. Fitness correlates were significantly affected by food abundance, predation threat or the interaction of these factors. High food abundance and the absence of predation threat significantly increased larval growth rates, adult body mass, fecundity, egg size, and decreased time to emergence. Long-term effects of predator threat and food abundance on fitness correlates of B. tricaudatus were compared to previously conducted short-term patch choice trials to test for concordance between short-term measures of patch choice and their potential longer-term fitness consequences. This comparison indicated that patches that were utilized the most were those that yielded the highest fitness benefits. These results suggest that behavioural costs of balancing mortality risk due to predation against food acquisition by B. tricaudatus can have strong fitness consequences.\n      </p>", "The great variety of sexual systems possessed by flowering plants can be understood in terms of sex allocation theory, which assumes that individuals allocate resources to male vs. female reproductive structures so as to maximize total fitness. The relative shapes of the fitness gain curves for each sex can be used to predict and explain such allocation patterns. Several recent studies have attempted to measure the shapes of these gain curves. Typically, these studies have regressed estimates of male or female fitness against flower number for a set of plants of different size. Here I argue that this method is inappropriate, and that it can lead to incorrect conclusions about the true shapes of the gain curves if some third, causal factor, such as genotype, size, or environmental conditions, affects both allocation and the fitness returns from that allocation. I suggest that experimental manipulation of flower number is likely to be the most useful and easily interpretable technique for estimating the shapes of gain curves in plants.\n      </p>", "\"Ecological\" speciation occurs when reproductive isolation evolves as a consequence of divergent selection between populations exploiting different resources or environments. We tested this hypothesis of speciation in a young stickleback species pair by measuring the direct contribution of ecological selection pressures to hybrid fitness. The two species (limnetic and benthic) are strongly differentiated morphologically and ecologically, whereas hybrids are intermediate. Fitness of hybrids is high in the laboratory, especially F1 and F2 hybrids (backcrosses may show some breakdown). We transplanted F1 hybrids to enclosures in the two main habitats in the wild to test whether the distribution of resources available in the environment generates a hybrid disadvantage not detectable in the laboratory. Hybrids grew more slowly than limnetics in the open water habitat and more slowly than benthics in the littoral zone. Growth of F1 hybrids was inferior to the average of the parent species across both habitats, albeit not significantly. The contrast between laboratory and field results supports the hypothesis that mechanisms of F1 hybrid fitness in the wild are primarily ecological and do not result from intrinsic genetic incompatibilities. Direct selection on hybrids contributes to the maintenance of sympatric stickleback species and may have played an important role in their origin.\n      </p>", "Cultures of Chlamydomonas were exposed to a range of relatively mild stresses for a period of 24 h. These stresses comprised high and low temperatures, osmotic stress, low pH, starvation and toxic stress. They were then allowed to recuperate for around ten vegetative generations under near-optimal conditions in unmodified minimal medium. Fitness was then assayed as the rate of division of isolated cells on agar. We found that there was a strong tendency for stressed cultures to have lower mean fitness and greater standardized variance in fitness than the negative controls which had been cultured throughout in unmodified minimal medium. The same tendency was shown, as expected, by positive controls which received mutagenic doses of ultraviolet irradiation. We concluded that the most reasonable interpretation of these observations is that mild stress increases the genomic rate of mutation. This appears to be the first time that this phenomenon has been noticed in eukaryotes. The response might be adaptive because lineages in which higher mutation rates are clicited by stress can be favourably selected through the production of a few mutants which are fortuitously well adapted to the stressful environment. Other interpretations are not excluded, however. Regardless of the mechanism involved, the elevation of mutation rates under stress will affect the rate of evolutionary response to environmental change and also the maintenance of sexuality.\n      </p>", "We used bacteria to study experimentally the process of genetic adaptation to environmental temperature. Replicate lines of Escherichia coli, founded from a common ancestor, were propagated for 2,000 generations in 4 different thermal regimes as 4 experimental groups: constant 32, 37, or 42\u26acC (thermal specialists), or a daily alternation between 32 and 42\u26acC (32/42\u26acC: thermal generalists). The ancestor had previously been propagated at 37\u26acC for 2,000 generations. Adaptation of the groups to temperature was measured by improvement in fitness relative to the ancestor, as estimated by competition experiments. All four experimental groups showed improved relative fitness in their own thermal environment (direct response of fitness). However, rates of fitness improvement varied greatly among temperature groups. The 42\u26acC group responded most rapidly and extensively, followed by the 32 and 32/42\u26acC groups, whose fitness improvements were indistinguishable. The 37\u26acC group, which experienced the ancestral temperature, had the slowest and least extensive fitness improvement. The correlated fitness responses of each group, again relative to the common ancestor, were measured over the entire experimental range of temperatures. No necessary tradeoff between direct and correlated responses of fitness was apparent: for example, the improved fitness of the 42\u26acC group at 42\u26acC was not accompanied by a loss of fitness at 37\u26acC or 32\u26acC. However, the direct fitness responses were usually greater than the correlated responses, judged both by comparing direct and correlated responses of a single group at different temperatures and by comparing direct and correlated responses of different groups at a single temperature. These comparisons indicate that the observed adaptation was, in fact, largely temperature specific. Also, the fitness responses of the generalist group across a range of temperatures were less variable than those of the thermal specialist groups considered as whole.\n      </p>", "The great adaptability shown by RNA viruses is a consequence of their high mutation rates. The evolution of fitness in a severely debilitated, clonal population of the nonsegmented ribovirus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) has been compared under five different demographic regimes, ranging from severe serial bottleneck passages (one virion) to large population passages (106 virions or more) under similar environmental conditions (cell culture type and temperature). No matter how small the bottleneck, the fitness of the evolved populations was always higher than the fitness of the starting population; this result is clearly different from that previously reported for viruses with higher fitness. The reattainment of fitness under a regime of serial population passages showed two main characteristics: (1) the rate of adaptation was higher during early passages; and (2) a maximum fitness value was reached after a large number of passages. The maximum fitness reached by this initially debilitated clone was similar to the fitness of wild-type virus. The practical implications of these findings in the design of vaccines using attenuated viruses are also discussed.\n      </p>", "Numerous studies have assessed the individual effects of prey nutritional quality or chemical defenses on consumer feeding behavior. However, little is known about how these traits interact to affect consumer feeding and performance. We tested the separate and interactive effects of prey chemical defenses and nutritional quality on the feeding behavior and fitness of six sympatric crustacean mesograzers. Natural concentrations of diterpene alcohols (dictyols) from the brown alga Dictyota menstrualis were incorporated, or not incorporated, into lower quality and higher quality foods to create artificial diets mimicking prey of variable value and defense. Five amphipods (Ampithoe longimana, A. valida, Cymadusa compta, Gammarus mucronatus, and Elasmopus levis) and one isopod (Paracerceis caudata), representing a continuum of closely to distantly related organisms, were fed intact algae or lower and higher quality diets containing or lacking dictyols. All six mesograzers preferred the green alga Enteromorpha intestinalis to the dictyol producing alga Dictyota menstrualis. In assays allowing consumers to choose between simultaneously available foods, dictyols deterred feeding by all five amphipods, but not the isopod; this occurred for both lower and higher quality foods. In no-choice assays, where consumers were confined with only one of our four treatment diets, effects on feeding became more complex. Nutritional quality alone affected feeding by five of the six species. These grazers compensated for lower quality by increasing consumption. Dictyols suppressed feeding for four of the six species. More interestingly, there were significant dictyol x quality interactions for three species. Dictyols decreased feeding more when placed in lower quality foods than higher quality foods. Two amphipods deterred by dictyols in the choice assays readily consumed dictyol-containing foods in no-choice situations and suffered few negative effects of doing so. Although all amphipods were deterred by dictyols in choice assays, dictyols decreased fitness (survivorship, growth, or reproduction) for only four of the five species. These effects included large and immediate decreases in survivorship, dramatic effects on reproduction, and modest effects on female growth. Dictyols enhanced survivorship of the isopod. Thus, the effects of secondary metabolites on feeding in choice situations vs. fitness in long-term assays were inconsistent. For three amphipods, certain effects of food quality, dictyols, or their interaction were detected only for females. In general, negative effects of dictyols on fitness were greater in lower than in higher quality foods, suggesting that prey nutritional value may counteract the effects of defensive metabolites. For example, when G. mucronatus consumed dictyols in lower quality foods, mortality was &gt;80% by day 5; for dictyols in higher quality foods, 80% mortality took 28 days to develop. Lower quality foods alone significantly decreased growth for the isopod, three of the amphipods, and the females of a fourth amphipod, concomitantly reducing fecundity for four of the five amphipods studied. The effects of both chemical defenses and nutritional quality were unrelated to consumer phylogeny; responses of congeners varied as much, or more, than responses of more distantly related consumers. Understanding mechanisms and consequences of food selection requires that the interactive effects of both chemical defenses and prey nutritional characteristics be considered explicitly.\n      </p>", "Because relatedness is high and dispersal is limited, one would expect to see higher levels of altruistic behaviour among clonal organisms than among animals of lesser relatedness. Enigmatically, however, parthenogenetic aphids do not emit alarm signals when a predator first enters a colony but only after being captured. Here, we report that an aphid smearing alarm pheromone directly onto a predator decreases the predation risk for clone-mates as the predator continues to search for additional prey. Adult multicoloured Asian ladybird beetles, Harmonia axyridis, daubed with alarm pheromone caused a greater proportion of aphids to drop off a plant and escape predation than did predators lacking pheromone droplets. Thus, along with direct fitness benefits of individual protection, aphid alarm signalling behaviour may have evolved through inclusive fitness benefits of protecting clone-mates by scent-marking predators.\n      </p>", "Herbivores are thought to achieve adequate nutrition by consuming numerous species of plants or by occasionally consuming animal tissue. Although active selection of diverse foods is common in nature, the relationship between diet mixing and consumer fitness is poorly understood, especially in marine environments. We studied the fitness-based consequences of dietary mixing in the sympatric amphipods Ampithoe marcuzzii, A. valida, Cymadusa compta, and Gammarus mucronatus by measuring survivorship, growth, and fecundity of these amphipods when they were offered single species of algae, a single animal food, a mixture of algal species, or a combination of algae and animal matter. For the more sedentary, tube-building amphipods A. marcuzzii, A. valida, and C. compta, fitness on mixed algal diets was matched by fitness on at least one of the monospecific algal diets, suggesting that they could benefit from preferential feeding on those algae in the field. The more mobile amphipod, G. mucronatus, survived and grew similarly on the mixed diets and on the filamentous brown alga Ectocarpus siliculosus. However, its fecundity was significantly higher when feeding on the algal and animal mixture than on Ectocarpus alone. Additionally, for G. mucronatus, fitness on mixed algae, mixed algae plus animal matter, and animal matter alone was equivalent, although female growth (but not gonad production) was slightly lower on animal matter alone than on the mixed algae combined with animal food. Thus the more mobile amphipod, G. mucronatus, was the only species able to perform well on animal food alone. In contrast, A. valida and C. compta experienced large negative effects when limited to consuming animal matter alone. For these two species, combining algae and animal matter did not enhance fitness over combining only algae. Fitness effects of specific algal diets showed some general similarities, but also considerable variance among the amphipods. For example, E. siliculosus was generally better food than other algae for all four amphipods, whereas Sargassum filipendula was generally poor. However, A. marcuzzii did not suffer negative effects of consuming only Sargassum. The red alga Polysiphonia sp. and the green alga Enteromorpha flexuosa decreased fitness in A. marcuzzii, C. compta, and G. mucronatus, but not A. valida, and the negative effects of Polysiphonia were considerably larger for A. marcuzzii than for the other amphipods. Our data show that nutritional requirements, even among related species (e.g., A. marcuzzii and A. valida), can be dramatically different. Diet mixing may benefit more mobile consumers like Gammarus that are better able to search for different foods, and may be less important for more sedentary herbivores like Ampithoe and Cymadusa that consume, and live in close association with, individual host plants.\n      </p>", "Ecological and evolutionary change is generated by variation in individual performance. Biologists have consequently long been interested in decomposing change measured at the population level into contributions from individuals, the traits they express and the alleles they carry. We present a novel method of estimating individual contributions to population growth and changes in distributions of quantitative traits and alleles. An individual's contribution to population growth is an individual's realized annual fitness. We demonstrate how the quantities we develop can be used to address a range of empirical questions, and provide an application to a detailed dataset of Soay sheep. The approach provides results that are consistent with those obtained using lifetime estimates of individual performance, yet is substantially more powerful as it allows lifetime performance to be decomposed into annual survival and fecundity contributions.\n      </p>", "The role of testosterone in female fitness is poorly known in most vertebrates. It has been proposed that the dynamics of female testosterone may represent a correlated response to selection acting on male testosterone. However, several costs and benefits of enhancing the circulating levels of testosterone in females have been documented in a number of species, suggesting that female testosterone may be the product of direct selection. Despite this, no study has tried to quantify the long\u2010term fitness consequences of manipulating female testosterone. We report the results of an experiment in which we implanted females with testosterone (T\u2010females) and recorded the consequences of this manipulation on investment and reproductive success throughout their lifetime in relation to control females (C\u2010females). Our results show that T\u2010females bred more years in the colony than C\u2010females. The onset of laying was delayed in T\u2010females compared with C\u2010females, but this effect decreased in the years following manipulation. The T\u2010females laid fewer eggs per year, but eggs were heavier than those laid by C\u2010females. The T\u2010females fed nestlings at a lower rate than C\u2010females in the 3 years in which feeding rates were measured and raised fewer fledglings than C\u2010females in the manipulation year. However, since T\u2010females accomplished more breeding attempts than C\u2010females, as a result of their longer stay in the colony, there were no significant differences between the lifetime reproductive success of T\u2010 and C\u2010females. There were no overall differences in body size of nestlings raised by T\u2010 and C\u2010females, but the body mass of fledglings reached a peak 2\u20133 years after manipulation for C\u2010females, a tendency not recorded in offspring of T\u2010females. Also, young that were fledged in broods of C\u2010females tended to recruit into the study colony more frequently than those fledged in T\u2010females' nests. All these results indicate that our testosterone manipulation improved the ability of females to acquire and maintain a breeding site but interfered with their reproductive biology and parental investment. Thus, our main conclusion is that under the ecological conditions of our experiment, the addition of exogenous testosterone reduced female fitness. However, differences in population density and female\u2010female competition are likely to alter the fitness landscape of this trait and change the adaptiveness of increased testosterone as a component of female reproductive strategies.\n      </p>", "\"font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold;\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: normal; line-height: 14px; font-size: 12px;\"><a class=\"newWindow\" href=\"http://www.press.uchicago.edu/journals/e-books/processor/an.html\" title=\"This link opens in a new window\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"border: solid thin green\" alt=\"\" src=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1334331794933/AmNat.epub.gif\" /></a></span></p>\n<a href=\"http://www.press.uchicago.edu/journals/e-books/processor/an.html\" target=\"_blank\">Free to ASN Members!</a>\n<br />\n", "\"font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold;\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: normal; line-height: 14px; font-size: 12px;\"><a class=\"newWindow\" href=\"http://www.press.uchicago.edu/journals/e-books/processor/an.html\" title=\"This link opens in a new window\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"border: solid thin green\" alt=\"\" src=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1334331794933/AmNat.epub.gif\" /></a></span></p>\n<a href=\"http://www.press.uchicago.edu/journals/e-books/processor/an.html\" target=\"_blank\">Free to ASN Members!</a>\n<br />\n", "", "\"font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold;\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: normal; line-height: 14px; font-size: 12px;\"><a class=\"newWindow\" href=\"http://www.press.uchicago.edu/journals/e-books/processor/an.html\" title=\"This link opens in a new window\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"border: solid thin green\" alt=\"\" src=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1334331794933/AmNat.epub.gif\" /></a></span></p>\n<a href=\"http://www.press.uchicago.edu/journals/e-books/processor/an.html\" target=\"_blank\">Free to ASN Members!</a>\n<br />\n", "We explore the effects of group size on the direct reproductive success of subordinate helpers in eusocial animals where only a single, dominant individual reproduces at one time. Helpers can reproduce directly if they inherit dominance, but when dominance is age based, an individual born into a larger group has a longer wait to inherit. We show that this disincentive to help can potentially be offset by increased productivity, increased life span, and insurance\u2010based benefits for helpers if they survive to inherit dominance in larger groups. We analyze a field experiment in which group size was manipulated in the hover wasp Liostenogaster flavolineata. Productivity increased linearly with group size, larger groups were less likely to fail, and dominants in larger groups may have lived longer. Combined with the probability of inheriting dominance, these effects led overall to a negative correlation between group size and expected direct fitness, mainly because group size decreased during our study period, so that helpers could not expect to inherit as large a group as they started queuing in. Our analysis suggests that the relationship between group size and productivity plays a central role in determining the fitness consequences of helping.\n      </p>", "The effect of nectar robbing on plant fitness is poorly understood and restricted to a few plant species. Furthermore, the available studies generally evaluate the effects of nectar robbing on female fitness, disregarding the male component. Here we measured the effects of the nectar-robbing bumblebees on male (measured as pollen analogue flow distance) and female (measured as seed production) reproductive success in the insect-dependent Polygala vayredae, a narrow endemic species from the pre-Pyrenees (Spain). Intense nectar robbing by bumblebees significantly reduced the nectar available to legitimate pollinators in the studied population, and this reduction affected both male and female fitness. Significant differences were observed in fluorescent dye dispersion between robbed and non-obbed flowers within the population. Fluorescent dyes from non-robbed flowers were dispersed to larger distances and over a larger number of flowers when compared with robbed ones. Moreover, significant differences were observed in both fruit set and seed ovule ratios between the two groups, with non-robbed flowers presenting higher reproductive outcomes. However, no effect on seed weight was detected among treatments. The data obtained suggest that in this species, nectar robbing has important indirect and negative effects on plant fecundity, through both male and female functions, due to a modification in the foraging behaviour of legitimate visitors.\n      </p>", "RNA viruses show the highest mutation rate in nautre. It has been extensively demonstrated that, in the absence of purifying selection, RNA viruses accumulate deleterious mutations at a high rate. However, the parameters describing this accumulation are, in general, poorly understood. The present study reports evidences for fitness declines by the accumulation of deleterious mutations in the bacteriophage MS2. We estimated the rate of fitness decline to be as high as 16% per bottleneck transfer. In addition, our results agree with an additive model of fitness effects.\n      </p>", "Chloroplasts contain a plastoquinone-NADH-oxidoreductase (Ndh) complex involved in protection against stress and the maintenance of cyclic electron flow. Inactivation of the Ndh complex delays the development of leaf senescence symptoms. Chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements, blue native gel electrophoresis, immunodetection and other techniques were employed to study tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) Ndh-defective mutants (\u0394ndhF). The \u0394ndhF mutants compared with wild-type plants presented: (i) higher photosystem II : photosystem I (PSII : PSI) ratios; (ii) similar or higher levels of ascorbate, carotenoids, thylakoid peroxidase and superoxide dismutase, yield ( $\\Phi_{PSII}$ ) and maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII levels ( $F_{v}/F_{m}$ ) than wild-type plant leaves of the same age; (iii) lower values of nonphotochemical quenching yield ( $\\Phi_{NPQ}$ ), but not at very high light intensities or during induced leaf senescence; (iv) a similar decrease of antioxidants during senescence; (v) no significant differences in the total foliar area and apical growth rate; and (vi) a production of viable seeds significantly higher than wild-type plants. These results suggest that the Ndh complex is involved in one of the redundant mechanisms that play a safety role in photosynthesis under stress, which has been conserved during evolution, but that its deletion increases fitness when plants are grown under favourable controlled conditions.\n      </p>", "There are several inferences that can be made from studies of the fitness of hybrid plants and animals. First, the fitness of hybrids varies. However, it is not possible to make a priori predictions concerning the relative fitness of a given hybrid genotype, or a series of genotypes. For example, plant hybrids are not more likely to have elevated fitness than animal hybrids. The variation in fitness for hybrids ranges from the highest fitness relative to parental genotypes to the lowest. The variation can be due to different environments or age classes. Furthermore, notwithstanding the paradigm that derived from the Neo-Darwinian synthesis, some hybrid genotypes demonstrate elevated fitness relative to their parents. To test the evolutionary importance of hybridisation in a given species complex, it is critical that findings from greenhouse/population cage experiments be tested in the field. This latter statement is easier for a botanist to argue, but even with plants, the field experimentation needed for a rigorous test of fitness (i.e., reciprocal transplants) is at the best risky, and costly in time and resources. Yet, these are the types of studies needed to test predictions concerning the likeliest circumstances under which hybridisation will be promoted. The scientific literature over the past decade has seen a change in the tenor of papers describing natural hybridisation. Ten years ago, papers more often than not reported the use of natural hybridisation as a tool to understand divergent evolution. More recently, a majority of studies have discussed the evolutionary impact of natural hybridisation. We look forward to a continued increase in the frequency of studies that assume this process to have evolutionary importance per se.\n      </p>", "A method is presented to evaluate the impact of environmental contaminants on organisms based on the relationship between toxicant-induced plastic responses in life cycle traits and fitness, which is defined as the intrinsic rate of population increase. Using the bacterivorous nematode Plectus acuminatus and the toxicant pentachlorophenol as a case study, life cycle experiments were conducted to assess critical effect concentrations (EC) for various traits. It was found that pentachlorophenol significantly reduced both juvenile survival and the reproductive period, while daily reproduction significantly increased. The juvenile survival was less sensitive to pentachlorophenol compared to the reproductive period (EC$_{20} = 4.3 \\mu$ mol/L and $1.3 \\mu$ mol/L, respectively). Using a demographic model based on life cycle data, physiological trade-off curves were constructed, indicating that fitness reductions were determined by plasticity in daily reproduction and juvenile survival. To further assess the relationship between fitness impairment and the EC$_{20}$ values, a sensitivity analysis of the model was performed, revealing that a 20% decrease in the reproductive period did not influence fitness, whereas a 20% reduction in juvenile survival resulted in a 5% fitness decrease. The results imply that (1) critical effect levels for sensitive life cycle traits are not sufficient for assessing the potential impact of toxicants on fitness, and (2) insight into the relationship between plasticity of life cycle traits and fitness provides a proper basis for the ecological risk assessment of toxicants on poplations.\n      </p>", "In many social vertebrates, remaining in the natal group leads to at least short-term reductions in the direct fitness of philopatric animals. Among communally breeding rodents, the direct fitness costs of philopatry appear to increase as the frequency of successful natal dispersal decreases, suggesting a functional link between constraints on natal dispersal and the reproductive consequences of sociality. To explore this relationship empirically, I documented patterns of direct fitness among female colonial tuco-tucos (Ctenomys sociabilis), which are group-living subterranean rodents from southwestern Argentina. Demographic data suggest that successful natal dispersal is rare in this species, leading to the prediction that natal philopatry in C. sociabilis is associated with significant reductions in individual direct fitness. Using data obtained during 1996-2001, I compared the direct fitness of females that dispersed from their natal group and bred alone as yearlings to that of females that lived and bred in their natal group as yearlings. Philopatric yearlings reared significantly fewer young to weaning than did disperser (lone) yearlings. Although neither survival to a second breeding season nor the estimated life-time number of pups reared to weaning differed between dispersal strategies, the annual direct fitness of group-living females was 23-40% less than expected, suggesting that philopatric animals experienced a substantial direct fitness cost by remaining in their natal group. These data yield important insights into the adaptive bases for group living in C. sociabilis and suggest that constraints on natal dispersal are an important factor favoring group living in this species.\n      </p>", "In many species, increased mating frequency reduces maternal survival and reproduction. In order to understand the evolution of mating frequency, we need to determine the consequences of increased mating frequency for offspring. We conducted an experiment in Drosophila melanogaster in which we manipulated the mating frequency of mothers and examined the survival and fecundity of the mothers and their daughters. We found that mothers with the highest mating frequency had accelerated mortality and more rapid reproductive senescence. On average, they had 50% shorter lives and 30% lower lifetime reproductive success (LRS) than did mothers with the lowest mating frequency. However, mothers with the highest mating frequency produced daughters with 28% greater LRS. This finding implies that frequent mating stimulates cross\u2010generational fitness trade\u2010offs such that maternal fitness is reduced while offspring fitness is enhanced. We evaluate these results using a demographic metric of inclusive fitness. We show that the costs and benefits of mating frequency depend on the growth rate of the population. In an inclusive fitness context, there was no evidence that increased mating frequency results in fitness costs for mothers. These results indicate that cross\u2010generational fitness trade\u2010offs have an important role in sexual selection and life\u2010history evolution.\n      </p>", "Although the role of natural selection in the evolution of floral traits has been of great interest to biologists since Darwin, studies of selection on floral traits through differences in lifetime fitness have been rare. We measured selection acting on flower number, flower size, stigma exsertion, and ovule number per flower using field data on lifetime female fitness (seed production) in wild radish, Raphanus raphanistrum. The patterns of selection were reasonably consistent across three field seasons, with strong directional selection for increased flower production in all three years, weaker selection for increased ovule number per flower in two years, and selection for increased flower size in one year. The causes of the selection were investigated using path analysis combined with multiplicative fitness components. Increased flower production increased fruit production directly, and increased numbers of ovules per flower increased the number of seeds per fruit in all three years; pollinator visitation did not influence either of these fitness components. Increased flower size was associated with increases in both the number of fruit and the number of seeds per fruit in one year, with the latter relationship being stronger. Total lifetime seed production was affected more strongly by differences in fruit production than by differences in either the number of seeds per fruit or the proportion of fertilized seeds that were viable, but all three fitness components were positively correlated with total seed production.\n      </p>"], "words": {"all": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "concept": {"number": 1,
