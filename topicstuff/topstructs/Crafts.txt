It focuses on two items of furniture and argues that both gender and pro-Modernist/anti-crafts biases are at work in the attitudes of design critics towards them. It goes on to examine the Eameses' attitudes towards the crafts, before and after they met in 1940, and considers the role played by 'functioning decoration' (their decorative arrangements of objects which encouraged an interplay between craft and machine work) in the humanizing of Modernist design in the post-war years in the USA.\n      </p>", "Posthumously published in 2002 and providentially so according to Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s account, Hannah Crafts' The Bondwoman's Narrative, written circa 1855, seems to possess more than one life. It simply refused to die in obscurity or, as Marcia Ann Gillespie has opined, to be \"shrouded in silence.\"Does the narrative simply converge with other slave narratives of the 19th century as it depicts Hannah's flight from slavery to freedom, or can Crafts' novel be situated at the very beginnings of Black feminism? Further interrogation of the narrative discloses that Crafts weaves themes of growth and embraces symbols such as houses, sleep, and journeys in the typical 19th-century manner of mainstream writers like Samuel Richardson, Daniel Defoe, and Charles Dickens in England and Edgar Allan Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, and Walt Whitman in America to situate her work within the American literary renaissance.\n      </p>", "The form of the display mediated the meaning of decorative objects in the encounter of 'Arts and Crafts' and 'Art Nouveau' at the First International Exhibition of Modern Decorative Art held in Turin in 1902. Most European displays featured model interiors with architectural fittings or the arrangement of furniture ensembles that located the decorative art in the private, domestic sphere. For example, Siegfried Bing recreated the dressing room designed by George de Feure, familiar from his popular 'Art Nouveau Bing' pavilion at the Paris exposition of 1900, in the French section. This article suggests that this type of display reaffirmed the pre-eminent status of the consumer. In contrast, the English section organized by the painter and designer Walter Crane under the auspices of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society adopted a museum paradigm for their display. With objects hung on the gallery walls and arranged in vitrines, the Arts and crafts display focused on production and offered decorative objects as public works rather than private objects. As contemporary critics revealed, the rhetorics of these displays underscored the cultural and political tensions surrounding decorative objects and their meanings in this moment.\n      </p>", "This article sounds out some of the meanings of two important German terms. It deals with their recent history and compares the developments of the crafts in Britain and Germany. 'Das Handwerk' is equivalent to aspects of 'the crafts' and 'the trades' and is thus a term of much greater importance in German art and economic life than either crafts or trade are in Britain. 'Kunsthandwerk' is a late nineteenth-century term and its twentieth-century meaning is more narrowly equivalent to Arts and Crafts and, later, studio crafts.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "This paper reviews the debate concerning British industrial output growth between 1760 and 1830.

However, unlike established and traditional forms of culture such as easel painting, there was no clear ideological position on the handmade.

This article studies the influence of English design reform in broad terms, comparing it with contemporary Catalan tendencies and approaches. Some interesting conclusions arise. First, Morris was not very well known at the time Modernisme emerged in the 1870s and 1880s. His influence would arrive later, in the 1890s, when a change of mind took place within Catalan Modernisme. Even then, however, Morris cannot be considered a major influence but, rather, a remote cultural reference. Secondly, Pre-Raphaelitism played an important role in the evolution of Modernisme mainly through the writings of Casellas and the work of Riquer. Thirdly, the Arts and Crafts movement and early Modernisme are too contemporary to find influences between them. The Arts and Crafts movement influenced Catalan arts but only later, when Noucentisme politicians were looking for forms of production outside industry and the social problems that it engendered. Finally, it will be suggested that the adoption of Arts and Crafts attitudes in the late Modernisme and Noucentisme periods was based on a 'high' Modernisme interpretation of Pre-Raphaelitism and this explains why Catalan industry and artists did not turn to industrial design as the Deutscher Werkbund and the British DIA had done in the same period.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Only with the advent of high-pressure steam after 1850 did the technology realise its potential. Compared with ICT, steam's impact on the annual rate of growth was modest.

Yet the decorative character of the New Sculpture and its intersections with debates associated with the Arts and Crafts Movement have also complicated its position in the history of sculpture. It is more readily absorbed into the discourse defined by craft reform than treated as a distinct sculptural phenomenon. This paper explores the divergence in visual and practical approaches that developed in sculpture-making between the first and second halves of the nineteenth century, and suggests that the deliberate fusion between decorative and sculptural qualities that emerged in the 1880s signalled not so much an attempt to align sculpture with craft, decoration and design, as a desire to reformulate the ways that sculptural aesthetics could be expressed and interpreted.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "Skill and technique appear axiomatic to the definition of handicraft. And no designers are more closely associated with defending skilled human labour than the leaders of the Arts and Crafts Movement in England and America. This essay, however, proposes that industrial-era definitions of handicraft-originating with figures such as T. J. Cobden-Sanderson, William Morris, Gustav Stickley and even the sociologist Thorstein Veblen-are in fact predicated on a paradoxical relationship to skill. For if skilled labour seems the self-evident alternative to mechanical production, it is also true that machines, capable of absolute precision and uniformity, threaten the traditional associations of craft and perfect workmanship. The era of the Arts and Crafts Movement thus developed ways of thinking about craft that are sceptical of practised, learned or reproducible technique. This essay probes the implications of that epistemological shift, considering its effects on the aesthetics of craft, on the class dynamics of handicrafts revivalism and on the popularization of a medieval style (rather than, say, eighteenth-century models) as the paradigm of the handcrafted. Rethinking the relation of craft and skill, the article offers an alternative to established historiographical models in which practical skilled labour was steamrolled by shoddy industrial production or modern marketplace ideals. Instead, I suggest that industrial-era definitions of skill do not support conventional distinctions of craft and consumerism, practicality and rarity or simplicity and excess.\n      </p>", "Ethnoarchaeological studies have longed served as a critical source of hypotheses, comparative data, and explanatory frameworks for archaeologists interested in describing and explaining ceramic production.

G. F. Watts is widely recognized as an eminent British painter, and Mary Watts' most substantial work is the Watts Chapel (completed 1904) in Compton, Surrey. Designed by Mary Watts and physically made by her and the people of Compton, the chapel is perhaps best described as an Arts and Crafts project. However, its focal point, the altarpiece, is G. F. Watts' painting 'The All-Pervading' (1904). This fusion of art and craft practice is symbolic of the Wattses' partnership and also an example of the ambiguous nature of Mary Watts' professional practice. Investigation of the role of gender in art history has highlighted art:craft/male:female dichotomies in relation to the hierarchies of the arts. Whilst superficially the work of the Wattses seems to illustrate this model, this essay will explore the complexities that question such categorization. In the example of the Watts Chapel, traditional hierarchies are not clear, as Mary Watts subverts not only the nature of her craft project, but also social and cultural expectations, to negotiate a space in which to pursue her practice as a professionally trained artist. This essay will argue that art and craft practice for Mary Watts was a sophisticated tool, which she used to disrupt the established boundaries between the arts, and both to resist and to manipulate the persona 'wife of the great artist'.\n      </p>", "The crafts produced and consumed by women during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries for the domestic interior are worth investigating to try to unravel why women at various levels of society took up home crafts and what their motives were for doing so. At one level, it may have been artistic self-expression; at another level a product of a commitment to household duty or financial necessity, or on a third level it may have been for entertainment or pastime. These motivations seem to reflect the more recently labelled DIY home improvements. The fact that particular crafts were associated with women was based partly on the determinist philosophies of the eighteenth century. These were predicated on distinctions that supposed that each gender had inherently different faculties. In the fields of art and crafts, this led to the distinction between amateur women and professional men, and more especially, the equating of specific crafts with women's work and homemaking. This gendering, which was preached both in school and in print, meant that by the mid-eighteenth century, any visual sensibility women had developed was particularly directed towards their homes. The broad aims of this paper are therefore to investigate the nature of the work undertaken, the role it played in certain women's lives, how it reflected social attitudes of the period, and its relationship with the home during the period 1750-1900. Finally, the article will reflect on how and in what different ways women's domestic arts and crafts could be considered as precursors to the DIY of today.\n      </p>", "For many architects in Australia, the learned language of the Arts &amp; Crafts garden was a way of creating a uniquely Australian landscape and lifestyle. This note traces the influence of the Arts &amp; Crafts Movement in England on the design and planting of gardens in Australia during the early twentieth century; and it considers parallels between the struggle by local architects to create a local variation of the Arts &amp; Crafts garden, and the national struggle to create a local identity.\n      </p>", "At the turn of the 19th century, the British School at Athens brought Byzantium to Britain. As the vital link between classical and modern Greece, Byzantium captured the imagination of British architects influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement. Their studies of gothic and byzantine architecture in Italy, Greece and Asia Minor, played a major role in the gothic and neo-byzantine revival buildings built in Britain from the 1880s on \u2014 a prime example being Westminster Cathedral. In 1888, two students of the Royal Academy of Arts \u2014 Robert Weir Schultz and Sidney H. Barnsley-arrived in Greece to begin their studies of Byzantine architecture. They, and the many architects who followed them, used the newly-founded British School as their home base. They travelled from the School to undertake the study and measurement of Byzantine monuments throughout Greece and neighbouring countries. Each monument was carefully recorded through a series of drawings, plans and photographs. Some monuments were captured at critical moments in their history, as the expansion of the Greek state brought churches back into Christian use after centuries, while other monuments were subsequently to be lost to us through catastrophes such as the Great Fire in Thessaloniki in 1917. The collected result of these labours is today known as the 'Byzantine Research Fund Archive', a unique collection of over 1500 drawings and 1000 photographs, created between 1888 and 1949.\n      </p>", "", "", "", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Building upon recent trends that have brought into view the roles of a greater diversity of groups, this article explores the agentive role of the crafts and artisan communities in the state formation of Jodhpur during the eighteenth century. This was a period when the Rathor rulers of Jodhpur were unable to rely on the external support of the Mughal Empire and felt compelled to forge alliances with new groups who, perhaps, were previously marginal to political processes in the region. This, of course, did not dissolve the difficult and often exploitative conditions under which artisans worked, and though their agency was more reactive than creative, it did serve to define and limit the levels of state appropriations in revenues and labour.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "The Aesthetic Movement in England and the United States promoted industrial production of \"objects of virtue\" that drew on the artistic styles of cultures removed in time and space from the nineteenth-century urban industrial environment. Aestheticism was not viewed simply as a means to the material improvement of society; spiritual benefits were to be accrued by those who learned how to respond to aesthetic beauty. The visual styles of art education textbooks and journals changed as the Arts and Crafts Movement succeeded the Aesthetic Movement. This change in style reflected a shift from an industrial art education to an antimodern desire to return to preindustrial modes of production. In this paper it is argued that conflicts between opposing categories in art education were the result of tensions found in the ideologies reflected by the Aesthetic Movement and the Arts and Crafts Movement.\n      </p>", "This paper will focus on three galleries in the Netherlands that once specialized in decorative arts and crafts. The period of study is between the years 1898 and roughly 1930. In all three galleries women played an important role. The discussion includes how these galleries can be linked to the gendering of art forms, interaction between 'high' and 'low' decorative art, and the notion of cross-culturalism. The three galleries explored concentrated on different aspects of the European decorative arts' reform movement: 'high' Arts and Crafts made by trained artist-designers, non-Western crafts coming from areas in the Far East, and home-made domestic folk arts and crafts from Northern and Central Europe. In addition to considering the actual employment of women as designers and gallery managers-which in itself was an important development-the issue of gender is addressed in a broader context. The discussion extends to rationality and notions of Nature with regard to primitiveness, femininity and masculinity. I hope to show that constructions of gender ideologies can correlate with an actual historical situation. Although the galleries reflect the Dutch case at the time, they can be seen to exemplify a more general trend.\n      </p>", "Gold jewelry among Southwestern Indians enjoyed a long and rich background of shell (ca. 9,000 years ago), turquoise (several centuries B.c.), and silver (A.D. 1850s). Charles Loloma, Hopi, was the first to use gold, in 1953. Quickly a variety of materials from around the world was added, lapis lazuli, onyx, ivory, chariote, and amethyst, among others. To inherited silver technologies were added a few specialties in gold. Basic forms, necklaces, bracelets, rings, earrings, buckles, and watch bands, remained the same; many of these deviated from symmetry in silver to free forms in gold. Formal designing became more necessary in the precious metal, sometimes with the efforts of separate designer and craftsman creating a single piece. Thus Indian gold jewelry has frequently passed from tribal into world-wide styles. Among the many fine Southwestern Indian goldsmiths today are Loloma; Preston Monongye, Hopi, and son Jessie, part Navajo; Ted Charveze, Isleta Pueblo; Gisbon Nez, Lee Yazzie, and James Little, all Navajo; Edith Tsabetsaye, Zuni; and Richard Chavez, San Felipe Pueblo.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Within eleven years of its first display at an international exhibition the Orkney chair had inspired close copies and brand-new related designs made in the Netherlands by the Dutch firm of John Uiterwijk and Chris Wegerif.

Chaos theory, I argue, offers a useful framework for grasping this understanding of race, in part by discouraging attempts to isolate any discrete concept of race as independent or definitive. Addressing this chaotic reality, Craft approaches his story with a narrative method analogous to fractal geometry-that is, an approach to representation and measurement that accounts for apparent irregularity, fragmentation, and instability.

The IACA was intended to protect American Indian culture by making it a federal felony to \"falsely suggest\" that handcrafted goods are \"Indian\" when in fact they are not. The IACA provides for stiff criminal penalties and authorizes certain Indian plaintiffs and the Attorney General to bring civil actions in federal court. In this note, William Hapiuk critically examines the IACA, which, in its first decade, has generated considerable controversy. Hapiuk argues that the IACA, as a legal regime designed to ensure cultural survival, is flawed because it fails (1) to acknowledge the historical development of both Indian tribes and Indian arts and crafts and (2) to appreciate the ways that contemporary Indian identity is constructed. Moreover, Hapiuk questions the efficacy of litigation and prosecution as tools for cultural preservation and recommends the repeal of the criminal and civil provisions of the IACA. He proposes instead a certification trademark program, which, he contends, would better address the problems created by imitation Indian arts and crafts.\n      </p>", "The translation into bamboo, in Japan in 1940-1, of that most evocative of Modernist furniture designs of the 1920s, the tubular steel \"chaise-longue\" designed by Le Corbusier, Charlotte Perriand and Pierre Jeanneret, has long presented an enigma.

Developing from studies in sociology, anthropology, design history and material culture, this paper questions the production and consumption of home-crafted objects within the domestic environment and aims to question the meaning of making in contemporary Britain. A discourse is constructed around oral history testimonies in which home craft makers are also its consumers, which situates the home as a site of production and consumption. Rather than interpreting person/object relations as an extension of 'taste', a more dynamic interplay of social and cultural relations is established by investigating the choice of kits, patterns and subjects made by respondents. This is discussed in relation to their display and juxtaposed with popular concepts of art, artistry, aesthetics and decoration.

It sets out to unpack the complex relationship between art, craft, artisanal production and design in these years concentrating on the role played by the third category in the early 1950s, especially as manisfested in the exhibition 'Italy at Work'. It seeks to recontextualize what was referred to, at the time, as 'handicraft' or 'folk art' within the economic and ideological framework of the period and to show its important role both in providing a necessary continuity and in enabling innovation of a certain kind to take place. An emphasis is placed on the role of the USA in these years and of individual architect-designers, especially Gio Ponti and Ettore Sottsass, who positioned themselves within current debates. The paper argues that the mature neo-modern Italian design movement took on board some of the defining characteristics of handicraft, and that a respect for tradition was crucial in the formation of the new aesthetic.\n      </p>", "The fan made a surprising appearance in fine art from the 1860s to the 1920s, from the rise of Japonisme to the establishment of a recognizably twentieth-century form of modern art.

From Whistler, through the Impressionist circle and thence to the Nabis, male and female artists adopted it as both a motif and a form in their development of a modern aesthetic. At the same time, it became a key form in the repertoire of fin-de-si\u00e8cle arts, connoting decadence rather than modernity. The fan, previously associated stereotypically with personal adornment and the feminine and thus carrying ephemeral cultural status, became prominent in the design and fine art fields as their borders dissolved and as the territories of gender became mobile in the development of a modernity orchestrated by consumerism.

This complexly constructed consensus has been fostered by their self-defined role as arbiters and vital presenters of local history and culture-a role that has been significantly reinforced by the attention they receive from museums, cultural organizations, historians, the folk art market and the tourist.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

This paper argues that, if we are to validate these comparisons, we must be certain that the dress motifs are traditional to clothing and take into account the span of use of each garment type in Aegean art; hence the importance in categorising these. Given the difficulties in proving transference between crafts which adhere to a common decorative style, I also argue that concurrent motif use be proposed only when ceramics feature identical or near identical copies of the dress motifs. I exemplify these points by examining the costume data from: 1) the Grand Staircase and Main Procession Frescoes which feature large-scale patterned garments, and 2) the Miniature Grandstand and Sacred Dance frescoes whose garments lack textile motifs.\n      </p>", "The Arts and Crafts artist Walter Crane's acceptance of socialism and his increasing involvement in political causes coincided with the creation of a series of books known in his oeuvre as flower books. These books have remained resolutely divided from a consideration of the depiction of flowers and floral forms in Crane's political cartoons. An alternative reading of such imagery is suggested, the premise being that the 'flower fairy' illustrations are as political as the cartoon in their presentation of the garden as an emblem for the ideal society. In particular, the artist's encounter with the socialist Countess of Warwick and her 'Old English Garden' at Easton Lodge, Essex, endorsed the creative and politicized flower symbolism found throughout his work.\n      </p>", "This article aims to describe the role played by crafts in the cultural exchange between Japan and the USA in the 1950s, after the Second World War, and to identify the effect of American power on the establishment of 'traditional crafts' in post-war Japan. In this article, I shall focus on the role played by crafts in the Japanese-USA cultural exchange project of the 1950s, as part of the Cold War use of 'soft power', and on American power, which had a considerable impact on the establishment of 'traditional crafts'.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
