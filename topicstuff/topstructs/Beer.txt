The Gamo's strict social hierarchy orchestrates who produces and consumes beer: ritual-sacrificer households are able to produce and consume more beer than non-ritual-sacrificer households and this pattern also was found in the ceramic inventories of the two types of household. The Gamo example suggests that the study of ceramic use alteration can be an additional tool in identifying the production of beer, the essential ingredient of feasting.\n      </p>", "The history of hops, hopped beer, and hop cultivation is unclear and ambiguous. An assessment of the available literature reveals many contradictions, especially regarding the first use of hops in beer and the earliest incidence of hop cultivation. Historically, hops were used for a variety of purposes; now their primary use is as a preservative and flavoring in beer. Hop cultivation is poorly documented, but was certainly undertaken by the 10th century, most probably in response to the demand generated by beer-brewing. After comparing the literature and investigating source material, a chronology of hop use in beer and hop cultivation is proposed. / La litt\u00e9rature \u00e9crite sur l'histoire du houblon, son utilisation pour la brasserie, et la cultivation de la plante est impr\u00e9cise et ambig\u00fbe.

Recent archaeological research carried out at Marayniyoq, a Middle Horizon Wari site in the Ayacucho Valley in central Peru, uncovered a series of cut stones with hollow depressions. Several features of these artifacts indicate that they functioned as grinding stones. Confirming this observation is the finding in association with the cut stones of several rocker grinders or milling stones, which are the active elements of grinding equipment. While this evidence convincingly indicates that grinding was an important activity at the site, fieldwork also uncovered a large number of large vessels. Most of these vessels had been broken and then repaired in the distant past, a fact which suggests that they were used for storing dry products that perhaps were processed by means of the grinding stones. The evidence from Marayniyoq is very similar to artifacts associated with maize beer production during (later) Inka times, strongly indicating that during the Middle Horizon maize beer appears to have been produced in a fashion very similar to that of the Inka. At the same time, this evidence suggests that maize beer distribution was a function of the state, perhaps as part of reciprocal obligations between elites and commoners.\n      </p>", "Xhosa beer-drinking rituals are structured according to several principles, among which the spatial order of domestic settings features prominently. An analysis of beer-drink rituals, however, requires that abstract notions of how they are structured spatially be understood in conjunction with practice, in which the spatial norms are applied in specific events and vary in meaning according to the particular variant of the ritual. Spatial symbolism also may be manipulated, modified, or subverted, according to specific circumstances affecting the participants. In addition, every beer-drink ritual (and thus the meaning of its spatial symbolism) has to be understood in relation to both previous and forthcoming events.\n      </p>", "Rural Xhosa beer-drinking is associated with a specialized lexicon related to producing, distributing, and ritually consuming maize beer in communal settings. Understanding this provides important insights into the status of beer as an indigenous commodity and the link between its consumption and sociopolitical and economic relations. It is in relation to the formal cultural framework of which the beer-drinking register is part that individual agency is exercised and a reflexive engagement with social practice occurs, and through which the meaning of specific ritual events is negotiated.\n      </p>", "In the mid-1980s, the Japanese beer industry, a stable oligopoly in which competition had traditionally been limited to well understood nonprice dimensions, experienced an outbreak of new product \"hypercompetition\" which saw a ten-fold increase in the industry's new product introduction rate, produced a major shake-up in firms' competitive positions, and forced firms to transform themselves in fundamental ways in order to compete effectively. Surprisingly, this hypercompetition occurred despite heavy government regulation of the industry. Driving it were a variety of demographic, dietary, social, economic, and distribution trends which affected demand for beer, plus the existence of a major player, Asahi, on the edge of bankruptcy and therefore sufficiently desperate to risk a frontal attack on the industry leader, Kirin. At the firm level, substantial internal change and the building of new organizational capabilities were required both to initiate and respond to hypercompetition. Examining in detail the process and difficulty of overcoming inertia and effecting change within the Asahi and Kirin organizations, two distinct types of hypercompetition-appropriate capabilities are identified. One is specialized capabilities, which allow a firm to compete effectively on the competitive dimension that a particular round of hypercompetition is based on (such as new product development). The other is general capabilities which allow a firm to efficiently carry out the continual recombination and reemployment of resources which a hypercompetitive state, in which shifts in the nature of competition are frequent and continuous, requires. Both types of capabilities are shown to be difficult to build and imitate, and for this reason to be potential sources of sustainable advantage. The paper identifies three broadly defining characteristics of hypercompetition: (1) continuing, nonmarginal change in the nature of competition, (2) required nontrivial organizational change, and (3) significant effects on firm performance and competitive position. Conceptually, it is argued that hypercompetition is Schumpeterian in nature, featuring recurring and fundamental competitive change, but that hypercompetition is most accurately seen as a particular combination of Schumpeterian, Industrial Organization, and Chamberlinian competition, with Schumpeterian instability weakening, but not replacing, the more stable aspects of Industrial Organization and Chamberlinian competition.\n      </p>", "Beer companies want to understand the relationship between the chemical characteristics of beer and the preferences for beer exhibited by consumers. Two data sets were provided to the analysts in this case study. The first set consisted of chemical measurements on 91 beers and preference measurements on the same beers collected from beer consumers in blind taste tests. The analysts were asked to use these data to develop a statistical model relating beer chemistry and consumer preferences for beer. The second data set consisted of chemical measurements on a holdout sample of 37 beers. The analysts were asked to employ their statistical model to predict consumer preferences for the beers in the holdout sample.

I want to say that one can distinguish two different paradigms in the history of science and technology: the one that Heidegger despised, which we could call the Modern paradigm, and another, cybernetic, nonModern, paradigm that he might have approved of. This essay focusses on work in the 1950s and early 1960s by two of Britain's leading cyberneticians, Stafford Beer and Gordon Pask, in the field of what one can call biological computing. My object is to get as clear as I can on what Beer and Pask were up to. At the end, I will discuss Beer's hylozoist ontology of matter, mind and spirit. This material is not easy to get the hang of\u2014but that is what one should expect from an unfamiliar paradigm.\n      </p>", "Epidemiologic studies indicate that light to moderate alcohol consumption from beer, wine, or spirits is associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality, owing primarily to a reduced risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). To find out whether this protective effect of small to moderate amounts of alcohol could be confirmed in Germany, where much of the alcohol consumed is taken in the form of beer, we studied the relation between alcohol and CHD and total mortality in a population of southern Germany. We conducted a prospective cohort study from 1984 to 1992 among 1,071 men and 1,013 women, age 45-64 years at baseline, from the Augsburg region. Eighty-seven per cent of men and 56% of women reported drinking alcohol at baseline. Among drinkers, men had an average alcohol intake of 42 gm per day, of which 33 gm per day came from beer. Women who drank had an average alcohol intake of 16 gm per day and derived about half of it from beer and the other half from wine. During the 8 years of follow-up, 96 deaths (all causes) and 62 incident CHD events (nonfatal and fatal) occurred in men, and 45 deaths (all causes) occurred in women. Adjusting for a number of potential confounders, in men the adjusted hazard rate ratio (HRR) of CHD events for drinkers as compared with nondrinkers was 0.51 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.27-0.95]; this protective effect starts with the 0.1-19.9 gm per day alcohol category and does not change much with higher intake. In men, the adjusted total mortality HRR for drinkers as compared with nondrinkers was 0.59 (95% CI = 0.36-0.97). The total mortality HRRs for the different alcohol groups compared with nondrinkers show a U-shaped curve, with the lowest HRR of 0.46 (95% CI = 0.20-0.80) for the 20-39.9 gm per day alcohol group and an HRR of 1.04 (95% CI = 0.54-2.00) for the \u226580 gm per day alcohol group. In women, the total mortality HRR for those drinking up to 19.9 gm per day as compared with nondrinkers was 0.46 (95% CI = 0.22-0.96).\n      </p>", "Since the classical period, beer has developed a bad reputation as the drink of the uncouth and the loutish. But more ancient evidence from the Near East suggests that beer was highly regarded and used extensively is religious ritual.

The results, taken in conjunction with earlier studies, suggest that certain variables, in addition to price and income, play a significatn role in such demand analysis in Ireland. A useful variable in this context is the dependency ratio, which measures changes in the age structure of the population. The results also support the thesis that dynamic elements are of considerable importance in demand theory. The most serious technical problem encountered in the study was the high degree of multicollinearity in the explanatory variables. It emerged that some of the conventional rules of thumb normally used for identifying the existence of this problem failed to exercise sufficient discrimination, and this provides a salutary lesson.\n      </p>", "Objective To investigate whether people who buy wine buy healthier food items than those who buy beer.

Like his Viennese contemporary Adolf Loos, Frank developed his own individual spatial planning strategy, which was based on differentiated room levels and heights, open circulation spaces and galleries, and open stairwells, terraces, and landings. This article examines the genesis and development of Frank's concept of \"The House as Path and Place\" and its expression in the Villa Beer, comparing Frank's approach with Loos's notion of the Raumplan and Le Corbusier's plan libre. By carefully establishing the linkages between the interlocking volumes in the house, Frank was able to produce a dynamic version of the Raumplan, one that fostered a powerful and affective experience of space.\n      </p>", "A unique clay figurine, now broken, was found in the excavations at Tel Beer Sheba in the Negev, one of a large corpus of about 350 Iron Age figurines from this site. It was found in a courtyard of a Level II building, dated to the late eighth century B. C. Though the locus is not completely secure, the Iron Age date is clear according to typology (the ware, whitewash, and general form are all typical of Iron Age II Judah). The figurine combines a horse's body with an anthropomorphic head, which is similar to heads of Judaean pillar figurines (but smaller). Two unique features, not found in Judaean figurines, were added: triangular ears and male genitals. Following discussion of various ancient \"monsters,\" we identify this figurine as a centaur, which finds the closest parallels in Cypriote hermaphrodite centaur figurines. There is other evidence for connections between Judah and Cyprus during this period. We assume that the figurine is a result of such a connection, perhaps indirectly through a Philistine city. Centaurs are unknown so far from Iron Age Judah, and this figurine remains a rare exception; hence, it cannot inform us much about Judaean religious beliefs.\n      </p>", "Interpretations of symbolic meaning and nonverbal communication have gained a strong foothold in the field of historical archaeology as post-processual theory becomes more widely accepted.

In \"recovering mind,\" care must be taken to ensure cause, motivations, and rationalizations are not solely a product of one's own cultural milieu.\n      </p>", "Whether regulating access to firearms and alcohol will reduce violent injuries is an important policy question. Empirical answers are difficult to obtain because only observational data are available. The present study estimated the association of firearm sales and alcohol sales with subsequent homicides, after adjusting statistically for potential confounders (e.g., unemployment rates) using California data from 1972 through 1993. Handgun sales and beer sales were lagged one year and used to explain variation in the homicides of Californians (e.g., 1990 sales were used to explain 1991 homicides). Differences across population groups were investigated, with a focus on 15- to 34-year-olds, the highest risk age group. Even when taking potential confounders in the base population into account, beer sales and handgun sales generally are associated positively one year later with homicide, particularly among young men. Reducing beer sales may reduce homicides. And, although they represent a small fraction of existing firearms, regulating the number of handguns sold may reduce the number of homicides.\n      </p>", "This paper aims to enrich our understanding of the history and substance of cybernetics. It reviews the work of three British cyberneticians - W. Ross Ashby, Stafford Beer and Gordon Pask - paying attention particularly to the materiality of their practice - the strange and fascinating devices and systems that were at the heart of their work - and to the worldly projects they pursued - scientific, technological, artistic, organizational, political and spiritual. Connections are drawn between cybernetics and recent theoretical work in science and technology studies, in the hope of illuminating key features of both. The paper concludes by suggesting that the antidisciplinary impulse of contemporary science studies might find inspiration in the work of cyberneticians - that theory does not have to remain confined to the realm of theory.\n      </p>", "The rapid growth and development in modern times of Beer-Sheva, the city of the Patriarchs, and its transformation into a major centre of growth in the southern desert part of Israel has intrigued experts who deal with urban growth and development.

Smoking of cigarettes was associated with an elevated risk of 2.80 in males (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.65-4.76) and 5.33 (95% CI: 1.55-18.33) in females, as compared with nonsmokers. Variables like daily amount of smoked cigarettes, duration of smoking, age at beginning of cigarette smoking and time since smoking cessation showed a clear dose- and time-response relationship in males, but not in females. Elevated risks were observed for higher consumption of coffee, beer and wine, but - especially for the consumption of coffee - were drastically reduced after adjustment for smoking. A weak association was found between the daily fluid intake and bladder cancer in males. Among females a significantly decreased odds ratio (OR) of 0.34 (95% CI: 0.11-0.99) was found for a daily fluid intake of more than two liters. Protective effects and risk reductions of approximately 50% were found for the regular intake of raw carrots, kale, salads and fruits.

About half the world's consumption of absolute alcohol comes from spirits, one third from beer, the rest from wine. Spirits are the leading drink in Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, Central and Northern America and most of Asia; wine in southern Europe, parts of South America and Central Asia; beer in northern Europe, North America and Australasia. The production of grapes from which wine is made is climatically limited and consumption is high only in the regions of production, i.e. mainly areas of Mediterraneantype climate. Beer production is much more widely distributed, and only a very small amount is exported. Spirits, unlike beer and wine, can be made from a wide variety of plants, and so their consumption is not limited to areas of production. Income per capita, religion, migration and several other factors influence the relative importance of the beverages in different parts of the world.\n      </p>", "Beer advertising is a topic that has frequently attracted the attention of industrial organization economists.

Major legal decisions pertaining to commercial speech and other regulations also are discussed.\n      </p>", "Objective: To examine the association between beer binging (regular sessions of heavy beer drinking) and mortality. Design: Prospective population based study with the baseline assessment of level of alcohol intake (dose), by type of drink and drinking pattern, previous and existing diseases, socioeconomic background, occupational status, involvement in organisations during leisure time, physical activity in leisure time, body mass index, blood pressure, serum lipids and plasma fibrinogen concentration, during an average of 7.7 years' follow up of mortality. Setting: Finland. Subjects: A population sample of 1641 men who consumed beer who were aged 42, 48, 54, or 60 years at baseline. Main outcome measures: All cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, death due to external causes, fatal myocardial infarctions. Results: The risk of death was substantially increased in men whose usual dose of beer was 6 or more bottles per session compared with men who usually consumed less than 3 bottles, after adjustment for age and total alcohol consumption (relative risk 3.01 (95% confidence interval 1.54 to 5.90) for all deaths; 7.10 (2.01 to 25.12) for external deaths; and 6.50 (2.05 to 20.61) for fatal myocardial infarction). The association changed only slightly when smoking, occupational status, previous diseases, systolic blood pressure, low density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration, plasma fibrinogen concentration, body mass index, marital status, leisure time physical activity, and involvement in organisations were controlled for. Conclusion: The pattern of beer binging is associated with increased risk of death, independently of the total average consumption of alcoholic drinks. The relation is not explained by known behavioural, psychosocial, or biological risk factors. Death due to injuries and other external causes is overrepresented among beer bingers, but a strong association with fatal myocardial infarction suggests that the pathway may also involve other acute triggers of severe health events.\n      </p>", "Economists have investigated the effects of increased alcohol taxes on various alcohol-related phenomena like traffic fatalities, but to my knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the effects of beer taxes on teen pregnancy outcomes, namely abortion and birth rates. The study employs state-level data for 15-19-year-old women for the years 1985, 1988, 1992, and 1996. The smallness of the panel imposes some constraints on the statistical methods used. Results indicate that higher beer taxes have statistically significant negative effects on teen abortion rates, though the magnitudes of the effects are quite small. Effects on birthrates are statistically insignificant. This suggests that increased beer taxes may help prevent some unwanted pregnancies that would typically be terminated via abortions rather than culminating in live births. However, the small magnitudes of the effects strongly caution against relying on increased beer taxes to noticeably reduce teen pregnancy rates.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

We analyzed data from a population-based case-control study to measure the association between carbonated beverage intake and risk of adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the esophagus. Methods A food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to collect data on carbonated soft drink and beer consumption; a self-administered questionnaire was used to collect information on demographic, socioeconomic, and lifestyle-related factors from 1,484 control subjects, 294 cases with EAC, 325 cases with adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (EGJAC), and 238 cases with SCC of the esophagus. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using unconditional multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for confounders. Results High intake of soft drinks was not associated with risk of EAC (fully adjusted OR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.53\u20131.66, p for trend = 0.85) or EGJAC (fully adjusted OR = 1.07, 95% CI 0.67\u20131.73, p for trend = 0.89) but was inversely associated with SCC of the esophagus (fully adjusted model OR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.20\u20130.78, p for trend = 0.04). High intake of beer was inversely associated with risk of EGJAC (fully adjusted OR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.35\u20130.81) but positively associated with esophageal SCC (fully adjusted model OR = 1.86, 95% CI 1.17\u20132.95).

We find that speeding up cycle time is beneficial, but the sharing of POS information is not necessarily so. Whether or not the sharing of POS information is beneficial depends on the nature of the demand pattern represented by the POS information. If the demand pattern conveys continual change in ultimate downstream customer demand (as does an S-shaped demand pattern), the POS information can distract the upstream decision maker from what is perhaps more immediately relevant information, orders placed by the proximate downstream agent and the supply line.\n      </p>", "This laboratory study was directed toward a better understanding of the effects of light intensity on the growth of and phosphorus uptake by algae in an aqueous environment. Green algae Chlorella and Scenedesmus were grown under rigorously controlled environmental conditions. Two methods were used to vary the available light intensity. First, a constant biomass density was maintained by employing a photo-electric-turbidostat apparatus and the light intensity was controlled at the source. Second, the incident luminous energy was held constant and the cell density was varied. The Beer-Lambert expression $(I_{0}/I=e^{{\\rm CAD}})$ failed to predict the light penetration data. However, an empirical relationship in which the familiar coefficient of extinction was replaced by an exponential variable did provide the necessary agreement. Growth rate plotted vs. the culture-face-light intensity yields a curve that implies the existence of a light saturation point. When growth rate vs. EALI was plotted, a more logical effect of light was produced.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "We analyze how online reviews are used to evaluate the effectiveness of product differentiation strategies based on the theories of hyperdifferentiation and resonance marketing. Hyperdifferentiation says that firms can now produce almost anything that appeals to consumers and they can manage the complexity of the increasingly diverse product portfolios that result. Resonance marketing says that informed consumers will purchase products that they actually truly want. When consumers become more informed, firms that provide highly differentiated products should experience higher growth rates than firms with less differentiated offerings. We construct measures of product positioning based on online ratings and find supportive evidence using sales data from the craft beer industry. In particular, we find that the variance of ratings and the strength of the most positive quartile of reviews play a significant role in determining which new products grow fastest in the marketplace.

Thomas W. O'Brien constructed the Klondike Brewery in 1904 in anticipation of this economic prosperity. Over its history, the brewery produced steam beer, lager, bock, and a variety of nonalcoholic products. Brewery advertisements boldly proclaimed \"The Beer that Made Klondike Famous and Milwaukee Jealous.\" Unfortunately for O'Brien, the population of Dawson City radically declined after 1908, and combined with pressures from temperance forces, the market for beer was reduced even further. In 1919 prohibition closed the plant all together. Archival and archeological research on the Klondike Brewery provides a variety of data by which to interpret brewery operations, position it within the local community, and assess its place in the early-20th-century brewing industry. O'Brien, it is argued, established a small-scale, yet modern, San Francisco-style brewery with up-to-date technology, in spite of the problems of transport logistics and cost.\n      </p>", "Canopy transmittance was measured at 1200 and 1400 local solar time using an integrating radiometer on seven coniferous forest stands in western Montana, ranging in projected leaf area index (LAI) from 1.7-5.3 m^2/m^2. Transmittance of each 1-ha stand was measured at 96,000 points, yet measurement required &lt;1 h because the instrument instantaneously integrates 80 radiometer measurements at once. The Beer-Lambert Law was inverted to estimate LAI using measured transmittance and an extinction coefficient of 0.52. LAI estimated by transmittance was highly correlated with LAI measured by sapwood-based allometric equations at both the 1200 (R^2 = 0.97) and 1400 (R^2 = 0.94) measurement times.

Because national firms reap larger benefits from new media than firms serving only local consumers, media innovations may reduce the market for local products. This paper considers the effect of television on the market for local beer. Using market-level data on television penetration, local breweries and brewery production from 1945-1960, results show that increases in television penetration are associated with fewer local breweries and less local beer production.

Design-Cross sectional health survey with assessment of intake of beer, wine and spirits (at last non-weekend day), smoking habits, social networks, physical activity, body mass index, educational level, presence of chronic disease, and self reported health. Setting-WHO Copenhagen Healthy City Survey, Denmark. Participants-4113 men and 7926 women aged 18 to 100 years. Main results-Of the 12 039 subjects, 8680 reported their health as optimal, and 3359 reported a suboptimal health. After controlling for the covariates, the relation between total alcohol intake and the proportion reporting suboptimal health was J shaped. Heavy drinkers of any of the three types of alcoholic beverages had a higher prevalence of suboptimal health than non-drinkers. However, only light (1-2 glasses of wine yesterday) and moderate (3-5) wine drinkers had significantly lower odds ratios for suboptimal health-0.72 (95% confidence limits; 0.56 to 0.92) and 0.65 (0.49 to 0.87), respectively-when compared with non-wine drinkers. Moderate beer or spirits drinkers did not differ significantly from non-drinkers of these beverages with regard to prevalence of suboptimal health. Consistently, beer preference drinkers had an odds ratio of 1.50 (1.25 to 1.80) for suboptimal health compared with wine preference drinkers. Conclusions-A light to moderate wine intake is related to good self perceived health, whereas this is not the case for beer and spirits.

Shrub structure and associated effects on the light environment may be especially important in affecting productivity and diversity. Leaf-area index (LAI) and understory light levels of Morella cerifera shrub thickets were assessed on Hog Island, Virginia, USA, at four sites along a soil chronosequence. LAI was estimated from annual leaf litter, with allometric models relating stem diameter to leaf area, with a portable integrating radiometer (LI-COR LAI-2000), and from photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) using the Beer-Lambert law. For the two youngest thickets, LAI estimates from leaf litter (\u223c10.0) approached levels often associated with tropical rain forest. Allometric models estimated LAI values at 9.8 and 12.5 for the same thickets. High LAI in thickets also results in high light attenuation. Light levels within thickets were as low as 0.7% of above-canopy PAR in the youngest thicket. These data suggest that M. Cerifera shrub thickets have a very high potential for annual net primary production. Furthermore, extreme modification of the light environment, coupled with heavy shrub litter fall, may exclude potential competitors during thicket establishment and rapidly alter community structure and ecosystem function.\n      </p>", "Beer has been prohibited in Iceland since 1915, but wine has been legally imported since 1922, as have all other alcoholic beverages since 1934.

In our case-control study from Germany, we assessed and compared the effect of alcohol consumption from various sources on risk of coronary heart disease and its underlying mechanisms. The sample included 312 patients with clinically stable, angiographically confirmed coronary heart disease and 479 healthy controls. After control for potential confounding factors, the odds ratio for coronary heart disease was 0.55 (95% confidence interval = 0.37-0.83) for drinkers compared with nondrinkers. Risk reduction was particularly strong among the majority of study participants who reported drinking predominantly or exclusively beer. Alcohol consumption from various sources was consistently associated with a more favorable profile of lipids and hemostatic factors. Nevertheless, a strong inverse association persisted between beer drinking and coronary heart disease even after control for these \"intermediate variables.\" Our results support suggestions that the protective effect of moderate alcohol consumption against coronary heart disease is mediated in part by beneficial effects of ethanol on lipids and hemostatic factors.

Advertisements with image-oriented visuals were found to directly produce more positive $A_ad$ , $A_b$ , and attitude toward the product category ( $A_pc$ ) evaluations than did the tombstone versions. The authors then used structural equation modeling to examine the relationship among $A_ad$ , $A_b$ , and $A_pc$ . The results were generally supportive of the proposed mediating model.

Much of the literature is concerned with sorghum or 'native' beer, its use as a means of controlling labour and its centrality to urban African women's economic and political activity. This article departs from these themes in focusing on the lifting of prohibition in 1962 and the first decade of distribution of 'European liquor' to Africans in apartheid South Africa. It also breaks with the control-resistance model and considers the post-prohibition 'opportunity' for the state, liquor producers and African consumers and (albeit illicit) retailers. The article shows that the apartheid regime's revision of the liquor laws was initially motivated by the economic imperatives of the malt beer brewers, wine-makers and distillers. It was ultimately driven by the expediency of the apartheid administrators. Government monopoly in the distribution of liquor to Africans was perceived as a major potential source of revenue for urban apartheid and a means of alleviating the tax burden on white urban residents. Opposition, whether from old style paternalists in parliament, African organisations or the temperance movement, was met with scorn. Attempts by the liberal Cape Town city council to canvas African opinion in the townships under its administration were treated with derision. African demands for business opportunities in the retail liquor trade were simply ignored and local councils compelled to act as publicans. The growth in demand for 'European liquor' and, in particular, the success of the South African Breweries cartel followed the opening up of the African market. The article demonstrates that African taste for malt beer, coupled with the brewing cartel's willingness to put business above the law to deal directly with illicit African retailers, put the South African Breweries on a winning course. In contrast, it demonstrates that despite the promise of the apartheid regime, only a portion of the profits generated by African liquor consumption were utilized for urban amenities; Africans were effectively drinking themselves deeper into apartheid and urban squalor.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "Among the non-scriptural literary remains of Indian Tantric Buddhism, enigmatic spiritual songs (Skt. doh\u0101) composed by accomplished yogic adepts have received a degree of attention by Western scholars.
