While evaluating the literary importance of the two genres and presenting their socio-cultural context, this study discusses the pertinence of truth and referentiality and focuses on the selected texts by Truman Capote, Norman Mailer, John Berendt, and Don DeLillo. Flis's book is characterized by a multicultural approach that also examines postmodern Slovene literary and journalistic production.\n      </p>", "This article describes the potential political value of the hip-hop mixtape by demonstrating (a) how a consolidated radio and music industry media environment has largely made the medium of radio an agent of the suppression of mass organization and struggle; (b) how this suppression acts to maintain African America as an internal colony rather than a free citizenry; (c) how in response to this, the application of media theories and general frames of reference that center this experience is necessary; (d) that though hip-hop as a cultural expression has become part of the machinery of colonial control it still offers avenues of liberation specifically the underappreciated aspect of the mixtape as an African American underground communication and press; and (e) the potential of and challenge to mixtapes becoming a source of emancipatory journalism using \u2022 the author's own Washington, D.

Shelly's Victor Frankenstein, though well intentioned in his goals, failed to model ethical behavior for his creation, abandoning it to its own recourse. Today we live in an era of unfettered mergers and acquisitions where once separate and independent media increasingly are concentrated under the control and leadership of the fictitious but legal personhood of a few conglomerated corporations. This paper will explore the impact of mega-media mergers on ethical modeling in journalism. It will diagram the behavioral context underlying the development of ethical habits, discuss leadership theory as it applies to management, and address the question of whether the creation of mega-media conglomerates will result in responsible corporate citizens or monsters who turn on their creators.\n      </p>", "Journalists in the UK have always been ambivalent about what form of occupational control to pursue. Although resistant to the structures of the conventional profession, they have embraced the idea of 'professionalism'. As the formations traditionally associated with Anglo-American professions become relevant to fewer and fewer employees and increasingly subject to external regulation it is more relevant, we suggest, to investigate how the discourse of 'professionalism' as a set of values and identities can be mobilized by employers as a form of self-discipline. Journalism, notable for its powerful occupational mythology, provides a vivid example of how this process has eased the imposition of radical changes to the organization of work. Now, ironically, recent changes in the occupation's social composition and training may mean that journalists, who have always cherished a self-image as socially marginal, will aspire to conventional professional respectability.\n      </p>", "The mandate for journalists is to \"get\" the story from sources with diverse, sometime inimical interests. Most news stories are negotiated in defined social contexts among many different actors, including sources, journalists, editors and press agents. Much of this negotiation occurs in an unwriteable register. Such discourse is thus a key site for looking at interpretive agency in newswriting. Speech labeled \"off-the-record\" is but one of several modes of discourse that are unwriteable in journalistic practice. In this article I examine a case study of journalistic practice, and the efforts I, as a journalist, engaged in to \"get\" the story from political actors who shift on and off the record while seeking to further their own practical agendas. I follow the conversations with situated political actors, both on and off the record, as the journalist attempts to move, both socially and textually, from unwriteable speech to a writeable story.\n      </p>", "The transformation of today\u2019s mass media system leads to uncertainty about communication behaviors concerning scientific issues.

A survey of the reviews of his key works from 1948-1998 (including nine novels) in national publications shows that his creative nonfiction, reportage and biographies have generally received greater favorable comment than his fiction (excepting The Naked and the Dead). A careful analysis of Mailer's utterances on the novel, journalism and history as competing, overlapping \"modes of perception\" demonstrates his conviction that the historical novel is the form best able to deliver social and cultural history in our time. He offers Dos Passos'U.S.A. as theform's finest exemplar, one which engulfs and ingests competing forms, and hints that his own mammoth anthology, The Time of Our Time, be seen as its successor.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "The \"sociological imagination\" that connects personal troubles to public issues is an idea that was in the air when C.

Prompted by flagging popular interest in public life and declining newspaper readership and influenced by ideals of deliberative democracy, public journalists think the promotion of reasonable and informed dialogue among citizens should be part of the role journalists play in a democracy. They have reconstructed traditional reporting practices by advocating public listening in newsgathering, by producing purposeful news, and by encouraging public debate. Such reforms have drawn fire from critics who believe they endanger standards of journalistic independence and fairness. Though public journalists can overcome their mainstream critics, they must look more carefully at their deliberative democratic goals to generate more precise standards of professional practice. Turning to the theoretical literature for a model of deliberation, this paper argues that the role of journalists in promoting public deliberation is different and more circumscribed than public journalists believe.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "In this essay I argue that Tamilnet.com, an Internet news agency put together by a group of Sri Lankan Tamils to address the Tamil diaspora and influence English-speaking elites, subverted international news coverage during Sri Lanka's civil war by making \"ironic\" use of the discursive styles of journalism and anthropology. I also claim that this constituted a particular form of autoethnographic popular anthropology that challenged professional anthropology, and in some ways sought to replace it. In the first two sections of this essay, I dismantle the concept of \"the popular\" by showing that when anthropologists and social theorists use the term they are often referring to connected but distinct aspects of popularity which should be distinguished: Baudrillardian market popularity on the one hand, and Habermasian identity-resistance popularity on the other. I then show how the Internet, given its technology and software, is best seen as market popular in form but identity-resistance popular in content. In the remaining four sections I illustrate, ethnographically, how the creators of Tamilnet.com, while deeply embedded in civil war and a world-wide diaspora, recognized this aspect of the Internet and used it-again, \"ironically\"-to construct a site that advances their own nationalist interests.\n      </p>", "In 1943, The Architectural Review decided to formalize its approach to contemporary design by introducing a regular 'Design Review' section, which ran from 1944 until 1946. As one of the principal editors, Nikolaus Pevsner asked the architect and industrial designer Sadie Speight to compile these features, thereby initiating a working relationship that was difficult as well as fruitful. Drawing upon a hitherto overlooked collection of letters between them, this article offers a significant case study for understanding in detail the process of design journalism in post-war Britain. The Speight/Pevsner correspondence provides the opportunity for an examination of a gender-inflected professional relationship between two important commentators on post-war design and illuminates their positions as advocates of modernism in Britain in relation to the stance of The Architectural Review. It demonstrates the potential of this material as a contribution to contemporary design historical debates concerning gender, consumption and the dissemination of modernism.\n      </p>", "This article argues that the use of social science perspectives and methods by journalists is not a recent phenomenon, but one which began to develop long ago within the dominant humanistic philosophy of professional journalism.

If journalistic and social science methods are to become more closely wedded, one very important condition, in addition to interest by editors and availability of talent, is financial support from those who own and control mass media.\n      </p>", "Of the many trends in literary journalism today, the use of humor to convey sociocultural critiques continues to be one of the major forces in work by Spanish women.\n      </p>", "Dutch writer Arnon Grunberg compares himself to a dog: always attracted to sniffing in bins.

This article examines the point of journalistic production in one major news organization and shows how reporters and editors manage constraints of time, space, and market pressure under regimes of convergence news making. It considers the implications of these conditions for the particular forms of intellectual and cultural labor that journalists produce, drawing connections between the political economy of the journalistic field, the organizational structure of multimedia firms, new communications technologies, and the qualities of content created by media workers.\n      </p>", "Talk show host Rush Limbaugh made headlines in 2003 when he appeared on a cable sports program and claimed the media were biased in favor of African American quarterbacks. Using a sample made up of the seven African American starting quarterbacks in the National Football League matched with seven White quarterbacks with comparable statistics, this study considers whether newspaper coverage was slanted by race. The data, including more than 10,000 articles published during the 2002 football season, show minor and inconsistent differences in coverage between African American and White quarterbacks and offer no support to Limbaugh's position. Despite the media's apparent lack of bias in this situation, response to Limbaugh's comments in the media avoided the larger issue of race and instead focused on the playing ability of African American quarterbacks.\n      </p>", "Norman Mailer's Tough Guys Don't Dance (1984) has often been dismissed as an example of formulaic pulp fiction that is unworthy of serious critical attention. However, it is also a novel that provides a useful index to popular attitudes and moral positioning with regard to obscenity, violence, and other forms of criminal behavior. In Mailer's hands, the new reality of the late twentieth century is shown to include a \"criminal\" turn in American popular culture; this criminal turn has had the effect of \"decriminalizing\" a substantial portion of activities that for previous generations had been considered as vices. In this way, Tough Guys Don't Dance serves as an extremely revealing cultural barometer, one that has the capacity for providing a narrative index to a significant transformation of popular taste and morality.\n      </p>", "The First World War was the first modern, mediated conflict. In this paper I argue that British correspondents on the Western front attempting to accurately witness the war encountered a crisis of representation and visuality. They occupied a particularly unstable position between the many sites and points of view within a cubist landscape of shattered geographies and unstable boundaries. Their writings, though rich in masculinist and nationalistic accounts of heroism, also contain a newer perspective characterized by the failure to fit these older narratives into the inhuman, incomprehensible spaces of modern war.\n      </p>", "In the information age, an exchange with the media is part of the duties the economics profession has to deliver to educate the public. A key issue is the education of policymakers through the media. It is the silver bullet of policy advice in comparison to commissioned research and face-to-face advice provided to the politician. It also pleases the vanity of the scientist: Few economists are willing to sacrifice the celebrity of public visibility to the effectiveness of face-to-face advice. The author advocates for a stronger role of researchers in the public debate and suggests ways to become more influential.

In particular, it traces how pre-9/11 abolitionist legal frameworks have been redeployed in the context of regime change from the Clinton to Bush administrations. In the current political context, combating the traffic in women has become a common denominator political issue, uniting people across the political and religious spectrum against a seemingly indisputable act of oppression and exploitation. However, this essay argues that feminists should be the first to interrogate and critique the premises underlying many claims about global sex trafficking, as well as recent U.S.-based efforts to rescue prostitutes. It places the current raid-and-rehabilitation method of curbing sex trafficking within the broader context of Bush administration and conservative religious approaches to dealing with gender and sexuality on the international scene.\n      </p>", "Si bien el objeto central del art\u00edculo es la cr\u00edtica a la vida cotidiana chilena en Joaqu\u00edn Edwards Bello, en su primera parte se detiene en algunos aspectos importantes del g\u00e9nero en que la cr\u00edtica se da, la cr\u00f3nica urbana, asociados a su origen period\u00edstico, a su estructura, a su lector y al estado de la modernidad chilena que su irrupci\u00f3n a comienzos del XX implica.

Supported by a brief corpus of chronicles, the second part of the article attempts to define one essential feature present in Edwards's criticism: namely a criticism of both a specific and uninterrupted mode in which power has been imposed on the Chilean society effecting extreme forms of polarizaron and the ideological discourses that \"naturalize\" its presence.\n      </p>", "Yellow journalism must be opposed, but it is astonishing that methods which restrict democratic rights of freedom of the press and journalists, specifically the right of journalists to protect their sources, should be advocated to tackle problems which should and can be dealt with by methods which are not restrictive of basic liberties.\n      </p>", "Liberal arts universities are under mounting pressure to maintain their position of relevance in an increasingly technological and economically competitive world, while professional journalism is steadily losing ground to social media.

But perhaps more importantly, the war also changed the way journalism itself functioned during wartime and the way readers participated in its reportage. Newspapers like The Times provided a public forum for the expression of private experiences of the war--a forum in which public and private voices mixed, as official \"despatches\" were printed alongside personal letters from soldiers at the front. In addition, institutionally backed editorials and articles from the papers' \"Own Correspondents\" surrounded an unprecedented barrage of letters to the editor from civilians weighing in on the Crimean campaign. These unofficial contributions suggest that the world fashioned by the mass media during what was dubbed \"the people's war\" functioned as a genuine public sphere.\n      </p>", "The authors describe an experimental economics course designed as a journalism workshop.

In a professional culture which prizes the qualities of objectivity and detachment, what place if any remains for the public display of religious and moral convictions on the part of the reporter? This article uses in-depth interviews with twenty Catholic and evangelical journalists (employed at major news organizations such as Time, Newsweek, the New York Times, and ABC News) to explore how religious people in American journalism manage the tension between objectivity and religious commitment. It identifies three types of strategies Catholics and evangelicals have used to negotiate the boundary between professional and religious worlds: 1) privatization and selective compartmentalization; 2) multivocal bridging languages; and 3) the rhetoric of objectivity. While some Catholic and evangelical respondents attempted to confine their religious beliefs to the private sphere, the vast majority were able to translate their religious and normative convictions into the language of professional journalism. At the same time, most qualified the use of religious or normative language with countervailing appeals to the rhetoric of objectivity, restoring the boundary between professional and religious worlds after it had become blurred.\n      </p>", "           ", "Popular music performance raises important questions about music-making as process. These questions are addressed through dealing with a further issue: the difference between music journalism and academic discourse on music. A dialogic structure is adopted, first, in a short paper, Tim Quirk examines film of The Who playing at the Isle of Wight in 1970. He shows how Pete Townshend's performance moves through a cycle, from incompetence to the extraordinary: paradoxically, formulaic performance prompts sincerity (and so an extraordinary performance) on the part of Townshend. Jason Toynbee responds by arguing that Quirk's writing is able to open up, as journalism, an approach to performance not available to academics. What is at stake is the foregrounding of subjectivity in the writer (Quirk) and, through this, the inter-subjectivity of performer and audience. Quirk's own response follows, and there is then a second round of responses which develops these issues.\n      </p>", "Tom\u00e1\u0161 Masaryk, the founder and first president (1918-1935) of interwar Czechoslovakia, devoted considerable time to founding, tracking, and attempting to take over newspapers and journals. In this article, Andrea Orzoff argues that journalism possessed central importance in interwar Czechoslovak political culture. Every party had its own press apparatus, making newsrooms into logical extensions of the usual arenas of political contention. But especially for Masaryk and his longtime collaborator Eduard Bene\u0161, newspapers were a means of communicating directly with the electorate, thus subverting or evading the constraints of parliamentary politics. Orzoff offers various examples of Masaryk's successful and unsuccessful attempts to meddle in the affairs of the interwar press. She concludes that print culture helps scholars understand interwar Czechoslovak democracy and its closeness to Austro-Hungarian political culture. Particularly, the history of interwar journalism helps clarify the activities and opinions, long mythologized, of the Czechoslovak \"freelancer president.\"\n      </p>", "Legal controls over data collection in European countries have badly affected the work of epidemiologists. By contrast, journalists have been allowed far greater freedoms.

Advertising and public relations have come to dominate the output of the press, in many respects. In government, newspapers have become particularly the willing partners of the image-makers. Advertising dominates the magazine business even more completely, while broadcasting has government regulation to contend with as well.
