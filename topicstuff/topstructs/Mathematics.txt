Graphical analysis showed that students who started middle school with higher achievement took mathematics courses earlier than those with lower achievement. Immediate improvement in mathematics achievement was observed right after taking particular mathematics courses (regular mathematics, prealgebra, algebra I, trigonometry, and calculus). Statistical analysis showed that all mathematics courses added significantly to growth in mathematics achievement, although this added growth varied significantly across students. Regular mathematics courses demonstrated the least regulating power, whereas advanced mathematics courses (trigonometry, precalculus, and calculus) demonstrated the greatest regulating power. Regular mathematics, prealgebra, algebra I, geometry, and trigonometry were important to growth in mathematics achievement even after adjusting for more advanced courses taken later in the sequence of students' mathematics coursework.\n      </p>", "Using data from the Longitudinal Study of Mathematics Participation (N = 1,518 students from 34 schools), we investigated the effects of pure and applied mathematics courses on mathematics achievement, controlling for prior mathematics achievement. Results of multilevel modelling showed that the effects of pure mathematics were significant after adjusting for traditionally important student-level predictors of achievement and for school effects. The effects of mathematics courses varied significantly across schools. Students taking pure mathematics achieved higher in smaller schools, particularly schools with higher teacher commitment. Students taking applied mathematics achieved higher if they attended smaller schools. /// \u00c0 l'aide de donn\u00e9es tir\u00e9es de la Longitudinal Study of Mathematics Participation (N = 1518 \u00e9l\u00e8ves dans 34 \u00e9coles albertaines), les auteurs ont \u00e9tudi\u00e9 les effets des cours de math\u00e9matiques pures et appliqu\u00e9es sur les comp\u00e9tences en math\u00e9matiques en tenant compte des comp\u00e9tences ant\u00e9rieures.

This is not in spite of, but partially based on the famous results of G\u00f6del and Turing. In this way statements are about mathematical objects and algorithms, proofs show the correctness of statements and computations, and computations are dealing with objects and proofs. Interactive computer systems for a full integration of defining, computing and proving are based on this. The human defines concepts, constructs algorithms and provides proofs, while the machine checks that the definitions are well formed and the proofs and computations are correct. Results formalized so far demonstrate the feasibility of this 'computer mathematics'. Also there are very good applications. The challenge is to make the systems more mathematician-friendly, by building libraries and tools. The eventual goal is to help humans to learn, develop, communicate, referee and apply mathematics.\n      </p>", "In this study we explore the potential for mathematics instruction of four reading strategies grounded in transactional reading theory. On the basis of the descriptive study of 18 instructional episodes developed in 4 secondary mathematics classes as a result of collaborative action research, we show that encouraging mathematics students to talk, write, draw, and enact texts can provide them with concrete ways to construct and negotiate interpretations of what they read. In addition to helping students better understand the text read, acting on and acting out a text allow students to use that text as a springboard for sense-making and discussion of important mathematical ideas and issues about the nature of mathematics, especially when these reading experiences are supported by compatible classroom norms and values.\n      </p>", "Recent reform efforts call on secondary school mathematics teachers to provide all students with rich opportunities and experiences with proof throughout the secondary school mathematics curriculum-opportunities and experiences that reflect the nature and role of proof in the discipline of mathematics. Teachers' success in responding to this call, however, depends largely on their own conceptions of proof. This study examined 16 in-service secondary school mathematics teachers' conceptions of proof. Data were gathered from a series of interviews and teachers' written responses to researcher-designed tasks focusing on proof. The results of this study suggest that teachers recognize the variety of roles that proof plays in mathematics; noticeably absent, however, was a view of proof as a tool for learning mathematics. The results also suggest that many of the teachers hold limited views of the nature of proof in mathematics and demonstrated inadequate understandings of what constitutes proof.\n      </p>", "This article describes both the process and products of a cooperative inquiry project between two educational researchers-one from literacy education and one from mathematics education. The collaboration took place in an undergraduate, inquiry-based mathematics classroom in which the researchers sought to develop a shared vision of learning and literacy. The researchers discovered that they each used a different learning model to make sense of mathematics instruction, and that both of these models obscured important aspects of learning in a Standards-based mathematics classroom. An alternative model of learning and literacy in mathematics that takes into consideration both models is presented, as well as the process through which the researchers negotiated this shared perspective.\n      </p>", "The academic achievement gap, particularly the mathematics achievement gap, between Black students and their White counterparts has been well documented with numerical facts. As mathematics education researchers attempt to develop theories and practices that assist in eradicating the gap, they would serve mathematics education well if they would expand the sphere of their research into the sociocultural arena. To assist in expanding the sphere, this article presents a review of key historical and current theoretical perspectives regarding the schooling experiences of African American students, with an emphasis on African American male students, borrowed from the disciplines of anthropology, social psychology, and sociology. The review is organized around three discourse clusters: the discourse of deficiency, the discourse of rejection, and the discourse of achievement. The author suggests that researchers move away from the discourses of deficiency and rejection and toward the discourse of achievement when developing sound education theories and classroom practices that assist in eradicating the academic (and mathematics) achievement gap.\n      </p>", "The Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 1999 Video Study examined eighth-grade mathematics teaching in the United States and six higher-achieving countries. A range of teaching systems were found across higher-achieving countries that balanced attention to challenging content, procedural skill, and conceptual understanding in different ways. The United States displayed a unique system of teaching, not because of any particular feature but because of a constellation of features that reinforced attention to lower-level mathematics skills. The authors argue that these results are relevant for policy (mathematics) debates in the United States because they provide a current account of what actually is happening inside U.S. classrooms and because they demonstrate that current debates often pose overly simple choices. The authors suggest ways to learn from examining teaching systems that are not alien to U.S. teachers but that balance a skill emphasis with attention to challenging mathematics and conceptual development.\n      </p>", "This article reports findings from a study exploring the roles of peer influences in cultivating urban high school students' academic success in mathematics. While the literature describing family/school influences on the academic achievement of students of color is compelling, much of it suggests that urban students' peer groups do not support academic achievement. This study of high school students sought to link their academic behaviors to a historical tradition of intellectual networks within their communities. The ways in which students' peer groups, families, and school communities fostered their mathematics success are discussed with the aim of helping researchers and educators gain a more complete vision of urban students' achievement.\n      </p>", "The Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) provides data that seems clearly important to science and mathematics education in the U.S. TIMSS gathered extensive data on curriculum, textbooks, teachers, and instructional practices in science and mathematics education and some of these data are presented and discussed. Eighth grade achievement data show the U.S. to be somewhat above average in science achievement but consistently average or below in mathematics. U.S. official curricula cover comparatively many topics and are relatively unfocused. U.S. science and mathematics textbooks typically take a cautious, inclusive approach keeping traditional content while adding new reform topics. They thus lack. Teachers, without guidance to help them focus, typically divide their attention among many topics. Empirically, there is little agreement in the U.S. on what is truly \"basic\" judging by common topics among curricula and textbooks. U.S. teaching, at least in mathematics, is teacher and moves among many different activities, failing to tell a coherent story. We must face these as we seek to find ways to become what we want to be in providing science and mathematics education.\n      </p>", "The federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) calls for a highly qualified teacher in every classroom. According to the legislation, \"highly qualified\" is defined as full certification, a bachelor's degree, and demonstrated content knowledge in all core subjects taught. States, district, and schools are spending considerable resources addressing these provisions, but to what degree are the readily available measures of teacher qualifications associated with the type of teaching advocated by standards-based reform? The authors examine the relationships among educational credentials, preparedness to teach content, participation in professional development, and use of reform-oriented instruction by middle school mathematics teachers using data from the 2000 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). Their analyses suggest that preparedness to teach mathematics content and participation in content-related professional development activities are associated with reform-oriented teaching, measured here as increased emphases on conceptual learning goals for students and increased use of reform-oriented teaching strategies.\n      </p>", "This longitudinal study examined the effects of providing an accelerated mathematics curriculum in heterogeneously grouped middle school classes in a diverse suburban school district. A quasi-experimental cohort design was used to evaluate subsequent completion of advanced high school math courses as well as academic achievement. Results showed that probability of completion of advanced math courses increased significantly and markedly in all groups, including minority students, students of low socioeconomic status, and students at all initial achievement levels. Also, the performance of initial high achievers did not differ statistically in heterogeneous classes relative to previous homogeneous grouping, and rates of participation in advanced placement calculus and test scores improved.\n      </p>", "How the use of computers in mathematics classrooms was viewed by students in two middle years mathematics classrooms was the focus of the research described in this paper. The primary data sources consisted of questionnaires, classroom observations supported by videotaping of mathematics lessons, and interviews with two girls and two boys from each class. Thus both qualitative and quantitative methods were used. Girls viewed the computer-based lessons less favourably than did boys. In general, the boys were likely to believe that computers contributed to their experiencing pleasure in these lessons, and to making mathematics more relevant to them. Girls were typically more concerned about whether computers facilitated learning and enabled success in mathematics. The attitudes of students to computer-based mathematics were related to their views of computers.\n      </p>", "Intensive case study is an expensive tool for measuring teachers' instructional practice. Previous research suggests that teacher self-report surveys provide a low-cost and relatively accurate picture of classroom practice. To examine the extent to which teachers implement mathematics education reform, we developed a 20-item survey based on nine dimensions of standards-based teaching. In this article, we provide evidence of the reliability (i.e., internal consistency) and validity of the instrument. The evidence consists of correlations of survey scores with a mandated performance assessment in Grade 6 mathematics, congruence with classroom observations of a small sample of teachers, and demonstrations that teachers who are similar in their claims about using a standards-based text series differ in how they use the text in ways predicted by the survey.\n      </p>", "In this article we offer a theoretical discussion of teachers' mathematics-for-teaching, using complexity science as a framework for interpretation. We illustrate the discussion with some teachers' interactions around mathematics that arose in the context of an in-service session. We use the events from that session to illustrate four intertwining aspects of teachers' mathematics-for-teaching. We label these aspects \"mathematical objects,\" \"curriculum structures,\" \"classroom collectivity,\" and \"subjective understanding\". Drawing on complexity science, we argue that these phenomena are nested in one another and that they obey similar dynamics, albeit on very different time scales. We conjecture (1) that a particular fluency with these four aspects is important for mathematics teaching and (2) that these aspects might serve as appropriate emphases for courses in mathematics intended for teachers.\n      </p>", "According to A. Bandura's (1986) social cognitive theory, individuals form their self-efficacy beliefs by interpreting information from four sources: mastery experience, vicarious experience, social persuasions, and physiological or affective states. The purpose of this study was to examine the heuristics students use as they form their mathematics self-efficacy from these and other sources. Semistructured interviews were conducted with eight middle school students who reported either high or low self-efficacy and with students' parents and mathematics teachers. Students relied on information from all four hypothesized sources, which were combined according to various heuristics. Teaching structures, course placement, and students' self-regulated learning also emerged as important factors related to self-efficacy. Results refine and extend the tenets of social cognitive theory.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

In addition, sex differences in achievement, interest, and course selection were analyzed. At the end of Grade 10, students opted for either a basic or an advanced mathematics course. Data analyses revealed sex differences in favor of boys in mathematics achievement, interest, and opting for an advanced mathematics course. Further analyses by means of structural equation modeling show that interest had no significant effect on learning from Grade 7 to Grade 10, but did affect course selection--that is, highly interested students were more likely to choose an advanced course. Furthermore, interest at the end of Grade 10 had a direct and an indirect effect (via course selection) on achievement in upper secondary school. In addition, results suggest that, at least from Grade 7 to Grade 10, achievement affected interest--that is, high achievers expressed more interest than low achievers. The findings underline the importance of interest for academic choices and for self-regulated learning when the instructional setting is less structured.\n      </p>", "This article describes how the world-wide web is currently used by a mathematics educator.

These barriers were examined through the use of data from nationally representative samples of eighth-grade mathematics classrooms across 38 nations that took part in the Third International Mathematics and Science Study in 1999 and follow-up analyses involving data from the high-achieving nations of Japan and Singapore. Findings suggest that most of these perceived barriers are not impediments to the use of conceptual teaching strategies in other countries, and the comparative findings hold promise for alternative paradigms for organizing better mathematics instruction in the United States.\n      </p>", "A broad view of mathematics education takes it as the study of how people learn and do mathematics. Starting with this view, the actual and potential relationships of mathematics education as a research discipline to mathematics as a field of knowledge and activity and to the mathematicians carrying out that activity are analyzed. This leads to the picture of a gulf between the two scientific communities which are based in different cultures of thinking and research. A (meta-)study of mathematics and all its facets termed here mathematicology is proposed. It could serve as common ground for cooperative studies by mathematicians and mathematics educators. Thereby the gulf will not necessarily become narrower but a bridge over the differences and mutual misunderstandings could be built.\n      </p>", "Recurrent criticism of some mathematics used in statistics is summarized. The value and importance of mathematics both in the structure of statistical theory and as a tool for the statistician are not disputed, but it is argued that using unnecessary or statistically irrelevant mathematics in presenting material that is potentially useful to statisticians hinders the dissemination and wider adoption of useful ideas by making it difficult to extract the statistically relevant content.

With a focus on the perspectives of teachers, the study investigated the relationship between the teachers' conceptions of beginning algebra and their conceptions of their own teaching practices, with a view to unravelling their conceptions of change in their practices. Significant findings which threw light on the aforementioned relationship have been presented in Agudelo-Valderrama, Clarke and Bishop (2007), highlighting a direct association between a teacher's conceptions of the nature of beginning algebra, the crucial determinants of her/his teaching practice, and her/his attitude to change. After an overview of the study, this paper focuses on specific evidence which clearly shows that in contrast to the strong relationship between a teacher's conceptions of mathematics and her/his teaching practice, assumed in the theoretical model of teachers' thought structures, the teachers see a strong relationship between their conceptions of social/institutional factors of teaching and what they do in their teaching. Implications of the findings for teacher education in Colombia are identified.\n      </p>", "The authors present an analysis of portfolio entries submitted by candidates seeking certification by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards in the area of Early Adolescence/Mathematics. Analyses of mathematical features revealed that the tasks used in instruction included a range of mathematics topics but were not consistently intellectually challenging. Analyses of key pedagogical features of the lesson materials showed that tasks involved hands-on activities or real-world contexts and technology but rarely required students to provide explanations or demonstrate mathematical reasoning. The findings suggest that, even in lessons that teachers selected for display as best practice examples of teaching for understanding, innovative pedagogical approaches were not systematically used in ways that supported students' engagement with cognitively demanding mathematical tasks.\n      </p>", "For more than 14 years, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (1989, 2000) has advocated that teachers of mathematics facilitate that students make connections of various kinds, in their learning of mathematics. Semiotic theories, including those of Peirce and those of Saussure and Lacan (each for different purposes), provide useful lenses for examining ways that teachers may facilitate the making of connections, for instance between home and school mathematics, or between mathematics and other school subjects, or between different branches of mathematics. This paper describes a nested chaining model that takes into account the need for interpretation and meaning making at each step in the sequences involved in connections. A nested model has the capacity to allow for webs of signification and meaning that take into account the complexity of the processes in ways that linear semiotic chains cannot.

It argues that standards of attainment in school mathematics are closely connected to belief systems regarding value and purpose; that these systems do not always collectively offer a credible and coherent vision for mathematics education which can be effectively implemented in school classrooms; and that this coherence of vision is what to a large extent characterises the higher performing TIMSS countries.

An undue emphasis on its mathematical foundations is detrimental to the discipline--it leads to restrictions on its perceived value so that statisticians and those who might otherwise benefit from its methods lose out. Although mathematics lies at its core, statistics as a discipline involves several essential components beyond mathematics. Notably among these are an appreciation of the concepts and methods of the area to which statistical techniques are being applied and computational skills. The range of potential applications of statistical ideas is vast-and is growing. It is important that the discipline of statistics should not let itself be marginalized by an apparent obsession with mathematical niceties.\n      </p>", "Teaching assistants (TAs) play vital roles in the mathematics education of undergraduates and may become mathematics professors. From the K\u201412 literature, it is clear that patterns of teaching practice, as well as beliefs about teaching and learning, form early in teachers' careers. Yet, although there is a large body of research about K\u201412 teachers, researchers are only beginning to consider the development of TAs. This article is an effort to foster collaboration between K\u201412 and undergraduate mathematics educators in framing and carrying out research on the nature of TA professional development.

Given the complex nature of the educational process, these policies are likely to have mixed effects on both general levels of attainment and stratification based on race or ethnicity and social class. Using nationally representative longitudinal data and hierarchical linear modeling, this article explored the association between students' mathematics course work and states' high school graduation requirements and assessment or accountability policies. We found that students in states with more graduation requirements tended to enroll in higher level mathematics courses as freshmen and persist to take more advanced level courses. Similar trends were also found for students in states that link test performance to consequences for schools. Extensive testing, however, had little effect on course taking except to increase differences based on socio-economic status. In contrast, differences between racial or ethnic groups tended to be smaller in states where test performance was linked to consequences for students.\n      </p>", "The authors explored the consequences of middle school mathematics course taking, a measure of opportunity to learn, disparity in students' high school mathematics achievement, and achievement growth. Using 4-year longitudinal data from an ethnically and linguistically diverse district, they applied a 3-level hierarchical linear growth model to address potential inequity in course taking and its consequences. The results indicate that course-taking patterns, even when controlling for prior achievement, play a prominent role in identifying performance differences. The distribution of mathematics course taking among various subgroups not only differed in Grade 8 but also became increasingly inequitable by Grade 11.\n      </p>", "To help students grasp the intimate connections that exist between mathematics and its applications in other disciplines a library of interactive learning modules was developed. This library covers the mathematical areas normally studied by undergraduate students and is used in science courses at all levels. Moreover, the library is designed not just to provide critical connections across disciplines but to also provide longitudinal subject reinforcement as students progress in their studies. In the process of developing the modules a complete editing and publishing system was constructed that is optimized for automated maintenance and upgradeability of materials. The result is a single integrated production system for web- based educational materials. Included in this is a rigorous assessment program, involving both internal and external evaluations of each module. As will be seen, the formative evaluation obtained during the development of the library resulted in the modules successfully bridging multiple disciplines and breaking down the disciplinary barriers commonly found in their math and non-math courses.\n      </p>", "The nature of modern constructive mathematics, and its applications, actual and potential, to classical and quantum physics, are discussed.\n      </p>", "This paper reports the use of a systematic review to explore the impact of daily mathematics lessons in England on enhancing pupil confidence and competence in early mathematics.

In a study presented in two parts, we attempt to capture the world of Internet teaching of undergraduate mathematics. In the first part of the study (Engelbrecht, J. and Harding, A.: 2004, 'Teaching undergraduate mathematics on the web 1: Technologies and taxonomy'), we attempt to create some order in the huge number of activities that are available on the web with a graphical classification of the different types of web courses and discuss some of the technologies involved. In this, the second part of the study, we discuss attributes and implications of this mode of teaching/learning mathematics, also mentioning some of the benefits and concerns. Speculation about the future in such a fluid environment is both risky and fascinating but we nevertheless envisage some possible future trends. Research on this mode of teaching is sparse and open research questions are plentiful.

The advent of the digital computer introduced a powerfully new element that promises to transform the relation between them. This paper outlines the thesis that the effect of the digital computer on mathematics, already widespread, is likely to be radical and far-reaching. To articulate this claim, an abstract model of doing mathematics is introduced based on a triad of actors of which one, the 'agent', corresponds to the function performed by the computer. The model is used to frame two sorts of transformation. The first is pragmatic and involves the alterations and progressive colonization of the content and methods of enquiry of various mathematical fields brought about by digital methods. The second is conceptual and concerns a fundamental antagonism between the infinity enshrined in classical mathematics and physics (continuity, real numbers, asymptotic definitions) and the inherently real and material limit of processes associated with digital computation. An example which lies in the intersection of classical mathematics and computer science, the P = NP problem, is analysed in the light of this latter issue.\n      </p>", "The current study examined the mathematical achievement of high school students enrolled for 3 years in one of three NSF funded Standards-based curricula (IMP, CMIC, MMOW). The focus was on traditional topics in mathematics as measured by subtests of a standardized achievement test and a criterion-referenced test of mathematics achievement. Students generally scored at or above the national mean on the achievement subtests. Hierarchical linear modeling results showed that prior mathematics knowledge was a significant but modest predictor of achievement, student SES had a moderate effect, and increasing concentrations of African American students in a classroom were associated with a stronger effect of attendance on achievement. No differences on the standardized achievement subtests emerged among the Standards-based curricula studied once background variables were taken into account. The two suburban districts providing data for the criterion-referenced test achieved well above the national norm.\n      </p>", "Mathematics teachers' selection and implementation of instructional tasks were analyzed before, during, and after their participation in a professional development initiative that focused on selecting and enacting cognitively challenging mathematical tasks. Data collected from 18 secondary mathematics teacher participants included tasks and student work from teachers' classrooms, lesson observations, and interviews. Ten secondary mathematics teachers who did not participate in the professional development initiative served as the contrast group and participated in 1 lesson observation each. Analysis of the data indicated that, following their participation in the professional development initiative, project teachers more frequently selected highlevel tasks as the main instructional tasks in their classrooms and had improved the maintenance of high-level cognitive demands. Significant differences existed between project teachers and the contrast group in task selection and implementation. These differences were not influenced by the use of Standards-based or conventional curricula in project teachers' classrooms.\n      </p>", "The hypergeometric differential equation was found by Euler [Euler, L. (1769) Opera Omnia Ser. 1, 11-13] and was extensively studied by Gauss [Gauss, C. F. (1812) Comm. Soc. Reg. Sci. II 3, 123-162], Kummer [Kummer, E. J. (1836) Riene Ang. Math. 15, 39-83; Kummer, E. J.

The hypergeometric function known also as Gauss' function is the unique solution of the hypergeometric equation analytic at z = 0 and with value 1 at z = 0. This function, because of its remarkable properties, has been used for centuries in the whole subject of special functions. In this article we give a matrix-valued analog of the hypergeometric differential equation and of Gauss' function. One can only speculate that many of the connections that made Gauss' function a vital part of mathematics at the end of the 20th century will be shared by its matrix-valued version, discussed here.\n      </p>", "In the last three decades there have been a variety of studies of what is often referred to as 'everyday' or 'street' mathematics. These studies have documented a rich variety of arithmetic practices involved in activities such as tailoring, carpet laying, dieting, or grocery shopping. More importantly, these studies have helped to rectify outmoded models of rationality, cognition, and (school) instruction. Despite these important achievements, doubts can be raised about the ways in which theoretical conclusions have been drawn from empirical materials. Furthermore, while these studies rightly criticised prevalent theories of rationality and cognition as too simplistic to account for everyday activities, it seems that some of the proposed alternatives suffer from similar flaws (i.e., are straightforward inversions of the to-be-opposed theories, rather than more nuanced views on complicated issues). In this article we illustrate our sceptical view by discussing four case studies in Jean Lave's pioneering and influential 'Cognition in Practice' (1988). By looking at the case studies in detail, we investigate how Lave's conclusions relate to the empirical materials and offer alternative characterisations. In particular, we question whether the empirical studies demonstrate the existence of two different kinds of mathematics ('everyday' and 'school,' or 'formal' and 'informal') and whether school instruction tries to replace the former with the latter.\n      </p>", "This empirical paper considers the different purposes for which teachers use examples in elementary mathematics teaching, and how well the actual examples used fit these intended purposes. For this study, 24 mathematics lessons taught by prospective elementary school teachers were videotaped. In the spirit of grounded theory, the purpose of the analysis of these lessons was to discover, and to construct theories around, the ways that these novice teachers could be seen to draw upon their mathematics teaching knowledgebase in their lesson preparation and in their observed classroom instruction. A highlypervasive dimension of the findings was these teachers' choice and use of examples. Four categories of uses of examples are identified and exemplified: these are related to different kinds of teacher awareness.\n      </p>", "Students' success in mathematics depends upon attitude towards mathematics.

The SRL support was based on the IMPROVE metacognitive self-questioning method that directs students' attention to understanding when, why, and how to solve problems (Kramarski and Mevarech, Am Educ Res J 40:281-310, 2003). Sixty-four Israeli elementary teachers participated in a month-long professional development program to enhance mathematical and pedagogical knowledge. The course was part of a 3-year professional development program sponsored by the Israeli Ministry of Education. This mixed-method study included quantitative assessments of teachers' professional knowledge in mathematical problem solving for an authentic task based on Program for International Student Assessment's framwork (Program for International Student Assessment, 2003) and in lesson planning, as well as qualitative interviews and videotaped observations of two teachers. Results indicated that teachers in the SRL program outperformed those in the no-SRL program on various problem solving skills (e.g., reflection and conceptual mathematical explanations) and lesson planning (e.g., task demands and teaching approach). Videotaped observations of actual teaching indicated that the SRL-trained teacher demonstrated more teaching practices that aimed to promote students' understanding and better supported students' regulation of their own learning, compared to the no-SRL-trained teacher.

This study examined the impact of participation in either a National Science Foundation\u2014funded or commercially developed mathematics curriculum on the difficulty level of the first university mathematics course a student enrolled in and the grade earned in that course. The results provide evidence that National Science Foundation\u2014funded curricula do not prepare students to initially enroll in more difficult university mathematics courses as well as commercially developed curricula, but once enrolled students earn similar grades.

Critical for making progress in these debates is information about the actual nature of classroom practice in U.S. classrooms. This article focuses on one key element of classroom practice-teaching-and presents the results of two studies of randomly selected, nationally representative U.S. eighth-grade mathematics lessons that were videotaped as part of the TIMSS 1995 and 1999 Video Studies. Analyses compare features of teaching found in these lessons with pedagogical recommendations for middle school teachers in the Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (Principles and Standards) in order to examine the extent to which teaching in U.S. eight-grade classrooms is standards-based. Results show that typical mathematics teaching, in both 1995 and 1999, is more like the kind of traditional teaching reported for most of the past century (Cuban, 1993; Fey, 1979; Weiss, Pasley, Smith, Banilower, &amp; Heck, 2003; Welch, 1978) than the kind of teaching promoted in Principles and Standards.\n      </p>", "This article reports on models of teaching that developed as outgrowths of a study of middle-grades mathematics classes. Grounded theory methodology and sociolinguistic tools were used to move from classroom observations and interviews to lineby-line coding of classroom discourse, to mapping the flow of talk and verbal assessment moves, to a multilevel analysis of the relationships of forms of talk and verbal assessment, and, ultimately, to models of teaching that promote discourse on a continuum from univocal (conveying meaning) to dialogic (constructing meaning through dialogue). Three specific cases are highlighted that represent deductive (associated with univocal), inductive (associated with dialogic), and mixed (a hybrid of deductive and inductive) models of teaching. Teaching practices associated with each model are illustrated and discussed.\n      </p>", "G\u00f6del argued that intuition has an important role to play in mathematical epistemology, and despite the infamy of his own position, this opinion still has much to recommend it. Intuitions and folk platitudes play a central role in philosophical enquiry too, and have recently been elevated to a central position in one project for understanding philosophical methodology: the so-called 'Canberra Plan'. This philosophical role for intuitions suggests an analogous epistemology for some fundamental parts of mathematics, which casts a number of themes in recent philosophy of mathematics (concerning a priority and fictionalism, for example) in revealing new light.\n      </p>", "The purpose of this study was to explore the views of students enrolled at a small United States Midwestern community college toward learning mathematics, and to examine the relationship between student beliefs about mathematics learning and educational experiences with mathematics using Q methodology and open-ended response prompts. Schommer's (Journal of Educational Psychology, 82, 495-504, 1990) multidimensional theory of personal epistemology provided the structural framework for the development of 36 domain specific Q sort statements. Analysis of the data revealed three distinct but related views of learning mathematics which were labeled Active Learners, Skeptical Learners, and Confident Learners. Chi-square tests of independence revealed no significant differences based on gender. Additionally, there was no evidence for differences based on level of mathematics completed, age, or college hours accumulated. Student's previous experiences in instructional environments, however, were closely associated with beliefs. Results are discussed in view of the implications for establishing learning environments and considerations in implementing Standards-based curricula in higher education.\n      </p>", "This study examines the emotional responses of three individuals to timed mathematics tests. We examine the emotional responses of two adult women who look back to timed skills-tests in elementary school and the emotional response of a grade-three girl currently taking timed skills-tests.

However, the means by which videotaped lessons are coded and analysed remains an underdeveloped area with scholars adopting substantially different approaches to the task. In this paper we present an approach based on generic descriptors of mathematics learning objectives. Exploiting live observations in five European countries, the descriptors were developed in a bottom-up recursive manner for application to videotaped lessons from four of these countries, Belgium (Flanders), England, Hungary and Spain. The analyses showed not only that the descriptors were consistently operationalised but also that they facilitated the identification of both similarities and differences in the ways in which teachers conceptualise and present mathematics that resonated with the available literature. In so doing we make both methodological and theoretical contributions to comparative mathematics research in general and debates concerning the national mathematics teaching script in particular.\n      </p>", "Using dialogues with our informants, as well as with each other, we explore how the men and women in our research make it through their mathematics coursework and, in turn, pursue their intended majors. Our research focuses on how students navigate what we call the gendered math path and how that path conforms to and diverges from traditional gender norms. Common themes of women's lower than men's self-perception of their ability to do mathematics, along with the divergent processes of doing gender that emerged in men's and women's discussions of their application of mathematics, reminded us of the continued struggles that women have to succeed in male-dominated academic disciplines. Although self-perception helps us understand why there are fewer women in STEM fields, it is important to understand how different forms of application of ideas might add to the diversity of what it means to do good science.\n      </p>", "National and international studies have made student performance in mathematics a high priority in schools. Using longitudinal data from elementary and secondary schools, the authors examined the connections between specific family and community involvement activities and student achievement in mathematics at the school level. After the authors controlled for prior levels of mathematics achievement, analyses indicated that effective implementation of practices that encouraged families to support their children's mathematics learning at home was associated with higher percentages of students who scored at or above proficiency on standardized mathematics achievement tests. Findings suggest that subject-specific practices of school, family, and community partnerships may help educators improve students' mathematics skills and achievement.\n      </p>", "This review considers research related to mathematics education and cooperative learning, and it discusses how teachers might assist students in cooperative groups to provide equitable opportunities to learn. In this context, equity is defined as the fair distribution of opportunities to learn, and the argument is that identity-related processes are just as central to mathematical development as content learning. The link is thus considered between classroom social ecologies, the interactions and positional identities that these social ecologies make available, and student learning.

It is found that even teachers who have undergone some assessment training may underestimate the role of interpretation of evidence, and questions about equity in the uses of teachers' judgements are raised in relation to awareness and practice. It is suggested that more care needs to be taken over the formation and use of 'professional judgements' within systems of assessment.\n      </p>", "In this response to Foundations for Success: The Final Report of the National Mathematics Advisory Panel (2008), the authors argue that the Panel's assumption that only experimental research studies can produce scientific evidence limits the power of the Panel's recommendations to improve mathematics teaching and learning. The authors first discuss the theoretical underpinnings, potential contributions, and limitations of experimental studies. Against this background, they focus on three issues that are central to improving mathematics learning and teaching, those of equity, the nature and content of text-books, and graduate education. In doing so, the authors illustrate the limitations of developing implications for policy and practice by relying exclusively on research conducted using a single methodology.\n      </p>", "The quality of students' mathematics classroom discussions is an important factor in determining mathematics classroom learning outcomes. Good mathematics classroom discussions provide an opportunity for ideas to be shared and developed, but not all mathematics classroom discussions produce these learning opportunities. In this paper I discuss three constructs (subject, purpose, and frame) and how they can be used to analyze and characterize the quality of students' mathematics classroom discussions in terms of the mathematics learning potential that those discussions provide.\n      </p>", "This study was designed to compare the effects of Team Assisted Individualization (TAI) and Student Teams- Achievement Divisions (STAD) on fourth grade students' academic achievement in and attitudes towards mathematics. Seven classes of a school were randomly selected for this experimental study. Two of these were given instruction through TAI; two through STAD, and the remaining three were treated as a control group. For the purpose of the data analysis regarding academic achievement, the 3X1 covariance analysis was used to compare the groups. As a result of this comparison, both the TAI and STAD methods were found to have positive effects (d= 1.003 for TAI and d=0.40 for STAD) on students' academic achievement in mathematics. The pairwise comparisons showed that the TAI method had a more significant effect than the STAD method. The scores for the attitude towards mathematics were analyzed by using non-parametric statistics. As a result of this analysis, no significant difference was observed regarding students' attitudes towards mathematics.\n      </p>", "The theoretical frameworks presented in this Special Issue are appraised with respect to how they might enhance teachers' or researchers' work with 'special needs' students learning mathematics. The notion of 'special needs' is used in a broad sense, encompassing specific Special Educational Needs as well as students with low attainment. The analysis indicates that the different frameworks offer some distinctive methods for research or ideas for interventions, either individually or within multi-lens approaches. It also points to other perspectives, not represented here, that could be relevant for a growing understanding of issues of affect in mathematics education.\n      </p>", "The authors evaluated self-efficacy and motivational orientation across Hispanic and Caucasian students to predict variables related to mathematics achievement, including mathematics performance and students' plans to take additional mathematics courses. Path models were analyzed for 358 students in Grades 9 and 10 who attended a West Texas high school and for the sample split by ethnicity. The tested models provided adequate goodness of fit to the data, supporting the finding that self-efficacy predicts motivational orientation and mathematics performance. Tests of each model parameter across ethnicity revealed 1 significant difference, suggesting that the relationship between prior mathematics achievement and self-efficacy was stronger for Hispanic students. Findings indicate that similar motivational systems exist to predict mathematics achievement across ethnicity; however, Caucasian students do not place as much emphasis on prior mastery experiences as do Hispanic students, suggesting that other factors are active in influencing their self-efficacy.\n      </p>", "This retrospective study examined the impact of prior mathematics achievement on the relationship between high school mathematics curricula and student postsecondary mathematics performance. The sample (N = 4,144 from 266 high schools) was partitioned into 3 strata by ACT mathematics scores. Students completing 3 or more years of a commercially developed curriculum, the University of Chicago School Mathematics Project curriculum, or National Science Foundation-funded curriculum comprised the sample. Of interest were comparisons of the difficulty level and grade in their initial and subsequent college mathematics courses, and the number of mathematics courses completed over 8 semesters of college work. In general, high school curriculum was not differentially related to the pattern of mathematics grades that students earned over time or to the difficulty levels of the students' mathematics course-taking patterns. There also was no relationship between high school curricula and the number of college mathematics courses completed.\n      </p>", "This review critically examines 33 studies on students' epistemological beliefs about mathematics. Five categories were identified: beliefs about mathematics, development of beliefs, effects of beliefs on behavior, domain differences, and changing beliefs. Studies examining beliefs about mathematics revealed consistent patterns of nonavailing beliefs at all educational levels. Mathematics instructional environments were inferred to influence the development of beliefs about mathematics. All studies revealed significant relationships between beliefs and cognition, motivation, and academic achievement. Descriptive studies found relationships between beliefs and learning behaviors. Studies examining domain differences found significant variations in beliefs across disciplines. Studies focusing on changing beliefs were successful, which was attributed to appropriate changes in instructional style. The article concludes with suggestions for future research.\n      </p>", "Mathematical skill level, classroom behavior, and effort of 512 students were rated by 15 third-grade teachers and 14 fifth-grade teachers. Of those students, 464 completed mathematics and reading achievement tests. Correlation and regression analyses were performed to measure the relationship between student gender and teacher perceptions of their mathematics proficiency. In both third and fifth grades, regression results showed that mathematics and reading achievement test scores, together with student effort, were significant predictors of teacher rating of student mathematics achievement. Gender was not a significant contributor in either grade. Similar results were found when students were split by general or special education. The findings suggest that the teachers did not consider student gender when rating the mathematics skill level of their students.\n      </p>", "Mathematics education (didactics of mathematics) cannot grow without close relationships to mathematics, psychology, pedagogy and other areas. However, there is the risk that by adopting standards, methods and research contexts from other well-established disciplines, the applied nature of mathematics education may be undermined. In order to preserve the specific status and the relative autonomy of mathematics education, the suggestion to conceive of mathematics education as a 'design science' is made.\n      </p>", "Using data from the 2003 National Assessment of Educational Progress, this analysis compared mathematics achievement in public, charter, and major types of private schools to examine whether disparities in achievement are due to differences in school performance or student demographics in various sectors. Hierarchical linear models were used to control for student- and school-level demographic characteristics. The analysis indicated that the relatively high raw scores of private schools were more than accounted for by student demographics. In fact, after demographic differences had been controlled, the private school advantage disappeared and even reversed in most cases. These findings raise questions about the basis of reform models that seek remedies in parental choice, autonomy, competition, and other attributes associated with the private school sector.\n      </p>", "This paper addresses the issue of subjectivity in the context of mathematics education research. It introduces the psychoanalyst and theorist Jacques Lacan whose work on subjectivity combined Freud's psychoanalytic theory with processes of signification as developed in the work of de Saussure and Peirce. The paper positions Lacan's subjectivity initially in relation to the work of Piaget and Vygotsky who have been widely cited within mathematics education research, but more extensively it is shown how Lacan's conception of subjectivity provides a development of Peircian semiotics that has been influential for some recent work in the area. Through this route Lacan's work enables a conception of subjectivity that combines yet transcends Piaget's psychology and Peirce's semiotics and in so doing provides a bridge from mathematics education research to contemporary theories of subjectivity more prevalent in the cultural sciences. It is argued that these broader conceptions of subjectivity enable mathematics education research to support more effective engagement by teachers, teacher educators, researchers and students in the wider social domain.\n      </p>", "The author examined advanced mathematics achievement with 1,839 students from 162 schools. The data were obtained from the Third International Mathematics and Science Study Population 3 cohort; the author used hierarchical (multilevel) linear modeling to examine student- and school-level factors. Even within the advanced mathematics cohort, gender and economic disparities existed, but the magnitude of these disparities varied from school to school. Average parent education was observed to be associated with the magnitude of the coefficient for attitude toward mathematics on achievement. The more a student believed that success in mathematics was caused by natural ability, the higher the score on the test. Finally, resources, school size, and average parent education were significantly associated with school mean achievement in advanced mathematics.\n      </p>", "Amid debates about the continued salience of gender in mathematics, this report summarizes an IES-funded investigation of gender-related patterns in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study\u2014Kindergarten Class of 1998\u201399 (ECLS-K). Girls' and boys' mathematics achievement, confidence, and interest were examined, along with experiences at home and school. Teacher-reported instructional practices shed little light on gender gaps in mathematics performance; however, teachers' perceptions of girls and boys could play a role.\n      </p>", "This paper investigates the nature of the interaction between the teacher and students as they worked on different mathematics activities in a single classroom over a 10-month period. Sociocultural theories and the Vygotskian zone of proximal development provide the main framework for examining the teaching and learning processes and explaining the incorporation of a four-phase lesson plan as increasing participation of the teacher and students in the teaching and learning process. Drawing on the analyses of discourse from videotaped lessons and the interviews with the teacher and students, five different types of interactions that emphasized mathematical sense-making and justification of ideas and arguments were identified. Excerpts from transcriptions of such interactions are provided to illustrate the learning practices, either academic or non-academic, that students developed in response to these interactions.\n      </p>", "A semiotic perspective on mathematical activity provides a way of conceptualizing the teaching and learning of mathematics that transcends and encompasses both psychological perspectives focussing exclusively on mental structures and functions, and performance-focussed perspectives concerned only with student' behaviours. Instead it considers the personal appropriation of signs and the underlying meaning structures embodying relationships between signs. It is concerned with patterns of sign use and sign production, including individual creativity in sign use, and the underlying social rules and contexts of sign use. It is based on the concept of a semiotic system, comprising signs, rules of sign production, and an underpinning meaning structure. This theorisation is applied to the learning of number, from counting to calculation. Historical, foundational and developmental (i.e., learning) perspectives are explored and contrasted. It is argued that in each of these domains, the dominant significant activity concerns the production of sequences of signs.\n      </p>"], "words": {"all": {"number": 3, "prob":
