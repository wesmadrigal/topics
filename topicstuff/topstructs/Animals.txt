A lattice animal is a finite connected set of sites, with its weight being the sum of the scores at its sites. Let $N_{n}$ be the maximal weight of those lattice animals of size n that contain the origin. Denote by N the almost sure finite constant limit of $n^{-1}N_{n}$ , which exists under a mild condition on the positive tail of F. We study certain geometrical aspects of the lattice animal with maximal weight among those contained in an n-box where n is large, both in the supercritical phase where N &amp;gt; 0, and in the critical case where N = 0.\n      </p>", "How do animals become problems? Drawing on interactionist theories of social problems and cultural geography, I argue that the construction of animals as problems relies upon cultural understandings of nature/culture relationships, which in turn entail \"imaginative geographies.\" Specifically, modernity posits a firm boundary between nature and culture. Animals have their place, but are experienced as \"out of place\"\u2014and often problematic\u2014when they are perceived to transgress spaces designated for human habitation. Relying on New York Times articles from 1851 to 2006, and articles from 51 other newspapers from 1980 to 2006, this article focuses on the process by which pigeons as a species were problematized. I contend that pigeons have come to represent the antithesis of the ideal metropolis, which is orderly and sanitized, with nature subdued and compartmentalized. While typified as a health issue, the pigeon's primary \"offense\" is that it \"pollutes\" habitats dedicated for human use. The catch phrase \"rats with wings\" neatly summarizes society's evaluations of, and anxieties about, this bird. This metaphor reflects a framing of pigeons by claims-makers that renders them out of place in the cityscape. This study expands social problems theorizing to more thoroughly account for animals and the role of space.\n      </p>", "Vaccines are used to control the main infectious diseases of animals confined in zoos or wildlife sanctuaries. Most of these vaccines are not approved for wild animal species and therefore their use is extra-label. There is a need to collect more data on the use of vaccines in various species and to develop new guidelines to ensure the safe and effective use of these vaccines. Also, there is a need to develop methods to improve the administration of vaccines, especially in free-ranging wildlife.\n      </p>", "Using anaesthetized animals to test potential humaneness of killing traps, initiated in the 1970s, was based on the knowledge that anesthesia minimizes animal stress. Our study focus was to determine whether time-to-loss-of-sensibility resulting from tests on anaesthetized animals was predictive of time-to-loss-of-sensibility of results from tests on unanaesthetized animals. Time-to-loss-of-sensibility of anaesthetized animal tests (median = 75.5 seconds, n = 198) were less than unanaesthetized animal tests (median = 102 seconds, n = 333). However, the relationship between anaesthetized animal tests and unanaesthetized animal tests is not predictive (&lt;tex-math&gt;$r^{2}=0.07$&lt;/tex-math&gt;, P=0.244), based on species and trap types tested by the Fur Institute of Canada's Trap Effectiveness Project between 1985 and 1997. Therefore, we do not recommend use of anaesthetized animals to test humaneness of killing traps.\n      </p>", "Viruses normally associated with man, or antibodies to such viruses, were found in animals in two villages in West Bengal during a 6-month survey. Eleven serotypes were isolated from the feces of seven vertebrate species and one serotype from flies. In one of the villages, echovirus 7 was most frequently isolated at the start of the study and was obtained from six species, including both mammals and birds, whereas poliovirus 1 occurred in two species at the end of the study. Repeated isolations were made from two dogs over a 2- to 3-month period. The coprophagous, terrestrial species (dogs and chickens) yielded the highest number of isolates and the highest number of serotypes, whereas the primarily nonterrestrial species (monkeys and house crows) yielded the least number of isolates and serotypes. Most of the cattle and some of the goats had antibodies to a Hong Kong ( $H_{3}N_{2}$ )-like strain of influenza. The viruses occurred with a frequency that may have been proportional to the abundance of each serotype in the environment. No clinical symptoms were observed in the viral-positive animals.\n      </p>", "An epic narrative poem known as Hnewo teppy (\"Book of Origins\") holds a central place in the mythic and ritual imagination of the Nuosu people of south-west China. Existing both as oral performances and oral-connected written texts, the narrative relates the origins of the sky, earth, geographical features, and life forms-culminating in the origins of the forebears of the Nuosu people. Animals and plants populate the landscape of the narrative world, clustering in the categories of wild and domestic. Individual species tend to be associated with specific niches in the natural and human-modified landscape, their origins occurring in a dynamic of creation and destruction throughout the ages. Among the forerunners of living beings in the present age are the \"tribes of snow,\" catalogued in taxons comprised of wild plants and animals. Moreover, many portions of the epic feature domesticated stock and crops that are associated with, and in some cases even sanction, Nuosu customs current today. In an approach drawing on folkloristic theory and ecocriticism, this article introduces and outlines a hitherto undocumented version of the Hnewo tepyy, examines how select images of life forms in the text relate to historic and contemporary Nuosu culture, and suggests that in the traditions of the Hnewo, boundaries between the realms are conceptually mitigated by the ultimate origin of all life in the sky.\n      </p>", "This essay examines the interest in animals expressed by late Enlightenment historians, including particularly the views of Johann Gottfried Herder, Guillaume Thomas Fran\u00e7ois Raynal, William Robertson, and Edward Gibbon. These historians, the first to emphasize the way the use of animals contributed to human progress, were influenced by the Comte de Buffon and by Enlightenment conjectural history and stadial theory. Where animals are discussed in their writings, these thinkers made a significant contribution to the transition from early modern perspectives to a more historical view of the role of animals in human culture.\n      </p>", "Objectives\u2014To investigate the incidence of allergy to laboratory animals (ALA) during the first two years of employment, and to study the effect on ALA of atopy and sensitisation. Methods\u2014A follow up prospective study of ALA at the Zeneca (formerly ICI) Research Laboratories. Results\u2014The incidence of the disease during the first year of employment has remained at about 10% since the mid-1980s. This compares with an incidence of 37% in the early 1980s. The reduction in incidence and its maintenance at a lower level is thought to be due to the introduction and management of improved engineering controls, working practices, and educational programmes designed to reduce exposure to allergens from laboratory animals. The underlying incidence of immunological sensitisation to animals (the presence of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to animal allergens) is much higher (40% after one and 53% after two years of exposure). Both atopic diathesis and presensitisation to laboratory animals increased the likelihood that a person would develop ALA. Conclusion\u2014Neither factor predicted the disease accurately so their use should be restricted to the identification of people who may be more susceptible to the development of ALA (and thus who may need to pay particular attention to the use of personal protective equipment) rather than to their exclusion.\n      </p>", "We consider nearest-neighbor self-avoiding walk, bond percolation, lattice trees, and bond lattice animals on ${\\Bbb Z}^{d}$. The two-point functions of these models are respectively the generating function for self-avoiding walks from the origin to $x\\in {\\Bbb Z}^{d}$, the probability of a connection from the origin to x, and the generating functions for lattice trees or lattice animals containing the origin and x. Using the lace expansion, we prove that the two-point function at the critical point is asymptotic to $const.|x|^{2-d}$ as |x| \u2192 \u221e, for d \u2265 5 for self-avoiding walk, for d \u2265 19 for percolation, and for sufficiently large d for lattice trees and animals. These results are complementary to those of [Ann. Probab. 31 (2003) 349-408], where spread-out models were considered. In the course of the proof, we also provide a sufficient (and rather sharp if d &amp;gt; 4) condition under which the two-point function of a random walk on ${\\Bbb Z}^{d}$ is asymptotic to $const.|x|^{2-d}$ as |x| \u2192 \u221e.\n      </p>", "Estimates of population size obtained by capture-recapture methods refer solely to the catchable portion of a population. Given a population containing marked animals, two closed-form maximum likelihood estimators of the proportion of uncatchable animals are presented. They are based on twice sampling the proportion of marked animals in the population: the first sample is drawn from catchable animals only, the second from mixed catchable and uncatchable animals. If the individuals in the first sample are not available to the second sample, both sample must be taken from a representative subpopulation of known size. The quantities required may be obtained during a standard capturere-capture session, provided the sampling methods meet the relevant assumptions; the ensuing estimate of population size can then be corrected for uncatchability. The technique is illustrated for eider ducks, using data from Coulson (1984, Ibis 126, 525-543).\n      </p>", "The paper deals with partiality flowing from special relationships. Two main problems are discussed. The first concerns the relationship between partiality and genuine moral obligations. If partiality can bring about such obligations only if it is reasonable, what requirements should it meet in order to be reasonable? The second problem is one of animal ethics. Can the concept of reasonable partiality help us articulate what is morally at stake in a current discussion about the treatment of domestic animals, viz. the European discussion about the castration of pigs?\n      </p>", "In this paper, the practice of women breast-feeding animals is viewed from a geographic and historical perspective. The principal aims are to establish where the practice has been commonplace, to determine its economic and socio-cultural context, to consider its possible role in animal domestication, and to weigh its significance in human ecology. &#151; In many cases, the practice is an expression of affection for pets (among Polynesians, among forest peoples of tropical South America, and especially among aboriginal hunters and gatherers in Southeast Asia, Australia, and Tasmania). In other cases, affection is supplemented or supplanted by economic concerns, as among various Melanesian \"pig complex\" peoples. In some cases, breast-feeding of animals is linked to cult and ritual, an outstanding example being the nursing of cubs in connection with the Ainu bear cult. In a few cases, animals are breast-fed with the welfare of the human mother or child being of greatest concern. The conclusion is drawn that animal nursing may indeed have contributed to the domestication of such animals as the pig and dog, and that in some places, particularly lowland New Guinea, the practice can play an important role in human ecology.\n      </p>", "More than 50 million animals are used in biomedical research in the world each year. It is highly desirable that this number is reduced both for ethical and for economic reasons. Better experimental design could lead to the use of fewer animals and improve the repeatability of animal experiments so that alternative methods would be easier to validate. Screening experiments aimed at identifying rodent carcinogens would be more powerful if more than one strain of mice and/or rats were used. Attempts to validate alternative test methods by using chemicals already tested in the Draize test for eye irritation are complicated by limited information on the interexperiment variability of the whole animal test. In academic toxicological research, surveys suggest that many experiments are poorly designed, and some seem to be unnecessarily large.\n      </p>", "Animal mtDNAs are typically small (\u224816 kbp), circular-mapping molecules that encode 37 or fewer tightly packed genes. Here we investigate whether similarly compact mitochondrial genomes are also present in the closest unicellular relatives of animals, i.e., choanoflagellate and ichthyosporean protists. We find that the gene content and architecture of the mitochondrial genomes of the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis, the ichthyosporean Amoebidium parasiticum, and Metazoa are radically different from one another. The circular-mapping choanoflagellate mtDNA with its long intergenic regions is four times as large and contains two times as many protein genes as do animal mtDNAs, whereas the ichthyosporean mitochondrial genome totals &gt;200 kbp and consists of several hundred linear chromosomes that share elaborate terminal-specific sequence patterns. The highly peculiar organization of the ichthyosporean mtDNA raises questions about the mechanism of mitochondrial genome replication and chromosome segregation during cell division in this organism. Considering that the closest unicellular relatives of animals possess large, spacious, gene-rich mtDNAs, we posit that the distinct compaction characteristic of metazoan mitochondrial genomes occurred simultaneously with the emergence of a multicellular body plan in the animal lineage.\n      </p>"], "words": {"associated": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "consider": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "estimates": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "an": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "as": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "paper": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "including": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "are": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "in": {"number": 7, "prob": 5.7968854162784825e-05}, "examines": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "particularly": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "relationships": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "from": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "infectious": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "west": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "objectives": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "two": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "to": {"number": 4, "prob": 3.312505952159133e-05}, "population": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "more": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "we": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "used": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "known": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "during": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "with": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "by": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "women": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "a": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "animals": {"number": 4, "prob": 3.312505952159133e-05}, "using": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "this": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "of": {"number": 6, "prob": 4.968758928238699e-05}, "such": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "were": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "become": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "the": {"number": 7, "prob": 5.7968854162784825e-05}, "or": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}}}
