{"total_words": 1519, "documents": ["The kinematics of surface swimming of the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) and water opossum (Chironectes minimus) were studied to determine locomotor changes associated with the evolutionary transition from terrestrial to semiaquatic existence. Films of individual animals swimming across an aquarium were made and analyzed. Didelphis swam with a modified quadrupedal gait similar to a diagonal sequence run. Besides providing propulsive forces, this gait generated an upward force allowing the nasal apertures to remain above the water for breathing. In contrast, Chironectes paddled exclusively with the hind limbs in a manner similar to other semiaquatic mammals. The non-wettable fur of Chironectes seemed to provide sufficient buoyancy so that no additional forces were required to maintain the nares above the water surface. Transition to exclusive hind limb paddling in semiaquatic mammals appears to be associated with development of non-wettable fur for increased buoyancy and with increased swimming effectiveness resulting from lack of interference between forelimbs and hind limbs during the stroke cycle. Eliminating use of the forelimbs in paddling also permitted unrestricted movement of the hind limbs.\n      </p>", "Swimming pools have become an essential attachment to most habitable coastal construction such as hotels, condominiums and single family residences. A large swimming pool type structure may obstruct the free flow of floodwater and increase the turbulence. This in turn may increase the scour potential and the wave/debris action on the building and foundation. A conceptual breakaway concrete swimming pool design is described herein. It is demonstrated that this pool will withstand everyday factored water/soil loading, but will collapse and break away under extreme wave action, thereby minimizing the detrimental effects of a solid pool.\n      </p>", "The propulsive swimming modes of river otters (Lutra canadensis) were examined relative to behavior. Six river otters were filmed in zoo enclosures that provided surface or submerged views. The repertoire of swimming modes observed for otters included quadrupedal paddling, forelimb paddling, alternate hind-limb paddling, simultaneous hind-limb paddling, and body and tail dorsoventral undulation. Paddling modes accounted for 88% of surface swimming observations and for 86% of observations involving submerged maneuvers. Dorsoventral undulation predominated during rectilinear submerged swimming. Transition from paddling to undulatory propulsion was accomplished by use of simultaneous hind-limb paddling in concert with dorsoventral body and tail flexion. These motions produced a posteriorly directed traveling wave in the tail with an average velocity 1.62 times the swimming velocity. The higher velocity in the tail could produce hydrodynamic thrust during all phases of the paddling cycle.\n      </p>", "Sexual selection via female mate choice can result in the evolution of elaborate male traits that incur substantial costs for males. Despite increased interest in how female mating preferences contribute to the evolution of male traits, few studies have directly quantified the locomotor costs of such traits. A sexually selected trait that could affect movement costs is the sword exhibited by male swordtail fishes: while longer swords may increase male mating success, they could negatively affect the hydrodynamic aspects of swimming activities. Here, we examine the energetic costs of the sword in Xiphophorus montezumae by experimentally manipulating sword length and measuring male aerobic metabolism during two types of activity, routine swimming and courtship swimming. Direct measurements of oxygen consumption indicate that males with longer swords expend more energy than males with shortened swords during both types of swimming. In addition, the sword increases the cost of male courtship. Thus, while sexual selection via female choice favours long swords, males with longer swords experience higher metabolic costs during swimming, suggesting that sexual and natural selection have opposing effects on sword evolution. This study demonstrates a hydrodynamic cost of a sexually selected trait. In addition, this study discriminates between the cost of a sexually selected trait used in courtship and other courtship costs.\n      </p>", "Locomotion in land and water requires different adaptations, hence semiaquatic mammals must deal with conflicting demands of the 2 environments. Semiaquatic rodents of the tribe Oryzomyini are considered semiaquatic mostly based on habitat use and morphology, but locomotory specializations were not yet determined for most species of the group. We compared water absorption of the fur and swimming behavior between 2 species of oryzomyine water rats (Nectomys) and 2 terrestrial species of Cerradomys. We used adult rodents captured in the wild but acclimated to laboratory conditions. Water absorption rate was determined by the relative increase in body mass after a 5-min swimming session. Animals were videotaped swimming in an aquarium to determine gaits, body posture, maneuverability, and speed. Water absorption rate was significantly lower in semiaquatic species, with no significant difference between sexes. Bipedal paddling was the more frequently used gait by all 4 species, but semiaquatic species were faster and maintained a more hydrodynamic body posture, with a short gliding phase during the gait cycle. Only semiaquatic species were capable of floating effortlessly, and used the swimming bound, a gait similar to the half bound of terrestrial locomotion. Submerged swimming was the fastest swimming gait, used by 1 terrestrial and 1 semiaquatic species. The better performance during bipedal swimming of semiaquatic water rats was related to the improved buoyancy provided by reduced water absorption of the fur, which seemed to represent an important adaptation to move in the water without compromising locomotion on land.\n      </p>", "The swimming behavior of the rice water weevil Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus Kuschel (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is unique in comparison to that of most other aquatic weevils. Propulsion during swimming is provided only by the mesothoracic legs. The legs are moved synchronously during protraction and retraction. The pro- and metathoracic legs serve as diving planes and provide stability. The average rice water weevil swimming speed was 1.53 (\u00b10.15 SE) cm per s with a range of 0.88 to 2.52 cm per s. Weevils averaged 5.67 (\u00b10.22 SE) strokes per s. The mode of swimming by L. oryzophilus differs from those described for Phytobious leucogaster (Marsham) (= Litodactylus leucogaster), P. comari (Herbst), Bagous cavifrons LeConte, B. americanus LeConte and B. limosus Gyllenhal. It also differs from descriptions of swimming for other aquatic Coleoptera and Hemiptera. Furthermore, L. oryzophilus swims below the surface and was observed at depths of 18.0 cm in the laboratory. This brings the modes of free swimming (exclusive of skating) to at least 3 by adult aquatic curculionids. /// El comportamiento de nataci\u00f3n del gorgojo acu\u00e1tico de arroz, Lissorhotrus oryzophilus Kuschel (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) es \u00fanico en comparaci\u00f3n a la mayor\u00eda de los gorgojos acu\u00e1ticos.

Here I address the trade-offs between gains and risks and the question of how much and how fast to swim using simple models that optimise the number of lifetime mate encounters. Radically different swimming strategies are predicted for different feeding behaviours, and these predictions are tested experimentally using representative species. In general, male swimming speeds and the difference in swimming speeds between the genders are predicted and observed to increase with increasing conflict between mate searching and feeding. It is high in ambush feeders, where searching (swimming) and feeding are mutually exclusive and low in species, where the matured males do not feed at all. Ambush feeding males alternate between stationary ambush feeding and rapid search swimming. Swimming speed and the fraction of time spent searching increase with food availability, as predicted. This response is different from the pattern in other feeding types. The swimming speeds of non-feeding males are predicted and observed to be independent of the magnitude of their energy storage and to scale with the square root of body length in contrast to the proportionality scaling in feeding copepods. Suspension feeding males may search and feed at the same time, but feeding is more efficient when hovering than when cruising. Therefore, females should mainly be hovering and males cruising, which is confirmed by observations. Differences in swimming behaviour between genders and feeding types imply different mortality rates and predict well the observed patterns in population sex ratios. Sex ratios may become so female-biased that male abundances limit population growth, demonstrating that behaviours that are optimal to the individual may be suboptimal to the population.\n      </p>", "Video observation has shown that feeding-current-producing calanoid copepods modulate their feeding currents by displaying a sequence of different swimming behaviours during a time period of up to tens of seconds. In order to understand the feeding-current modulation process, we numerically modelled the steady feeding currents for different modes of observed copepod motion behaviours (i.e. free sinking, partial sinking, hovering, vertical swimming upward and horizontal swimming backward or forward). Based on observational data, we also reproduced numerically a modulated feeding current associated with an unsteadily swimming copepod. We found that: (i) by changing its propulsive force, a copepod can switch between different swimming behaviours, leading to completely different flow-field patterns in self-generated surrounding flow; (ii) by exerting a time-varying propulsive force, a copepod can modulate temporally the basic flow modes to create an unsteady feeding current which manipulates precisely the trajectories of entrained food particles over a long time period; (iii) the modulation process may be energetically more efficient than exerting a constant propulsive force onto water to create a constant feeding current of a wider entrainment range. A probable reason is that the modulated unsteady flow entrains those water parcels containing food particles and leaves behind those without valuable food in them.\n      </p>", "There is a significant reduction in overall maximum power output of muscle at low temperatures due to reduced steady-state (i.e. maximum activation) power-generating capabilities of muscle. However, during cyclical locomotion, a further reduction in power is due to the interplay between non-steady-state contractile properties of muscle (i.e. rates of activation and relaxation) and the stimulation and the length-change pattern muscle undergoes in vivo. In particular, even though the relaxation rate of scup red muscle is slowed greatly at cold temperatures (10\u00b0C), warm-acclimated scup swim with the same stimulus duty cycles at cold as they do at warm temperature, not affording slow-relaxing muscle any additional time to relax. Hence, at 10\u00b0C, red muscle generates extremely low or negative work in most parts of the body, at all but the slowest swimming speeds. Do scup shorten their stimulation duration and increase muscle relaxation rate during cold acclimation? At 10\u00b0C, electromyography (EMG) duty cycles were 18% shorter in cold-acclimated scup than in warm-acclimated scup. But contrary to the expectations, the red muscle did not have a faster relaxation rate, rather, cold-acclimated muscle had an approximately 50% faster activation rate. By driving cold- and warm-acclimated muscle through cold- and warm-acclimated conditions, we found a very large increase in red muscle power during swimming at 10\u00b0C. As expected, reducing stimulation duration markedly increased power output. However, the increased rate of activation alone produced an even greater effect. Hence, to fully understand thermal acclimation, it is necessary to examine the whole system under realistic physiological conditions.\n      </p>", "In northern freshwater lakes, several fish species have populations composed of discrete morphs,usually involving a divergence between benthic and limnetic morphs. Although it has been suggested that swimming demand plays an important role in morphological differentiation, thus influencing habitat selection, it is unclear how it affects reaction norms, patterns in character correlation, and levels of morphological integration. We examined whether swimming demand could induce morphological plasticity in the directions expected under divergent habitat selection, and evaluated its influence on the morphological integration in Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) and brook charr (S. fontinalis), two congeneric species exhibiting conspicuous and subtle resource polymorphism, respectively. We found that changes in morphology were induced by differential swimming demands in both species. The length of the pectoral fin was the character that responded most strongly according to the predicted morphological expectations under divergent habitat selection. High levels of morphological plasticity, relatively low levels of integration, and differences found in the morphological correlation structure among water velocity treatments suggest that constraints on morphological change are unlikely in either species, thus allowing great potential for phenotypic flexibility in both species. The magnitude of character integration, however, was larger for Arctic charr than for brook charr. This latter result is discussed in the light of the differences in the level of polymorphism between the two species in the wild. The results of the present study indicate that swimming demand alone may not be sufficient to generate the polymorphism encountered in nature. Given that both diet and swimming demands can induce morphological changes, it would be important to conduct experiments targeting the interaction between the morphological modules related to trophic and swimming demands.\n      </p>", "Background. Swimmers can be exposed to high levels of trihalomethanes, byproducts of chlorination disinfection. There are no published studies on the relation between swimming and birth weight. We explored this relation in a large birth cohort, the Avon (England) Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), in 1991-1992. Methods. Information on the amount of swimming per week during the first 18-20 weeks of pregnancy was available for 11,462 pregnant women. Fifty-nine percent never swam, 31% swam up to 1 hour per week, and 10% swam for longer. We used linear regression to explore the relation between birth weight and the amount of swimming, with adjustment for gestational age, maternal age, parity, maternal education level, ethnicity, housing tenure, drug use, smoking and alcohol consumption. Results. We found little effect of the amount of swimming on birth weight. More highly educated women were more likely to swim compared with less educated women, whereas smokers were less likely to swim compared with nonsmokers. Conclusions. There appears to be no relation between the duration of swimming and birth weight.\n      </p>", "Swimming pools have become an integral part of habitable coastal construction. These pools frequently increase the turbulance of floodwater during a tropical storm or hurricane. This results in an increase in the scour potential under and around swimming pools. This paper demonstrates that a suitable scour model for seawalls from literature is applicable to coastal swimming pools, including over-topping and corner effects. The model predicts substantial scour around pools for typical storm waves and water levels. Optimum sizing and siting for coastal swimming pools are also discussed.\n      </p>", "1. The cost of reproduction due to limiting of the reproductive female's locomotion capability has been suggested many times, but has rarely been directly examined, especially in fishes. Here, the effect of pregnancy on swimming performance in the viviparous Mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, was studied. 2. Eight females of G. affinis were isolated, each in a separate aquarium, and critical swimming speed (Ucrit), body mass (BM) and cross-section area were measured every 5 days from the beginning of the pregnancy until 2-4 days after parturition. 3. Swimming kinematics (tail beat frequency and amplitude) was measured in nonpregnant and pregnant females at different swimming speeds. 4. BM increased during pregnancy from 0\u00b747 \u00b1 0\u00b713 g to 0\u00b772 \u00b1 0\u00b719 g, and the cross-section area also increased during pregnancy from 0\u00b7 21\u00b1 0\u00b7 06 cm2 to 0\u00b7 32\u00b1 0\u00b7 07 cm2. Ucrit decreased from 25\u00b7 0\u00b1 1\u00b7 3 cm s-1 before pregnancy to 20\u00b7 1\u00b1 1\u00b7 5 cm s-1 just before parturition, and returned to 24\u00b7 7\u00b1 1\u00b7 4 cm s-1 2-4 days after parturition. Interindividual variation was repeatable and reflects real differences among individuals. 5. Swimming kinematics was not affected by pregnancy. 6. The results suggest that reductions in Ucrit are probably because of aerobic constraints and not necessarily due to hydrodynamic changes resulting from changing in body form or plasticity. Moreover, the reduction in Ucrit is, potentially, a 'cost of reproduction' owing to decrease in the ability to gain food during pregnancy in G. affinis females.\n      </p>", "Some Bosmina water flea species develop morphological antipredatory defenses, such as long antennules and a high carapace, but in Bosmina (Eubosmina) coregoni gibbera these traits are larger and more variable in females than in males. Here we propose that this sexual dimorphism derives from differential costs of hydrodynamic drag and selection for mobility in males. We tested this hypothesis by estimating drag of several Bosmina morphologies by using scale models sinking in glycerin of different concentrations and viscosities. Body forms included males, sexual and asexual females of B. c. gibbera, and males and asexual females of Bosmina (Eubosmina) longispina, a taxon with less variable body shape. For a given body length or body volume, male models had lower drag than models of sexual and asexual females, suggesting that males can swim 14-28% faster with the same energy consumption. Consistent with this conclusion, video recordings showed that males of B. c. gibbera advanced 55-73% farther than females in each swimming stroke. We conclude that hydrodynamic drag may have significant implications for swimming and evolution of sexual dimorphism in water fleas, and we suggest that males lack the defensive structures of females of B. c. gibbera (e.g., high carapaces) because competition over mates favors low drag.\n      </p>", "Objectives: Chlorination destroys pathogens in swimming pool water, but by-products of chlorination can cause human illness. We investigated outbreaks of ocular and respiratory symptoms associated with chlorinated indoor swimming pools at two hotels. Measurements: We interviewed registered guests and companions who stayed at hotels X and Y within 2 days of outbreak onset. We performed bivariate and stratified analyses, calculated relative risks (RR), and conducted environmental investigations of indoor pool areas. Results: Of 77 guests at hotel X, 47 (61%) completed questionnaires. Among persons exposed to the indoor pool area, 22 (71%) of 31 developed ocular symptoms [RR = 24; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.5-370], and 14 (45%) developed respiratory symptoms (RR = 6.8; 95% CI, 1.0-47) with a median duration of 10 hr (0.25-24 hr). We interviewed 30 (39%) of 77 registered persons and 59 unregistered companions at hotel Y. Among persons exposed to the indoor pool area, 41 (59%) of 69 developed ocular symptoms (RR = 24; 95% CI, 1.5-370), and 28 (41%) developed respiratory symptoms (RR = 17; 95% CI, 1.1-260) with a median duration of 2.5 hr (2 min-14 days). Four persons sought medical care. During the outbreak, the hotel X's ventilation system malfunctioned. Appropriate water and air samples were not available for laboratory analysis. Conclusions and Relevance to Professional Practice: Indoor pool areas were associated with illness in these outbreaks. A large proportion of bathers were affected; symptoms were consistent with chloramine exposure and were sometimes severe. Improved staff training, pool maintenance, and pool area ventilation could prevent future outbreaks.\n      </p>", "There is strong evidence that genetic capacity for growth evolves toward an optimum rather than an absolute maximum. This implies that fast growth has a cost and that trade-offs occur between growth and other life-history traits, but the fundamental mechanisms are poorly understood. Previous work on the Atlantic silverside fish Menidia menidia has demonstrated a trade-off between growth and swimming performance. We hypothesize that the trade-off derives from the competing metabolic demands associated with growth and swimming activity. We tested this by measuring standard metabolic rate $(M_{STD})$ , maximum sustainable metabolic rate $(M_{ACT})$ and metabolic scope of laboratory-reared silversides originating from two geographically distinct populations with well-documented differences in genetic capacity for growth. The fast-growth genotype had a significantly greater $M_{STD}$ than the slow-growth genotype, but a similar $M_{ACT}$ when swum to near exhaustion. The scope for activity of the fast-growth genotype was lower than that of the slow-growth genotype. Furthermore, the fast-growth genotype eats larger meals, thereby incurring a greater postprandial oxygen demand. We conclude that a metabolic trade-off occurs between growth and other metabolic demands and that this trade-off provides a general mechanism underlying the evolution of growth rate.\n      </p>", "Planktonic cercariae (parasite larvae) of digenetic flatworms (Himasthla rhigedana) encyst up to 100% of intermediate host populations. Toward explaining such high prevalence, larval behavior and passive-transport processes were evaluated experimentally for their roles in waterborne parasite transmission. Using a new application of laser and digital video imaging technologies, we quantified cercarial movements in still water and in simulated field flows. In still water, downward swimming in response to light, irrespective of intensity or source, and gravity brought larvae to the bottom three-times faster than gravitational sinking alone. A 33% elevation in temperature (18-24\u26ac C) caused a 71% increase in swim speed. In flume flows characteristic of southern California salt marshes (u* = 0.2 cm/s, occurring &gt;80% of the time), vertical larval distributions were highly bottom skewed. The mean downward swim speed (0.59 cm/s at 24\u26ac C) was three times faster than turbulent fluctuations (w' = 0.23 cm/s), indicating that cercariae overpowered eddies to reach the bed. When flume flows simulated rare storm events (u* = 0.8 cm/s, w' = 0.95 cm/s, occurring \u2264 1% of the time), turbulence overwhelmed behavioral effects and homogeneously mixed larvae throughout the water column. Environmentally triggered downward swimming can thus quickly bring larvae to the bed, promoting contact with benthic intermediate hosts (snails and crabs) under most flow conditions. The efficacy of vertical swimming in typical marsh flows identifies larval behavior, not passive transport, as the principal mechanism responsible for dispersal to host habitat.\n      </p>", "When a fish swims in water, muscle contraction, controlled by the nervous system, interacts with the body tissues and the surrounding fluid to yield the observed movement pattern of the body. A continuous dynamic beam model describing the bending moment balance on the body for such an interaction during swimming has been established. In the model a linear visco-elastic assumption is made for the passive behaviour of internal tissues, skin and backbone, and the unsteady fluid force acting on the swimming body is calculated by the 3D waving plate theory. The body bending moment distribution due to the various components, in isolation and acting together, is analysed. The analysis is based on the saithe (Pollachius virens), a carangiform swimmer. The fluid reaction needs a bending moment of increasing amplitude towards the tail and near-standing wave behaviour on the rear-half of the body. The inertial movement of the fish results from a wave of bending moment with increasing amplitude along the body and a higher propagation speed than that of body bending. In particular, the fluid reaction, mainly designed for propulsion, can provide a considerable force to balance the local momentum change of the body and thereby reduce the power required from the muscle. The wave of passive visco-elastic bending moment, with an amplitude distribution peaking a little before the mid-point of the fish, travels with a speed close to that of body bending. The calculated muscle bending moment from the whole dynamic system has a wave speed almost the same as that observed for electromyogram-onset and a starting instant close to that of muscle activation, suggesting a consistent matching between the muscle activation pattern and the dynamic response of the system in steady swimming. A faster wave of muscle activation, with a variable phase relation between the strain and activation cycle, appears to be designed to fit the fluid reaction and, to a lesser extent, the body inertia, and is limited by the passive internal tissues. Higher active stress is required from caudal muscle, as predicted from experimental studies on fish muscle. In general, the active force development by muscle does not coincide with the propulsive force generation on the tail. The stiffer backbone may play a role in transmitting force and deformation to maintain and adjust the movement of the body and tail in water.\n      </p>", "A prolonged swimming trial is the most common approach in studying steady-state changes in oxygen uptake, cardiac output and tissue oxygen extraction as a function of swimming speed in salmonids. The data generated by these sorts of studies are used here to support the idea that a maximum oxygen uptake is reached during a critical swimming speed test. Maximum oxygen uptake has a temperature optimum. Potential explanations are advanced to explain why maximum aerobic performance falls off at high temperature. The valuable information provided by critical swimming tests can be confounded by non-steady-state swimming behaviours, which typically occur with increasing frequency as salmonids approach fatigue. Two major concerns are noted. Foremost, measurements of oxygen uptake during swimming can considerably understimate the true cost of transport near critical swimming speed, apparently in a temperature-dependent manner. Second, based on a comparison with voluntary swimming ascents in a raceway, forced swimming trials in a swim tunnel respirometer may underestimate critical swimming speed, possibly because fish in a swim tunnel respirometer are unable to sustain a ground speed.\n      </p>", "We observed a group of 18 wood bison, of mixed sex and age classes, swimming across a 1.7 km wide section of the Liard River on 16 July 2002. Water levels and flow rates were above the long-term average for that time of year, and there was a river current of 14-16 km/h. The animals took at least 27 minutes to negotiate their 3.6 km swim. Younger animals were able to keep more of their head and body above the water level than older mature males. Calves of the year, observed swimming across a secondary channel of the river on 15 July 2003, had only their heads above water. Bison are capable of swimming across lakes and rivers (Wood Buffalo National Park, Yellowstone National Park), but well-documented cases of bison navigating rapidly flowing northern rivers are rare. Open-water crossings of the Liard River are important to the ecology of the Nahanni wood bison population, especially since seismic activity in the Liard River Valley is likely to increase. /// Le 16 juillet 2002, on a observ\u00e9 un groupe de 18 bisons des bois, des deux sexes et de groupes d'\u00e2ge divers, traversant \u00e0 la nage une section de la rivi\u00e8re Liard large de 1,7 km.

Past studies on phenotypic plasticity usually focus on ultimate (evolutionary) issues. More recently, proximate (developmental) factors explaining how plasticity is achieved are starting to be addressed. 2. Here, we examine the importance of resource level and temperature on growth rate and burst swimming speed in tadpoles of Spea hammondii (Western Spadefoot Toad). 3. Food and temperature manipulations alter growth rate via different developmental processes (cell growth and cell recruitment, respectively) and these processes appear to have consequences for swimming performance in tadpoles. 4. Tadpoles reared at warm temperatures were slower swimmers than those reared at cooler temperatures while food level had no effect on size-specific burst speed. Tadpoles reared at warm temperatures also had more fibres in the tail muscle, probably due to an earlier onset of recruitment. Tadpoles reared at higher food levels had larger muscle fibres, but little differences in fibre number compared to those reared at low food levels. 5. These results indicate that growth by adding cells comes at a performance cost not seen when growth is due to increasing cell size. This developmental difference also has implications for how body size manipulations are carried out in behavioural and ecological studies.\n      </p>", "Fossorial lizards differ in morphology from their surface-dwelling relatives. The Australian sphenomorphine skink genus Ctenotus consists of surface-dwelling species, and is closely related to the genus Lerista, which includes both surface-dwelling and fossorial species. Sand-swimming represents the derived condition and has evolved independently in several lineages of Lerista. The heads of lizards in the two genera differ in shape (blunt snout for Ctenotus versus wedge-shaped for Lerista) and in length relative to the body (approximately 20% of snout-vent length for Ctenotus versus 12% for sand-swimming Lerista). Do these specializations affect the sizes or types of prey that can be consumed by Lerista? We compared prey-handling by Ctenotus and Lerista to correlate morphological differences with differences in prey-handling ability, and to distinguish the effects of snout shape and head length. Feeding trials included three categories of insect prey that the lizards normally eat: soft-bodied larvae (Lepidoptera), hard-bodied larvae (Coleoptera), and roaches (Blatoidea). In comparisons based on the mass of a prey item relative to the mass of a lizard, Lerista had longer handling times for all prey categories and were limited to smaller prey than were Ctenotus. However, when comparisons were based on the length of prey relative to the length of a lizard's head, Lerista ate some elongate prey as fast or faster than did Ctenotus, and both genera successfully swallowed prey more than twice the length of their own head. Thus, the differences in prey-handling performance of Ctenotus and Lerista probably result from the fact that Lerista have a relatively shorter head than Ctenotus. All Lerista species, surface-dwelling and fossorial, have short heads compared to primitive sphenomorphine lizards. Fossorial species of Lerista have elongate trunks, and consequently their heads are shorter in proportion to trunk length than those of surface-dwelling Lerista. However, most fossorial species of Lerista are longer and heavier than any of their surface-dwelling congeners, and the heads of these fossorial species are large relative to the prey they encounter. As a consequence, the diets of large fossorial species of Lerista do not appear to be limited by their morphological specialization for sand-swimming.\n      </p>", "Fishes swim by flapping their tail and other fins. Other sea creatures, such as squid and salps, eject fluid intermittently as a jet. We discuss the fluid mechanics behind these propulsion mechanisms and show that these animals produce optimal vortex rings, which give the maximum thrust for a given energy input. We show that fishes optimize both their steady swimming efficiency and their ability to accelerate and turn by producing an individual optimal ring with each flap of the tail or fin. Salps produce vortex rings directly by ejecting a volume of fluid through a rear orifice, and these are also optimal. An important implication of this paper is that the repetition of vortex production is not necessary for an individual vortex to have the 'optimal' characteristics.\n      </p>", "In the isopod crustaceans Idotea wosnesenskii and I. resecata, the first three pairs of abdominal appendages (pleopods) are locomotory, and the remaining two pairs are respiratory. We investigated the mechanical and morphometric properties of the pleopods in order to study constraints that may influence this division of labor. Measurements of the flexural (bending) stiffness of the pleopods demonstrated that the podites of the first and second pairs of pleopods were generally an order of magnitude stiffer than the fourth and fifth pleopods; the third pleopods were variable in stiffness. Anterior pleopods tend to be slightly thicker and have thicker cuticles, but these morphological differences do not entirely account for differences in flexural stiffness among pleopods; there must also be differences in modulus of elasticity (E\u0332). Estimates of E\u0332 based on these stiffness data yield values in the middle of the range typical of arthropod cuticles. The differences in cuticle thickness and material properties between the anterior and posterior pleopods may help explain why the swimming pleopods do not make a significant contribution to gas exchange.\n      </p>", "The distance over which propagules can successfully colonize new sites depends on processes that increase the time they remain competent while being dispersed. As do feeding larvae, algal spores can contribute to their own nutrition (via photosynthesis) during dispersal. We explored the dispersal potential of the kelps Macrocystis pyrifera and Pterygophora californica in laboratory experiments by examining (1) how long their spores can swim, (2) the contribution of energy derived from photosynthesis to spore swimming duration, and (3) the ability of spores to germinate and attach after they stop swimming. Results indicate that under photosynthetically saturating irradiance no spores of either species can swim longer than 120 h; &lt;10% of the spores were still swimming after 72 h. When placed in the dark, spores did not swim longer than 72 h; &lt;10% remained swimming after 48 h. More importantly, spores did not die after they stopped swimming; most germinated in the water column and retained their capacity to produce viable sporophyte recruits. The ability of spores to attach after they stopped swimming differed between the two species; settlement density declined in Macrocystis and increased in Pterygophora. Thus, the viable planktonic stage of these algae is not necessarily restricted to the spore but may include later life history stages. These results provide biological evidence that the spores and germlings of these kelps can remain competent in the plankton for extended periods of time, which is consistent with our previous findings that their dispersal can occur over greater distances than previously thought possible.\n      </p>", "1. Although the repeatability of a trait is of interest for several reasons, few studies have critically examined the repeatability or correlation of metrics of swimming performance. We quantifiee repeatability of three swimming performances (burst speed during c-start escape response, critical swimmimg speet &lt;tex-math&gt;$[U_{crit} ]$&lt;/tex-math&gt; maximum speed &lt;tex-math&gt;$[U_{\\max } ]$&lt;/tex-math&gt;,and size/shape measures over short (within-day), medium (days and weeks), and long (more than a year) time-scales in a small poeciliid fish, the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata). 2. We found that individuai differences in most swimming performance metrics were repeatable on various time-scales. Burst speed during c-start was repeatable within a day, as well as over days and weeks, but it was not repeatable over the span of a year. However, th\u00e8 medium term repeatability was only statistically significant when accounting for the variation of individuals within a day and correcting for attenuation. &lt;tex-math&gt;$U_{crit} $&lt;/tex-math&gt;, &lt;tex-math&gt;$U_{\\max} $&lt;/tex-math&gt; and size were repeatable on medium time-scales, but only size and &lt;tex-math&gt;$U_{\\max} $&lt;/tex-math&gt; were repeatable over the span of a year. Our index of shape was not statistically repeatable over any time-scales. 3. When examining the corr\u00e9lations of performances and size, only a few traits were related to each other. &lt;tex-math&gt;$U_{crit} $&lt;/tex-math&gt; and &lt;tex-math&gt;$U_{\\max} $&lt;/tex-math&gt; were significanti positively related to each other for trial 1 only, but not any of the others. &lt;tex-math&gt;$U_{\\max} $&lt;/tex-math&gt; and the mean c-start burst speed were correlated on trial 2 only. No other traits were significantly related to each other, and no performance traits were related to size or shape. &lt;tex-math&gt;$U_{crit} $&lt;/tex-math&gt; and &lt;tex-math&gt;$U_{\\max} $&lt;/tex-math&gt; also did not differ in their overall mean values, suggesting that &lt;tex-math&gt;$U_{\\max} $&lt;/tex-math&gt;, a more recently described assessment of fish swimming performance, may be a reliable alternative. 4. Ail traits, except our index of shape, shifted in their mean value over th\u00e8 span of a year. &lt;tex-math&gt;$U_{crit} $&lt;/tex-math&gt; and c-start burst speed decreased significantly, consistent with previous findings on the effects of s\u00e9nescence on neuromuscular Systems. However, &lt;tex-math&gt;$U_{\\max} $&lt;/tex-math&gt; and size increased significantly over a year. 5. The measures of swimming performance used in this study are becoming widely used in ecological and evolutionary studies. Our results suggest that individuai differences in these measures are relatively stable on various time-scales. We found no significant relation of these performance metrics with body size or a simple index of shape, and few relations among the performance measures, suggesting that they measure different aspects of locomotor physiology and/or motivation under the test conditions used. Finally, while &lt;tex-math&gt;$U_{crit} $&lt;/tex-math&gt; and c-start burst speed decreased over the span of the year, consistent with theories of senescence, &lt;tex-math&gt;$U_{\\max} $&lt;/tex-math&gt; significantly increased over a year, suggesting that further studies of this recently described performance metric are needed.\n      </p>", "Mammals re-entered the oceans less than 60 million years ago. The transition from a terrestrial to an aquatic lifestyle required extreme morphological and behavioural modifications concomitant with fundamentally different locomotor mechanisms for moving on land and through water. Energetic transport costs typically reflect such different locomotor modes, but can not be discerned from the fossil record. In this study the energetic challenges associated with changing from terrestrial to aquatic locomotion in primitive marine mammals are examined by comparing the transport, maintenance and locomotor costs of extant mammals varying in degree of aquatic specialization. The results indicate that running and swimming specialists have converged on an energetic optimum for locomotion. An allometric expression, COT&lt;sub&gt;TOT&lt;/sub&gt;=7.79 mass&lt;sup&gt;-0.29&lt;/sup&gt; (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0.83, n=6 species), describes the total cost of transport in J kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for swimming marine mammals ranging in size from 21 kg to 15 000 kg. This relation is indistinguishable from that describing total transport costs in running mammals. In contrast, the transitional lifestyle of semi-aquatic mammals, similar to that of ancestral marine mammals, incurs costs that are 2.4-5.1 times higher than locomotor specialists. These patterns suggest that primitive marine mammals confronted an energetic hurdle before returning to costs reminiscent of their terrestrial ancestry, and may have reached an evolutionary limit for energetic optimization during swimming.\n      </p>", "Species evolve in response to the abiotic and biotic interactions they experience in a community, and so studying the adaptation of species in a community context is a necessary component for understanding the development of community structure. Previous studies have suggested that Enallagma damselflies (Odonata: Coenagrionidae) invaded aquatic habitats with large dragonflies as the top predators at least twice, and large changes in morphological structures (e.g., caudal lamellae and abdomen), which should increase swimming speed, are associated with these invasions. This is significant because these species swim away from attacking predators, whereas species in the ancestral habitat (habitats with fish as the top predators) do not swim from attacking predators. We quantified swimming speed over a large ontogenetic size range for larvae of seven Enallagma species, two in dragonfly lakes and five in fish lakes. Results of analysis of covariance and a modification of Felsenstein's method of evolutionary contrasts indicate that a large evolutionary increase in the slope of the ontogenetic relationship between swimming speed and loge(body length) is associated with invasions into dragonfly lakes, and this shift results in larvae of dragonfly-lake species being faster swimmers, especially in larger size classes than larvae of fish-lake species. We also present experimental results demonstrating that damselflies with larger lamellae are faster swimmers and have higher survival when exposed to dragonfly predation. The results of this study indicate that the change in selective environment associated with habitat shifts into dragonfly lakes promoted adaptations for increased swimming speed in Enallagma lineages. The potential ramifications of this adaptation for community structure are discussed.\n      </p>", "Objectives\u2014To measure the levels of exposure to nitrogen trichloride (NCl3) in the atmosphere of indoor swimming pools and to examine how they relate to irritant and chronic respiratory symptoms, indices of pulmonary function, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine in lifeguards working in the pools. Method\u2014334 lifeguards (256 men; 78 women) recruited from 46 public swimming pools (n=228) and 17 leisure centre swimming pools (n=106) were examined. Concentrations of NCl3 were measured with area samplers. Symptoms were assessed by questionnaire and methacholine bronchial challenge (MBC) test by an abbreviated method. Subjects were labelled MBC+ if forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) fell by \u226520%. The linear dose-response slope was calculated as the percentage fall in FEV1 at the last dose divided by the total dose given. Results\u20141262 samples were taken in the 63 pools. Mean NCl3 concentrations were greater in leisure than in public pools. A significant concentration-response relation was found between irritant eye, nasal, and throat symptoms\u2014but not chronic respiratory symptoms\u2014and exposure concentrations. Among women, the prevalence of MBC+ was twice as great as in men. Overall, no relation was found between bronchial hyperresponsiveness and exposure. Conclusions\u2014The data show that lifeguards exposed to NCl3 in indoor swimming pools are at risk of developing irritant eye, nasal, and throat symptoms. Exposure to NCl3 does not seem to carry the risk of developing permanent bronchial hyperresponsiveness, but this association might have been influenced by self selection. The possibility that subjects exposed to NCl3 are at risk of developing transient bronchial hyperresponsiveness cannot be confidently ruled out.\n      </p>", "This article examines the unspoken rules, routines, and rituals of the swimming pool, using ideas from negotiated order theory, Foucault, Goffman's dramaturgical theory, and symbolic interactionism. It identifies three sets of social norms: respect for personal space, respect for individuals' disciplinary regimes, and the desexualization of encounters. I show how these rules are (normally) followed or (occasionally) breached through various rituals, and examine the consequences for interaction order. The tale of \"The Emperor's New Clothes\" is used analogously to explain why actors cannot consciously attend to their precarious construction of reality, yet remain poised to defend it.\n      </p>", "Previous studies have shown that two or three lineages of Enallagma damselflies, which historically coexisted with fish, recently invaded and adapted to living with large dragonfly predators in fishless waters. In adapting to live with these new predators, lineages shifted behaviorally to using swimming as an evasive tactic against attacking predators, evolved morphological features that made them faster swimmers, and evolved biochemical features to increase refueling strenuous activities like swimming. However, these habitat shifts have occurred in only one of the two primary clades within the genus in North America. Here, I show that clade-level differences exist among species in the ancestral, fish-lake habitat that should make habitat shifts easier to accomplish in the clade in which they have occurred. Specifically, fish-lake species in the clade in which habitat shifts occurred have much higher propensities to swim in the laboratory, swim faster when they do swim, and have higher mass-specific activities for arginine kinase than do species in the other primary clade, in which no extant species are found in fishless waters. These results are discussed in the context of the dynamics of founder events and the potential implications for community structure.\n      </p>", "Tadpoles of Hyla gratiosa, Rana catesbeiana and R. utricularia accumulated little lactate during 30 s of intense swimming from 4-27 C in the laboratory or in the field. Their anaerobic scopes are therefore considerably lower than those of adult anurans. Concentrations of lactate and pyruvate in R. catesbeiana tails also changed little with 30 s of burst swimming at 23 C, but phosphocreatine was completely depleted by this activity. Our results are consistent with the view that the hydrolysis of phosphocreatine and not anaerobic glycolysis yields most of the energy utilized during intense, short-term swimming in anuran larvae. The immobility that anuran larvae often exhibit after a predator attack may result from depletion of phosphagen stores and a limited ability to synthesize ATP by glycolysis.\n      </p>", "The reasons Lutreolina crassicaudata is always captured in close proximity to water are not clear. We investigated locomotory behavior and performance in swimming, running, climbing, and jumping of L. crassicaudata. One adult male was videotaped in the laboratory while swimming, walking on the ground and on a horizontal tube 1.2 m from the ground, climbing a tree trunk angled 45\u00b0, and jumping gaps between supports. The locomotor cycles in these different activities were described by speed, stride length, stroke or stride frequency, time of power and recovery phases or stance and swing phases, and by displacement of points on the animal. L. crassicaudata employed a quadruped paddling gait in swimming. Swimming speed was similar to that of terrestrial didelphids, but stroke frequency and buoyancy ability were more similar to those of the water opossum. Different gaits were used for locomotion in each habitat type and we conclude that L. crassicaudata cannot be considered a specialized species for aquatic locomotion.\n      </p>", "We describe behavioural changes in two generations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of perchlorate. The first generation $(G_{0,2002} )$ was exposed as two-year-old adults to perchlorate in experimental groups ranging in concentration from less than the method detection limit (&lt;1.1 ppb) to 18.6 ppm for up to 22 days during their courtship, spawning, egg guarding, and first five days of fry guarding. No differences were noted in the behaviour or reproductive output of these fish that were exposed as adults. However, perchlorate exposure throughout development caused widespread effects in the second generation $(G_{1,2003} )$ which was spawned and raised through sexual maturity in one of four nominal experimental groups (0, 30 and 100 ppm, and a 'variable' treatment that progressively increased from &lt; 1.1 ppb to approximately 60 ppm perchlorate). Dose-dependent effects were found during the $(G_{1,2003} )$ swimming and behavioural evaluations, including higher mortality rates among treated fish following stressful events. Perchlorate-exposed fish had higher failure rates during swimming trials and failed at lower flow rates than control fish. A number of treated fish exhibited seizures. Progressively fewer males completed benchmark metrics, such as nest building, spawning, nursery formation, or fry production, in a dose-dependent manner. Fewer males from higher treatments courted females, and those that did initiated courtship later and had a reduced behavioural repertoire compared to fish from lower treatments. The lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) for swimming performance, reproductive behaviour, survivorship and recruitment was 30 ppm perchlorate (our lowest $G_{1,2003} $ treatment), and near complete inhibition of reproductive activity was noted among males raised in 100 ppm perchlorate. A small number of treated $G_{1,2003} $ females were isolated in aquaria, and some performed reproductive behaviour typical of males, such as biting, leading and zig-zagging in the presence of gravid females. These findings have profound implications for recruitment in wild fish populations exposed to perchlorate, and suggest that perchlorate may disrupt behaviour in other vertebrates as well.\n      </p>", "Although movement of individuals has important consequences on population dynamics and various ecological interactions, it is often difficult to quantify fully. We investigated the temporal variation in the number of the amphipod Corophium volutator swimming in the water column during periods of immersion over an intertidal mudflat in the Bay of Fundy, Canada, in spring-summer 2006. Swimming is an important mode of dispersal, since the number of swimming amphipods can peak at over 30,000 individuals within a 20-cm-diameter, stationary plankton net over a period of immersion of \u223c4 h. Amphipods swim throughout spring-summer, but abundance in the water column is less in May than in the other months. As well, amphipods swim during the day and night, but the number swimming shows periodicity in relation to diel time of high tide, with peaks when high tides occur around 1:45 am. Finally, the number of amphipods swimming shows periodicity in relation to lunar cycles, with peaks around the time of new moon and full moon. We developed a statistical model describing the swimming activity of C. volutator based on month, diel time of high tide, and day of the lunar calendar. The model accurately predicts the timing of peaks, but does not predict well the amplitude of the highest peaks. Overall, the model gives a very good approximation of the number of swimmers (61% of the variation is explained) and provides a strong basis for future modeling of spatial population dynamics of C. volutator.\n      </p>", "Objectives: Recent studies have explored the potential for swimming pool disinfection by-products (DBPs), which are respiratory irritants, to cause asthma in young children. Here we describe the state of the science on methods for understanding children's exposure to DBPs and biologics at swimming pools and associations with new-onset childhood asthma and recommend a research agenda to improve our understanding of this issue. Data sources: A workshop was held in Leuven, Belgium, 21-23 August 2007, to evaluate the literature and to develop a research agenda to better understand children's exposures in the swimming pool environment and their potential associations with new-onset asthma. Participants, including clinicians, epidemiologists, exposure scientists, pool operations experts, and chemists, reviewed the literature, prepared background summaries, and held extensive discussions on the relevant published studies, knowledge of asthma characterization and exposures at swimming pools, and epidemiologic study designs. Synthesis: Childhood swimming and new-onset childhood asthma have clear implications for public health. If attendance at indoor pools increases risk of childhood asthma, then concerns are warranted and action is necessary. If there is no such relationship, these concerns could unnecessarily deter children from indoor swimming and/or compromise water disinfection. Conclusions: Current evidence of an association between childhood swimming and new-onset asthma is suggestive but not conclusive. Important data gaps need to be filled, particularly in exposure assessment and characterization of asthma in the very young. Participants recommended that additional evaluations using a multidisciplinary approach are needed to determine whether a clear association exists.\n      </p>", "Loggerhead turtle hatchlings in laboratory tanks had a sustained swimming speed of approximately 20 cm/sec at temperatures between 25.6 and 28.9 C. Test temperatures of 30.0 and 33.0 C significantly reduced this speed. The swimming speed of hatchlings exposed to fluctuating temperatures varied with the temperature. A temperature of 33.0 C eliminated phototactic orientation.\n      </p>", "Standard methods to measure recreational water quality require at least 24 hr to obtain results, making it impossible to assess the quality of water within a single day. Methods to measure recreational water quality in \u2264 2 hr have been developed. Application of rapid methods could give considerably more accurate and timely assessments of recreational water quality. We conducted a prospective study of beachgoers at two Great Lakes beaches to examine the association between recreational water quality, obtained using rapid methods, and gastrointestinal (GI) illness after swimming. Beachgoers were asked about swimming and other beach activities and 10-12 days later were asked about the occurrence of GI symptoms. We tested water samples for Enterococcus and Bacteroides species using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. We observed significant trends between increased GI illness and Enterococcus at the Lake Michigan beach and a positive trend for Enterococcus at the Lake Erie beach. The association remained significant for Enterococcus when the two beaches were combined. We observed a positive trend for Bacteroides at the Lake Erie beach, but no trend was observed at the Lake Michigan beach. Enterococcus samples collected at 0800 hr were predictive of GI illness that day. The association between Enterococcus and illness strengthened as time spent swimming in the water increased. This is the first study to show that water quality measured by rapid methods can predict swimming-associated health effects.\n      </p>", "Latitudinal populations of the Atlantic silverside, Menidia menidia, show substantial genetic variation in rates of energy acquistion and allocation. Reared in common environments, silversides from northern latitudes consume more food, grow faster and more efficiently, store more energy, and produce greater quantities of eggs than their southern conspecifics. The persistence of seemingly inferior southern genotypes in the face of ostensibly superior northern genotypes suggest that there are hidden evolutionary trade-offs associated with these elevated acquisition and allocation rates. We tested the hypothesis that rapid growth and high levels of food consumption trade-off against locomotory performance in M. menidia. We compared both aerobic (prolonged and endurance) and anaerobic (burst) swimming capacities between intrinsically fast-growing fish from the north (Nova Scotia, NS) and intrinsically slow-growing fish from the south (South Carolina, SC) and between growth-manipulated phenotypes within each population. We also compared swimming speeds and endurance between fasted and recently fed fish within populations. Maximum prolonged and burst swimming speeds of NS fish were significantly lower than those of SC fish, and swimming speeds of fast-growing phenotypes were lower than those of slow-growing phenotypes within populations. Fed fish had lower burst speeds and less endurance than fasted fish from the same population. Thus, high rates of growth and the consumption of large meals clearly diminish swimming performance, which likely increases vulnerability to predation and decreases survival and relative fitness. The submaximal growth rate of southern M. menidia appears to be adaptive, resulting from balancing selection on rates of somatic growth.\n      </p>", "The kinematics and hydrodynamics of routine linear accelerations were studied in American eels, Anguilla rostrata, using high-speed video and particle image velocimetry. Eels were examined both during steady swimming at speeds from 0.6 to 1.9 body lengths (L) per second and during accelerations from -1.4 to $1.3 L s^{-2}$ . Multiple regression of the acceleration and steady swimming speed on the body kinematics suggests that eels primarily change their tail-tip velocity during acceleration. By contrast, the best predictor of steady swimming speed is body wave speed, keeping tail-tip velocity an approximately constant fraction of the swimming velocity. Thus, during steady swimming, Strouhal number does not vary with speed, remaining close to 0.32, but during acceleration, it deviates from the steady value. The kinematic changes during acceleration are indicated hydrodynamically by axial fluid momentum in the wake. During steady swimming, the wake consists of lateral jets of fluid and has minimal net axial momentum, which reflects a balance between thrust and drag. During acceleration, those jets rotate to point downstream, adding axial momentum to the fluid. The amount of added momentum correlates with the acceleration, but is greater than the necessary inertial force by $2.8 \\pm 0.6 times$ , indicating a substantial acceleration reaction.\n      </p>", "Airway irritants such as ozone are known to impair lung function and induce airway inflammation. Clara cell protein (CC16) is a small anti-inflammatory protein secreted by the nonciliated bronchiolar Clara cells. CC16 in serum has been proposed as a noninvasive and sensitive marker of lung epithelial injury. In this study, we used lung function and serum CC16 concentration to examine the pulmonary responses to ambient O3 exposure and swimming pool attendance. The measurements were made on 57 children 10-11 years of age before and after outdoor exercise for 2 hr. Individual O3 exposure was estimated as the total exposure dose between 0700 hr until the second blood sample was obtained (mean O3 concentration/ m3\u00d7 hours). The maximal 1-hr value was 118 \u03bc g/ m3 (59 ppb), and the individual exposure dose ranged between 352 and 914 \u03bc g/ m3 hr. These O3 levels did not cause any significant changes in mean serum CC16 concentrations before or after outdoor exercise, nor was any decrease in lung function detected. However, children who regularly visited chlorinated indoor swimming pools had significantly lower CC16 levels in serum than did nonswimming children both before and after exercise (respectively, 57 \u00b1 2.4 and 53 \u00b1 1.7 \u03bcg/L vs. 8.2 \u00b1 2.8 and 8.0 \u00b1 2.6 \u03bcg/L; p &lt; 0.002). These results indicate that repeated exposure to chlorination by-products in the air of indoor swimming pools has adverse effects on the Clara cell function in children. A possible relation between such damage to Clara cells and pulmonary morbidity (e.g., asthma) should be further investigated.\n      </p>", "Drag forces acting on the body (parasite drag) of a Humboldt penguin (Spheniscus humboldti) were determined by towing a cast of a wingless carcass. On the surface $D_{p-sur} = 2.27 U_{o}^{2.55}$ ($D_{p-sur}$ = parasite drag on the surface, N; $U_{o}$ = towing speed, m s\u207b\u00b9) and submerged $D_{pm-sub} = 1.48 U_{o}^{2.0}$ ($D_{pm-sub}$ = parasite drag for submerged model). The minimum drag coefficient, 1.1 x 10\u207b\u00b2, approximates that of a live macaroni penguin (Eudyptes chrysolophus) but is higher than that of a streamlined form with the same diameter:length ratio. The wingbeat was analyzed using high-speed film of submerged swimming Humboldt penguins. Wing data and parasite-drag data were used to compute the lift, thrust, and drag forces of a swimming penguin. Wingbeat thrust was computed using both blade element analysis (which required wind tunnel tests on penguin wing models) and lifting surface theory. Blade element analysis gave remarkably more reasonable results, which were used for subsequent computations. Total thrust ($T_{T}$) from the wings is equivalent to total drag ($D_{T}$) of a Humboldt swimming submerged and has the estimated relationship to swimming speed ($U_{b}$) Of $D_{T}$ = $T_{T} = 2.68 U_{b}^{2.0}$\n      </p>", "The empirical study of natural selection reveals that adaptations often involve trade\u2010offs between competing functions. Because natural selection acts on whole organisms rather than isolated traits, adaptive evolution may be constrained by the interaction between traits that are functionally integrated. Yet, few attempts have been made to characterize how and when such constraints are manifested or whether they limit the adaptive divergence of populations. Here we examine the consequences of adaptive life\u2010history evolution on locomotor performance in the live\u2010bearing guppy. In response to increased predation from piscivorous fish, Trinidadian guppies evolve an increased allocation of resources toward reproduction. These populations are also under strong selection for rapid fast\u2010start swimming performance to evade predators. Because embryo development increases a female\u2019s wet mass as she approaches parturition, an increased investment in reproductive allocation should impede fast\u2010start performance. We find evidence for adaptive but constrained evolution of fast\u2010start swimming performance in laboratory trials conducted on second\u2010generation lab\u2010reared fish. Female guppies from high\u2010predation localities attain a faster acceleration and velocity and travel a greater distance during fast\u2010start swimming trials. However, velocity and distance traveled decline more rapidly over the course of pregnancy in these same females, thus reducing the magnitude of divergence in swimming performance between high\u2010 and low\u2010predation populations. This functional trade\u2010off between reproduction and swimming performance reveals how different aspects of the phenotype are integrated and highlights the complexity of adaptation at the whole\u2010organism level.\n      </p>", "It is thought that fish generate the power needed for steady swimming with their anterior musculature, whereas the posterior musculature only transmits forces to the tail and does negative work. Isolated red muscle bundles driven through the length changes and stimulation pattern that muscles normally undergo during steady swimming showed the opposite pattern. Most of the power for swimming came from muscle in the posterior region of the fish, and relatively little came from the anterior musculature. In addition, the contractile properties of the muscle along the length of the fish are significantly adapted to enhance power generation.\n      </p>", "We develop a theoretical description of sperm chemotaxis. Sperm cells of many species are guided to the egg by chemoattractants, a process called chemotaxis. Motor proteins in the flagellum of the sperm generate a regular beat of the flagellum, which propels the sperm in a fluid. In the absence of a chemoattractant, sperm swim in circles in two dimensions and along helical paths in three dimensions. Chemoattractants stimulate a signaling system in the flagellum, which regulates the motors to control sperm swimming. Our theoretical description of sperm chemotaxis in two and three dimensions is based on a generic signaling module that regulates the curvature and torsion of the swimming path. In the presence of a chemoattractant, swimming paths are drifting circles in two dimensions and deformed helices in three dimensions. The swimming paths can be described by a dynamical system that exhibits different dynamic regimes, which correspond to different chemotactic behaviours. We conclude that sampling a concentration field of chemoattractant along circular and helical swimming paths is a robust strategy for chemotaxis that works reliably for a vast range of parameters.\n      </p>", "1. Adaptation to cold environments of ectotherm populations is expected to result in increased standard metabolic rates if resources are not limiting. However, it is still unclear how the maintenance of high standard metabolic rates would affect locomotor performance and its impact at the population level. 2. We compared standard metabolic rate and swimming performance of Brown Trout populations inhabiting rivers with contrasting thermal conditions. To avoid environmental confounding effects, we tested offspring raised in controlled conditions. There were significant differences among populations and families for both traits, suggesting that the observed differentiation pattern has a genetic basis. 3. We found a significant negative relationship between standard metabolic rate and swimming performance at the population level. On the other hand, standard metabolic rates tended to be negatively related to the temperature in the rivers of origin, whereas swimming performance was positively related to river temperature, but these trends were not significant. 4. These results suggest that selection for traits positively linked with standard metabolic rates may result in lower relative prolonged swimming performance. The potential evolutionary consequences of the observed negative relationship are discussed.\n      </p>", "The authors argue that age, sex, and racial differentials in swimming participation are conditioned by the availability of swimming infrastructure and the principle of social exclusivity that limits access of lower status groupings, even where pools and programs are available. In turn, the authors argue that participation in swimming and where that activity occurs (pool versus open water) affect life chances (accidental drowning rates) across status groups. Multiple data sources were used to operationalize measures of swimming participation, social exclusivity, conditions associated with the development of swimming infrastructure, risk for a place to drown, and age, sex, and racial accidental drowning and submersion rates. Given that some progress has been made toward lessening social exclusivity with lower status groups now participating in many sports, and the underreporting of deaths from accidental drowning and submersion, the authors believe that the confirmation of their hypotheses is conservative.\n      </p>", "A quartet of interconnected interneurons whose periodic activity appears to generate the traveling body wave of the swimming leech has been identified on each side of segmental ganglia of the ventral nerve cord of Hirudo medicinalis. Theoretical analysis and electronic analog models of the identified intra- and interganglionic synaptic connections of the segmentally iterated interneurons showed that they form an oscillatory network with cycle period and intra- and intersegmental phase relations appropriate for the swimming movement.\n      </p>", "Tunicates are the only animals that perform cellulose biosynthesis. The tunicate gene for cellulose synthase, Ci-CesA, was likely acquired by horizontal transfer from bacteria and was a key innovation in the evolution of tunicates. Transposon-based mutagenesis in an ascidian, Ciona intestinalis, has generated a mutant, swimming juvenile (sj). Ci-CesA is the gene responsible for the sj mutant, in which a drastic reduction in cellulose was observed in the tunic. Furthermore, during metamorphosis, which in ascidians convert the vertebrate-like larva into a sessile filter feeder, sj showed abnormalities in the order of metamorphic events. In normal larvae, the metamorphic events in the trunk region are initiated after tail resorption. In contrast sj mutant larvae initiated the metamorphic events in the trunk without tail resorption. Thus, sj larvae show a \"swimming juvenile\" phenotype, the juvenile-like trunk structure with a complete tail and the ability to swim. It is likely that ascidian cellulose synthase is required for the coordination of the metamorphic events in the trunk and tail in addition to cellulose biosynthesis.\n      </p>", "When predator chemical cues are present, low activity of prey is a commonly seen defensive behavior. However, few studies have explored the functional implications of the defensive behaviors and, thus, elucidated the possible linkages between behavioral responses and its consequences. In this study, we experimentally investigated how behavioral responses of Hyla japonica tadpoles to predator chemical cues affect vulnerability to a dragonfly nymph Anax parthenope Julius. The frequency of tadpoles attacked by dragonfly nymphs was lower with chemical cues of predator was present than without chemical cues, and most of attacks occurred when tadpoles were mobile. When tadpoles were exposed to chemical cues, on the other hand, their swimming speed was quicker and swimming distance was longer, respectively, and the rates of being approached of the swimming tadpoles by dragonfly nymph was lower than those not exposed to chemical cues. We found that the tadpoles are induced by predator chemical cues not only to generally lower activity but also to swim in bursts as additional behavior and that the suite of their behavioral responses reduce the vulnerability against dragonfly nymph. Tadpoles can receive information about the predation risks by chemical cues and adjust their defensive behavior accordingly.\n      </p>", "Recent advances in micro-machining allow very small cargos, such as single red blood cells, to be moved by outfitting them with tails made of micrometre-sized paramagnetic particles yoked together by polymer bridges. When a time-varying magnetic field is applied to such a filament, it bends from side to side and propels itself through the fluid, dragging the load behind it. Here, experimental data and a mathematical model are presented showing the dependence of the swimming speed and direction of the magnetic micro-swimmer upon tunable parameters, such as the field strength and frequency and the filament length. The propulsion of the filament arises from the propagation of bending waves between free and tethered ends: here we show that this gives the micro-swimmer a gait that is intermediate between a eukaryotic cell and a waggled elastic rod. Finally, we extract from the model design principles for constructing the fastest swimming micro-swimmer by tuning experimental parameters.\n      </p>", "Many sea turtle conservation projects include hatcheries where eggs are incubated and cared for, until hatchlings emerge and are released to the sea. Unfortunately, hatchlings are often retained for prolonged periods in hatchery enclosures after emerging from the sand. During this time they continuously crawl around, burning limited energy reserves, and missing valuable hours of darkness during which they would normally distance themselves from shore. We hypothesized that these forms of interference impair hatchling swimming behavior and, in turn, reduce survival rates during offshore migrations. We used hatchlings of Chelonia mydas in laboratory experiments to determine effects of retention in hatchery enclosures on hatchling swimming speed and behavior. Our results indicate that hatchery operations have a detrimental effect on hatchling behavior. Swimming speed decreased by over 12% with six hours of retention in the hatchery. Swimming style also varied with prolonged retention. Hatchlings frequently used a dog-paddle swimming style (rather than the more efficient powerstroke) after several hours of retention. This deviation in normal swimming style, coupled with decreased swimming speeds, likely hinders hatchling offshore migrations and reduces survival rates.\n      </p>", "Objectives: For many decades chlorination has been used as a major disinfectant process for public drinking and swimming pool water in many countries. However, there has been rising concern over the possible link between disinfectant byproducts (DBPs) and adverse reproductive outcomes. The purpose of this study was to estimate the concentrations of trihalomethanes (THMs) in some indoor swimming pools in London and their variation within and between pools and any correlation with other factors. Methods: Water samples were collected from eight different indoor swimming pools in London. A total of 44 pool samples were collected and analysed for total organic content (TOC) and THMs. Water and air temperature were measured along with the pH during the collection of pool samples. The level of turbulence and the number of people in the pool at the time were also assessed. Results: The geometric mean concentration for all swimming pools of TOC was 5.8 mg/l, of total THMs (TTHMs) 132.4 \u03bcg/l, and for chloroform 113.3 \u03bcg/l. There was a clear positive linear correlation between the number of people in the swimming pool and concentrations of TTHMs and chloroform (r=0.7, p&lt;0.01), and a good correlation between concentrations of TOC and TTHMs (r=0.5, p&lt;0.05) and water temperature and concentrations of TTHMs (r=0.5, p&lt;0.01). There was a larger variation in THMs within pools than between pools. Conclusion: Relatively high concentrations of THMs were found in London's indoor swimming pools. The levels correlated with the number of people in the pool, water temperature, and TOC. The variation in concentrations of THMs was greater within pools than between pools.\n      </p>", "Populations of Marenzelleria viridis in the Chester River (Kent County, Maryland) experience temperatures ranging from over 30\u00b0 C in summer to near freezing in winter. Interestingly, M. viridis swims actively in winter. This observation led us to examine the relationship between locomotor capacity and temperature in individuals of M. viridis. Juvenile specimens were collected in February (\"cold animals\") and June (\"warm animals\"). Video analysis revealed that swimming is achieved by flexing the body in cyclic, helical waves. Wave frequencies were measured as an index of locomotor capacity at 5\u00b0 C, 15\u00b0 C, and 25\u00b0 C. The mean wave frequencies of cold animals were 5.4 Hz at 5\u00b0 C and 7.1 Hz at 15\u00b0 C (Q&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.3); the mean wave frequencies of warm animals were 6.1 Hz at 15\u00b0 C and 7.8 Hz at 25\u00b0 C (Q&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.3). The effects of changes in water viscosity on wave frequency between 5-25\u00b0 C were not significant. These results demonstrate that the temperature sensitivity of locomotor capacity in juvenile M. viridis is quite low. We conclude that low temperature sensitivity enables M. viridis to be active throughout the year.\n      </p>", "Swimming as a response of the sea anemone Actinostola new species can be elicited as a result of contact with the submarginal surface of another swimming sea anemone Stomphia coccinea. However, Stomphia does not swim as a result of contact with Actinostola.

No agent that causes Actinostola to swim has been detected in extracts, rubbings, or dried matter from Stomphia.\n      </p>", "The swimming behaviour of Cyzicus grubei was recorded for captive animals caught from a temporary pond in Extremadura (SW Iberian Peninsula). C. grubei shows slow swimming near the bottom, but it swims actively in the water column. Mean absolute speed (cm $\\text{sec}^{-1}$ ), mean relative speed (body lengths $\\text{sec}^{-1}$ ), mean antennae stroke frequency (strokes $\\text{sec}^{-1}$ ), and mean antennae stroke distance (cm $\\text{stroke}^{-1}$ ) did not vary with carapace length in C. grubei (N = 30). /// Se ha estudiado el comportamiento natatorio de Cyzicus grubei en ejemplares procedentes de una laguna temporal del suroeste de la Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica.

The swimming muskrat was enclosed in a metabolic chamber to monitor oxygen consumption as a measure of the aerobic power input. The metabolic rate ( $\\dot{V}_{O_{2}}$ ) of swimming muskrats at a water temperature of 25 C was found to increase linearly over the range of test velocities. The computed cost of transport exhibited a curvilinear decrease with increasing velocity to a minimum of 0.75 m/s. Observations of free-swimming muskrats showed that they did not swim at the energetically most efficient velocity but at a lower mean velocity of 0.58 m/s. Departure from the expected swimming velocity was believed to be dependent on an addition of anaerobic metabolism to the aerobic metabolism and onset of fatigue at velocities above 0.6 m/s due to high drag.\n      </p>", "Oxygen consumption ($\\dot{V}O_{2}$) Of the Humboldt penguin Spheniscus humboldti was measured during swimming over the range 0.23-1.26 m s\u207b\u00b9. The fraction of time spent swimming submerged and on the surface was recorded simultaneously with VO\u2082. The power output ($P_{o}$), computed from surface:submerged swimming ratios and drag data, and the power input ($P_{i}$), from $\\dot{V}O_{2}$, were determined for each speed. Overall energetic efficiency ($\\eta_{o}$), the ratio $P_{o}$ :$P_{i}$, increased with swimming speed ($U_{b}$) as $\\eta_{o} = 0.103U_{b}^{2.8}$ ($U_{b} = m s^{-1}$) with a maximum value of 0.192. The maximum propulsion efficiency ($\\eta_{p}$), the ratio of $P_{o}$ :$P_{i}-less-maintenance-metabolism$, was 0.247. By changing from surface to submerged swimming as $U_{b}$ increases, the cost of transport remains constant at 13.4 J (kg.m)\u207b\u00b9 for $U_{b} = 0.5-1.26 m s^{-1}$. Increasing speeds without increasing transport costs enables the birds to reduce transit time to foraging locations without increasing energy expenditure, a distinct benefit when raising chicks on shore.\n      </p>", "Many workers have suggested that the crayfish giant fibers trigger swimming movements or tail flips during escape responses. Recordings from intact animals show that this is often not the case; both swimming and single tail flips can occur in the absence of giant fiber activity. Swimming movements and tail flips are coordinated by neural mechanisms not involving the giant fibers. When giant fibers are active, they may trigger the first flexion in a swimming sequence, initiate a single tail flip, or synchronize the muscular activity in the several segments of the abdomen, but they are not a necessary part of the neural oscillator which drives swimming.\n      </p>", "The effect of oxygen pressure on the swimming activity of hemoglobin-rich (red) and hemoglobin-poor (pale) Ceriodaphnia quadrangula was studied at 25\u00b0C. The swimming time of red animals until final cessation of antennal movement was constant (38 min) in extremely low oxygen concentration, rapidly increased, and reached 100 min at 4.5 torr. The swimming time of pale animals was constant (24 min) at 3.5 torr, increased gradually, and reached 100 min at 11.7 torr. The swimming time of red animals in nitrogen-saturated water increased on exposure to 3.5 torr and reached a maximum of 35 min at 5.8 torr. The swimming time of pale animals increased above 10.5 torr and reached a maximum of 23 min at 16.3 torr.\n      </p>", "Mouthbrooding occurs among several groups of fishes. Although a mouth full of eggs can be expected to pose a considerable respiratory problem, to our knowledge no study has examined respiratory consequences of mouthbrooding in fishes, or how hypoxia or strenuous swimming may affect the success of this reproductive strategy. In two species of cardinalfish (Apogon fragilis and Apogon leptacanthus), from the reef at Lizard Island (Great Barrier Reef), we found that mouthbrooding significantly reduced the ability to take up oxygen at low ambient oxygen levels. While the direct energetic cost of mouthbrooding appeared insignificant at rest in well-oxygenated water, mouthbrooding significantly reduced the respiratory scope of the fishes and their capacity for sustained aerobic swimming. The males spat out their eggs in hypoxia. Interestingly, the species with the larger brood, A. fragilis, spat out the brood at a higher water [O2] than did A. leptacanthus, which had a smaller mean brood mass. Moreover, in contrast to mouthbrooding A. leptacanthus, mouthbrooding A. fragilis was unable to increase its ventilatory frequency in response to hypoxia. This suggests a trade-off situation between hypoxia tolerance and brood size. Apparently, A. fragilis has sacrificed hypoxia tolerance in favour of a large brood size to a greater extent than has A. leptacanthus.\n      </p>", "Postcranial axial anatomy of six Jurassic ichthyosaurs is described and used to define a generalized pattern of regional anatomy with four structural units (neck, trunk, tail stock, fluke). Functional interpretation of each unit predicts a generalized swimming mode that used a laterally compressed, laterally oscillating caudal fluke as the propulsive organ. Fluke displacement was accomplished by the undulation of a dorsoventrally compressed posterior tail stock acting on a stabilized anterior tail stock. The trunk was largely uninvolved in locomotion. Osteological predictors of postcranial flexibility in living aquatic axial locomotors are reviewed and used to identify the existence of a range of swimming styles within this generalized pattern among surveyed ichthyosaurs.\n      </p>", "A novel cyanobacterium capable of swimming motility wass isolated in pure culture from several locations in the Atlantic Ocean. It is a small unicellular form, assignable to the genus Synechococcus, that is capable of swimming through liquids at speeds of 25 micrometers per second.

However, electron microscopy failed to reveal flagella and shearing did not arrest motility, indicating that the cyanobacterium may be propelled by a novel mechanism.\n      </p>", "An excitatory drive to the spinal cord neurons supplying rhythmic locomotor output in swimming was demonstrated in paralyzed late Xenopus embryos.

An especially important group of freshwater invertebrates is the water fleas of the genus Daphnia. These animals are often the dominant herbivores in lakes and ponds. They play a key role in determining water clarity (by grazing on algae) and they are an important part of the diet of fish. Natural chemical signals (kairomones) produced by predators affect the development, life history strategy, and behavior of zooplankton. Laboratory studies of anthropogenic chemicals that have biological activity (xenobiotics), such as the insecticide carbaryl, have demonstrated effects of concentrations in the 1 to 5 ppb range on Daphnia development, growth rate, and swimming behavior in our laboratory experiments. Low concentrations of carbaryl inhibit growth and reproduction and delay maturation, whereas survivorship was not effected. These sublethal exposures to carbaryl reduced Daphnia population growth rate (productivity) by about 15% (at 5 ppb), enough to have significant ecological effects on the rest of the lake community. The insecticide carbaryl showed synergistic interactions with natural chemicals associated with predators (kairomones) that modify Daphnia development and life history characteristics. In addition, there were complex synergisms between carbaryl, the predator odors, and oxygen concentration (low oxygen concentration can be either a natural environmental stress or an anthropogenic stress). Daphnia produce males facultatively, usually in late fall; at other times, reproduction is asexual. There is some evidence from long-term field studies that the maximum frequency of males has declined since the 1940s, when estrogenmimicking xenobiotics first appeared in lakes. A decrease in sexual recombination will result in maladapted Daphnia relative to their constantly changing environment.\n      </p>", "Conflicts between structural requirements for carrying out different ecologically relevant functions may result in a compromise phenotype that maximizes neither function. Identifying and evaluating functional trade-offs may therefore aid in understanding the evolution of organismal performance. We examined the possibility of an evolutionary trade-off between aquatic and terrestrial locomotion in females of European species of the newt genus Triturus. Biomechanical models suggest a conflict between the requirements for aquatic and terrestrial locomotion. For instance, having an elongate, slender body, a large tail, and reduced limbs should benefit undulatory swimming, but at the cost of reduced running capacity. To test the prediction of an evolutionary trade-off between swimming and running capacity, we investigated relationships between size-corrected morphology and maximum locomotor performance in females of ten species of newts. Phylogenetic comparative analyses revealed that an evolutionary trend of body elongation (increasing axilla-groin distance) is associated with a reduction in head width and forelimb length. Body elongation resulted in reduced maximum running speed, but, surprisingly, also led to a reduction in swimming speed. The evolution of longer tails was associated with an increase in maximal swimming speed. We found no evidence for an evolutionary trade-off between aquatic and terrestrial locomotor performance, probably because of the unexpected negative effect of body elongation on swimming speed. We conclude that the idea of a design conflict between aquatic and terrestrial locomotion, mediated through antagonistic effects of body elongation, does not apply to our model system.\n      </p>", "We have used a multidisciplinary approach, using methods ranging from neurophysiology to field observations of natural behavior, to study the rapid backward escape-swimming of the Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus. Escape-swimming involves a series of rapid power and recovery strokes of the abdomen, termed tail-flips. The initial tail-flip is mediated by giant fibers, and leads to a number of subsequent nongiant flips. The trajectory of the tail-flip depends on the particular giant fibers recruited, and also on the laterality of the stimulus, which influences steering and righting. The duration of swimming appears to be influenced by both neuronal and metabolic factors. By extending these laboratory studies to field trails, we have confirmed that the swimming performance of Nephrops is similar under natural conditions, and also in interactions between these animals and the trawl nets used to capture them.\n      </p>", "The amount of energy available to larvae during swimming, location of a suitable recruitment site, and metamorphosis influences the length of time they can spend in the plankton. Energetic parameters such as swimming speed, oxygen consumption during swimming and metamorphosis, and elemental carbon and nitrogen content were measured for larvae of four species of bryozoans, Bugula neritina, B. simplex, B. stolonifera, and B. turrita. The larvae of these species are aplanktotrophic with a short free-swimming phase ranging from less than one hour to a maximum of about 36 hours. There is about a fivefold difference in larval volume among the four species, which scales linearly with elemental carbon content and, presumably, with the amount of endogenous reserves available for swimming and metamorphosis. Mean larval swimming speeds (in centimeters per second) were similar among species. Specific metabolic rate and larval size were inversely related. For larvae of a given species, respiration rates remained similar for swimming and metamorphosis; however, because metamorphosis lasts about twice as long as a maximal larval swimming phase, it was more energetically demanding. Larger larvae expended more energy to complete metamorphosis than did smaller larvae, but in terms of the percentage of larval energy reserves consumed, swimming and metamorphosis were more \"expensive\" for smaller larvae. A comparison of the energy expended during larval swimming calculated on the basis of oxygen consumption and on the basis of elemental carbon decrease suggests that larvae of Bugula spp. may not use significant amounts of dissolved organic material (DOM) to supplement their endogenous energy reserves.\n      </p>", "Five juvenile alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) swam individually in a water channel at flow velocities from 13 to 95 cm/s by lateral undulations of the tail. Motion analysis of cine films revealed that the alligators swam by the generation of travelling waves initiating in the pelvic region. The wave pattern resembled undulatory modes utilized by fish. The posterior and lateral velocities of the travelling wave increased linearly with increased length-specific swimming velocity. The amplitude of the tail wave remained constant over the range of swimming velocities while frequency varied. The kinematics and propulsive morphology of the swimming juvenile alligators indicated a low performance mode of life. This is correlated with the prey-capture techniques of crocodilians.\n      </p>", "The swimming of long animals like snakes, eels and marine worms is idealized by considering the equilibrium of a flexible cylinder immersed in water when waves of bending of constant amplitude travel down it at constant speed. The force of each element of the cylinder is assumed to be the same as that which would act on a corresponding element of a long straight cylinder moving at the same speed and inclination to the direction of motion. Relevant aerodynamic data for smooth cylinders are first generalized to make them applicable over a wide range of speed and cylinder diameter. The formulae so obtained are applied to the idealized animal and a connexion established between B/\u03bb , V / U and R1. Here B and \u03bb are the amplitude and wave-length, V the velocity attained when the wave is propagated with velocity U, R1 is the Reynolds number Ud\u03c1 /\u03bc , where d is the diameter of the cylinder, \u03c1 and \u03bc are the density and viscosity of water. The results of calculation are compared with James Gray's photographs of a swimming snake and a leech. The amplitude of the waves which produce the greatest forward speed for a given output of energy is calculated and found, in the case of the snake, to be very close to that revealed by photographs. Similar calculations using force formulae applicable to rough cylinders yield results which differ from those for smooth ones in that when the roughness is sufficiently great and has a certain directional character propulsion can be achieved by a wave of bending which is propagated forward instead of backward. Gray's photographs of a marine worm show that this remarkable method of propulsion does in fact occur in the animal world.\n      </p>", "The movement and function of the laterally flattened tail of surface swimming muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) were studied by forcing individual animals to swim against a constant water flow of velocity ranging from 0.2 to 0.75 m/s. Simultaneous lateral and ventral views of the swimming muskrats were filmed. During swimming the tail produces a series of traveling waves that moved posteriorly with increasing amplitude at a velocity faster than the muskrat was swimming. The characteristics of the traveling waves were analogous to the body and tail undulations observed in the swimming of anguilliform fish. Calculations showed that the tail provided a maximum of 1.4% of the total thrust power necessary to propel the muskrat at 0.75 m/s. Amputation of a muskrat tail causes the animal to yaw while swimming. The compressed tail of the muskrat may allow for the effective generation of thrust in surface swimming by producing small amounts of thrust in conjunction with the prevention of yaw.\n      </p>", "The mesopelagic vertically migrating penaeid shrimp Sergestes similis was studied in situ in Monterey Bay, California, at depths ranging from 291-569 m using a remotely operated submarine equipped with a video camera. Instances both of routine swimming and of escape behavior were observed. In routine swimming, S. similis (mean total length 43.5 mm) swims at an average of 7.4 cm/s. Propulsion is provided exclusively by the pleopods, which beat in an adlocomotory metachronous wave at approximately 4 Hz. The pereiopods are generally held close to the underside of the thorax. The long second antennae (hereafter \"antennae\" unless first antennae are specified) are invariably deployed in a characteristic position, with the relatively inflexible proximal portion, over 1 body length long, directed anterolaterally and angling slightly ventrally, and the flexible distal portion, over 2 body lengths long, trailing posteriorly from a distinct articulation or \"kink\" at the end of the proximal portion. The antennae clearly respond to tactile stimuli, and perhaps have chemosensory function as well. Sergestes similis was never observed to stop swimming except for briefbouts of grooming or momentary reactions to tactile contacts on the antennae. Downward swimming was always active, and was not accomplished by passive sinking. The extremely long, setose antennae would be expected to produce substantial drag which must be overcome by metabolically generated thrust. Thrust of the pleopods is maximized during the propulsive stroke by extending and separating the pleopods and spreading the setae, while drag is minimized on the recovery stroke by retracting the pleopods and holding them in apposition to one another and by folding the setae. The escape reaction in this species is the typical decapod tail flip.\n      </p>", "In the estimation of the developmental regularity among children it is important to know the relation between the developmental and the calendar age. It is particularly important in the estimation of the level of development among children with an increased level of guided motor activity. It takes place, for instance, in the case of children practising swimming. In auxology there are many morphological, physiological and motor features which are regarded as the measure of the developmental age. For several years researches have been conducted on the EMN index as the determinant of the biological age. The EMN index shows continuous changes during ontogeny, proves the existence of stages in the developmental age and is also considerably correlated with the calendar age. This is an ecosensitive factor. The EMN index differentiates individuals from another as well as groups isolated with regard to the effect of the environmental factors, for instance, the different levels of motor activity. The aim of this investigation is to estimate the standard of biological maturity (the body height and mass, the EMN index) among children, who went through a guided swimming training. Morphological features are most often used as the measures of development. However, they can become unreliable when they themselves establish the criterion of selection to a sports discipline or when some ranges of values are optimal on some given standards. The EMN index is not burdened with these features. The children who go through training show the higher level of the EMN index values than the children who do not go. The effect of this is the fact that young swimmers are biologically older than their peers. However, the shape of the curve of development of the EMN index in swimmers goes at a different level depending on the seniority of training. Um den regul\u00e4ren Entwicklungsablauf von Kindern beurteilen zu k\u00f6nnen, ist es wichtig, die Beziehung zwischen dem Entwicklungs- und dem Kalenderalter zu kennen. Das ist bei Kindern mit gesteigerter motorischer Aktivit\u00e4t besonders wichtig. Eine solche Beurteilung findet z. B. bei Kindern statt, die Schwimmsport betreiben wollen. In der Auxologie kennt man viele morphologische, physiologische und motorische Merkmale, die als Ma\u00df f\u00fcr die Beurteilung des Entwicklungsalters gelten.

Pereiopods V-VII are modified as paddles, and their respective body segments are conspicuously enlarged to accommodate the bulky extrinsic musculature of the limbs. However, fundamentally, the skeletomusculature of these appendages is the same as that of unmodified ambulatory pereiopods on other isopods. Even though the architecture of E. cornuta is extensively modified for swimming, the animal is reluctant to do so. The significance of this is discussed.\n      </p>", "Physical factors often have an overriding influence on the distribution patterns of organisms, and can ultimately shape the long-term structure of communities. Although distribution patterns in sessile marine organisms have frequently been attributed to functional characteristics interacting with wave-induced water motion, similar evidence for mobile organisms is lacking. Links between fin morphology and swimming performance were examined in three diverse coral reef fish families from two major evolutionary lineages. Among-habitat variation in morphology and performance was directly compared with quantitative values of wave-induced water motion from seven coral reef habitats of different depth and wave exposure on the Great Barrier Reef. Fin morphology was strongly correlated with both field and experimental swimming speeds in all three families. The range of observed swimming speeds coincided closely with the magnitude of water velocities commonly found on coral reefs. Distribution patterns in all three families displayed highly congruent relationships between fin morphology and wave-induced water motion. Our findings indicate a general functional relationship between fin morphology and swimming performance in labriform-swimming fishes, and provide quantitative evidence that wave energy may directly influence the assemblage structure of coral reef fishes through interactions with morphology and swimming performance.\n      </p>", "Third to sixth instar larvae of the aquatic firefly Luciola substriata swim with their ventral side up, including when they were searching for prey. When larvae were engaged in swimming, the thoracic legs sculled backwards continuously, while the abdomen could curve upward and downwards. The pygopodium located in the end of abdomen enable larvae to grasp and adhere on floating objects that also help start or cease swimming. When larvae in back-swimming changed direction, the larval abdomen curved clockwise or counterclockwise quickly and then unbent. The legs movement of larvae consists of eight different stroke patterns. The larvae averaged 1.6 strokes per sec and 0.6 wiggle of abdomen per sec. Larvae swim slowly with the speed of 0.9 m/h.\n      </p>", "The morphology of branching corals effectively blocks impinging currents. Weak flows in the colony's inner sections can hinder some of the corals' basic physiological functions. At night, high respiration by the coral and the absence of photosynthesis by the symbiotic algae sometimes generate severe hypoxia near coral branches. Nevertheless, branching corals thrive in flow-protected areas. Many of them host resident fish that seek shelter between their branches during the night. In situ observations using an infrared-sensitive video camera revealed that, unlike crevice-dwelling fishes, which sleep motionless, fish (Dascyllus marginatus, D. aruanus, and Chromis viridis) that spend the night in living hard corals (Stylophora pistillata, Acropora spp., Pocillopora spp., and Seriatopora spp.) exhibit a unique sleep-swimming mode that is characterized by energetic, high-frequency fin motions. In the reef, the presence of fish in the coral S. pistillata increased gypsum dissolution and, hence, mass transfer, by \u223c17% compared with colonies without fish. The extent to which the fish enhanced water replenishment in the inner zone of the coral was assessed in the laboratory using oxygen measurements. In the absence of fish, oxygen levels near the coral tissues (\u223c1 mm) rapidly declined, reaching 10-30% of ambient levels, which was much lower than the nearly steady levels of 60-80% when sleep-swimming fish were present. Individual sleep-swimming fish were spatially separated across the coral, so that most of the coral's inner zone was frequently ventilated. This common, yet so-far overlooked mutualistic relationship is unique by the virtue of its effect, the active modulation of hydrodynamic conditions, and its operation during the sleep of the active animal. The modulation of hydrodynamic conditions by the fish can mitigate flow limitation on the growth and survival of branching corals.\n      </p>", "The swimming behaviour of the puerulus of the spiny lobster Jasus edwardsii is poorly described despite its ecological significance. Therefore, the swimming behaviour of pueruli of this species was recorded for captive animals caught from the east coast of northern New Zealand. Forward swimming velocities were variable among individual puerulus and ranged from 13.0 to 30.7 cm $\\text{s}^{-1}$ . Backward swimming velocities of 28.6-52.2 cm $\\text{s}^{-1}$ were recorded. Individuals were capable of sustained forward swimming, whereas backward swimming was primarily used as a rapid reverse escape reaction. The forward swimming posture of the puerulus is described, including swimming with the tips of the antennae protruding from the surface of the water. Attempts to measure the duration of sustained forward swimming of pueruli in a small flume tank failed because the lobsters were not rheotactic, as has been commonly found in fish. /// Le comportement natatoire de la larve puerulus de la langouste Jasus edwardsii a \u00e9t\u00e9 peu d\u00e9crite malgr\u00e9 son int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9cologique.

Melibe swims spontaneously, as well as in response to different types of aversive stimuli. In this study, swimming was elicited by contact with the tube feet of the predatory sea star Pycnopodia helianthoides, pinching with forceps, or application of a 1 M KCl solution. During an episode of swimming, the duration of swim cycles (2.7 \u00b1 0.2 s [mean \u00b1 SEM], n = 29) and the amplitude of lateral flexions remained relatively constant. However, the latency between the application of a stimulus and initiation of swimming was more variable, as was the duration of an episode of swimming. For example, when touched with a single tube foot from a sea star (n = 32), the latency to swim was 7.0 \u00b1 2.4 s, and swimming continued for 53.7 \u00b1 9.4 s, whereas application of KCl resulted in a longer latency to swim (22.3 \u00b1 4.5 s) and more prolonged swimming episodes (174.9 \u00b1 32.1 s). Swimming individuals tended to move in a direction perpendicular to the long axis of the foot, which propelled them laterally when they were oriented with the oral hood toward the surface of the water. The results of this study indicate that swimming in Melibe, like that in several other molluscs, is a stereotyped fixed action pattern that can be reliably elicited in the laboratory. These characteristics, along with the large identifiable neurons typical of many molluscs, make swimming in this nudibranch amenable to neuroethological analyses.\n      </p>", "Sperm competition, the contest among ejaculates from rival males to fertilize ova of a female, is a common and powerful evolutionary force influencing ejaculate traits. During competitive interactions between ejaculates, longer and faster spermatozoa are expected to have an edge; however, to date, there has been mixed support for this key prediction from sperm competition theory. Here, we use the spectacular radiation of cichlid fishes from Lakeanganyika to examine sperm characteristics in 29 closely related species. We provide phylogenetically robust evidence that species experiencing greater levels of sperm competition have faster-swimming sperm. We also show that sperm competition selects for increases in the number, size, and longevity of spermatozoa in the ejaculate of a male, and, contrary to expectations from theory, we find no evidence of trade-offs among sperm traits in an interspecific analysis. Also, sperm swimming speed is positively correlated with sperm length among, but not within, species. These different responses to sperm competition at intra- and interspecific levels provide a simple, powerful explanation for equivocal results from previous studies. Using phylogenetic analyses, we also reconstructed the probable evolutionary route of trait evolution in this taxon, and show that, in response to increases in the magnitude of sperm competition, the evolution of sperm traits in this clade began with the evolution of faster (thus, more competitive) sperm.\n      </p>", "A novel pattern of undulatory swimming is described in the freshwater oligochaete, Dero digitata (Family Naididae). Movements are rhythmic (6-12 cycles/s), each cycle consisting of a single, helical body wave that passes from the worm's anterior to posterior end, thus propelling the worm forward. Successive cycles of these waves alternate between right-handed and left-handed helical orientations. Helical swimming in response to posterior tactile stimulation was commonly expressed in all stages of asexual reproduction, including non-fissioning \"normal\" worms, late prefission worms, and separated anterior or posterior zooids. Swimming also occurred in amputated anterior and posterior body fragments. Reynolds numbers ranged from approximately 50 (in the shortest and slowest worms) to 300 (in the longest and fastest worms). During slow swimming, wave velocities and forward velocities were 37 mm/s and 10 mm/s, respectively; during fast swimming these values were 55 mm/s and 25 mm/s, respectively. Thus, corresponding values of overall \"slippage\" were 73 and 55%, respectively. Central conduction of swim wave excitation likely involves intersegmental, non-giant fiber pathways that are (1) functionally coupled between anterior and posterior zooids of prefission worms and (2) readily activated by posterior mechanosensory inputs in whole worms and isolated zooids.\n      </p>", "After opisthobranch molluscs dislodge from the substrate during onset of swimming, the ensuing flexion or undulatory motions are usually not well oriented with respect to predators, prey or suitable substrate. Swimming motions are effective in launching animals off the substrate and elevating them into the water column where they are primarily transported passively by ambient waves and tidal currents. Both active swimming and passive transport on ambient currents may provide escape from predators, search for food and mates, and dispersal to new and potentially adaptive locations. However, loss of contact with the substrate and launching into the water column may also bring a high cost in terms of exposure to diverse risks. I illustrate several forms of opisthobranch swimming and describe their mechanisms and roles. In addition, adaptations of some opisthobranchs to reduce the risks of exposure to predators during swimming are suggested. These adaptations include small size, transparency or inconspicuous color to reduce predation while swimming, and neurobehavioral mechanisms of rheotaxis and geomagnetic sensitivity.\n      </p>", "BACKGROUND: Exposure to disinfection by-products (DBPs) in drinking water has been associated with cancer risk. A recent study (Villanueva et al. 2007; Am J Epidemiol 165:148-156) found an increased bladder cancer risk among subjects attending swimming pools relative to those not attending. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated adults who swam in chlorinated pools to determine whether exposure to DBPs in pool water is associated with biomarkers of genotoxicity. METHODS: We collected blood, urine, and exhaled air samples from 49 nonsmoking adult volunteers before and after they swam for 40 min in an indoor chlorinated pool. We estimated associations between the concentrations of four trihalomethanes (THMs) in exhaled breath and changes in micronuclei (MN) and DNA damage (comet assay) in peripheral blood lymphocytes before and 1 hr after swimming; urine mutagenicity (Ames assay) before and 2 hr after swimming; and MN in exfoliated urothelial cells before and 2 weeks after swimming. We also estimated associations and interactions with polymorphisms in genes related to DNA repair or to DBP metabolism. RESULTS: After swimming, the total concentration of the four THMs in exhaled breath was seven times higher than before swimming. The change in the frequency of micronucleated lymphocytes after swimming increased in association with higher exhaled concentrations of the brominated THMs (p = 0.03 for bromodichloromethane, p = 0.05 for chlorodibromomethane, p = 0.01 for bromoform) but not chloroform. Swimming was not associated with DNA damage detectable by the comet assay. Urine mutagenicity increased significantly after swimming, in association with the higher concentration of exhaled bromoform (p = 0.004). We found no significant associations with changes in micronucleated urothelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support potential genotoxic effects of exposure to DBPs from swimming pools. The positive health effects gained by swimming could be increased by reducing the potential health risks of pool water.\n      </p>", "Whereas the laws of thermodynamics prohibit extraction of useful work from the Brownian motion of particles in equilibrium, these motions can be \"rectified\" under nonequilibrium conditions, for example, in the presence of asymmetric geometrical obstacles. Here, we describe a class of systems in which aerobic bacteria Bacillus subtilis moving randomly in a fluid film power submillimeter gears and primitive systems of gears decorated with asymmetric teeth. The directional rotation is observed only in the regime of collective bacterial swimming and the gears' angular velocities depend on and can be controlled by the amount of oxygen available to the bacteria. The ability to harness and control the power of collective motions appears an important requirement for further development of mechanical systems driven by microorganisms.\n      </p>", "The six extant aquatic families of Hydradephaga (Coleoptera) known so far represent a diverse group of beetles morphologically highly modified for life in the water. We report the discovery of a new genus with two species from South Africa and China, which differ greatly from all extant families, but resemble the Jurassic-Cretaceous Liadytidae (the dagger symbol indicates that the taxa are known only as fossils). Based on a combined phylogenetic analysis of molecular and morphological data we erect a new family, Aspidytidae, which is the sister group of Dytiscidae plus Hygrobiidae. We propose a new scenario for the evolution of swimming behaviour in adephagan beetles, in which the transition into the aquatic environment is followed by complex and repeated changes in lifestyles, including the secondary complete loss of swimming ability in Aspidytidae.\n      </p>", "Alveolar breath sampling was used to assess trihalomethane (THM) exposures encountered by collegiate swimmers during a typical 2-hr training period in an indoor natatorium. The breath samples were collected at regular intervals before, during, and for 3 hr after a moderately intense training workout. Integrated and grab whole-air samples were collected during the training period to help determine inhalation exposures, and pool water samples were collected to help assess dermal exposures. Resulting breath samples collected during the workout demonstrated a rapid uptake of two THMs (chloroform and bromodichloromethane), with chloroform concentrations exceeding the natatorium air levels within 8 min after the exposure began. Chloroform levels continued to rise steeply until they were more than two times the indoor levels, providing evidence that the dermal route of exposure was relatively rapid and ultimately more important than the inhalation route in this training scenario. Chloroform elimination after the exposure period was fitted to a three compartment model that allowed estimation of compartmental half-lives, resulting minimum bloodborne dose, and an approximation of the duration of elevated body burdens. We estimated the dermal exposure route to account for 80% of the blood chloroform concentration and the transdermal diffusion efficiency from the water to the blood to in excess of 2%. Bromodichloromethane elimination was fitted to a two compartment model, which provided evidence of a small, but measurable, body burden of this THM resulting from vigorous swim training. These results suggest that trihalomethane exposures for competitive swimmers under prolonged, high-effort training are common and possibly higher than was previously thought and that the dermal exposure route is dominant. The exposures and potential risks associated with this common recreational activity should be more thoroughly investigated.\n      </p>", "The swimming ability of cotton rats and rice rats from several localities in Florida and Mississippi was compared. Rice rats freely swam a 2-m barrier separating two small \"islands,\" making better than 20 times the number of crossings made by cotton rats. Some cotton rats (26%) never swam the barrier during the 2-day test period, but all rice rats did. In general, cotton rats from Florida, especially ones from a barrier island, swam more frequently than did cotton rats from Mississippi. Rice rats from all localities were approximately equal in their tendency to swim. All crossings by rice rats and most by cotton rats were made during darkness. The fur of rice rats was more water repellent than that of cotton rats. Air trapped between hairs increased the buoyancy of the rice rats and reduced heat loss in water. Even with twice the body weight, cotton rats exhibited a significantly greater decrease in core body temperature when placed in 15\u00b0C water for 40 min than did rice rats. While swimming, both species used mainly the hind feet for propulsion and held the front feet close to the body. Rice rats swam faster than cotton rats, frequently swimming underwater for more than 10 m. Cotton rats never swam underwater, although they would momentarily submerge when they jumped from a platform. Semiaquatic adaptations appear to be important components of niche segregation in these sympatric rodents.\n      </p>", "The swimming metabolism of yearling and adult harbor seals was measured by indirect calorimetry in a flow channel at speeds ranging from 0.5 to 1.4 m\u00b7s\u207b\u00b9. Minimum resting metabolic rates in still water were 5.1 and 4.6 ml O\u2082\u00b7min\u207b\u00b9\u00b7kg\u207b\u00b9 for the two yearling seals (body mass [ $M_{b}$ ] = 33 kg) and one adult seal ( $M_{b} = 63 kg$ ), respectively. Minimum resting metabolic rates were about 1.1 X the predicted standard metabolic rate for mammals of equivalent size. During steady-state swimming, metabolism increased curvilinearly with speed and was best described by the equation $\\dot{V}O_{2} (ml O_{2}\\cdot{min}^{-1}\\cdot{kg}^{-1}) = 5.1 + 6.25$ velocity $(m\\cdot{s}^{-1})^{1.42}$ for the yearling seals and $\\dot{V}O_{2} = 4.6 + 3.1$ $velocity^{1.42}$ for the adult seal. Stroke frequency increased linearly as a function of swimming speed. Cost of transport decreased asymptotically with swim velocity, approaching a minimum at 1.0-1.4 m\u00b7s\u207b\u00b9 of 3.6 J\u00b7m\u207b\u00b9\u00b7kg\u207b\u00b9 for yearling and 2.3 J\u00b7m\u207b\u00b9\u00b7kg\u207b\u00b9 for adult seals. The minimum cost of transport was less than for other semiaquatic birds and mammals but 3-4 X the predicted value for salmonid fish of equivalent size at 25 C.\n      </p>", "A comparative analysis of terrestrial and aquatic locomotion is used to show that swimming has evolved from the jumping of Melanoplus differentialis. Analyses of swimming movements, together with mechanical considerations, demonstrate that thrust is generated by the difference in velocity between the power and return strokes of the hind tibiae. With these facts we propose the argument that a behavioral modification has preceded a morphological change in the evolution of swimming in this animal.\n      </p>", "1. Infant carrying behaviour occurs across diverse taxa inhabiting arboreal, volant and aquatic environments. For mammals, it is considered to be the most expensive form of parental care after lactation, yet the effect of infant carrying on the energetics and performance of the carrier is virtually unknown. 2. Echelon swimming in cetacean (dolphin and whale) mother-infant dyads, described as calf in very close proximity of its mother's mid-lateral flank, appears to be a form of aquatic 'infant carrying' behaviour as indicated by the hydrodynamic benefits gained by calves in this position which enables them to maintain proximity of their travelling mothers. Although this behaviour provides a solution for minimizing separations of mother-infant dyads, it may be associated with maternal costs. 3. Through kinematic analyses this study demonstrates empirically that 'infant carrying' impacts the locomotion of dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) mothers as evident by decreased swim performance and increased effort. 4. The mean maximum swim speed of mothers swimming in echelon only represented 76% of the mean maximum swim speed of these mothers swimming solitarily. In addition, there was a concomitant 13% reduction in distance per stroke for mothers swimming in echelon compared to periods of solitary swimming. 5. Thus, 'infant carrying' in an aquatic environment is associated with maternal costs, and could ultimately impact maternal energy budgets, foraging efficiency and predator evasion.\n      </p>", "Sperm of the sea urchin Tripneustes gratilla repeatedly start and stop swimming when suspended in seawater and observed by dark-field microscopy. While in the quiescent state, which usually lasts about a second, the sperm assume a shape resembling a cane, with a sharp bend of \u223c3.4 rad in the proximal region of the flagellum and very little curvature in the rest of the flagellum except for a slight curve near the tip. The occurrence of quiescence requires the presence of at least 2 mM Ca2+ in the seawater, and the percentage of sperm quiescent at any one time increases substantially when the sperm are illuminated with blue light. With intense illumination, close to 100% of the sperm become quiescent, and this percentage decreases gradually to \u223c0.3% over a 104-fold decrease in light intensity. An increased concentration of K+ in the seawater also increases the percentage of quiescence, with a majority of the sperm being quiescent in seawater containing 80 mM KCl. The induction of quiescence by light or by increased KCl is completely inhibited by 10 \u03bcM chlorpromazine, and \u223c90% inhibited by 1 mM procaine or sodium barbital. Sperm treated with the divalent-cation ionophore A23187 swim quite normally, although for a relatively short period, in artifical seawater lacking divalent cations, but are abruptly arrested upon addition of 0.04-0.2 mM free Ca2+. The flagellar waveform of these arrested sperm is almost identical to that of light-induced quiescence in the live sperm. The results support the hypothesis that quiescence is induced by a rise in intracellular Ca2+, perhaps as a consequence of a membrane depolarization, and that it is similar to the arrest response in cilia.\n      </p>", "Coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch, and steelhead trout, Salmo gairdneri, 57 to 60 mm in total length, were exposed either once for 1 hr to 1,500 cercariae of Nanophyetus salmincola, or daily for 1 hr to 100 of these parasites for 15 days. The effect of the parasites on the swimming ability of fish exposed only once was determined immediately after exposure, or after 6, 12, 24, or 96 hr, or after 15 days; fish exposed daily were tested immediately after the last exposure. Groups of control and infected fish were tested together in a swimming tube. In some tests, the water velocity in the tube was increased gradually at 10-min intervals, and the velocity at which each fish became fatigued was recorded. In other tests, the water velocity was suddenly increased to a high, constant level, and the duration of swimming of each fish at that velocity was recorded. In both types of tests, there was a marked effect of the parasite on the swimming ability of fish exposed once and tested 0 to 96 hr later and on those exposed repeatedly and tested after their last exposure. The mean swimming speeds or times of groups of steelhead trout were reduced by 10 to 58%, as compared with those of controls, and corresponding per cent reduction values for coho salmon ranged from 4 to 95%. This impairment of the swimming ability of infected fish is attributed to tissue injury caused by migrating parasites. The swimming ability of fish that were exposed once and tested 15 days later, when the parasites were encysted, was little affected. However, it is likely that the effect would have been greater had the infections been heavier.\n      </p>", "Groups of mice were placed in water containing from 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Naegleria fowleri amebae per ml and allowed to swim for 2.5 to 20 min. Mouse mortality ranged from 0 to 70% and was dependent upon the concentration of amebae per ml and the length of swimming exposure. That swimming mice can develop fatal naeglerial infection further confirms the mouse model for studying experimental primary amebic meningoencephalitis.\n      </p>", "The nudibranch Melibe leonina swims by rhythmically flexing its body from side to side at a frequency of 1 cycle every 2-5 sec. Melibe swim spontaneously, when they are dislodged from the substrate, or when they come in contact with predatory seastars, such as Pycnopodia helianthoides. Intracellular recordings obtained from semi-intact swimming Melibe reveal a population of \u223c15 swim motoneurons (SMNs) in each pedal ganglion. In general, SMNs in one pedal ganglion fire out-of-phase with SMNs in the opposite pedal ganglion, resulting in rhythmic side-to-side bending movements. In isolated brains, recordings from SMNs yield similar results, indicating the existence of a swim central pattern generator (CPG). There is no evidence for synaptic interactions between SMNs and either inhibiting or exciting SMNs has no impact on the swim pattern. The SMNs are driven by a CPG consisting of 4 interneurons; 2 in the cerebropleural ganglia and 1 in each pedal ganglion. Appropriate bursting activity in the swim interneurons is necessary for swimming to occur. Either hyperpolarization or depolarization of any of the 4 CPG interneurons disrupts the normal swim pattern. Swimming behavior, and the fictive swim motor program expressed by the isolated brain, are inhibited by light and nitric oxide donors. NADPH-diaphorase staining and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) immunocytochemistry of Melibe brains suggests the source of nitric oxide might be a pair of bilaterally symmetrical cells located in the cerebropleural ganglia.\n      </p>", "Early embryonic swimming is widespread among marine invertebrates, but quantitative information about swimming behaviors is scarce. Swimming may affect encounters with predators, positioning in the water column, and nutrient absorption. Measured rates and patterns of swimming and sinking for blastulae of four eastern Pacific echinoid species show that sinking speeds equal or exceed swimming speeds. Swimming speed scaled negatively with embryo size, though sinking speed did not scale with size. Analysis of swimming paths of Strongylocentrotus franciscanus revealed a temperature dependency in swimming pattern that affected speed of upward movement. Sinking speeds were significantly greater at 10 \u00b0C than at 14 \u00b0C for blastulae of all four species examined. In Dendraster excentricus, killing the blastulae annulled this temperature effect, indicating an active density regulation by these embryos. Finally, measurements of particle velocities around sinking and swimming D. excentricus blastulae show that swimming creates a more localized disturbance than sinking. Embryonic swimming may therefore decrease rather than increase encounters with pelagic predators. Results from subsequent experiments in which embryos were reared in low-oxygen environments suggest that any oxygen-absorption advantages of swimming have little, if any, effect on the development of D. excentricus embryos.\n      </p>"], "words": {"focus": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "four": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "known": {"number": 1, "prob":
