{"total_words": 954, "documents": ["The frequency and form of adoption practices in Oceania recently have been cited as evidence that human behavior is inconsistent with predictions derived from sociobiological theory (Sahlins 1976). Ethnographic data reviewed here, however, suggest otherwise. In Oceania kinship is an important factor in the selection and treatment of adopted children as adoption occurs almost exclusively among close relatives. Natal children often ally against their adopted siblings over the division of their common parents' estate while adoptive parents themselves frequently apportion their land unequally among their natal and adopted children. These patterns and other data are consistent with predictions generated by a sociobiological model of adoptive decisions. The model illustrates how kinship facilitates adoption as a means of modifying extreme family sizes, and how asymmetries in the degrees of relatedness between parents and their adopted and natal children provide the basis of differential treatment of them. Adoption in Oceania provides an example of a clearly cultural behavior which is consistent with sociobiological predictions, and suggests that both culture and biology are relevant to an understanding of human behavior.\n      </p>", "Substantial anthropogenic environmental change occurred in Remote Oceania following the first arrival of people at 3000 BP and their spread throughout the region by 700 BP. It included numerous faunal extinctions, widespread deforestation and the erosion and re-deposition of sediments, to which are attributed various consequences for cultural development. The issue considered here is whether an explanation of anthropogenic change could extend to variations in settlement history between Remote Oceanic islands. Most of those were inhabited continuously, especially in the older settled area, but in East Polynesia settlement is thought to have declined on several islands and it was abandoned in many others. Consideration of the type and scale of anthropogenic changes indicates no correlation with variations in settlement history. Anthropogenic changes might be regarded as constants of the settlement process. Late Holocene climatic patterns, ecological complexity and isolation with its effect on the availability of subsistence choices, may have been more influential variables.\n      </p>", "Women's fishing in Oceania has been overlooked in most subsistence studies in the region and, as a consequence, there are few quantitative data available upon which to base an assessment of its importance. However, in the present study, the few data available on women's fishing in Oceania are examined, and these show that women contribute significantly to marine food yields in the region. Also, it is suggested that the highly regular nature of women's fishing makes women more reliable, and therefore more effective than men as suppliers of protein for subsistence. The implications of these findings for future development policies in the region are then discussed.\n      </p>", "Breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis, Moraceae), a traditional starch crop in Oceania, has enjoyed legendary status ever since its role in the infamous mutiny aboard the H.M.S. Bounty in 1789, yet its origins remain unclear. Breadfruit's closest relatives are A. camansi and A. mariannensis. DNA fingerprinting data (AFLP, amplified fragment length polymorphisms) from over 200 breadfruit cultivars, 30 A. camansi, and 24 A. mariannensis individuals were used to investigate the relationships among these species. Multivariate analyses and the identification of species-specific AFLP markers indicate at least two origins of breadfruit. Most Melanesian and Polynesian cultivars appear to have arisen over generations of vegetative propagation and selection from A. camansi. In contrast, most Micronesian breadfruit cultivars appear to be the result of hybridization between A. camansi-derived breadfruit and A. mariannensis. Because breadfruit depends on humans for dispersal, the data were compared to theories on the human colonization of Oceania. The results agree with the well-supported theory that humans settled Polynesia via Melanesia. Additionally, a long-distance migration from eastern Melanesia into Micronesia is supported.\n      </p>", "Unique arboreal-based subsistence economies emerged in Wallacea, New Guinea and Near Oceania. Initial developments have their roots in the Pleistocene. The developmental history of arboreal-based economies (often called arboriculture) in Southeast Asia and the Pacific is not well understood. A framework of subsistence system diversification in relation to unexploited ecological opportunities is useful for subsistence system model building. The emergence of arboreal-based economies in Island Southeast Asia and Near Oceania has significant implications concerning Pacific prehistory, as Austronesian descendants probably incorporated arboriculture and arboreal resources into their economies and subsequently translocated these to the more distant Pacific islands. The overall framework can be applied to assessing subsistence developments elsewhere.\n      </p>", "Concentrations of dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC &amp; POC) in river waters were measured during 1993-1994 in the Lanyang Hsi watershed, which represents a typical small Oceania river. The DOC concentrations varied in the range of 0.5-4 mg/l during non-typhoon period, but rose to as high as 8 mg/l during Typhoon Tim in July, 1994. Based on the log-linear relationship between the DOC load and the discharge rate, we estimated the DOC export to be 3.4 \u00b1 0.6 ktC/yr, and the DOC yield to be 4.1 \u00b1 0.7 gC/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/yr, which is considerably higher than a former estimate (ca. 0.1 gC/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/yr) for the Oceania. On the other hand, the DOC yield is less than the concurrent POC yield (21.7 \u00b1 4.7 gC/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/yr) by a factor of five, but most of the exported POC is fossil carbon. Under the assumption that the suspended sediments contain a mean fossil POC content of 0.5%, the nonfossil POC yield was calculated to be 4.6 \u00b1 3.0 gC/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/yr, comparable to the DOC yield. Since DOC and nonfossil POC are directly related to the ecosystem, their combined fluxes give a biogenic organic carbon yield of 8.7 \u00b1 3.1 gC/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/yr.\n      </p>", "The human settlement of the Pacific in general, and the origin of the Polynesians in particular, have been topics of debate for over two centuries. Polynesian origins are most immediately traced to people who arrived in the Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa region \u22483,000 B.P. and are clearly associated with the Lapita Cultural Complex. Although this scenario of the immediate origins of the Polynesians is generally accepted, the debate on the ultimate origin of the Polynesians and the Lapita cultural complex continues. Our previous research has shown that analyses of mtDNA variation in the Pacific rat (Rattus exulans), often transported as a food item in the colonizing canoes, are valuable for tracing prehistoric human migration within Polynesia. Here we present mtDNA phylogenies based on \u2248240 base pairs of the D-loop from both archaeological and modern samples collected from Island Southeast Asia and the Pacific. We identify three major haplogroups, two of which occur in the Pacific. Comparing our results with Lapita models of Oceanic settlement, we are able to reject two often cited but simplistic models, finding support instead for multifaceted models incorporating a more complex view of the Lapita intrusion. This study is unique and valuable in that R. exulans is the only organism associated with the Lapita dispersal for which there are sufficient ancient and extant populations available for genetic analysis. By tracking population changes through time, we can understand more fully the settlement process and population interactions in both Near and Remote Oceania.\n      </p>", "In the nineteenth century many Europeans saw Oceania as a sort of Paradise on earth. Exceptions were the Christian churches and their missionary branches. They looked at the \"heathen\" societies in this area as a virgin field to be Christianized. In the Tonga Islands in Western Polynesia, Roman Catholic missionaries arrived two decades after the Wesleyan Methodist (Protestant) missionaries. Both groups had the same aim, but they did not share the same ideology. This paper analyzes how they went on together.\n      </p>", "The current nominal species Nactus pelagicus represents a species complex that includes bisexual and unisexual populations. Four karyotypic morphs are known, but previous authors have noted that populations do not differ in gross external morphology. In this study, a comparison of samples from five bisexual and five unisexual populations confirms a high level of morphological uniformity (mensural and meristic) within and between samples. Morphological differences are slight but, in some cases, significantly different. Although the differences are slight, multivariate analyses (PCA, DFA) segregate some bisexual populations from unisexual ones and support the specific recognition of the bisexual populations (N. multicarinatus-southern Solomon Islands and Vanuatu) and the unisexual populations (N. pelagicus-southern Vanautu, New Caledonia, and Oceania). Lectotypes are designated, and type-localities are restricted for both species; each species is redescribed.\n      </p>", "Oceania is a diverse region encompassing Australia, Melanesia, Micronesia, New Zealand, and Polynesia, and it contains six of the world's 39 hotspots of diversity. It has a poor record for extinctions, particularly for birds on islands and mammals. Major causes include habitat loss and degradation, invasive species, and overexploitation. We identified six major threatening processes (habitat loss and degradation, invasive species, climate change, overexploitation, pollution, and disease) based on a comprehensive review of the literature and for each developed a set of conservation policies. Many policies reflect the urgent need to deal with the effects of burgeoning human populations (expected to increase significantly in the region) on biodiversity. There is considerable difference in resources for conservation, including people and available scientific information, which are heavily biased toward more developed countries in Oceania. Most scientific publications analyzed for four threats (habitat loss, invasive species, overexploitation, and pollution) are from developed countries: 88.6% of Web of Science publications were from Australia (53.7%), New Zealand (24.3%), and Hawaiian Islands (10.5%). Many island states have limited resources or expertise. Even countries that do (e.g., Australia, New Zealand) have ongoing and emerging significant challenges, particularly with the interactive effects of climate change. Oceania will require the implementation of effective policies for conservation if the region's poor record on extinctions is not to continue. /// Ocean\u00eda en una regi\u00f3n diversa que comprende Australia, Melanesia, Micronesia, Nueva Zelanda y Polinesia, y contiene seis de las 39 regiones de importancia para la biodiversidad del mundo.

For many prehistorians the distribution of Lapita sherds identifies the expansion of Austronesian-speaking populations through Oceania. This article addresses the Lapita language question by exploring the implications of the relationship among gamma globulin (Gm) genetics, paleoenvironments, malaria, natural selection, and prehistoric settlement patterns. Archeological sites with Lapita ceramics are consistently located in coastal lowlands, which in some parts of Oceania would have been malarious areas. Drawing on recent evidence that Austronesian-speaking populations in Near Oceania possess a genetic advantage over Non-Austronesian speakers with regard to malaria, we contend that Austronesian speakers have been able to occupy - on a permanent basis - malarious coastal lowlands that were detrimental to Non-Austronesian speakers. It follows, therefore, that the inhabitants of those Lapita sites spoke one or more of the Austronesian languages.\n      </p>", "Subsistence agriculture in the Pacific Islands has a complex prehistory centered on western Melanesia. Based on an analysis of cultigen provenience, a sequential model of a three-tiered crop structure of indigenous agricultural systems has been derived: (1) The independent early domestication of endemic species in the New Guinea region; (2) introduction of species from Southeast Asia; (3) the advent of American crop plants. The temporal sequence has archaeological and linguistic confirmation of 10 000 years ago for the beginnings of agriculture, 6000 years for Southeast Asian introduction, with the sweet potato contributing in Polynesia in prehistory, and in Melanesia only in post-Columbian times. Recent research directed toward issues of domestication in New Guinea and subsistence prehistory in Australia on three genera, Canarium, Colocasia and Ipomoea, exemplify under-recognized resources with quite different potentials for economic botany. Unlike past exploitation of indigenous plant resources, future users of plants such as those exemplified, and especially where commercialization is involved, cannot avoid addressing intellectual property rights that pertain to species domesticated, selected or conserved by peoples of the non-industrialized world.\n      </p>", "Existing archaeobotanical and palynological records of plant use in the northern New Guinea lowlands are reviewed in light of recent work at Kuk and theoretical refocusing on plant use practice. A practice-based approach is supported as the most useful way of investigating the highly problematical area of tropical plant food production. The existing direct record of past plant use in lowland New Guinea is considered woefully inadequate to achieve this task, as is that in Near Oceania and Island Southeast Asia. Archaeobotanical methods exist to fill the void, but full implementation requires a change in general archaeological and palaeoecological practice.\n      </p>", "Populations of the Bar-tailed Godwit (Limosa lapponica; Scolopacidae) embark on some of the longest migrations known among birds. The baueri race breeds in western Alaska and spends the nonbreeding season a hemisphere away in New Zealand and eastern Australia; the menzbieri race breeds in Siberia and migrates to western and northern Australia. Although the Siberian birds are known to follow the coast of Asia during both migrations, the southern pathway followed by the Alaska breeders has remained unknown. Two questions have particular ecological importance: (1) do Alaska godwits migrate directly across the Pacific, a distance of 11 000 km? and (2) are they capable of doing this in a single flight without stopping to rest or refuel? We explored six lines of evidence to answer these questions. The distribution of resightings of marked birds of the baueri and menzbieri races was significantly different between northward and southward flights with virtually no marked baueri resighted along the Asian mainland during southward migration. The timing of southward migration of the two races further indicates the absence of a coastal Asia route by baueri with peak passage of godwits in general occurring there a month prior to the departure of most birds from Alaska. The use of a direct route across the Pacific is also supported by significantly more records of godwits reported from within a direct migration corridor than elsewhere in Oceania, and during the September to November period than at other times of the year. The annual but rare occurrence of Hudsonian Godwits (L. haemastica) in New Zealand and the absence of their records along the Asian mainland also support a direct flight and are best explained by Hudsonian Godwits accompanying Bar-tailed Godwits from known communal staging areas in Alaska. Flight simulation models, extreme fat loads, and the apparent evolution of a wind-selected migration from Alaska further support a direct, nonstop flight. /// Las poblaciones de Limosa lapponica (Scolopacidae) se embarcan en una de las migraciones m\u00e1s largas conocidas para aves. La raza baueri cr\u00eda en el oeste de Alaska y pasa la estaci\u00f3n no reproductiva a un hemisferio de distancia en Nueva Zelanda y el este de Australia; la raza menzbieri cr\u00eda en Siberia y migra hacia el oeste y el norte de Australia. Aunque se sabe que las aves de Siberia siguen la costa de Asia durante ambas migraciones, la ruta meridional que siguen las aves reproductivas de Alaska ha permanecido desconocida. Dos preguntas tienen particular importancia ecol\u00f3gica: (1) \u00bflas aves de Alaska migran directamente a trav\u00e9s de Pac\u00edfico, a lo largo de 11 000 km? y (2) \u00bfson capaces de hacerlo en un \u00fanico vuelo sin parar a descansar y reabastecerse? Exploramos seis l\u00edneas de evidencia para responder a estas preguntas. La distribuci\u00f3n de avistamientos de aves marcadas de las razas baueri y menzbieri fue significativamente diferente entre vuelos hacia el norte y el sur, sin que hubiera pr\u00e1cticamente un solo avistamiento de individuos marcados de baueri a lo largo del continente asi\u00e1tico durante la migraci\u00f3n hacia el sur. El per\u00edodo de la migraci\u00f3n hacia el sur de ambas razas indica la ausencia de una ruta costera asi\u00e1tica para baueri, con un pico en el paso de las aves ocurriendo all\u00ed un mes antes de la partida de la mayor\u00eda de las aves desde Alaska. El uso de una ruta directa a trav\u00e9s del Pac\u00edfico tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 avalado por un n\u00famero significativamente mayor de aves reportadas para un corredor migratorio directo que para cualquier otro lugar de Ocean\u00eda, y para el per\u00edodo entre septiembre y noviembre que para otros momentos del a\u00f1o. La presencia anual, aunque rara, de L. haemastica en Nueva Zelanda y la ausencia de registros a lo largo del continente asi\u00e1tico tambi\u00e9n avalan la posibilidad de un vuelo directo y se explican mejor por el hecho de que L. haemastica acompa\u00f1a a L. lapponica desde \u00e1reas de escala comunes en Alaska.

An exception was the monophyletic \"Pacific clade\" (PC) of pigs not previously linked to any specific location. We examined mtDNA sequences of two varieties of Vanuatu sacred pigs, the male pseudohermaphroditic Narave from the island of Malo (n = 9) and the hairless Kapia from the island of Tanna (n = 9), as well as control pigs (n = 21) from the islands of Malo, Tanna, and Epi and compared them with GenBank sequences to determine (i) the distribution of PC and introduced domestic lineages within Vanuatu, (ii) relationship between the Narave and Kapia, and (iii) origin of the PC. All of the Narave share two PC mtDNA sequences, one of which matches the sequence of a Narave collected in 1927, consistent with an unbroken maternal descent of these intersex pigs from the original pigs brought to Vanuatu 3,200 years ago. One-third of the Kapia share a single PC lineage also found in the Narave. The remaining Kapia lineages are associated with recently introduced, globally distributed domestic breeds. The predominant Narave lineage is also shared with two wild boars from Vietnam. These data suggest that PC pigs were recently domesticated within Southeast Asia and dispersed during the human colonization of Remote Oceania associated with the Lapita cultural complex. More extensive sampling of Southeast Asian wild boar diversity may refine the location of Pacific pig domestication and potentially the proximate homeland of the Lapita cultural complex.\n      </p>", "Archaeological evidence for prehistoric strategies of marine exploitation in Oceania may be profitably analyzed from an ecological perspective, in which individual sites and assemblages are viewed in the context of adaptation to local environmental constraints. This perspective is illustrated through the contrastive analysis of environment, technology, and faunal remains at three prehistoric Hawaiian sites. Differing strategies of marine exploitation evidenced for each site are shown to reflect local marine environmental conditions. An ecological approach shows greater promise for an understanding of prehistoric adaptation to marine environment than the typological analyses current in much archaeological work on fishing.\n      </p>", "Dumont d'Urville's 1832 popular division of Oceania into the enduring 'provinces' of Melanesia, Polynesia and Micronesia created a geographic and intellectual framework for much recent and previous research in the social sciences. Despite criticism and alternative renderings, there is no evidence that Dumont d'Urville's tripartite division of the Pacific, now more than 170 years old, is in any danger of being replaced. It is necessary, therefore, to periodically re-examine the historical development of his three geo-culture areas and the conceptual issues that arise from their deployment in modern contexts.\n      </p>", "Oceania is a diverse region consisting of 29 countries, all of which are islands; its total population is approximately 379 million people.

A major task for Business Ethics in this region is to seed the development of the field in countries in which development has not yet begun, and to assist development where it is nascent.

The \u201ctypical\u201d rails of this region comprise a diverse assemblage of long-billed species variously placed in the genera Rallus, Lewinia, Nesoclopeus, Gallirallus, Habropteryx, Tricholimnas, Aramidopsis, Amaurornis, Eulabeornis, and Habroptila. I present a phylogenetic hypothesis for this group based on Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses of 12S, control region, and cytochrome-b data obtained from museum specimens (frozen tissues, toe pads from study skins, and bones from archaeological sites) of living and extinct species. All previously recognized genera are either monotypic or non-monophyletic, and I advocate lumping nearly all species into a broadly defined Gallirallus sensu lato. Volant species are not paraphyletic with respect to nearly all flightless species. Instead flightless species branch off in rapid succession from lineages leading to extant volant species. The nesting of the flightless species G. pendiculentus with G. philippensis suggests that the flightless condition may evolve prior to reproductive isolation. A locally calibrated relaxed molecular clock indicates that species from Oceania evolved only within the last 400,000 years, supporting the hypothesis that speciation proceeds rapidly in flightless rails. These results help resolve a long-standing taxonomic quagmire and have important implications for Pacific biogeography and the tempo and mode of speciation in island birds.\n         Las especies de Rallidae no voladoras vivientes y extintas del Pac\u00edfico se cuentan entre los ejemplos de grupos con mayor cantidad de especies que han presentado evoluci\u00f3n en paralelo en los vertebrados.

Some analogies can be seen between certain sophisticated strategies of decollectivizing employers and state strategies of Oceania in Orwell's 1984, though there are many limits to such analogies and indeed to the success of decollectivist strategies, due to the contradiction between rhetoric and actions, employees' exposure to other discourses and the potential for union response and renewal.

Five of the research team were interviewed by a sixth member in an open, semi-structured interview format, and the data were analysed thematically. The primary learning for the team, with wider implications for others in development research and practice, is that if the aim is to produce credible findings from investigations of this nature, it is important to exhibit a high degree of transparency regarding the role and position of each researcher, and an explicit attempt to be reflexive in relation to the associated challenges.\n      </p>", "This ethnographic study of a participatory video workshop conducted with rural women in Fiji observed how communities engage with processes of production for empowerment, and the implications for dialogue, community building, and representation within Fiji's fragmented multicultural society.

Highstand conditions were reached in widely spaced island groups by the interval 4000-3000 BC, and probably peaked near 2000 BC as inferred from global isostatic calculations, but persisted longer within the interior of the Pacific Ocean basin than along its western margin. Post-mid-Holocene sea level began to decline by 1200 BC along fringing island arcs of both the northwest and southwest Pacific, but highstand conditions persisted until AD 800 in the Tuamotu Archipelago along the eastern edge of Polynesia, and until near 0 BC/AD in intervening island groups. On intra-Pacific atoll and barrier reefs, stable islets of modern configuration could not form on emergent mid-Holocene paleoreef flats until after the crossover date, at which declining high-tide level fell below mid-Holocene low-tide level. Crossover dates range AD 500-1400 depending upon geographic position and tidal range for different island groups. Human settlement of Pacific Oceania followed close on the heels of the mid-Holocene sea-level highstand, as attractive coastal environments evolved, but there were long pauses in human migration, of 1500 years in each case, between occupation of the Lapita region, extending into the southwest Pacific as far as West Polynesia, and the island groups of East Polynesia, and between occupation of the western fringe of Micronesia in the northwest Pacific and the island groups that reach eastward into the central Pacific. The long pause in prehistoric migrations can be ascribed to prolongation of highstand conditions within intra-Pacific island groups, where island habitability was adversely affected by persistence of highstand conditions and occupation was unattractive until highstand conditions waned.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "The prehistory of Oceania is best approached through the cooperation of a number of disciplines, including archaeology, physical anthropology, linguistics, ethnology, and ethnobotany, to name perhaps the major five.

This chronicle describes the major socio-demographic and health trends since the 1950s in the region as a whole, in its four sub-regions (Melanesia, Micronesia, Polynesia and Australia-New Zealand) and, where possible, in each country. The most reliable recent data are given in an statistical appendix. An introductory presentation of the region's geographical, institutional and economic diversity is followed by a description of demographic growth rates, population size and structure, nuptiality, fertility and its determinants, mortality (overall, infant, maternal), child health, migration, urbanization and access to education. As in the other regions of the world, the demographic regimes in Oceania have diversified over the last two decades. Natural growth is slowing down, but still ranges between 0.6% and more than 2% per year in the different countries. Fertility is declining everywhere, but levels are highly contrasting (around 2 children per woman in six countries, above 4 in seven others). Life expectancy is also increasing, but varies between 61 years in the subregion of Melanesia and 80 years in Australia-New Zealand. Likewise, infant mortality ranges from 5 to 50 per 1,000. The proportion of urban dwellers is quite small in most of the island countries. Migration has played a major role in the population dynamics of Oceania, and continues to do so, notably through the emigration of young adults. Access to education is practically universal in the vast majority of countries.

However, the pathways of these dispersal events are not well understood. We sought to elucidate such a pathway for the plant genus Metrosideros Banks ex Gaertn., which appears to have colonized Hawaii from New Zealand. Location We have previously analysed the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence of nrDNA for thirty-six taxa of Metrosideros subgenus Metrosideros distributed across Melanesia and Polynesia. Further we collected two taxa from the Austral and Marquesas Islands. Methods Phylogenetic analysis was undertaken using both the ITS and external transcribed spacer (ETS) regions of nrDNA for twenty-three taxa from Polynesia and East Melanesia. Results The increased resolution achieved by combining ETS data with that of ITS allowed discrimination of two subclades in eastern Oceania. One subclade groups all the Hawaiian taxa together with M. collina (J. R. &amp; G. Forst.) A. Gray from the Marquesas Islands. Main conclusions From an origin in New Zealand, the woody angiosperm Metrosideros is likely to have crossed the equator to Hawaii using a staging point in the remote Marquesas Islands. Colonization of Hawaii by the wind-borne seed of these plants has been achieved against the flow of the prevailing Trade winds north of the equator.

It argues that the essential context for understanding these trends lies in the limits to genuine self-determination imposed by the process of decolonization itself, and by the universalized ideas of state and nation it introduced. Despite their awkward fit with indigenous institutions and practices, these institutions are continually reinforced through significant international pressures including intervention.

Implicit in most discussions of this phenomenon is a standard wave-of-advance model founded on demographic growth and the economic advantage provided by food production. The Lapita movement is also routinely embedded within a much larger narrative of the expansion of Austronesian languages and peoples out of Southeast Asia into Island Melanesia and ultimately east through East Polynesia. Although this simple narrative is very attractive, as more data become available, the details of segments of the \u201cAustronesian\u201d expansion require revision in order to reconcile the data from archaeology, linguistics, and biology. This paper looks closely at recent data on the Lapita portion of the \u201cAustronesian\u201d expansion and concludes that it is best explained as a leapfrog rather than a wave-of-advance movement out of New Guinea into Remote Oceania. This has important implications for those interested in modeling linguistic and biological variation in the region and highlights the potential importance of historical accident over process in our understanding of culture history.\n      </p>", "Scholarly views on the prehistory of the Pacific Islanders are currently undergoing a major shift in perspective and underlying assumptions. This shift is driven by new research data and a need for new theoretical perspectives on space, time, and causal process. A new research agenda is coming to the fore, replacing the agenda guiding Pacific studies since the 1950s. Instead of looking at these islands as remote, undeveloped human colonies scattered across a vast and empty expanse of sea, we are finding that the Pacific was a notably early sphere of human accomplishments, on land and sea, where the ocean was more an avenue than a barrier for cultural interchange. The roots of this new perspective can be traced back, in part, to the Wenner-Gren/Smithsonian conference on human biogeography held in Washington, D.C., in 1974.\n      </p>", "Mangaia (Cook Islands) consists of a weathered volcanic interior encircled by limestones known as the makatea. Excavations at Tangatatau Rockshelter (site MAN-44), located on the inner cliff of the makatea, produced a stratified sequence of Polynesian artifacts and faunal remains ranging from A.D. 1000-1100 to A.D. 1500-1600. Resident species of birds represented at MAN-44 include nine seabirds (at least three extirpated on Mangaia) and 12 land birds (eight extirpated or extinct). Seven of the extinct/extirpated land birds are confined to the site's four lowest stratigraphic zones, which represent the first 200-300 yr of human occupation at MAN-44. During this time, human exploitation of vertebrates switched from primarily native land birds to almost exclusively small reef fish, domesticates (chickens, pigs), and commensals (rats). Sediment cores from a lake 0.9 km from MAN-44 show clear palynological and stratigraphic signals of human presence on Mangaia, especially forest clearance of the volcanic interior, beginning at 1600 yr B.P. The rugged makatea must have provided a forest refuge for birds during the first 700 yr of human presence, after which Mangaians exploited the previously little used makatea because forest resources (trees, other plants, birds) had been depleted on the now badly eroded volcanic interior. MAN-44 is the oldest archaeological site known on Mangaia. Whether other species of birds were lost in the period of human activity that preceded occupation of MAN-44 remains to be seen.\n      </p>", "This article compares theories of knowledge and strategies for cultural transmission implicit in Pohnpei and American models of education.

Using examples from Pohnpei, Micronesia, I show how notions of superior and inferior are compounded through several sign systems - spatial relations, food sharing, the body, and language. These systems act oppositionally as well as cooperatively to produce situated ideas of social inequality, ideas built out of disequilibrium of bodies in space, of referents in language, and distribution of resources, as well as contradictions in the interactions of these signs. The compounding of signs not only recruits multiple sensory modes and perspectives in the exposition of hierarchical relations, but entails a notion of the contradictory nature of status relations. Using examples from a Pohnpeian feast, I explore the creative interplay of sign systems in the construction of \"moments\" of hierarchy in a large, public setting and discuss how through the practice of title-giving, which virtually every adult member of the society participates in, a particular idea of social inequality, built out of multiple sign systems, is mapped onto each body.\n      </p>", "This article discusses from an ethnological point of view Jules Verne's presentation of burials in non-European cultures, where one or more persons die voluntarily or not in a ritual act.

There are some 350 islands of volcanic and coralline origin that range from Babeldaob at 333 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (about 80% of Palau's total land area) to others, unnamed, that are less than one hectare. A barrier reef encircles most of the archipelago creating a lagoon up to 20 km wide. The majority of the islands are uninhabited, accessible with difficulty only by boat at high tide, and are densely vegetated over steep, rocky terrain. Because of their proximity to the Philippines, New Guinea, the Moluccas, and Borneo, the Palau islands host a significantly richer herpetofauna with more unique taxa than is found on other Pacific islands to the east. As with most other Pacific island groups, however, the herpetofauna has been poorly documented. Since the earliest investigations that began in the nineteen century, Palau's herpetofauna has been uncovered piecemeal. No sustained field effort had been conducted until we began a systematic survey of the islands in 1992. Since then we have collected in Palau every month of the year at least once. This checklist of 46 species of reptiles and amphibians includes almost twice as many taxa as were known from Palau (Owen, 1977) at the beginning of our study. Among these are new species or Palauan records of Gehyra, Hemiphyllodactylus, Lepidodactylus, Nactus, Perochirus, Emoia and Sphenomorphus. Because of the difficulties in surveying so many islands we believe that additional taxa and distributional records await discovery; even the smallest island in Palau can turn up surprises. Nonetheless, it is appropriate to consolidate what is now known about this intriguing fauna and environment. We provide an historical summary of previous collecting efforts, an overview of the islands' geology and habitats, and for each species account we include distributional information, taxonomic and systematic discussion, natural history observations, and a comprehensive bibliography.\n      </p>", "The Pacific Islands or Oceania, typically subdivided into Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia, have witnessed a virtual explosion of archaeological research, as indicated by this review of the past 5 years' literature. Most recent work centers on one or more of six major themes. Two themes are concerned with the movement of people into the Pacific region: the discovery of Pleistocene-age sites in island Melanesia and the search for early assemblages evidencing Austronesian dispersals. Substantial efforts have abo focused on reconstructing prehistoric economic behavior and on assessing the impacts that colonizing human populations had on isolated and fragile island ecosystems. In the realm of social archaeology, Oceanic studies have contributed to understanding the long-term dimensions of interisland exchange and to the rise of complex, hierarchical sociopolitical systems, especially chiefdoms.\n      </p>", "The human colonization of the Pacific is an enduring problem in historical anthropology. Recent advances in archaeology historical linguistics, and bioanthropology have coalesced to form a set of models for population movements and interactions in Oceania, which have been tested on independent data sets. Earliest human movements into Near Oceania began about 40,000 years ago, resulting in great cultural, linguistic, and genetic diversity in this region. About 4000 years ago, the expansion of Austronesian speakers out of Southeast Asia led to the emergence of the Lapita cultural complex in Near Oceania. The Lapita expansion into Remote Oceania, commencing about 1200 BC, led ultimately to the settlement of the vast eastern Pacific, ending with the colonization of New Zealand about AD 1250. Polynesians probably reached the coast of South America, returning with the sweet potato and possibly the bottle gourd. Polynesian influences on New World cultures remain a topic of debate.\n      </p>", "The underlying structure of discriminations in the classification of siblings has received considerable attention. Prior research has demonstrated the tendency of patterns of sibling classification to persist, often for thousands of years, in groups of societies that speak related languages. In this paper it is shown that a sample of 223 societies from Island Oceania exhibits 11 structural types of sibling classification linked in a developmental chain. Some of these types are rare and highly localized; others are common and regionally widespread. As one moves from west to east the number of types systematically decreases. The distributional data are examined in light of current knowledge of Oceanic culture history. The linguistic and archaeological materials are found consistent with the \"ethnographic fact\" under study, and it is argued that the history of interisland and interregional contact in Oceania is more complex than has generally been thought. In conclusion, a case is made for a probable developmental sequence of structural patterns of sibling classification in Island Oceania that accords with most of the information reviewed.\n      </p>", "In Allen's world-historical theory of kinship, humanity began with a tetradic-Dravidian system based on cross-cousin marriage and defined by alternate generation, prescriptive, and classificatory equations. In the course of time the dominant trend has been towards the irreversible breakdown of these equations in just this order. Comparative linguistic evidence is obviously crucial for an evaluation of Allen's theory and for similar grand theories of irreversible change in kinship systems. This article presents some linguistic evidence from Oceania, a part of the world not covered in the recent symposium on transformations of kinship systems (Godelier, Trautmann &amp; Tjon Sie Fat 1998). The Polynesian evidence shows, consistent with Allen's theory, that leftward movements towards the Dravidian pole are unusual and can be explained as substratum effects. But the broader Oceanic evidence shows, contrary to Allen's theory, that endogenous developments of Dravidian systems, although they may be improbable, are indeed possible. / Selon la th\u00e9orie historique mondiale de la parent\u00e9 d'Allen, l'humanit\u00e9 a commenc\u00e9 avec un syst\u00e8me t\u00e9tradique-dravidien fond\u00e9 sur le mariage entre cousins crois\u00e9s et d\u00e9fini par des \u00e9quations prescriptives et classificatoires entre g\u00e9n\u00e9rations altern\u00e9es.

Spauligodon hemidactylus n. sp. represents the 31st species to be described for this genus and is distinguished by the low number of tail filament spines of the female and the presence of unequal knobs on the egg. This is the first report of the genus Spauligodon from Oceania.\n      </p>", "The linguistic anthropology of Oceania has seen vigorous and productive analysis of language ideologies, ritual performance, personhood, and agency. This article points to three related paths of inquiry that are especially promising. First, language ideologies are analyzed for the ways they shape expectations and interpretations of effective action and social identity. Second, processes of entextualization are examined with reference to Bible translation because Christianity is a dominant social force in contemporary Oceania. Third, prominent recent work on personhood and agency is reviewed, and scholars are urged to reconsider the classic Oceanic term mana in relation to changing understandings of power, including those wrought by religious transformations. These paths of inquiry are intertwined and cross-cutting and can lead to productive new understandings of ideologies and practices of stability and transformation.\n      </p>", "This article critically engages with the recent diffusion of the orthodox development model in Oceania and highlights some evolving dilemmas. In particular, it explores the social, economic and ecological tensions arising from economic reforms that are exacerbating the fragility of already vulnerable nation-states and communities. In order to illustrate its arguments, a case study of the impacts of agro-export growth in Tonga is presented. Attention is drawn to the socially inequitable and ecologically unsustainable outcomes of rapid growth in this sector. In analyzing the political economy of the squash pumpkin sector, the authors point to the important role that culture plays in mediating and conditioning development outcomes. Reflecting on the Tongan case, it is argued that to better understand the implications of orthodox developmental reform in the region, research must seek to more explicitly incorporate distributional and ethical analysis.\n      </p>", "The possibility of tuna fish being an agent for the diffusion of the circular shell fishhook found in California and Oceania is discussed. Data from the latter area indicate a specific type of hook and of fishing technique for these fish, suggesting that the circular shell hook would not be used in this way. The experimental evidence of Robinson (1942) and Glidden (Heye 1921) and an examination of the function of fishhooks further suggest that the circular shell hooks function best in a different subenvironment of the sea and for a different group of fish than the tunas. While it is impossible to state unequivocally that the tunas could not be the agents of diffusion for this hook, the specificity of the existing tuna-fishing techniques and the evidence for a different use of the circular hook make it more improbable than is suggested by Heizer or Landberg.\n      </p>", "Inter-archipelago exchange networks were an important aspect of prehistoric Polynesian societies. We report here a novel genetic characterization of a prehistoric exchange network involving an endemic Pacific island tree snail, Partula hyalina. It occurs in the Society (Tahiti only), Austral and Southern Cook Islands. Our genetic data, based on museum, captive and wild-caught samples, establish Tahiti as the source island. The source lineage is polymorphic in shell coloration and contains a second nominal species, the dark-shelled Partula clara, in addition to the white-shelled P. hyalina. Prehistoric inter-island introductions were non-random: they involved white-shelled snails only and were exclusively inter-archipelago in scope. Partulid shells were commonly used in regional Polynesian jewellery, and we propose that the white-shelled P. hyalina, originally restricted to Tahiti, had aesthetic value throughout these archipelagoes. Demand within the Society Islands could be best met by trading dead shells, but a low rate of inter-archipelago exchange may have prompted the establishment of multiple founder populations in the Australs and Southern Cooks. The alien carnivorous land snail Euglandina rosea has recently devastated populations of all 61 endemic species of Society Island partulid snails. Southern Cooks and Australs P. hyalina now represent the only unscathed wild populations remaining of this once spectacular land snail radiation.\n      </p>", "Archived blood fractions (plasma, settled red cells, white cells) have proved to be a rich and valuable source of DNA for human genetic studies. Large numbers of such samples were collected between 1960 and the present for protein and blood group studies, many of which are languishing in freezers or have already been discarded. More are discarded each year because the usefulness of these samples is not widely understood. Data from DNA derived from 10-35-year-old blood samples have been used to address the peopling of the New World and of the Pacific. Mitochondrial DNA haplotypes from studies using this source DNA support a single wave of migration into the New World (or a single source population for the New World), and that Mongolia was the likely source of the founding population. Data from Melanesia have shown that Polynesians are recent immigrants into the Pacific and did not arise from Melanesia.\n      </p>", "Taro planthoppers (Tarophagus spp.) may be associated exclusively or primarily with taro (Colocasia esculenta), and the geographical distribution of T. proserpina provides circumstantial evidence that taro is native to the Sahul continental region (as well as being native to Sunda). T. colocasiae (Matsumura) (Asche and Wilson 1989a, b) is reported here for the first time in Australia, and the genus Tarophagus is reported for the first time on the wildtype form of taro (C. esculenta). Three species of taro plant hopper are present in Asia and the Pacific. T. proserpina has a relatively narrow distribution extending from eastern New Guinea to Polynesia (Remote Oceania). This distribution adds support to the suggestion that Polynesian taros are derived from a Melanesian taro gene pool. It is tentatively suggested that different Tarophagus species evolved in association with different taro gene pools, before the domestication of taro in multiple regions within Asia and the Pacific. Plant viruses associated with taro and Tarophagus are also discussed.\n      </p>", "Tropical Pacific island streams have poorly understood communities that deserve scientific attention. We examined benthic macroinvertebrates and fishes of the Inem River on Kosrae, Federated States of Micronesia. Larval chironomids, lepidopterans, odonates, and freshwater shrimps dominated the benthos and drift. Diel periodicity in drift was not evident. Nine fishes, two shrimps, and one snail species were identified. Kosrae's stream fauna appears even more depauperate than other Pacific high islands, possible due to its extreme isolation.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Students awarded scholarships study at tertiary institutions throughout the Pacific, including New Zealand. But what is it like when they return home, fitting back into their culture and family life, and finding work? The research described in this article explored this question in relation to women graduates from Vanuatu when they returned after studying overseas for three or more years. Some slipped back in easily and found work quickly; others experienced profound culture shock on re-entry and took many months to find suitable work. If Vanuatu is to make the best possible use of these women's tertiary qualifications, and if donors are to realise the goals of their scholarship scheme, necessary changes include more co-ordinated support and regular tracer studies.\n      </p>", "A wide range of audiences now accesses Indigenous community radio and television across Australia. This article draws from the first-ever audience study of the sector, 'Community Media Matters', completed in 2007. It reveals that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander media offer an essential service to communities and play a central organising role in community life. Although previous studies into the Australian Indigenous media sector have suggested this, it is the first time that audiences from the cities to the most remote parts of the continent have had a chance to confirm the importance of locally produced media in their lives. This has revealed new insights into the nature of the relationship between audiences and the producers of Indigenous community radio and television.\n      </p>", "As a result of globalisation and changing technologies, young people are increasingly required to engage with the broader world beyond their local and national communities. This raises significant questions about the ways and spaces in which young people will need to engage as active citizens, and the new tools and resources that young people will need to equip them for their futures. The Global Connections Program has been developed to address these identified needs. It is a youth-led global learning initiative which aims to provide an opportunity for connection and learning among young people in Australia and Indonesia. This article explores Plan's youth-led approach to global learning, with a focus on the implementation and evaluation findings of the Global Connections Program, as well as the challenges faced thus far.\n      </p>", "This article presents a critical analysis of what caused the failure of Australia's first Community Forest Management (CFM) trial. We explore how 'community' was conceptualised and represented through the dynamic CFM process, leading to contradictions and conflicts that could not be resolved. We examine the governance structures and institutions that were created to try to enable community participation in forest management. Ambiguity and uncertainty in the power and purpose of the CFM organisation, as well as power relationships within the organisation, all contributed to conflicts that eventually tore the CFM process apart.\n      </p>", "This paper examines the analytical concept of the \"house\" which has recently been featured as providing a better understanding of some types of social structure. Initially this concept was introduced by Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss with the aim of offering an alternative to descent theory in kinship systems lacking strictly unilineal principles. Following L\u00e9vi-Strauss, a rather heterogenous multitude of \"house\"-societies has meanwhile been described in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific. In this article, general as well as particular features of the \"house\" are examined in a number of societies. The comparative analysis suggests that although the \"house\" might prove to be an important theoretical tool in several instances, it cannot be regarded as a definite escape from both alliance and descent theory, because in many cases it seems to run the risk of becoming quite arbitrary.\n      </p>", "In 1987, two coups d'\u00e9tat took place in Fiji, which is a multicultural state characterized by two leading ethnic groups. These are the Fijians, who are the original Melanesians, and the Indo-Fijians, who are the descendants of plantation workers and free immigrants from India during the colonial period. The goal of the insurgencies was to reinforce the Paramountcy of Fijian Interests. Until now the Indo-Fijians fight for equal rights. The Fijians themselves are also divided along traditional rivalries. The aftermath of colonial times led to a third coup in the year 2000. In 2006 new tensions between the government and the Fiji Military Forces broke out. Six years after the last political crisis Fiji is standing on the edge of another conflict.\n      </p>", "This article examines a 40-year history of women's organising in Fiji, in order to show how the political goals pursued by active citizens can be shaped by an interplay of domestic and international political contingencies. This approach challenges the common and somewhat idealised definitions of active citizenship that focus upon actors' capacity to mobilise collectively behind political goals independent of those that motivate the state or the market. Rather, active citizenship is viewed as a realm of political activity constituted in ways that both reflect and contest contingent factors prevailing globally and locally.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Linguists studying the Austronesian languages claim to demonstrate a human migration out of southern China, Taiwan or the northern Philippines that transformed the peoples and cultures of the Pacific.

The precise origins and dispersal routes of the Austronesian peoples and the associated Lapita culture remain contentious, and numerous disparate models of dispersal (based primarily on linguistic, genetic, and archeological data) have been proposed. Here, through the use of mtDNA from 781 modern and ancient Sus specimens, we provide evidence for an early human-mediated translocation of the Sulawesi warty pig (Sus celebensis) to Flores and Timor and two later separate human-mediated dispersals of domestic pig (Sus scrofa) through Island Southeast Asia into Oceania. Of the later dispersal routes, one is unequivocally associated with the Neolithic (Lapita) and later Polynesian migrations and links modern and archeological Javan, Sumatran, Wallacean, and Oceanic pigs with mainland Southeast Asian S. scrofa. Archeological and genetic evidence shows these pigs were certainly introduced to islands east of the Wallace Line, including New Guinea, and that so-called \"wild\" pigs within this region are most likely feral descendants of domestic pigs introduced by early agriculturalists. The other later pig dispersal links mainland East Asian pigs to western Micronesia, Taiwan, and the Philippines. These results provide important data with which to test current models for human dispersal in the region.\n      </p>", "Much human adaptation depends on the gradual accumulation of culturally transmitted knowledge and technology. Recent models of this process predict that large, well-connected populations will have more diverse and complex tool kits than small, isolated populations. While several examples of the loss of technology in small populations are consistent with this prediction, it found no support in two systematic quantitative tests. Both studies were based on data from continental populations in which contact rates were not available, and therefore these studies do not provide a test of the models. Here, we show that in Oceania, around the time of early European contact, islands with small populations had less complicated marine foraging technology. This finding suggests that explanations of existing cultural variation based on optimality models alone are incomplete because demography plays an important role in generating cumulative cultural adaptation. It also indicates that hominin populations with similar cognitive abilities may leave very different archaeological records, a conclusion that has important implications for our understanding of the origin of anatomically modern humans and their evolved psychology.\n      </p>", "A new species of Collocalia (Aves: Apodidae) is based on six fossils recovered from a Holocene rockshelter deposit on Mangaia, Cook Islands. The coracoid and carpometacarpus of the new species, C. manuoi, are larger and very different qualitatively from those of the extant C sawtelli on Atiu, Cook Islands, the geographically nearest population of Collocalia.
