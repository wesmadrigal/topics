Some organizations establish enterprise architecture (EA) standards to enable greater compatibility of information technology (IT) components and integration of applications and data across the enterprise. Through a firm-level survey, we sought to answer two key questions about the use of EA standards: (1) How do different governance mechanisms affect the use of EA standards? and (2) To what extent does the use of EA standards help organizations to improve the sharing and integration of IT resources across the enterprise? We identified four key governance mechanisms for EA standards management and examined how each mechanism affected the use of EA standards. We also examined how th\u00e8 use of EA standards affects the management of IT infrastructure, applications, and data resources across business units. Our empirical results showed that the use of EA standards is effective in heiping organizations to better manage their IT resources. Our study also provides detailed insights into how organizations can set up governance mechanisms to facilitate the use of EA standards in achieving enterprisewide goals.\n      </p>", "The concept of \"vertical architecture\" defines the scope of a firm and the extent to which it is open to final and intermediate markets; it describes the configurations of transactional choices along a firm's value chain. A firm can make or buy inputs, and transfer outputs downstream or sell them. Permeable vertical architectures are partly integrated and partly open to the markets along a firm's value chain. Increased permeability enables more effective use of resources and capacities, better matching of capabilities with market needs, and benchmarking to improve efficiency. Partial integration promotes a more dynamic, open innovation platform and enhances strategic capabilities by linking key parts of the value chain. This permeable vertical architecture, accompanied by appropriate transfer prices and incentive design, facilitates resource allocation and guides a firm's growth process. Our longitudinal study of a major European manufacturer suggests that to understand how firm boundaries are set and what their impacts are, we need to complement the microanalytic focus on transactions with a systemic analysis at the level of the firm. It also shows how, over and above transactional alignment, decisions about boundaries and vertical architectures can transform a firm's strategic and productive capabilities and prospects.\n      </p>", "The central hypothesis of this paper is that database design and systems design in general can be simplified considerably by tailoring the design methods to a suitable range of applications. Domain-specific knowledge can be incorporated into a specialized database architecture that leaves the designer only with the task of specifying the application-specific parts. Based on an analysis of business constraints, we propose such an architecture for the domain of business transaction processing. The architecture offers several data and transaction management services, special-purpose subdatabases, and design-checking rules to be used by the application designer. Two services, input management and audit and control services, are described in more detail.\n      </p>", "The seasonal progression of phenophases in 21 shrub species of the Chilean matorral was analyzed. Five \"modules\" or basic units that are responsible for the aboveground architecture of the plants were characterized. These modules appear to be organized in seven differnet spatial arrangements. In drought-deciduous species a module type with an \"absolute short shoot\" with limited apical growth, leafy or spiny, predominated. In evergreen species \"long shoot\" and \"temporal leafy short shoot\" module types were more frequent. The spatial arrangement of morphologically different modules and the temporal sequence of their formation allow a dynamic interpretation of the modular architecture of the plants.\n      </p>", "Shrubland communities in Central Spain were studied through classifying growth forms of woody species and determining the shared use of the ground in progressively smaller spaces. 516 plants belonging to the six most abundant species and taken from different sites were included in biometric measurements. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to detect the trends of variation in the architecture of plants. The individuals were classified on the basis of the results of the PCA and different morphological types were detected, mainly 'elliptical', 'spherical' or 'variable' according to their shape. These morphological types were adopted by most plants depending on their location and community. The horizontal occupation of space seems to be determined by whether or not the species rooted close to each other are able to occupy different strata. The co-occurrence of two species in a reduced space is not facilitated when the two species have the same architecture. Then a spatial segregation tends to occur at a fine scale. The results can be interpreted as an optimization strategy of the shrubland 'biomass/horizontal occupied area ratio', which can be maximized in different environmental situations. It can also help to explain the 'grain' size of the pattern of horizontal spatial organization of the shrubland.\n      </p>", "Crises, situations characterized by high consequence, low probability, and short decision time, create a unique and threatening decision-making environment that must be conscientiously supported. The aim of this study is to derive a prescriptive architecture for crisis response systems, in particular, the role of communication and the characteristics of communication systems that are needed to connect the decisionmaking elements of crisis response. The layered crisis communication architecture (CCA) detailed in this paper enumerates the communication functionality required of any crisis response system. To support the crisis-handling team adequately during crisis response, such systems must include the services of each of the described six layers: The base, or connectivity, layer interfaces with the ISO's OSI model to provide error-free end-to-end message transfer. The data-validation layer protects against incorrect data sources through gathering information to corroborate an incoming message. The filtering layer organizes and synthesizes messages to ensure that the crisis-handling team is presented with relevant data in a meaningful, usable form. The values layer interprets messages based on preestablished crisis priorities. The organizational memory layer provides decision makers with access to relevant data and knowledge bases. The group process layer supports the communication, coordination, and collaboration among the crisishandling team members. To support crisis response adequately, these six layers of the CCA must be implemented as a single, cohesive whole. Through the CCA, the study offers pragmatically sound principles for organizing crisis response systems and captures a comprehensive perspective of the crisis response process; that is, this work offers a system architecture. As an architecture, the model enumerates all the functions necessary to support crisis response communication effectively.\n      </p>", "Different forms of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal inoculum are found in soil patches with differing histories. These inoculum types include spores, infected root fragments, and extramatrical hyphae. Utilizing root observation chambers, detailed observations were made of the growth dynamics of mycorrhizal hyphae from inoculum sources to roots and the subsequent radiation out from individual colonized root segments. There were several types of hyphal architecture classified by whether the external hyphae were entering (infecting) a plant root or developing from the root surface and growing out into the soil matrix. Morphologically, individual hyphal filaments within all architectural types looked quite similar and clear architectural differences could only be identified when distinct sets of interconnected hyphal filaments were studied. The primary hyphal architectural types observed in the soil were classified as runner hyphae, hyphal bridges, absorptive hyphal networks, germ tubes, and infection networks produced by spores and root fragments. The specialized hyphal architectures of these fungal endophytes appear to be linked to the unique function of each hyphal type. Runner hyphae and infection networks from either spores or root fragments were observed to be capable of infecting new root segments. Absorptive hyphal networks were never observed to act as units of infection and were classified as structures primarily involved in the acquisition of soil resources. This high degree of specialization may help explain why vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are so efficient in their beneficial role of nutrient and water transport to the host plant.\n      </p>", "This paper investigates three research topics in military scenario training and implementation: (1) the functions what military scenarios can provide which can be implemented by training, and the knowledge content of military scenario training for specific procedure and tasks; (2) the appropriate architecture to develop military scenario training systems; (3) a system architecture that incorporates the function of scenario base, rule base, geographical database, and learning mechanism with geographical information systems to develop military scenario training. The prototype of proposed scenario training systems and an example of system functions is also presented.

The shape of fragmentary fossil material, such as single organs, may therefore give hints for the reconstruction of the architecture of a flower. This study is partly a review and partly provides original material and new points of view on organ-architecture interrelationships. Several topics are illustrated with examples: (1) autonomous and imprinted shape, exemplified by cuneate organs, especially stamens; (2) conditions for valvate anther dehiscence; (3) lability in number and shape of reduced organs that have decreased in size and lost their original function; (4) long hairs as filling material of irregular spaces; (5) architectural conditions for the presence of orthotropous ovules; (6) structural differences between exposed and covered organ parts in bud; and (7) sepal aestivation and petal elaboration.\n      </p>", "A model simulating the three-dimensional crown architecture of a plant was developed with the objective of assessing the light capture and whole-plant carbon gain consequences of leaf display in understory plants. This model uses geometrical measurements taken in the field to reconstruct the projected image of a plant so that light absorption from any direction can be assessed. The photon flux density (PFD) from a given direction was estimated from the canopy openness derived from hemispherical canopy photographs and equations simulating the daily course of direct and diffuse PFD. For diffuse PFD, the directional fluxes and absorbed PFD were integrated over 160 different directions representing 8 azimuth classes and 20 elevation angle classes. Direct PFD absorption was determined for the time that a solar track on a given day intersected a canopy gap. Assimilation rate was simulated for the sunlit and shaded parts of leaves separately and then summed to give the whole-plant carbon gain. Comparisons of simulations for a tropical forest edge species, Clidemia octona, and an understory species, Conostegia cinnamomea, illustrate the operation of the model and show that the edge species is more efficient at capturing side light while the understory species is slightly more efficient at capturing light from directly above, the predominant light direction in this environment. Self-shading within Conostegia crown and steep leaf angles in the Clidemia crown reduced light capture efficiencies for light from directly above. Whole-plant daily carbon gain was much higher in the forest edge site, mostly because of the additional PFD available in this site. However, simulations for both species in the understory light environment show that the higher light capture efficiencies of the understory species in this environment conferred a 27% advantage in carbon gain in this environment.\n      </p>", "Self-supporting plant stems are slender, erect structures that remain standing while growing in highly variable mechanical environments. Such ability is not merely related to an adapted mechanical design in terms of material-specific stiffness and stem tapering. As many terrestrial standing animals do, plant stems regulate posture through active and coordinated control of motor systems and acclimate their skeletal growth to prevailing loads. This analogy probably results from mechanical challenges on standing organisms in an aerial environment with low buoyancy and high turbulence. But the continuous growth of plants submits them to a greater challenge. In response to these challenges, land plants implemented mixed skeletal and motor functions in the same anatomical elements. There are two types of kinematic design: (1) plants with localized active movement (arthrophytes) and (2) plants with continuously distributed active movements (contortionists). The control of these active supporting systems involves gravi- and mechanoperception, but little is known about their coordination at the whole plant level. This more active view of the control of plant growth and form has been insufficiently considered in the modeling of plant architecture. Progress in our understanding of plant posture and mechanical acclimation will require new biomechanical models of plant architectural development.\n      </p>", "The narrative of Albert Kahn\u2019s rags-to-riches career, as previously told, suggests that his success was a matter of happenstance, augmented by a remarkable work ethic. The happenstance factor turns out to be a distortion resulting from the architect\u2019s innate humility and a need to downplay his relationship with Joseph Boyer for business reasons. Although Boyer did not hire him in 1900 to design a machine shop as widely believed, the industrialist was nonetheless integral to the careers of Albert and Julius Kahn as the brothers developed their respective niches in industrial work. Having experienced numerous setbacks and few triumphs in his first attempt at an architectural practice, Kahn specialized in industrial work as a determined act of reinvention made possible by Boyer. Chris Meister offers a fresh examination of the architect\u2019s work in the first years of the twentieth century and the role that his business partners played in shaping his career in Albert Kahn\u2019s Partners in Industrial Architecture.\n      </p>", "Information pollution is characterized as a major problem in modern organizations and in society at large.

The architecture and allometry of eight populations of mangrove tree saplings of seven species (1.5-3 m in height) were studied at Sungei Merbok, Kedah, Peninsular Malaysia. Three populations (Bruguiera cylindrica, Bruguiera parviflora and Rhizophora apiculata) were growing in shaded conditions, the other five (Avicennia alba, Rhizophora apiculata, Rhizophora mucronata, Sonneratia alba and Xylocarpus granatum) were in the open. 2. Comparisons were made between the population specific allometric regressions for dimension pairs of the form ln y = b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ln x + b&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. The bifurcation ratio (R&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;) for the-branching system of each sapling was calculated. 3. In the majority of the allometric regressions the populations differed significantly in b&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; but not b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, though some significant slope differences were found, particularly for regressions involving root dry weight. 4. The allometric analysis showed that for saplings of the same height, those growing in the shade had lower shoot dry weight and lower dry weight and area of leaves than the open-grown ones. The shaded saplings also exhibited a greater accumulation of foliage at the top of the plant. 5. Xylocarpus granatum was notable for a low investment in leaves, which was probably explained by recent flushing, and in roots, which may reflect the limited development of pneumatophores in this species. The shaded Bruguiera populations showed a relatively high root investment probably because of their abundant pneumatophore development. 6. When compared to published results of allometric analyses for shaded saplings from lowland tropical rain forest and warm temperate rain forest it was found that the shaded mangroves were consistently more similar to the unshaded mangroves than to the rain-forest saplings. This may be because the shaded mangroves were growing under higher average irradiances than those from the rain forests. It is argued, however, that mangrove species are inherently more likely to show an architecture better suited to high irradiance conditions than the majority of broad-leaved evergreen rain-forest trees.\n      </p>", "Distributed systems research, and in particular ubiquitous computing, has traditionally assumed the Internet as a basic underlying communications substrate. Recently, however, the networking research community has come to question the fundamental design or 'architecture' of the Internet. This has been led by two observations: first, that the Internet as it stands is now almost impossible to evolve to support new functionality; and second, that modern applications of all kinds now use the Internet rather differently, and frequently implement their own 'overlay' networks above it to work around its perceived deficiencies. In this paper, I discuss recent academic projects to allow disruptive change to the Internet architecture, and also outline a radically different view of networking for ubiquitous computing that such proposals might facilitate.\n      </p>", "We describe the leaf architecture (venation and cuticle) of the eight extant species of Argentinean Proteaceae and discuss the diagnostic value of the characters. Proteaceae leaves are characterized by several architectural features. The leaves are ovate to oblong\u2010lanceolate or elliptic, with coriaceous texture, and have normal\u2010marginal petiole; the apexes vary between acute and obtuse, while the bases are acute to decurrent. They have pinnate simple first\u2010category venation, lack agrophic veins, have well\u2010developed areoles, and have two\u2010or\u2010more\u2010branched freely ending ultimate veins. Furthermore, all species have brachyparacytic stomata restricted to the abaxial surface of the leaves and multicellular trichomes. Cuticle features that differ among the species are the presence or absence of glands and papillae, and stomata size in relation to epidermal cell size. Architectural and cuticular features are also useful for differentiating tribes, subtribes, genera, and species within the subfamily Grevilleoideae. A key for the identification of Argentinean Proteaceae based only on leaf and cuticle characters is presented.\n      </p>", "We investigate the multilinear epistatic model under mutation-limited directional selection. We confirm previous results that only directional epistasis, in which genes on average reinforce or diminish each other's effects, contribute to the initial evolution of mutational effects. Thus, either canalization or decanalization can occur under directional selection, depending on whether positive or negative epistasis is prevalent. We then focus on the evolution of the epistatic coefficients themselves. In the absence of higher-order epistasis, positive pairwise epistasis will tend to weaken relative to additive effects, while negative pairwise epistasis will tend to become strengthened. Positive third-order epistasis will counteract these effects, while negative third-order epistasis will reinforce them. More generally, gene interactions of all orders have an inherent tendency for negative changes under directional selection, which can only be modified by higher-order directional epistasis. We identify three types of nonadditive quasi-equilibrium architectures that, although not strictly stable, can be maintained for an extended time: (1) nondirectional epistatic architectures; (2) canalized architectures with strong epistasis; and (3) near-additive architectures in which additive effects keep increasing relative to epistasis.\n      </p>", "This paper studies an organizational architecture that I call information-age architecture.

This connection obfuscates important differences in how ideas about treatment were reflected in particular architectural design. In other words, there have been few attempts to understand how the physical structure of the asylum became part of its medical discourse, and no attempts to research the treatment programme evolving as a result of the designers' intentions and becoming part of the asylum's architecture. Every researcher working in the field of the history of asylums acknowledges the importance of The York Retreat and its policy of 'moral treatment' in influencing the course of nineteenth-century asylum construction. Since the investigation of the design and internal organization of the nineteenth-century asylum has become an object of investigation, the influence of The Retreat needs to be evaluated in light of this research. This article will focus on the correspondence between the founder of The York Retreat, William Tuke, and its architect, John Bevans. I will present their discussions on the design of The Retreat within the context of their perceptions of insanity and their beliefs in 'moral treatment' to show how the intentionality of design is realized in architectural form.\n      </p>", "A large number of vegetative and fertile branching systems of Thucydia mahoningensis provide data for interpreting the growth architecture and life\u2010history pattern of a primitive Paleozoic conifer. Internal anatomy is similar to modern conifers, indicating an arborescent life\u2010history pattern. Three categories of vegetative plagiotropic branching systems are recognized, and these resemble developmental variations among lateral branching systems in juvenile trees of the extant conifer Araucaria heterophylla (Salisb.) Franco. Thucydia mahoningensis is considered to be a small tree on the basis of the size and branching pattern of the stem and lateral branching systems and on the basis of internal anatomy. Growth architecture of T. mahoningensis conforms to Massart\u2019s model, but fertile remains reveal interesting differences from living species. The T. mahoningensis tree has an orthotropic stem that bears two orders of plagiotropic vegetative shoots. Fertile shoots have a compound ovulate fertile zone and lack vegetative lateral branches. Ovulate branches bear penultimate\u2010type vegetative leaves in the basal region, a compound ovulate fertile zone in the midregion, and ultimate\u2010type vegetative leaves in the distal region. Axillary ovuliferous dwarf shoots of the compound fertile zones correspond to ultimate branches of the vegetative systems. Compound pollen cones are terminal on branches. These and supplementary data from previously described walchian species reveal that the architecture of the most primitive conifers resembles juvenile araucarian conifers and suggest that giant conifers evolved from diminutive trees by the combination of an extended vegetative growth phase and hypermorphoses in leaf development.\n      </p>", "The article offers a survey of temple architecture in the Iranian world before the Macedonian conquest. Despite the observations that ancient Iranians worshipped in the open air, structures of cultic significance have been discovered in some areas of Eastern Iran. While the attribution of the earliest, second millennium temples to the Iranian tribes is still disputable, Iranians definitely had temples before the Achaemenids. The earliest temples found in the Iranian settlements are the ones from Tepe Nush-i Jan (for Western Iran) and Dah\u0101n-i Ghul\u0101m\u0101n (for the Eastern). However, it seems that the majority of ancient Iranians, including the first Achaemenids, worshiped under the open sky. Given the nomadic background of the ancient Iranians they probably became acquainted with temple architecture once they came into close contact with the highly developed civilisations, which preceded them in some areas of what was later to become the Iranian World. In general it is impossible to speak of one \"Iranian culture\" or a unified \"Iranian cult\" in the second and first millennia BCE; instead, temple architecture demonstrates a variety of different regional traditions. More temples have been discovered in Eastern Iran than in Western. The architectural evidence from Eastern Iran in this period also suggests a complex picture of heterogeneous local cults, at least some of which made use of closed temples. Another kind of cultic structure was the open air terraces. There is also some evidence for domestic cults. Iranian cults also share a number of common, dominant features. Special significance was attributed to fire and ashes. Most temple altars (often stepped) were at the centre of the cult and rituals. Another important feature is the absence of cult statues and images. It is remarkable that most of the temples were erected on the highest point of the site or on an artificial elevated platform.\n      </p>", "The agranular cortex is an important landmark-anatomically, as the architectural flag of mammalian motor cortex, and historically, as a spur to the development of theories of localization of function. But why, exactly, do agranularity and motor function go together? To address this question, it should be noted that not only does motor cortex lack granular layer four, it also has a relatively thinner layer three. Therefore, it is the two layers which principally constitute the ascending pathways through the sensory (granular) cortex that have regressed in motor cortex: simply stated, motor cortex does not engage in serial reprocessing of incoming sensory data. But why should a granular architecture not be demanded by the downstream relay of motor instructions through the motor cortex? The scant anatomical evidence available regarding laminar patterns suggests that the pathways from frontal and premotor areas to the primary motor cortex actually bear a greater resemblance to the descending, or feedback connections of sensory cortex that avoid the granular layer. The action of feedback connections is generally described as 'modulatory' at a cellular level, or 'selective' in terms of systems analysis. By contrast, ascending connections may be labelled 'driving' or 'instructive'. Where the motor cortex uses driving inputs, they are most readily identified as sensory signals instructing the visual location of targets and the kinaesthetic state of the body. Visual signals may activate motor concepts, e.g. 'mirror neurons', and the motor plan must select the appropriate muscles and forces to put the plan into action, if the decision to move is taken. This, perhaps, is why 'driving' motor signals might be inappropriate-the optimal selection and its execution are conditional upon both kinaesthetic and motivational factors. The argument, summarized above, is constructed in honour of Korbinian Brodmann's centenary, and follows two of the fundamental principles of his school of thought: that uniformities in cortical structure, and development imply global conservation of some aspects of function, whereas regional variations in architecture can be used to chart the 'organs' of the cortex, and perhaps to understand their functional differences.\n      </p>", "A model is presented that examines the role of variations in the size of root systems as well as size-independent aspects of architecture on both the efficiency (volume of soil exploited per unit volume of root) and potential of exploitation (volume of soil exploited). This model is unique in that it explores the architecture of actual root systems rather than statistical approximations of root systems. This design allows the assessment of variations in root system size and size-independent aspects of architecture in realistic covarying combinations. Root systems of Senecio vulgaris L. grown in ambient and double-ambient atmospheric CO2 concentrations and two watering regimes were used to parameterize the model. There was a clear trade-off between the efficiency and potential of exploitation. Large root systems showed high exploitation but low exploitation efficiency. Inversely, small root systems showed low potential and high efficiency. Overall, the potential of soil exploitation was more strongly correlated with all measured aspects of root architecture than was efficiency. Root system size (total length or number of root tips) was much more highly correlated with patterns of soil exploitation, efficiency and potential, than were size independent aspects of architecture. These findings are important to studies of root architecture, demonstrating that studies of root system architecture need simultaneously to measure root system size, size-independent aspects of architecture and in situ patterns of deployment (e.g. trajectories of growth) to understand the functional significance of root architecture.\n      </p>", "Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonize the roots of most monocotyledons and dicotyledons despite their different root architecture and cell patterning. Among the cereal hosts of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, Oryza sativa (rice) possesses a peculiar root system composed of three different types of roots: crown roots; large lateral roots; and fine lateral roots. Characteristic is the constitutive formation of aerenchyma in crown roots and large lateral roots and the absence of cortex from fine lateral roots. Here, we assessed the distribution of colonization by Glomus intraradices within this root system and determined its effect on root system architecture. Large lateral roots are preferentially colonized, and fine lateral roots are immune to arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization. Fungal preference for large lateral roots also occurred in sym mutants that block colonization of the root beyond rhizodermal penetration. Initiation of large lateral roots is significantly induced by G. intraradices colonization and does not require a functional common symbiosis signaling pathway from which some components are known to be needed for symbiosis-mediated lateral root induction in Medicago truncatula. Our results suggest variation of symbiotic properties among the different rice root-types and induction of the preferred tissue by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Furthermore, signaling for arbuscular mycorrhizal-elicited alterations of the root system differs between rice and M. truncatula.\n      </p>", "Exceptionally well-preserved adpressions of the Late Pennsylvanian seed fern Odontopteris brardii (Brongniart) Sternberg are described from the Bonner Springs Shale (Kansas City Group, middle Missourian) of western Missouri, U.S.A. The fossils indicate that O. brardii fronds are bipinnate and similar in architecture to those seen in Lescuropteris (= Odontopteris) genuina (Grand'Eury) Remy et Remy from the Stephanian of France. This seems to contradict the widely accepted opinion that O. brardii is conspecific with Odontopteris minor f. zeilleri Potoni\u00e9, because fronds of the latter taxon are asymmetrically tripinnate. We suggest that heteroblastic development occurred in O. brardii and O. minor f. zeilleri, and bipinnate fronds were produced by juvenile plants. On the other hand, intraspecific differences in frond architecture may also have been a mechanism of adaptation. As a result, frond architecture can be used only in a limited sense for species circumscription in odontopterid seed ferns until the mechanisms underlying heterophylly in these plants are more fully understood.\n      </p>", "In this paper, we have reviewed how the hydraulic design of trees influences the movement of water from roots to leaves. The hydraulic architecture of trees can limit their water relations, gas exchange throughout the crown of trees, the distribution of trees over different habitats and, perhaps, even the maximum height that a particular species can achieve. Parameters of particular importance include: (1) the vulnerability of stems to droughtinduced cavitation events because cavitation reduces the hydraulic conductance of stems, (2) the leaf specific conductivity of stems because it determines the pressure gradients and most negative water potentials needed to sustain evaporation from leaves, (3) the water storage capacity of tissues because this might determine the ability of trees to survive long drought periods. All of these parameters are determined by the structure and function of anatomical components of trees. Some of the ecological and physiological trade-offs of specific structures are discussed.\n      </p>", "1 The architecture and leaf dimensions (petiole length, blade length and blade width) of 403 tree species were studied at six sites ranging from lowland equatorial to temperate Australian rain forest. The branching patterns of understorey saplings and exposed canopy trees were classified as orthotropic (three-dimensional arrangements of leaves about ascending twigs) or plagiotropic (leaves arranged in planes, usually along the sides of horizontal twigs). 2 Among understorey saplings, orthotropic species had larger leaves and longer petioles than plagiotropic species. Discriminant analysis showed that the two groups could be separated by petiole length and the ratio of blade width to length, with those orthotropic species having short petioles also tending to have narrow blades. 3 The petiole length distinguishing orthotropy from plagiotropy showed a linear decrease with increasing latitude, as small-leaved short-petioled orthotropic species were relatively abundant at the temperate Australian sites. 4 The likelihood of a species being plagiotropic was weakly related to its shade tolerance and not related to adult stature or abundance, i.e. understorey leaf display was more closely related to leaf dimensions than to life-history attributes. This importance of leaf dimensions may reflect their influence on light interception and mechanical support requirements. 5 A smaller fraction of species was plagiotropic in the canopy than in the understorey, particularly in Australia, where many short-petioled species shifted from plagiotropic to orthotropic on attaining the canopy. 6 This switch from plagiotropy to orthotropy appeared to be associated with excess light levels relative to photosynthetic capacity, slow branch extension rates and low illumination angles. Thus, leaf display is related to leaf dimensions in shaded saplings, but light and physiological factors may have a greater influence on canopy architecture.\n      </p>", "Tree architecture is an important determinant of the height extension, light capture, and mechanical stability of trees, and it allows species to exploit the vertical height gradient in the forest canopy and horizontal light gradients at the forest floor. Tropical tree species partition these gradients through variation in adult stature ( $H_{\\text{max}}$ ) and light demand. In this study we compare 22 architectural traits for 54 Bolivian moist-forest tree species. We evaluate how architectural traits related to $H_{\\text{max}}$ vary with tree size, and we present a conceptual scheme in which we combine the two axes into four different functional groups. Interspecific correlations between architecture and $H_{\\text{max}}$ varied strongly from negative to positive, depending on the reference sizes used. Stem height was positively related to $H_{\\text{max}}$ at larger reference diameters (14-80 cm). Species height vs. diameter curves often flattened toward their upper ends in association with reproductive maturity for species of all sizes. Thus, adult understory trees were typically shorter than similar-diameter juveniles of larger species. Crown area was negatively correlated with $H_{\\text{max}}$ at small reference heights and positively correlated at larger reference heights (15-34 m). Wide crowns allow the small understory species to intercept light over a large area at the expense of a reduced height growth. Crown length was negatively correlated with $H_{\\text{max}}$ at intermediate reference heights (4-14 m). A long crown enables small understory species to maximize light interception in a light-limited environment. Light-demanding species were characterized by orthotropic stems and branches, large leaves, and a monolayer leaf arrangement. They realized an efficient height growth through the formation of narrow and shallow crowns. Light demand turned out to be a much stronger predictor of tree architecture than $H_{\\text{max}}$ , probably because of the relatively low, open, and semi-evergreen canopy at the research site. The existence of four functional groups (shade-tolerant, partial-shade-tolerant, and long-and short-lived pioneer) was confirmed by the principal component and discriminant analysis. Both light demand and $H_{\\text{max}}$ capture the major variation in functional traits found among tropical rain forest tree species, and the two-way classification scheme provides a straightforward model to understand niche differentiation in tropical forests.\n      </p>", "Proposed definitions of the states of the pectoral girdle architecture in anurans-viz., arcifery, firmisterny, arciferofirmisterny, and \"almost arcifery\" are evaluated with respect to their consistency with the most recent morphological observations.

The present study shows that the extraradical spreading of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus intraradices grown monoxenically with tomato roots can be divided into three stages: (i) proliferation of runner hyphae acting as conducting channels, which divide dichotomously and extend the fungal colony radially; (ii) development of arbuscule-like structures, which are formed at regular intervals along the runner hyphae and which might play a preferential role in nutrient uptake; and (iii) formation of spores in zones already colonized by runner hyphae and arbuscule-like structures. The development of the mycorrhiza is accompanied by changes in the pH of the medium. In particular, pH decreases in zones of the medium in which a high number of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal spores are formed. The intricate architecture shown by the extraradical mycelium highlights the potential for enhanced nutrient uptake by mycorrhizal roots, and their role in the maintainance and amelioration of soil structure.\n      </p>", "Gall forming herbivores induce sinks and act as phloem parasites within their host plants. Their performance on the host plant can depend on the sink-source relationship they establish with the plant. Because sink-source relationships within a plant are reflected in its architecture, we examined how architectural differences among cottonwoods might influence the success of the galling aphid, Pemphigus betae. Using cloned cottonwoods in common garden studies, we found three major patterns. First, there is a significant clonal or genetic component to tree architecture; cloned trees grown in a common garden maintain the architecture of parental trees. Second, resistant tree genotypes have more natural sinks (i.e., buds) relative to sources (i.e., stem volume) than susceptible trees. Third, these differences in architecture result in greater competition among sinks on aphid-resistant trees than on aphid-susceptible trees. Sink competition within a tree was estimated by the Gini coefficient which quantifies the size inequality of a shoot population (i.e., competition among sinks is low when shoots are nearly equal in size, and great when a few shoots are large and most are small). Aphid death through gall abortion increased significantly (r2 = 0.65) on garden-grown trees as competition among sinks within a tree increased. Based on these observations we proposed the \"sink competition hypothesis\" to account for the performance of gall formers on their host plants. To test this hypothesis, we experimentally reduced sink densities (i.e., buds) on branches of resistant tree genotypes to resemble the bud densities of susceptible genotypes. By reducing the number of competing sinks, we predicted that aphid survival would increase. As predicted, aphid survival significantly increased. For example, in one removal experiment, aphid survival increased from 20% on control branches to 55% on branches with the highest level of bud removal. Similar bud removals on susceptible trees did not increase aphid survival, indicating that competition is relaxed on susceptible hosts. With the exception of the plant vigor hypothesis, most current hypotheses explaining herbivore distributions in nature focus on the importance to leaf-chewing herbivores of variation in chemistry. We believe that a sink competition model is needed to explain the distributions of the diverse group of herbivores that act as phloem parasites. The sink competition model is more mechanistic than the vigor hypothesis, and may account for apparent contradictions because it more clearly quantifies the resource base and the potential interactions that occur when sinks, either herbivore-induced or natural, compete for sources.\n      </p>", "\u2022 Mechanical architectures of two Clematis species, the herbaceous perennial Clematis recta and the woody liana, Clematis vitalba, were investigated and compared with the woody rhizomatous sand dune plant Clematis flammula var. maritima. \u2022 Bending mechanical properties of stems from various developmental stages were compared and related to stem geometry and relative proportions of tissues during development. \u2022 Clematis vitalba and C. flammula var. maritima showed mechanical architectures with reductions in structural Young's modulus of the stem during ontogeny. Irreversible loss of stem rigidity was mediated by disruption, separation and eventual loss of primary phloem fibres via secondary growth of the periderm and cambial activity. Each species showed variations of non-self-supporting mechanical architecture relating to specific habitat preferences. In aerial stems of C. recta the structural Young's modulus remained approximately constant during ontogeny, a mechanical signal characteristic for semi-self-supporting architectures. \u2022 Woody aerial plant stems are extremely rare in the Ranunculaceae and seldom, if ever, show self-supporting characteristics. Growth form evolution in the group may have been canalised by evolution of rhizomatous geophytic growth forms with secondary growth confined to underground stems specialized for water conduction, storage and perennation. Variation of this ground plan includes climbing, straggling or rhizomatous architectures but not self-supporting shrubs or trees with secondary growth generating requisite self-supporting mechanical properties. Certain body plan organisations appear to have inbuilt mechanical constraints which may have profound effects on the subsequent evolution of growth forms.\n      </p>", "The paper examines the chords of harmony that bond and blend music with architecture and suggests ways in which the rich universal rhythms of music and the arts can help to create an authentic architecture, particularly, African architecture: using the untapped African music, arts and cultures, just as other peoples worldwide have done with their developed musical cultures. The work notes that the concept of the word composition pervasively combines architecture and music. From a historical survey, it becomes clear that the great masters of architecture continue to make use of musical concepts in their architectural compositions. The paper focuses on the fact that the design of the brain quite rightly places music and architecture in the creative right cerebral hemisphere, thereby miraculously making architecture and music inseparable companions, and architects lovers of music. Consequently, with a focus on Africa, the work exposes the inherent danger in architectural training or practice devoid of music, and the benefits accruable from architecture composed on harmonic concepts from music.\n      </p>", "In the twentieth century, Italian architects and designers produced remarkable buildings, paintings and objects inspired by a vernacular tradition that had evolved over centuries of agrarian life. Despite their significant influence on Italian modernism and design, these peasant builders and artisans remained largely behind the scenes as 'ghosts of the profession'. Through their appropriation of the 'anonymous' vernacular, Italian artists and architects achieved a unique synthesis of collective expression and individual identity. As Italy was transformed from a primarily agrarian to an industrial economy, the emergence of new ways of life to accommodate urban and suburban dwelling fostered a dynamic dialogue between long established customs and modern practices, between the ethos of artisanal making and that of industrial production modes, between the anonymous craftsman and the signature designer. Through successive political regimes, a dialectic relation between past and present contributed to the emergence of an innovative regionalist modernism that embraced traditional practices without succumbing to banal historicism or nostalgia. The aim of this essay is to re-read the significant initiatives in Italian modernism that evince the impact of the vernacular in architecture and design during the pre-war, interwar, and post-war periods.\n      </p>", "This paper assesses the potential of large-scale aerial photographs for the identification of rain forest trees. Colour slides at 1: 3000 scale were acquired in French Guiana, above the canopy of a 25 ha study site where trees had already been identified. Firstly, the stereoscopic analysis of photographic prints served to establish a typology of the crowns, based on seven main classes of criteria: crown size, crown status, crown contour, crown architecture, foliage cover, foliage texture and colour, completed where possible by information on phenology. The terminology chosen was based on those proposed in previous studies. Secondly, a smaller area of 5 ha was delimited in the field, on which 15 tree categories (vernacular names) represented by 5 crowns or more on the photographs were selected. For each category, a standard crown was described using terminology previously defined. Twelve tree categories, including first and second class commercial timbers, displayed specific characteristics allowing them to be identified on aerial photographs. Further analyses will be undertaken in the future to measure the success of this identification method. This method may be applied for the recognition of particular species of interest: commercial, rare, endemic or key-stone species. Phenological data, as well as information on crown architectural development, can also be retrieved from aerial photographs, bringing new prospects for a better knowledge of crowns biology and their functional role in the forest ecosystem.\n      </p>", "Invertebrate algal grazer densities were manipulated in a temperate river to discover the impact of differences in riffle-scale architectural complexity on the strength of the trophic interaction between grazers and epilithic algae. Animal densities were manipulated by manual removal in architecturally complex boulder-cobble riffles and simpler bedrock riffles, with the complexity of smaller-scale architecture held constant. Responses in algal density were recorded before and after a month of manipulations, together with grazer colonization rate and body sizes. The experiment was carried out in winter and again in summer. The interaction between grazers and algae differed between habitats and seasons. In winter, when algae were growing, the more complex rifflescale architecture in the boulder-cobble riffles created a refuge from grazing for algae. This was probably the result of the movement abilities of the grazers interacting with habitat architecture, and potentially also due to the control of predatory fish densities by habitat architecture resulting in greater predation pressure on grazers in boulder-cobble riffles. Therefore the impact of highly complex riffle-scale architecture was to weaken the strength of the trophic interaction between algae and their grazers by reducing grazer densities, while potentially strengthening the trophic interaction between grazers and their fish predators.\n      </p>", "Clusia uvitana Pittier (Clusiaceae) is a tropical hemiepiphyte that has been shown to display a high plasticity in the expression of CAM in response to the environment. When water is available CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is taken up mostly during the day. This study of the water relations and hydraulic architecture has revealed that leaf water potentials, \u03a8, ranged from -0.7 to -0.9 MPa and changed very little with time or water availability. The absolute hydraulic conductivity of stem segments (K&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) and the specific conductivity (K&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) were comparable to many other temperate and tropical species, but the leaf specificity conductivity (K&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) was 1/3 to 1/30 that of many other species. So stems supported high leaf areas per unit of hydraulic conductivity. C. uvitana was very vulnerable to cavitation, reaching 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity at stem \u03a8 = -1.3 MPa. The species survives in spite of low K&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and high xylem vulnerability, because the CAM physiology insures low transpiration rates and high ability to evade dehydration.\n      </p>", "\u2022 Although canopy architecture is a prime determinant of forest functioning and productivity, it has received little attention when examining forest responses to rising atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations. In this study different characteristics of crown architecture of two Populus species and one hybrid were investigated within a highdensity poplar plantation. A free-air CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enrichment (FACE) facility was used to mimic future elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations. \u2022 Canopy depth and branching patterns were studied, and detailed branch characteristics such as branch dimension, inclination, and internodal length were assessed for the three poplar species in the FACE and control treatments. \u2022 Effects of elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were restricted to a significantly increased canopy depth and longer internodal lengths after two years of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enrichment. Additionally, branch dimensions and sylleptic branch numbers were increased by FACE, but responses were variable among growing seasons and species. However, FACE did not affect branch angles of origin and termination. \u2022 Crown architecture was modified mainly through a growth stimulation in response to FACE. Nevertheless, important differences among species were observed which may influence future CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; responses when competition will become more important.\n      </p>", "This field report focuses on one of the largest participation projects in Turkey, the \u201cChildren and Architecture Project.\u201d This initiative is organized by the Ankara Chamber of Architects in cooperation with Ankara University Centre for Research on Child Culture (CRCC).

Viral entry is initiated by binding to the CD4 receptor on the cell surface, which induces large conformational changes in gp120. These changes not only provide a model for receptor-triggered entry, but affect spike sensitivity to drug-and antibody-mediated neutralization. Although some of the details of the CD4-induced conformational change have been visualized by crystal structures and cryoelectron tomograms, the critical gp41-interactive region of gp120 was missing from previous atomic-level characterizations. Here we determine the crystal structure of an HIV-1 gp120 core with intact gp41-interactive region in its CD4-bound state, compare this structure to unliganded and antibodybound forms to identify structurally invariant and plastic components, and use ligand-oriented cryoelectron tomograms to define component mobility in the viral spike context. Newly defined gp120 elements proximal to the gp41 interface complete a 7-stranded \u03b2-sandwich, which appeared invariant in conformation. Loop excursions emanating from the sandwich form three topologically separate\u2014 and structurally plastic\u2014 layers, topped off by the highly glycosylated gp120 outer domain. Crystal structures, cryoelectron tomograms, and interlayer chemistry were consistent with a mechanism in which the layers act as a shape-changing spacer, facilitating movement between outer domain and gp41-associated \u03b2-sandwich and providing for conformational diversity used in immune evasion. A \"layered\" gp120 architecture thus allows movement among alternative glycoprotein conformations required for virus entry and immune evasion, whereas a \u03b2-sandwich clamp maintains gp120-gp41 interaction and regulates gp41 transitions.\n      </p>", "Hydraulic parameters were measured in seven species of Ficus (three free-standing and four hemi-epiphytic) on stem segments of 3-35 mm in wood diameter. Parameters measured included Kh (water flux per unit pressure gradient), KL (leaf specific conductivity = Kh per unit leaf area), Ks (specific conductivity = Kh per unit wood cross section), and Hv (Huber value = wood cross section per unit leaf area). The hemi-epiphytes tended to have less conductive stems per unit leaf area (lower KL) and invested less wood cross section per unit leaf area (lower Hv) than free-standing species. Hydraulic parameters of Ficus are compared to 21 other temperate and tropical species to see if there is any discernible pattern in hydraulic architecture that correlates with phylogeny, growth form or habitat occupied by diverse species. Figs, as a group, had relatively high Ks and relatively low Hv compared to other tropical trees. A possible correlation between KL and transpiration and growth form is discussed.\n      </p>", "Species differences in branching architecture and allometry were analysed for co-occurring forest floor saplings of 10 species of shade-tolerant evergreen broad-leaved tree, representative of primary warm-temperate rain forests in southern Japan, from the viewpoints of assimilative efficiency and significance for regeneration. Considerable diversity was found in the architecture of branching and in the leaf size of saplings. The differences in branching and leaf size were related to differences in allometric relationships between various properties of the saplings. It was hypothesized that this architectural and allometric diversity is related to the alternative of `choosing' either the pattern of assimilate allocation, which is adaptive in competition when there is an early improvement in light conditions, or the allocation pattern which is favourable for surviving long periods under persistently dark conditions. Measurements of sapling growth in closed stands and in gaps supported the hypothesis.\n      </p>", "Loretta Lees' recent call for a 'critical geography of architecture' argued that a more nuanced and truly interpretative methodology for analysing the relationship between space, place and architecture would involve active engagement with such architectural spaces. This paper argues that, in the same way, by broadening our approach to historical architectural geographies more meaningful interpretations will result. Utilizing a 'polyvocal' methodological approach, by which not only architects and planners but also residents of these spaces are considered as important actors, will facilitate this 'critical' engagement with architectural spaces. Further, by taking this polyvocal approach, interesting conclusions can be reached about the production, consumption and re-production of space, both in the past and also in the present.\n      </p>", "After 2000 a handful of very tall buildings were approved in central London, a circumstance that challenged well-established planning practices in that part of the city. Their promotion by Ken Livingstone, the mayor, but opposition to them by conservation groups, seemed to signal a fierce campaign ahead; in fact, it was all over in an instant. This article examines how this debate was framed to dismiss the arguments and concerns of those who oppose tall buildings. To make tall buildings acceptable, London's mayor drew on the merits associated with iconic architecture and high-profile architects. Under Livingstone's incumbency tall buildings were affirmed by the expertise and clout of global architects who provided legitimacy for mayoral ambitions to reach for the sky. Stressing the significance of high-quality design and iconic architecture helped to wear down deep-rooted antagonism and to channel the debate to improving the aesthetic qualities of London, a goal that enjoys wide consensus.\n      </p>", "Star Enterprise is a joint venture partnership between Texaco Inc. and the Saudi Arabian Oil Company. Created in 1988, it became fully operational on January 1, 1989. This new organization inherited staff, facilities, and information resources existing within Texaco Inc. at the time of formation. A significant opportunity for the new organization was to create a new Enterprise Information Technology Architecture to support business functions and management decision making. While this venture was an opportunity, it was also a challenge because of the existing information technology that was compromised of incompatible hardware and nonintegrated systems. This paper describes the architecture that emerged and reviews its current status. Two major contributions of the paper are to identify the principles upon which the architecture is being created and to review what has been learned to date in the process of implementing the architecture.\n      </p>", "\u2022 Atriplex halimus, a monoecious Chenopodiaceae, produces flowers displaying two basic architectures. \u2022 The first architectural pattern is made of staminate pentamerous flowers with an external whorl of yellowish tepals and an internal whorl of stamens. The second architectural pattern consists of female flowers with a single carpel enclosed within two opposite bracts. In both architectures, bisexual flowers and flowers of the unexpected sex were detected leading to the occurrence of up to six floral phenotypes on the same individual. \u2022 Daylength and light intensity affected sex ratio and flower distribution between both architectural patterns. Short days and low light irradiance promoted femaleness and bracteate floral architecture. Flower position on a reproductive axis and geographical origin of the plant (genotype) also affected sex and architecture ratios. \u2022 Thus, all the genetic information required for the production of both floral architecture and sexual organ types is present in each A. halimus plant but endogenous and environmental cues determine the fate of the floral meristems. These results are discussed in relation to classical models of genetic control of floral morphogenesis.\n      </p>", "", "", "", "", "An architectural approach is used to provide a framework for understanding the Enterprise-wide Information Management Complex (EWIMC). IMC is proposed as an emerging self-contained business process that interfaces with but remains separate from all other business elements, while providing unique services to those other elements. A generic model of EWIMC itself is presented that breaks down IMC into a set of systems federations, each functionally distinct from one another; each federation, in turn, is composed of more specific systems and each system its subsystems, and so on. Thus, a top-down, hierarchical approach is applied to the concept of IMC to provide a framework for understanding the complexities and interrelationships among its many pieces. The model is offered as a first step in developing a comprehensive overview of EWIMC to replace the numerous fragmented approaches offered in the past. An example of General Motors' architecture is presented. Finally, the System Planning Technique is presented as a tool for defining systems requirements.\n      </p>", "A reinvestigation of the previously described Leptophloeum rhombicum trunk from the Late Devonian (Frasnian) Huangchiateng Formation of Hubei, China provides a new perspective on the architecture of this arborescent lycopsid. It is preserved as a flattened, silicified petrification with an unevenly permineralized primary vasculature and spirally arranged rhombic leaf cushions, which agree with the diagnosis of L. rhombicum Dawson distributed worldwide in the Late Devonian. Taxonomically, this plant should be assigned to its own family and within the order Iso\u00ebtales sensu lato. The anatomy, from different levels of the trunk, demonstrates that the ontogeny of the plant may conform to a determinate growth pattern. Combining previous data with current architectural analysis, it suggested that the L. rhombicum tree had a pseudomonopodial branching pattern rather than an iso-dichotomous branching crown as previously proposed. New reconstruction of the general habit for this tree is given and consists of three major architectural units: a stigmarian rhizomorph, a main trunk, and lateral branches. When these results are considered with recent cladistic work, L. rhombicum may have developed similar growth architecture to some Famennian and Carboniferous arborescent lycopsids. This growth represents one of the archetypal architectures found in the Iso\u00ebtales s.l. extending from the early Late Devonian.\n      </p>", "Topology is an important component of the architecture of whole root systems. Unfortunately, most commonly applied indices used for characterizing topology are poorly correlated with one another and thus reflect different aspects of topology. In order to understand better how different methods of characterizing topology vary, this paper presents an exploration of several different methods for assigning order within branched root systems on the basis of (a) developmental (centrifugal) vs. functional (centripetal) ordering sequences and (b) whether orders are assigned to individual links or groups of adjacent links (segments). For each ordering system, patterns of scaling in relation to various aspects of link and segment size are explored using regression analyses. Segment-based ordering systems resulted in better fits for simple scaling relationships with size, but these patterns varied between developmental vs. functional ordering as well as the different size metrics examined. The functional (centripetal), link-based ordering system showed complex, non-linear scaling in relation to numbers of links per order. Using a simple simulation model of root growth, it is demonstrated that this method of characterizing root topology in relation to root size might be a more powerful tool for characterizing root system architecture than in the use of simple, single-index characterizations of topology.\n      </p>", "Members of the genus Solidago are among the most widely studied model systems in plant population biology. A comparative study of Solidago canadensis, S. altissima, and S. gigantea in an experimental garden showed that the three species had different patterns of shoot growth and development, leaf morphology and physiology, and biomass allocation at harvest. These differences were also found in the field. Contrary to some current taxonomic usage, our results show that S. canadensis should ecologically be treated as a separate taxon distinct from S. altissima, and that the latter may be grouped together with S. gigantea. Many of the biological differences between S. canadensis and the other two taxa, such as differential investment into sexual reproduction versus clonal growth, may be explained by differences in genet architecture. These architectures concern high compared to lower within-genet shoot density resulting from differences in rhizome lengths among the taxa (shorter in S. canadensis than in S. altissima and S. gigantea).\n      </p>", "Extreme topologies for root systems can be viewed either as minimizing cost or maximizing efficiency of soil exploration. Plants of red clover Trifolium pratense L., lettuce Lactuca sativa L., four species of Festuca and three of Geranium were grown in a range of nutrient supply conditions, to test this hypothesis. Topology was generally insensitive to changes in the supply of N and P but large differences between species were found: slow-growing perennials had efficient, herring-bone systems, whereas annuals were at the opposite extreme. This accords with earlier predictions. Lengths of external links were reduced by N and of internal links by P. There were large differences between species in mean link lengths. These data confirm the value of topological analyses in understanding the functional architecture of root systems.\n      </p>", "The architecture of 48 eastern deciduous trees was examined using five characteristics: leaf size, leaf shape, twig cross-sectional area, leaf number per twig, and branching density. Although there was much intraspecific variability in these characteristics, broadscale interspecific trends were evident. As leaf size increased, the percentage of trees with lobed, and then compound, leaves increased, but simple, unlobed leaves ranged throughout. An allometric series of architectural forms resulted from correlations between three of the variables: as leaf size increased, twig cross-sectional area increased, and branching density decreased. This lends empirical support to \"Corner's Rules,\" first formulated for tropical trees. Shade intolerant trees had more leaves per twig and bore a given total leaf area with fewer first-year shoots than shade tolerant trees. These data suggested that early successional trees bear their photosynthetically active tissue with lower investment in supportive, generally non-photosynthetic, tissue.\n      </p>", "Understanding the genetic basis to landscape vegetation structure is an important step that will allow us to examine ecological and evolutionary processes at multiple spatial scales. Here for the first time we show that the fractal architecture of a dominant plant on the landscape exhibits high broad-sense heritability and thus has a genetic basis. The fractal architecture of trees is known to influence ecological communities associated with them. In a unidirectional cottonwood-hybridizing complex (Populus angustifolia x P. fremontii) pure and hybrid cottonwoods differed significantly in their fractal architecture, with phenotypic variance among backcross hybrids exceeding that of F1 hybrids and of pure narrowleaf cottonwoods by two-fold. This result provides a crucial link between genes and fractal scaling theory, and places the study of landscape ecology within an evolutionary framework.\n      </p>", "Negative epistasis in hybrid genomes commonly results in postzygotic isolation between divergent lineages. However, some genomic regions may be selectively neutral or adaptive in hybrids and thus may potentially cross species barriers. We examined postzygotic isolation between ecologically similar species of Louisiana Iris: Iris brevicaulis and I. fulva to determine the potential for adaptive introgression in nature. Line-cross analyses allowed us a general overview of the gene action responsible for fitnessrelated traits. We then used a QTL mapping approach to detect genomic regions responsible for variation in these traits. Although hybrid classes suffered reduced fitness for many traits, hybrid means were equivalent to at least one of the parental species in overall estimates of maternal and paternal fitness during the two years of the field study. The genetic architecture underlying the fitness-related traits varied across field site and year of the study, thus emphasizing the importance of the environment in determining the degree of postzygotic isolation and potential for introgression across natural hybrid zones.\n      </p>", "Faced with the gravity of the financial crises which occurred in Mexico and, above all, in Asia, the objective of the new financial architecture as defined by the G7 and the IMF is to control international financial instability. However, many questions remain. Is it merely a question of improving the transparency of information in order to encourage better financial practice or of introducing much stricter rules while accepting the principle of limiting the international mobility of capital? If such questions arise, it is because there is no theoretical consensus over the dysfunction that was observed on the international financial markets in the 1990s. Paradoxically, this leads us to reconsider the work and theoretical heritage left to us by Keynes. Discussions about international monetary and financial governance recall the debate raised by Keynes, first of all in his Treatise on Money, about improvements to the gold standard system, and then when preparing for the Bretton Woods Conference. Could this new financial architecture not be seen as Keynes' revenge? In fact, the new architecture is a working compromise which brings together neo-Keynesian and neo-liberal principles but which cannot fully answer the challenges of systemic risk.\n      </p>", "Within-plant heterogeneity in growth, morphology, and chemistry is ubiquitous, and is commonly attributed to differences in tissue age, light availability, or previous damage by herbivores. Although these factors are important, we argue that plant vascular architecture is an underappreciated determinant of heterogeneity. Vascular architecture can restrict the transport of resources (nutrients, photosynthate, hormones, etc.) to within specific sectors of the plant: this is referred to as sectoriality. Although studies have documented sectoriality in the transport of isotopes and dyes from roots to shoots, the ecological consequences of this sectoriality remain poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that spatial variation in belowground nutrient availability combined with sectorial transport results in localized \"fertilization\" of aboveground plant parts and generates heterogeneity in traits important to herbivores. Our split-root experiments with tomato (Lycopersicon esculent urn Mill) clearly demonstrate that fertilization to isolated lateral roots generates heterogeneity in leaf morphology, phenolic chemistry, and side-shoot growth. Specifically, leaflets with direct connections to these lateral roots were larger and had lower levels of rutin and chlorogenic acid than did leaflets in other sectors lacking direct vascular connections. Moreover, side-shoot production was greater in the connected sectors. We discuss the implications of this heterogeneity for plant-herbivore interactions.\n      </p>", "Scientific progress is driven by innovation-which serves to produce a diversity of ideas-and imitation through a social network-which serves to diffuse these ideas. In this paper, we develop an agent-based computational model of this process, in which the agents in the population are heterogeneous in their abilities to innovate and imitate. The model incorporates three primary forces: the discovery of new ideas, the observation and adoption of these ideas, and the endogenous development of networks. The objective is to explore the evolving architecture of problem-solving networks and the critical roles that different agents play in the process. A central finding is that the emergent network takes a chain structure with innovators (those most skilled at generating new ideas) being the main source of ideas and those most skilled at imitating acting as connectors between the innovators and the masses. The impact of agent heterogeneity and environmental volatility on the network architecture is also characterized.\n      </p>", "A previous study of the Late Devonian (Famennian) sphenopsid Rotafolia songziensis Wang, Hao, and Wang provided detailed descriptions of the morphology and a sketchy illustration of a three\u2010ribbed primary xylem. The present anatomical data show that the protostele of this plant also has four\u2010ribbed primary xylem of exarch maturation. Located at the tip of each xylem rib, the tracheids of the protoxylem strand bear helical wall thickenings. Tracheids of metaxylem and secondary xylem possess scalariform pits and/or bordered pits. Ray cells seldom occur in secondary xylem. In contrast to fertile organs demonstrating great diversity in bract shape, structure, and sporangiophore number, the stelar architecture of the Sphenophyllales is consistent in ribbed primary xylem of fundamentally exarch maturation, although secondary xylem indicates moderate structural variations. Stelar architecture of the Sphenophyllales is compared with that of basal euphyllophytes and lycophytes. The position of peripheral protoxylem strands in the Sphenophyllales and Iridopteridales corresponds to the presence of leaves or leaf precursors. The origination of these strands differs from that of radiate protoxylem strands in the Aneurophytales.\n      </p>", "Old-field perennials of the genera Aster and Solidago, known to have long and short rhizomes, respectively, are expected to represent two types of genet architectures. We collected these plants at different field sites and grew their seeds and rhizomes in loose and compact soils to investigate the following questions about size and architectural plasticity in these clonal perennials: (1) to what extent do plant size and architecture vary among environments and within taxa, (2) does such variation obscure the differences in rhizome length and architecture between taxa, and (3) because these plants regenerate by clonal growth and sexual reproduction, how does mode of regeneration affect this variation? In all fields sites as well as in the contrasting experimental environments Aster and Solidago had similar size (e.g., shoot height and plant mass) but different architecture. Whereas Aster always produced long rhizomes and much-branched shoots with few main-stem leaves, Solidago produced short rhizomes and little-branched shoots with many main-stem leaves. Size variation among environments was large in both genera. Architecture was influenced by environment in Aster but not in Solidago. Phenotypic variation for size and architectural characters among populations and families within genera was small. In both genera, plants grown from rhizomes and from seeds of the same (maternal) parents had similar mean performance, but phenotypic variation among environments was greater for rhizome-derived than for seed-derived plants. We conclude that in these plants the environment influences variation in architecture less strongly than it affects variation in size. Because differences among populations and families were also small, the two taxa Aster and Solidago are well characterized by their respective plant architecture. We suggest that the influence of mode of reproduction on phenotypic flexibility may reflect a stronger architectural \"blueprint\" in seed-derived plants (less flexible) as compared with rhizome-derived plants (more flexible).\n      </p>", "Models of hybrid zone dynamics incorporate different patterns of hybrid fitness relative to parental species fitness. An important but understudied source of variation underlying these fitness differences is the environment. We investigated the performance of two willow species and their F1, F2, and backcross hybrids using a common-garden experiment with six replicated gardens that differed in soil moisture. Aboveground biomass, catkin production, seed production per catkin, and seed germination rate were significantly different among genetic classes. For aboveground biomass and catkin production, hybrids generally had intermediate or inferior performance compared to parent species. Salix eriocephala had the highest performance for all performance measures, but in two gardens F1 plants had superior or equal performance for aboveground biomass and female catkin production. Salix eriocephala and backcrosses to S. eriocephala had the highest numbers of filled seeds per catkin and the highest estimates of total fitness in all gardens. Measures of filled seeds per catkin and germination rate tend to support the model of endogenous hybrid unfitness, and these two measures had major effects on estimates of total seed production per catkin. We also estimated how the two willow species differ genetically in these fitness measures using line cross analysis. We found a complex genetic architecture underlying the fitness differences between species that involved additive, dominance, and epistatic genetic effects for all fitness measures. The environment was important in the expression of these genetic differences, because the type of epistasis differed among the gardens for aboveground biomass and for female catkin production. These findings suggest that fine-scale environmental variation can have a significant impact on hybrid fitness in hybrid zones where parents and hybrids are widely interspersed.\n      </p>", "The functional roles of the contrasting morphologies of sun and shade shoots of the evergreen shrub Heteromeles arbutifolia were investigated in chaparral and understory habitats by applying a three-dimensional plant architecture simulation model, YPLANT. The simulations were shown to accurately predict the measured frequency distribution of photosynthetic photon flux density (PFD) on both the leaves and a horizontal surface in the open, and gave reasonably good agreement for the more complex light environment in the shade. The sun shoot architecture was orthotropic and characterized by steeply inclined (mean = 71\u00b0) leaves in a spiral phyllotaxy with short internodes. This architecture resulted in relatively low light absorption efficiencies ( $E_{\\text{A}}$ ) for both diffuse and direct PFD, especially during the summer when solar elevation angles were high. Shade shoots were more plagiotropic with longer internodes and a pseudo-distichous phyllotaxis caused by bending of the petioles that positioned the leaves in a nearly horizontal plane (mean = 5\u00b0). This shade-shoot architecture resulted in higher $E_{\\text{A}}$ values for both direct and diffuse PFD as compared to those of the sun shoots. Differences in $E_{\\text{A}}$ between sun and shade shoots and between summer and winter were related to differences in projection efficiencies as determined by leaf and solar angles, and by differences in self shading resulting from leaf overlap. The leaves exhibited photosynthetic acclimation to the sun and the shade, with the sun leaves having higher photosynthetic capacities per unit area, higher leaf mass per unit area and lower respiration rates per unit area than shade leaves. Despite having 7 times greater available PFD, sun shoots absorbed only 3 times more and had daily carbon gains only double of those of shade shoots. Simulations showed that sun and shade plants performed similarly in the open light environment, but that shade shoots substantially outperformed sun shoots in the shade light environment. The shoot architecture observed in sun plants appears to achieve an efficient compromise between maximizing carbon gain while minimizing the time that the leaf surfaces are exposed to PFDs in excess of those required for light saturation of photosynthesis and therefore potentially photoinhibitory.\n      </p>", "By manipulating plant variety and predator species, we investigated the interactions of plant and predator traits in determining predation effectiveness. The predators were all coccinellid adults (Hippodamia convergens, Hippodamia variegata, Coccinella apunctata, and Coccinella septempunctata) and the prey were cabbage aphids (Brevicoryne brassicae). Foraging behavior of the four predators was observed on four crucifers that differed widely in their structures and surface textures (Brassica oleracea caulorapa, Brassica campestris, Brassica juncea crispifolia, and Hirschfeldia incana). Predation rates were significantly influenced by plant variety, a result we attribute to direct effects of plant morphology on predator mobility, falling frequency, and prey accessibility. Predation rates did not vary significantly among the ladybirds, although the four species did exhibit distinct foraging strategies as measured by time spent actively foraging, the rate of encountering aphids, and the fraction of aphids encountered that were consumed. The coccinellids also differed in their propensity for flying away from the plant, and in the frequency with which they fell from the plant. We did not detect any significant interaction effects between plant and predator species, suggesting that the main effects of plant and predator species may overwhelm their interactions in this kind of system. Our results suggest that the level of predation upon herbivorous insects may depend more upon plant architecture than on the particular species of natural enemies present.\n      </p>", "At sites in the United States, creosote bushes (Larrea tridentata (DC.) Cov.) orient foliage clusters predominantly toward the southeast. Foliage of bushes at the southernmost distribution extreme in Mexico shows no predominant orientation. Clusters at all sites are inclined between 33\u00b0 and 71\u00b0 from the horizontal. Inclinations are steeper in the drier and hotter Mojave Desert than in the Chihuahuan Desert. Individual leaflets, though not measured, appear more randomly oriented than foliage clusters. In several populations studied, branches were shorter in the southeastern sectors of the crown, reducing self-shading early in the morning. Measurements of direct beam radiation interception by detached branches, using digital image processing, indicated that foliage clusters oriented toward the southeast exhibited less self-shading during spring mornings than clusters oriented northeast. This effect was not apparent at the summer solstice. This type of canopy architecture may tend to minimize self-shading during the morning hours when conditions are more favorable for photosynthesis, resulting in an improved daily water use efficiency.\n      </p>", "Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) is applied to quartz extracted from mud mortar collected from Chav\u00edn de Hu\u00e1ntar, an early Andean monumental center. The samples appear to have been only partially exposed to sunlight during construction, so a minimum age model is applied to equivalent dose distributions. Complications, including complex radioactivity, low sensitivity of the quartz, and limited sample, prevent high precision, but the 14 dates obtained cluster around 1000 BC largely in agreement with radiocarbon assays on charcoal also collected from the mortar. Results suggest a relatively rapid construction for the monument. This work develops OSL as a method for directly dating architectural mortar.\n      </p>", "The genetic architecture of a phenotype plays a critical role in determining phenotypic evolution through its effects on patterns of genetic variation. Genetic architecture is often considered to be constant in evolutionary quantitative genetic models. However, genetic architecture may be variable and itself evolve when there are dominance and epistatic interactions among alleles at the same and different loci, respectively. The evolution of genetic architecture by genetic drift is examined here by testing the breeding value of four standard inbred mouse strains mated across a set of 26 related recombinant quasi-inbred (RqI) lines generated from the intercross of the Large (LG/J) and Small (SM/J) inbred mouse strains. Phenotypes of interest include age-specific body weights, growth, and adult body composition. If the genetic architecture of these traits has differentiated by genetic drift during the production of the RqI strains, we should observe interactions between tester strain and RqI strain. The breeding values of the tester strains will change relative to one another depending on which RqI strain they are crossed to. The study included an average of 15.1 offspring per cross, over a total of 100 different crosses. Multivariate and univariate analyses of variance indicate that there is strongly significant interaction for all traits. Interaction is more pronounced in males than in females and accounted for an average of about 40% of the explained variation in males and 30% in females. These results indicate that the genetic architecture of these traits has differentiated by genetic drift in the RqI strains since their isolation from a common founder population. Further analysis indicates that this differentiation results in changes in the order of tester strain effects so that common patterns of selection in these differentiated populations could result in the fixation of different alleles.\n      </p>", "Leaf venation is a showcase of plant diversity, ranging from the grid-like network in grasses, to a wide variety of dendritic systems in other angiosperms. A principal function of the venation is to deliver water; however, a hydraulic significance has never been demonstrated for contrasting major venation architectures, including the most basic dichotomy, \"pinnate\" and \"palmate\" systems. We hypothesized that vascular redundancy confers tolerance of vein breakage such as would occur during mechanical or insect damage. We subjected leaves of woody angiosperms of contrasting venation architecture to severing treatments in vivo, and, after wounds healed, made detailed measurements of physiological performance relative to control leaves. When the midrib was severed near the leaf base, the pinnately veined leaves declined strongly in leaf hydraulic conductance, stomatal conductance, and photosynthetic rate, whereas palmately veined leaves were minimally affected. Across all of the species examined, a higher density of primary veins predicted tolerance of midrib damage. This benefit for palmate venation is consistent with its repeated evolution and its biogeographic and habitat distribution. All leaves tested showed complete tolerance of damage to second- and higher-order veins, demonstrating that the parallel flow paths provided by the redundant, reticulate minor vein network protect the leaf from the impact of hydraulic disruption. These findings point to a hydraulic explanation for the diversification of low-order vein architecture and the commonness of reticulate, hierarchical leaf venation. These structures suggest roles for both economic constraints and risk tolerance in shaping leaf morphology during 130 million years of flowering plant evolution.\n      </p>", "Quantitative analyses of sexual expression show extensive interspecific variation in the strength of andromonoecy (proportions of hermaphroditic and staminate flowers) among Solanum species in the monophyletic section Lasiocarpa. The roles of phenotypic plasticity and inter- and intra-inflorescence architecture in the diversification of andromonoecy within this small clade were analyzed. Four species that represent a range of expression of andromonoecy were examined. Staminate flowers produced within inflorescences ranged from 3% (S. candidum) to 7% (S. ferox) in weakly andromonoecious species and from 39% (S. pseudolulo) to 60% (S. quitoense) in more strongly andromonoecious species. Manipulation of fruit set on clonal replicates of multiple genotypes demonstrated variation among species for phenotypic plasticity. The strongly andromonoecious species, 5. pseudolulo and S. quitoense, were not plastic and produced a large proportion of staminate flowers regardless of fruiting treatment, whereas S. candidum and S. ferox were phenotypically plastic and produced significantly more staminate flowers in the presence of developing fruit. Staminate flower production of all four species varied both within and among inflorescences. A greater proportion of staminate flowers were produced in distal (later produced) inflorescences. Within inflorescences, hermaphroditic flowers occurred in basal positions, whereas staminate flowers, when produced, occurred more distally. This pattern of staminate flower production is qualitatively the same in all species investigated; however, quantitative variation in the transition from hermaphroditic to staminate flower production within and among inflorescences is associated with variation in the strength of andromonoecy. At least three factors have contributed to the diversification of andromonoecy in section Lasiocarpa including the presence or absence of phenotypic plasticity in response to fruit set, quantitative variation in intra- and inter-inflorescence architectural effects, and total flower production.\n      </p>", "The abundance of epiphytic macroinvertebrates on aquatic macrophytes can be influenced by different plant architecture types. For example, dissected plants can provide epiphytic macroinvertebrates more substrate for foraging and more cover from predators than undissected plants. Large changes in macrophyte community composition have the potential to strongly influence wholelake macroinvertebrate abundance if overall plant architecture changes. For example, when the exotic macrophyte Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum L., EWM), a dissected plant, invades a lake and becomes dominant, fundamental changes in lake-wide plant architecture occur. We conducted a 6-lake field study and a meta-analysis to examine whether macroinvertebrate density and biomass varies predictably with plant architecture and, if so, whether these relationships are evident at the whole-lake scale when EWM dominates the plant community. We found that higher macroinvertebrate densities and biomass per g of plant were associated with dissected plants than undissected plants in both our field study and out meta-analysis of published studies. However, in our field study, macroinvertebrate densities and biomass per g of plant decreased as the % of EWM cover increased across lakes, although not always significantly. This result suggests that EWM provides different habitat for macroinvertebrates than native dissected plants. Therefore, the macrophyte community may support lower densities and biomass of macroinvertebrates when EWM is dominant at the whole-lake scale. Reduced abundance of macroinvertebrates could have strong impacts on other components of lake food webs.\n      </p>", "Product architecture knowledge is typically embedded in the communication patterns of established development organizations. While this enables the development of products using the existing architecture, it hinders the organization's ability to implement novel architectures, especially for complex products. Structured methods addressing this issue are lacking, as previous research has studied complex product development from two separate perspectives: product architecture and organizational structure. Our research integrates these viewpoints with a structured approach to study how design interfaces in the product architecture map onto communication patterns within the development organization. We investigate how organizational and system boundaries, design interface strength, indirect interactions, and system modularity impact the alignment of design interfaces and team interactions. We hypothesize and test how these factors explain the existence of the following cases: (1) known design interfaces not addressed by team interactions, and (2) observed team interactions not predicted by design interfaces. Our results offer important insights to managers dealing with interdependences across organizational and functional boundaries. In particular, we show how boundary effects moderate the impact of design interface strength and indirect team interactions, and are contingent on system modularity. The research uses data collected from a large commercial aircraft engine development process.\n      </p>", "Contemporary architectural discourse mostly assumes an unmediated link between architecture and culture. This is a historical assumption, however, rooted in colonial encounters when the notion of cultural difference first entered the architectural scene. In the first part of my article, I focus on a statement by Vitruvius that provides ways of thinking about architecture outside cultural identity categories. In the second part, I analyze two nineteenth-century texts to show both the cultural inscriptions of architectural discourse and their breaking points. Finally, I argue that recognizing the historicity of the relationship between architecture and culture involves problematizing architecture as an identity category as much as questioning culture as an architectural category.\n      </p>", "In an effort to elucidate the evolutionary mechanisms that determine the genetic architecture of a species, we have analyzed 17 populations of the microcrustacean Daphnia pulex for levels of genetic variation at the level of life-history characters and molecular markers in the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. This species is highly subdivided, with approximately 30% of the variation for nuclear molecular markers and 50% of the variation for mitochondrial markers being distributed among populations. The average level of genetic subdivision for quantitative traits is essentially the same as that for nuclear markers, which superficially suggests that the life-history characters are diverging at the neutral rate. However, the existence of a strong correlation between the levels of population subdivision and broadsense heritabilities of individual traits argues against this interpretation, suggesting instead that the among-population divergence of some quantitative traits (most notably body size) is being driven by local adaptation to different environments. The fact that the mean phenotypes of the individual populations are also strongly correlated with local levels of homozygosity indicates that variation in local inbreeding plays a role in population differentiation. Rather than being a passive consequence of local founder effects, levels of homozygosity may be selected for directly for their effects on the phenotype (adaptive inbreeding depression). There is no relationship between the levels of variation within populations for molecular markers and quantitative characters, and this is explained by the fact that the average standing genetic variation for life-history characters in this species is equivalent to only 33 generations of variation generated by mutation.\n      </p>", "The crown architectures of 11 Psychotria species native to Barro Colorado Island, Panama were reconstructed from field measurements of leaf and branch geometry with the three-dimensional simulation model Y-plant. The objective was to assess the role of species differences in architecture in light capture and carbon gain in their natural understory environment. When species were grouped according to their putative light environment preference, the shade tolerant species were found to have a small but significantly higher efficiency of light capture for both diffuse and direct light as compared to the light demanding species. Within each grouping, however, there were few significant differences in light capture efficiency among species. The lower efficiencies of light demanding species was due to slightly higher self-shading and slightly lower angular efficiencies. Simulations of whole plant assimilation showed that light demanding species had greater daily assimilation in both direct and diffuse light due to the significantly greater light availability in the sites where light demanding species were found, as compared to those where shade tolerant species occurred. Among light demanding species, the above ground relative growth rate measured over a 1-year period by applying allometric equations for mass versus linear dimensions, was positively correlated with diffuse PFD and with mean daily assimilation estimated from Y-plant. For the shade tolerant plants, there was no significant correlation between RGR and mean daily assimilation or with any measure of light availability, probably because they occurred over a much narrower range of light environments. Overall, the results reveal a strong convergence in light capture efficiencies among the Psychotria species at lower values than previously observed in understory plants using similar approaches. Constraints imposed by other crown functions such as hydraulics and biomechanical support may place upper limits on light capture efficiency.\n      </p>", "In the past decade, the focus of much of what passes for the corporate strategy debate has been on factors external to the firm--initially on industry structure and dynamics, and latterly on changing customer requirements and their implications. While perfectly valid as far as it goes, this outward focus has tended to blind executives to a series of internal factors likely to be even more critical to competitive success in the twenty first century. These factors constitute the key elements of what we call the strategic architecture of the firm. Constructing strategic architecture requires conscious attention to developing mechanisms for organizational learning, innovation and experimentation, constructive contention, empowerment, optimized value potential, corporate sustainability, and strategic re-framing. Firms with a thoughtful and durable commitment to these meta-strategies will not only survive to see the next century, they are likely to dominate it.\n      </p>", "This paper argues that the architecture of a codebase is a critical factor that lies at the heart of the open source development process. We define two observable properties of an architecture: (1) modularity and (2) option value. Developers can often make informed judgments about modularity and option value from early, partially implemented code releases. We show that codebases that are more modular or have more option value (1) increase developers' incentives to join and remain involved in an open source development effort and (2) decrease the amount of free riding in equilibrium. These effects occur because modularity and option value create opportunities for the exchange of valuable work among developers, opportunities that do not exist in codebases that are not modular or have no option value.\n      </p>", "Predictions of root architecture have been tested using only a narrow set of environmental conditions and species. There is little information on root architecture of plants growing on semi-arid grasslands where soil nutrient heterogeneity and defoliation might impose particular restrictions on root growth. We conducted a split-root study to evaluate the effect of nonuniform nutrient supply and clipping on root architecture and biomass allocation of three range grasses found in the Intermountain West of the USA: `Whitmar', a cultivar of Pseudoroegneria spicata, Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass), and `Hycrest', a hybrid between Agropyron desertorum and A. cristatum. Root systems of individual seedlings were equally divided between the two divisions of a partitioned 10-1 pot, and each of the divisions was independently supplied with `high or `low' nutrient solution. Plants were either clipped or not. Characteristics of root architecture (topology and link length), root size (root length and number of root tips), and biomass distribution (specific root length and root mass: root volume ratio) were evaluated. Root topology (branching distribution) changed with nutrient treatments and defoliation in all three species. Length of links (a segment of root between two branches, or between a node and a root tip) responded to nutrient treatment only in defoliated plants of `Whitmar', in which relative growth rate was associated with changes in architectural traits (external-external and internal-internal link length), while biomass accumulation and relative growth rate in cheatgrass and `Hycrest' maintained allometric relationships with root length. Our results suggest that large plasticity in root architecture, together with inherently low relative growth rate are adaptations that allow `Whitmar' to grow well in heterogeneous and poor soil-nutrient conditions. Cheatgrass and `Hycrest' exhibited characteristics suggesting capability for rapid exploitation of nutrient patches.\n      </p>", "Determining the sources of floral variation is crucial to the understanding of floral evolution. Architectural effects and phenotypic plasticity in development can play an important role in intraplant floral variation, giving rise to gender dimorphism or sexual specialization. Amphicarpic plants have another source of floral variation that could also be influenced by positional effects. We studied the effects of resource availability and architecture in intraplant floral variability in two ecotypes of the amphicarpic Emex spinosa. Male flowers were smaller than females, irrespective of position or resource availability. Emex spinosa shows gender dimorphism not influenced by positional effects. Flower size differences among positions were mainly due to architecture, because the effects of resources on flower size were minimal. Architectural effects caused a decrease in female flower size from ground to apical positions but an increase in most male traits that resulted in sexual specialization at the end of flowering. In general, the ecotypes were similarly affected by resources or architecture. Differences between subterranean and aerial female flowers seem also to be a consequence of architecture. Our results contribute to the evidence that resource limitation is an overestimated effect and that architectural effects must be considered in studies of floral or fruit variation.\n      </p>", "Three grasses (Holcus lanatus, Anthoxanthum odoratum and Festuca ovina) and three herbs (Rumex obtusifolius, Plantago lanceolata and Hieracium pilosella) were grown in a greenhouse at 3 nutrient levels in order to evaluate plant allocation, architecture and biomass turnover in relation to fertility level of their habitats. Four harvests were done at intervals of 4 weeks. Various plant traits related to biomass partitioning, plant architecture, biomass turnover and performance were determined. Differences in nutrient supply induced a strong functional response in the species shoot:root allocation, but architecture and turnover showed little or no response. Architectural parameters like specific leaf area and specific root length, however, in general decreased during plant development. Species from more nutrient-rich successional stages were characterized by a larger specific leaf area and longer specific shoot height (height/shoot biomass), resulting in a higher RGR and total biomass in all nutrient conditions. There was no evidence that species from nutrient-poor environments had a longer specific root length or any other superior growth characteristic. The only advantage displayed by these species was a lower leaf turnover when expressed as the fraction of dead leaves and a shorter specific shoot height (SSH) which might prevent herbivory and mowing losses. The dead leaf fraction, which is a good indicator for biomass and nutrient loss, appeared to be not only determined by the leaf longevity, but was also found to be directly related to the RGR of the species. This new fact might explain the slow relative growth rates in species from a nutrient-poor habitat and should be considered in future discussions about turnover.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Branch systems of open- and forest-grown populations of Lonicera maackii(Rupr.) Herder (ages 4-0 years) were compared to assess potential modes ot leal display in different light environments. The branch architecture of open-grown individuals was interpreted as adaptive plasticity. Opengrown individuals when compared to forest-grown individuals were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) taller and wider. This growth form was achieved as a result of increased branching and production of canopy-borne long shoots. The branch architecture expressed by forest-grown L. maackii was interpreted as an indirect response to light limitation rather than adaptive plasticity. Although forest-grown L. maackii expressed branch changes that could potentially maximize height gain (e.g., slower gains in canopy width relative to height gain, less growth in basal stem diameter, and decreased branching), these plants produced few long shoots and were roughly half as tall as open-grown individuals of similar ages. Emergence of L. maackii into a dominant understory position may require threshold light levels so that height gain can be achieved by long shoots released at successively higher canopy positions.\n      </p>", "\u2022 This study aims to link three-dimensional coarse root architecture to tree stability in mature timber trees with an average of 1-m rooting depth. \u2022 Undamaged and uprooted trees were sampled in a stand damaged by a storm.

Uprooted trees showed a lower cage volume, a larger proportion of oblique and intermediate depth horizontal roots and less wind-oriented root reinforcement. \u2022 Pinus pinaster stability on moderately deep soils is optimized through a typical rooting pattern and a considerable structural adaptation to the prevailing wind and soil profile.\n      </p>", "Among mammalian species, the time spent in the two main \u201carchitectural\u201d states of sleep\u2014slow\u2010wave sleep (SWS) and rapid\u2010eye\u2010movement (REM) sleep\u2014varies greatly. Previous comparative studies of sleep architecture found that larger mammals, those with bigger brains, and those with higher absolute basal metabolic rates (BMR) tended to engage in less SWS and REM sleep. Species experiencing a greater risk of predation also exhibited less SWS and REM sleep. In all cases, however, these studies lacked a formal phylogenetic and theoretical framework and used mainly correlational analyses. Using independent contrasts and an updated data set, we extended existing approaches with path analysis to examine the integrated influence of anatomy, physiology, and ecology on sleep architecture. Path model structure was determined by nonmutually exclusive hypotheses for the function of sleep. We found that species with higher relative BMRs engage in less SWS, whereas species with larger relative brain masses engage in more REM sleep. REM sleep was the only sleep variable strongly influenced by predation risk; mammals sleeping in riskier environments engage in less REM sleep. Overall, we found support for some hypotheses for the function of sleep, such as facilitating memory consolidation or learning, but not others, such as energy conservation.\n      </p>", "Oleg Grabar has argued that there was not a system of visual symbols in Islamic culture; consequently it is difflcult to hold that an Islamic architecture exists; that is, if we were to stand before a mosque and try to experience it aesthetically or see what kind of building it is we would not be able to say that it is a mosque.

In a previous study we demonstrated that the two types of ramets are functionally specialised. The production of SRRs results in the formation of consolidated clonal patches with densely packed shoots, while the production of LRRs results in a more diffuse network of connected rhizomes with widely spaced shoots. We hypothesised that the two types of ramets would be produced at different times during the growing season because of their functional differences. The production of LRRs throughout the growing season would enable the species to continuously explore new habitats while the production of SRRs early in the growing season would enable the species to occupy and consolidate resources in available open patches. We evaluated this hypothesis through field observations in different communities with S. americanus and indeed found that SRRs were produced early in the growing season while LRRs tended to be produced over an extended period of time. Plants in high-quality environments (i.e. higher light conditions) produced more SRRs, and these were formed early in the growing season. In contrast, plants in low-quality environments produced more LRRs, and these were formed continuously over the growing season. We also observed that the shoot longevity was greater for SRR. In high-quality patches, the production of the lower cost SRRs results in a more rapid occupancy of open spaces; in lower quality patches, the production of LRRs throughout the growing season enables plants to explore the immediate environment for higher quality patches.\n      </p>", "Although some progress has been made on the quality of Machine Translation in recent years, there is still a significant potential for quality improvement.

Predictions were made, based on a simulation analysis, that root systems from plants grown in low nutrient conditions and those from plants characteristic of such conditions should have the more herringbone topology (branching principally on main axis) and longer links. Both these predictions were confirmed for the dicots, but data from grasses agreed with the predictions only in terms of geometry (link lengths) and not topology. The ecological character of the species was assessed on the assumption that species of low inherent relative growth rate were characteristic of infertile soils. Taxonomic patterns were also evident, indicating that some variation in root system architecture may be historical rather than adaptive.\n      </p>", "The hydraulic architecture of the secondary hemiepiphyte Monstera acuminata was examined in native plants from Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz, Mexico, to determine how it compared to better-known growth forms such as trees, shrubs, lianas and primary hemiepiphytes. Monstera acuminata starts its life cycle as a prostrate herb. As it ascends a tree or other vertical support, the stem becomes thicker, produces larger leaves, and may die back from the base upwards until only aerial feeding roots serve to connect the stem to the soil. Unlike the pattern of vessel-size distribution along the stems of woody dicotyledons, M. acuminata has its wider vessels at the top of the stem, decreasing in diameter towards the base. Also peculiar is the fact that Huber values (axis area/distal leaf area) tend to increase exponentially at higher positions within the plant. Based on the hydraulic conductivity (kh) and leaf-specific conductivity (LSC, kh/distal leaf area), the base of the stem potentially acts as a severe hydraulic constriction. This constriction is apparently not limiting, as aerial roots are produced further up the stem. The plants have remarkably strong root pressures, up to 225 kPa, which may contribute to the maintenance of functional vessels by refilling them at night or during periods of very high atmospheric humidity, as in foggy weather and rain. In common with dicotyledonous plants, vessel length, vessel diameter, kh, specific conductivity (ks, kh/axis area) and LSCs were all positively correlated with axis diameter. The features of the hydraulic architecture of M. acuminata may be an evolutionary consequence of an anatomical constraint (lack of vascular cambium and therefore of secondary growth) and the special requirements of the hemiepiphytic growth form.\n      </p>", "When considering the nature of culture contact and colonialism it is as important to study the continuities in the host society, as it is to study the impositions made by incoming peoples. The diverse relationships between colonised and colonising societies are likely to be played out in aspects of material culture. This study examines Ntsweng and Phalatswe, two Tswana settlements of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the period of transition to British colonial authority. Architectural styles and settlement layout are examined in historical perspective and they demonstrate marked continuities well into the twentieth century. These continuities have to be understood not only in terms of the associations between Africans and Europeans, but also in terms of the nature of power in Tswana communities and, in particular, the relations between chiefs and their people. Chiefly power is also an essential factor in understanding the place of religion and the adoption of Christianity. As a consequence, rather than passively receiving introduced ideas and material culture, it appears that these societies coming under British authority were interpreting and incorporating such elements in ways relevant to their own society.\n      </p>", "A two-component tissue architecture assay system has been devised that tests the ability of human colon carcinoma cells to conform to the specific three-dimensional cell-cell and cell-substratum interactions characteristic of normal colonic tissues. Dissociated fetal rat colonic cells (FRCC) were allowed to reaggregate in suspension with or without the addition of different proportions (0.1%, 1%, and 10% of the total cells) of the human colon carcinoma cell lines, SW-1222 and LS-174T. Cellular aggregates obtained after 36 hours' incubation exhibited cell sorting by the formation of recognizable epithelial colonie crypt-like structures with glandular lumens in a mesenchyme-like background. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-positive SW-1222 cells in 10% mixed aggregates were organized into numerous well-formed glandular structures with a polarized apical distribution of CEA. LS-174T cells, on the other hand, were self-sorted but structurally disorganized with a continuous cell surface CEA distribution. Pure FRCC and mixed aggregates were implanted under the kidney capsules of Swiss nu/nu (nude) or CD-I nu/nu mice and allowed to grow for a period of 7-10 days. Whereas the normal FRCC readily formed colonie tissue, the SW-1222 cells exhibited a capacity for differentiation into colonie crypts which became progressively less normal and more tumor-like as the proportion of carcinoma cells in the aggregates was increased. The LS-174T cells demonstrated poor differentiation at all concentrations. Cell surface levels of CEA and the CEA family member nonspecific crossreacting antigen (NCA), both overexpressed in colon cancer, were higher in LS-174T than in SW-1222 cells, whereas family member biliary glycoprotein (BGP), downregulated in colon carcinoma was higher in the SW-1222 cells. These results thus support the suggestion that deregulated expression of CEA family members can be involved in the ability of colonocytes to differentiate and conform to normal tissue architecture as assessed by the assay. The assay is therefore amenable to genetic analysis of normal and perturbed architectural phenotypes.\n      </p>", "The digital automation of health information has traditionally focused on the formal implementation of electronic health records (EHRs). Most of these EHR systems are relational databases that focus on intra-enterprise applications; very few have become fully functional, scalable, distributed systems with interoperability. This article identifies the design challenges in EHRs and explores the potential of service-oriented architecture in the development of interoperable EHRs. A prototype SOA model for an EHR in a health clinic setting is described. Challenges in the application of the SOA model to health care are discussed. The experience gained from this effort provides valuable insight into how SOA can be developed in health care organizations. The paradigm shift towards an SOA will involve the consideration of \u201chealth care services\u201d as the fundamental basis for developing next-generation health care systems.\n      </p>", "Tree architecture determines a tree's light capture, stability, and efficiency of crown growth. The hypothesis that light demand and adult stature of tree species within a community, independently of each other, determine species' architectural traits was tested by comparing 53 Liberian rain forest tree species. We evaluated whether species differed in their tree height, crown depth, and crown diameter, when compared at a standardized size of 15-cm diameter at breast height, and how their architecture changed early during ontogeny. Tree height was positively correlated with adult stature and light demand. By producing a relatively slender stem, large-stature species are able to rapidly reach their reproductive size, at a low cost for construction and support. Light-demanding species need a slender stem to be able to attain or maintain a position in the canopy. Both crown depth and crown diameter were negatively correlated with adult stature, but not with light demand. This is in contrast with the hypothesis that shade-tolerant species should have a shallow crown to reduce self-shading in a light-limited environment. Investing energy in height growth rather than lateral crown growth allows a rapid vertical stem extension, but crown diameter has to be sufficiently small to reduce the risk of mechanical failure. All architectural patterns were maintained during ontogeny. The key factors driving interspecific differences in tree architecture are the costs of height extension and mechanical stability. In general, light demand and adult stature represent independent axes of architectural differentiation, affecting tree architecture in different ways.\n      </p>"], "words": {"evolutionary":
