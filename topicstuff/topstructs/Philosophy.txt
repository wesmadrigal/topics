Between the two extremes of relativizing historicism, which denies absolute truth, and arrogant scientism, which denies any constructive role for the history of ideas in philosophy, lies a via media in which historical reflection on concepts and their history is placed at the service of the system of cognitive philosophy. Knowledge of the history of philosophy, while not a sine qua non, can empower analytic philosophy to push forward to new and more satisfactory solutions to old and new problems. Examples are adduced from Boche\u0144ski's oeuvre and from the author's own experience.\n      </p>", "To explore the development of contemporary Chinese philosophy, fundamentally, is to explore the development of Marxist philosophy in contemporary China. The disputes over philosophical views in Chinese academic circles during the first half of the twentieth century have been focused on understanding Marxist philosophy from such aspects as \"what kind of philosophy Chinese society needs,\" \"the relation of philosophy to science,\" and \"philosophy as an idea to reflect on one's life.\" These explorations have provided us a significant ideological insight into the development of Marxist philosophy and contemporary Chinese philosophy; that is, in contemporary China, Marxist philosophy, as a doctrine of the liberation and all-round development of human beings, exists not only as a kind of\"doctrine\" or \"academy\" but also as a kind of widely accepted \"xueyuan (academic cultivations)\" among people.\n      </p>", "Since the publication of Dynamic Basis of Geomorphology by Arthur Stahler (1952) geomorphology has become dominated by the process approach to inquiry. This approach treats geomorphological processes and process-form interactions as manifestations of mechanical stresses and strains acting on earth materials. Little attention has been given to the philosophical underpinnings of this approach, which correspond to the doctrine of mechanistic materialism. Concerns about limitations of the process approach have been raised recently, including its inherent reductionism; difficulty in dealing with complex, large-scale geomorphic phenomena; and lack of a historical focus. This article presents an alternative perspective on the dynamic basis of geomorphology grounded in process philosophy. The central theme of process philosophy is that processes are ontologically and epistemologically more primary than substantive material objects. A major implication of process philosophy is that mechanistic concepts, while epistemically valuable, represent abstractions that lack ontological depth. Evidence both from contemporary science and from human experience suggests that the notions of matter as unchanging substance and of dynamic change as matter in motion under mechanistic influences are flawed ontologically. Instead, this evidence indicates that the nature of reality, including geomorphological phenomena, is fundamentally processual. By casting aside the constraints of mechanistic materialism, a process perspective grounded in process philosophy embraces the entire spectrum of research in contemporary geomorphology and has the potential to open new avenues of thought and inquiry, perhaps in ways that may also lead to enhanced connections between human and physical geography.\n      </p>", "Report on a symposium \"Analytical Philosophy of Science today\", July 23-24, 1995, in Beijing.

I introduce the main figures whose work initiated and maintained the sociological orientation in Hungarian philosophy thereby tracing its evolution. I suggest that its sociological outlook, if taken to be a characteristic tendency that gives Hungarian philosophy its distinctive flavour, provides us with the framework of a possible narrative about the history of Hungarian philosophy in the broader context of Central European philosophy. This narrative, in turn, suggests a way of integrating the latter into the history of Western philosophy rather than restricting its scope to a handful of canonical works only.\n      </p>", "Taking a panoramic view on the history of modem philosophy, we can learn that political philosophy, a new arena for modem philosophy, has become an important field in philosophical studies since the later half of the 20th century. As far as the problem domain of political philosophy is concerned, political philosophy is only a special form of philosophy. The revival of political philosophy, however, indicates that philosophical inspection of political matters has regained legitimacy, and also means the restaging of philosophy as a knowledge type at modern times. In one sense, we can view the newly-revived political philosophy as typical modemrn philosophy, because its problem domain, its unique angle of looking into the life world and its ideal concern about the actual world make it one of the best ways in which we can reflect the existence of mankind in modern times.\n      </p>", "The topic is experimental philosophy as a naturalistic movement, and its bearing on the value of intuitions in philosophy. This paper explores first how the movement might bear on philosophy more generally, and how it might amount to something novel and promising. Then it turns to one accomplishment repeatedly claimed for it already: namely, the discrediting of armchair intuitions as used in philosophy.\n      </p>", "The article examines the reception of Western philosophy in Lithuanian philosophy of religion. The purpose is to show how the discourse of philosophy of religion came about in Lithuania. This branch of philosophy has been not only culturally and socially important in Lithuania, it has been significant as well for the formation and maintenance of national identity. By the same token, it also was the most developed and controversial theoretically. The first part of the article lays out the genesis of the autonomous Lithuanian philosophy of religion, though strongly influenced by the transformations in the broader context of European philosophy. For that reason it will be useful to present the ideas of the most prominent Lithuanian thinkers in the field who have successfully adopted and adapted vital trends in Western philosophy into the Lithuanian cultural and intellectual context. The second part of the article is less historical and more problematic as it deals with specific issues concerning faith, God, anthropological problems as reflected in the works of contemporary Lithuanian philosophers of religion. Only after having explored certain affiliations of Lithuanian philosophy of religion with Western thought can we state that, although the latter was the necessary precondition of the former, Lithuanian philosophy of religion does substantiate its sovereign status while correlating in an original way major cultural transformations with the changes in theoretical context, according to the specific concerns of Lithuanian society. In addition, this historical and philosophical examination aims to look at the formation of Lithuanian identity, mentality, values, their roots in the Christian tradition as well as the capacity to respond at critical historical moments.\n      </p>", "The recent increase in philosophy of science articles in strategic management reflects researchers' rising concerns with understanding and securing the field's intellectual foundations. This article argues for a proactive approach to the philosophy of strategy, and for the rejection of conventional, 'off-the-shelf' philosophies that neither contemplated, nor can assimilate, the epistemological messiness and action-connectedness of strategic management. The article responds to Rodolphe Durand's critique, revisits the logic of competitive advantage, and makes the case for a pragmatist philosophy of strategy.\n      </p>", "Globalization was just emerging but did not really take shape during Karl Marx's time. In fact, both Karl Marx and Engels predicted the trend of globalization but did not really live in such a time. Therefore, globalization is still a new issue and a new research area for Marxist philosophy today. Based on the distinctions between some important concepts such as globalization and modernization, this paper probes the problems concerning the development of modernity theory, social morphology and civilization theory, and the Marxist theory of values raised in the process of globalization. The paper also explores some theoretical issues concerning the socialist modernization with Chinese characteristics in the Marxist philosophy, and contemplates possible research areas, angles and methods of Marxist philosophical research in the global era.\n      </p>", "Since the \"Conference on Foreign Philosophy\" held in Wuhu in October 1978, the study of foreign philosophy in China has undergone a prosperous stage. This article discusses the significance of the study of foreign philosophy in the context of renovation, transformation and remolding of Chinese contemporary culture, explores the role of the discipline in the context of Chinese cultural construction, and anticipates the future of this discipline. A cross-cultural perspective is needed for a proper understanding of the significance of the learning and study of foreign philosophy in Chinese cultural construction; otherwise we might fall into cultural conservationism. Secondly, to make philosophy and social sciences prosperous is also a task for foreign philosophy studies, and whether or not foreign philosophy can be well studied should be a mark of the prosperousness of the construction of Chinese culture. Finally, philosophy is a product of human beings and should eventually serve human beings. Chinese culture should open itself up to the world and so should foreign philosophy studies in China.\n      </p>", "In this paper, we suggest that constructivism has the potential to inform research in strategic management. The realist paradigm currently dominates strategy research, and constructivism, a well-established tradition in the philosophy of science, is often ignored. However, a study of strategy literature and research reveals that it is drawn upon more frequently than is explicitly acknowledged. Constructivism occupies a methodological space characterized by ontological realism and epistemological relativism. Ontological realism is an important cornerstone of a field as applied as strategy, while epistemological relativism helps us explore the constructed nature of the field, where the researcher is an active participant rather than a reactor or information processor. In this paper, we demonstrate the precedents and possibilities for constructivist research in strategic management. We examine some of the existent constructivist works in the strategy literature, and point to specific techniques, including historical analysis, to demonstrate how this perspective may advance the boundaries of strategy research.\n      </p>", "In my journey in understanding and appreciating West Churchman's writings, I have distilled three ideas from a small selection of Churchman's writings relevant to the practice of management science.

First, they tend to concern large frameworks rather than specific questions within the framework. Second, they are questions for which there is no generally accepted method of solution. And third they tend to involve conceptual issues. For these reasons a philosophical problem such as the nature of life can become a scientific problem if it is put into a shape where it admits of scientific resolution. Philosophy in the 20th century was characterized by a concern with logic and language, which is markedly different from the concerns of earlier centuries of philosophy. However, it shared with the European philosophical tradition since the 17th century an excessive concern with issues in the theory of knowledge and with scepticism. As the century ends, we can see that scepticism no longer occupies centre stage, and this enables us to have a more constructive approach to philosophical problems than was possible for earlier generations. This situation is somewhat analogous to the shift from the sceptical concerns of Socrates and Plato to the constructive philosophical enterprise of Aristotle. With that in mind, we can discuss the prospects for the following six philosophical areas: (i) the traditional mind-body problem; (ii) the philosophy of mind and cognitive science; (iii) the philosophy of language; (iv) the philosophy of society; (v) ethics and practical reason; (vi) the philosophy of science. The general theme of these investigations, I believe, is that the appraisal of the true significance of issues in the philosophy of knowledge enables us to have a more constructive account of various other philosophical problems than has typically been possible for the past three centuries\n      </p>", "The current linkages between ethical theory and management behavior are investigated in the wake of the much-publicized convictions of Enron executives. The vignettes used in this investigation represent ethical dilemmas in the areas of coercion and control, conflict of interest, physical environment, and personal integrity. Since 2003, and after the successful prosecution of Enron executives, the link between ethical philosophy and management behavior has shifted somewhat dramatically. There has been a significant change in the rational basis for managerial decision making. In 2003, even after the Enron scandal was publicized, practitioners still relied heavily on both act and rule utilitarian ethical philosophies when making business decisions. Currently, the majority of respondents are likely to select ethically appropriate actions based on either rule utilitarian or rights rationales. It appears that ethical behavior is now more in line with ethical rhetoric, which may positively impact the ethical climate of business decision making. Apparently, business scandals of the past did not really impact actual ethical behavior much, but the high-profile prosecutions, convictions, and jail sentences may have impressed on managers that now is the time to incorporate ethics into business decisions\n      </p>", "The power, depth, and humanity of the work and life of Josiah Royce gains in richness by following his reflections on the problems of philosophical pedagogy.

Except for a few personal recollections from his students and colleagues, an article by Frank M.

I reexamine these issues from the different perspective of the philosophy of history. Just as philosophers of history distinguish between chronicle (non-interpretive or non-explanatory writing) and narrative history (interpretive or explanatory writing), I distinguish between evolutionary chronicle (cladograms, broadly construed) and narrative evolutionary history. Systematics is the discipline which estimates the evolutionary chronicle. Explanations of the events described in the evolutionary chronicle are not of the covering-law type described by philosophers of science, but rather of the how-possibly, continuous series, and integrating types described by philosophers of history. Pre-evolutionary explanations of states (in contrast to chroniclar events) are still widespread in \"evolutionary\" biology, however, because evolutionary chronicles are in general poorly known. To the extent that chronicles are known, the narrative evolutionary histories based on them are structured like conventional historical narratives, in that they treat their central subjects as ontological individuals. This conventional treatment is incorrect. The central subjects of evolutionary narratives are clades, branched entities which have some of the properties of individuals and some of the properties of classes. Our unconscious treatment of the subjects of evolutionary narratives as individuals has been the cause of erroneous notions of progress in evolution, and of views that taxa \"develop\" ontogenetically in ways analogous to individual organisms. We must rewrite our narrative evolutionary histories so that they properly represent the branching nature of evolution, and we must reframe our evolutionary philosophies so that they properly reflect the historical nature of our subject.\n      </p>", "In this article, the author argues that Africana critical theory or Black existential philosophy is the philosophical discourse that critiques domination and affirms the empowerment of Black people in the world. However, although Africana critical theory shares similar concerns and themes such as existence, consciousness, trepidation, meaninglessness, hopelessness, fear, despair, servility, and abasement with European existentialism, there are important distinctions between them. For example, although European existentialism is, as Gordon says, \"predicated on the uniqueness of the individual as well as on a universalist conception of humans and their obligation to self,\" Africana critical theory or Black existential philosophy is predicated on the liberation of all Black people in the world from oppression.\n      </p>", "Fully embracing previous achievements in the research of Taoist philosophy, this paper attempts to create a sound analysis and investigation of the value concern of Taoism and reconstruct a new set of Taoist philosophy conforming to the requirement of modern science from the perspective of modern philosophy.

Given her anti-philosophical orientation, those scholars who use philosophy to interpret Woolf, I argue, are implicitly at odds with her aesthetic. Crucial to my argument is Woolf's conception of what I refer to as the semiotic unconscious, which predetermines the conceptual systems we use to systematize our experiences of the world. Based on my findings, I suggest an alternative frame for understanding Woolf's treatment of philosophy and, more generally, modernist anti-philosophicalism. Instead of assuming that philosophy signifies intellectual depth, as many scholars do, I suggest approaching Woolf, as well as many modernists, in terms of their scathing critique of philosophy. What we need are more studies that use a new frame to discuss the literary modernist assault on philosophy. As for Woolf, I conclude: to have an intimate understanding of her work, we must first banish philosophy and the philosopher.\n      </p>", "The power, depth, and humanity of the work and life of Josiah Royce gains in richness by following his reflections on the problems of philosophical pedagogy.

Contemporary relationships between the two fields are still to some extent marked by the distrust that maintains the divide between the so-called \u201ctwo cultures.\u201d An increasing number of philosophers, however, are making conceptual contributions to sciences ranging from quantum mechanics to evolutionary biology, and a few scientists are conducting research relevant to classically philosophical fields of inquiry, such as consciousness and moral decision-making.

His loss is a great blow to American philosophy.\n      </p>", "If the philosophy of science embraces the construction of knowledge to improve the human condition, then it should also embrace the prevention of the demolition of knowledge that supports the human condition. Nonhuman species are endowed with knowledge, albeit with varying levels of cognition. Nonhuman knowledge grows freely, with no political agenda and no methodological bias. Much nonhuman knowledge is unavailable to humans but is used in unwitting support of the human condition by producing human goods and services. Some nonhuman knowledge may be used directly to expand the human knowledge base. The ratio of human knowledge to nonhuman knowledge influences the sum of knowledge and the human condition. There is evidence that the ratio of human economy to total knowledge is too high and that the nonhuman component of total knowledge is deficient. The philosophy of science, led by the wildlife profession, should be expanded to incorporate nonhuman knowledge. Eventually, scientists of all disciplines should unite against the threats to total knowledge and the human condition posed by the erosion of nonhuman knowledge.\n      </p>", "History and philosophy complement and overlap each other in subject matter, but the two disciplines exhibit conflict over methodology. Since Hempel's challenge to historians that they should adopt the covering law model of explanation, the methodological conflict has revolved around the respective roles of the general and the particular in each discipline. In recent years, the revival of narrativism in history, coupled with the trend in philosophy of science to rely upon case studies, joins the methodological conflict anew. So long as contemporary philosophy of science relies upon history's methodology to construct its case studies, it subjects itself to a paradoxical situation: the better the history, the worse the philosophy. An example of the methodological conflict is presented in the case of Antoine Lavoisier. This example also serves our ultimate conclusion, which is that distinctively philosophical methods of case-study design promise enhanced prescriptive powers for philosophy of science.\n      </p>", "This article is based on the presupposition that postmodern philosophy has been largely influenced by Nietzsche's writings. The author raises the question of how Nietzsche and postmodern philosophy are interpreted in the contemporary philosophical discourse in Lithuania. The conclusion drawn is that many philosophy critics in Lithuania are interested in Nietzsche's philosophy (Mickevi\u017eius, Sodeika, \u0160erpytyt\u00e8, Sverdiolas, Baranova) and in the problems of postmodern philosophy (Ker\u0161yt\u00e8, Rubavi\u017eius, \u017dukauskait\u00e9, Serpytyt\u00e8, \u0160verdiolas, Baranova, Norkus). The article also raises a second crucial question: beyond the critics, are there any truly authentic postmodern thinkers in Lithuania? This article's main hypotheses is that Arvydas \u0160liogeris' philosophy is the best and perhaps the only example of original Lithuanian postmodern thought; it is based on, and interconnected with, the deeply inherited roots of existential thought in Lithuanian philosophical culture. The arguments for these hypotheses are as follows: first, \u0160liogeris is the first philosopher in Lithuania who has tried to reason in an interdisciplinary manner, e. g. trying to overcome the modernistic distinction between philosophy and the arts (especially literature, poetry, and the visual arts); secondly, \u0160liogeris's philosophizing is indispensable to his writings\u2014 his texts are examples of an experience of writing as thinking and thinking as writing; thirdly, following Deleuze's presupposition that the philosopher is a creator, one can see this creative aspect in \u0160liogeris's approach. His texts show how it is possible to synthesize insights from philosophy and poetry.\n      </p>", "Modern Lithuanian philosophy originated as a response to the questions formulated in Russian philosophy--religious, moral, and social. Later it turned to Continental European philosophy, preoccupying itself with German and French existentialism, hermeneutics, and phenomenology. Yet the loss of independent political and intellectual existence Lithuania experienced for five decades isolated and marginalized the then lively and promising intellectual culture. In the 1980s, Lithuanian philosophy started recovering and reorienting itself, again, to Western currents of modern theoretical thought.

Chicherin transformed Hegel's ideas to such an extent that the main concept of his philosophy became the concept of the person, and the main problem was the description of the person's connection to the Absolute. Chicherin was also known as a representative of the liberal tradition in Russia. However, he criticized classical western liberalism for belittling the value of the state. Chicherin's liberal theory was under construction in a dialectical combination of two principles: recognition of the absolute value of the person and its freedom and recognition of the necessity of a strong state for the solution of some general problems in the absence of which it will be impossible to realize the principle of freedom in all its completeness.\n      </p>", "The first Lithuanians to be introduced to philosophy were young members of the gentry who studied in European universities at the end of the 14th century. The recently christened Lithuania strove to adopt Western culture and to present itself as a Western state. At the end of the 14th century, the Vilnius Cathedral School was founded. The elements of logic were probably taught there. The growth of the political and economic power of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania brought about the need for higher education. The need was significantly increased by the growing activity of various religious orders. In 1507, the Dominicans started teaching philosophy and theology to their novices in Vilnius. They taught late medieval philosophy in its Thomistic interpretation. We can regard 1507 as the year Lithuania began to benefit from a new phenomenon, professional philosophy, with the Dominicans as its initiators. The Dominicans and later the Jesuits, Franciscans, Benedictines, Carmelites, Trinitarians, and other monastic orders enriched intellectual life in Lithuania by teaching philosophy in their schools. The most important event in the development of philosophy in Lithuania was the foundation of Vilnius University in 1579. The disciplines belonging to scholasticism of the second level were taught in its philosophy department.\n      </p>", "We argue that philosophical and historical research can constitute a \u201cBiohumanities\u201d that deepens our understanding of biology itself, engages in constructive \u201cscience criticism,\u201d helps formulate new \u201cvisions of biology,\u201d and facilitates \u201ccritical science communication.\u201d We illustrate these ideas with two recent \u201cexperimental philosophy\u201d studies of the concept of the gene and of the concept of innateness conducted by ourselves and collaborators.

The structure of the argument of this paper is to outline the main positions within the philosophy of science and highlight their problems, especially from the point of view of OR/MS; then to introduce critical realism and to show how it addresses these problems and how it is particularly appropriate for OR/MS; and finally to illustrate this by considering examples of various practical OR methods.\n      </p>", "When Socrates was accused in 399 BC of corrupting the young, the harm that his one-time associate Alcibiades did to Athens provided fuel for the charges against him. By setting the Symposium in 416 BC, just one year before Alcibiades led Athens on the disastrous Sicilian expedition, Plato revisits the charge that Socrates corrupts the young. In particular, does Socrates' freedom from the accepted opinions of his city and the \"universalism \" of the truth he pursues find political expression in imperialistic ambitions such as Alcibiades'? Exploring the role of Alcibiades in the Symposium, including his \"praise\" of Socrates, I argue that Socratic philosophy properly understood is a \"middle\"state (e.g., between ignorance and wisdom), and as such cannot represent an escape from one's particular political community into imperialistic politics. Moreover, as a middle state it is characterized by reciprocity, and as such offers a model for political life different from Alcibiades' imperialism.\n      </p>", "This paper is a background study.

Epistemically, the approaches one finds in the simulation literature run the gamut from objectivist to relativist with shades in between. At present in the philosophy of science, there appears to be a convergence toward a nonalgorithmic but discursive and nonrelativistic view of the argumentation involved in warranting scientific theorizing. The present paper attempts to give a description of the various philosophical positions as well as to summarize their problems and the kinds of evidentiary arguments they would each allow in arriving at defensible simulation models. From the debate, we attempt to set out a perspective that frees the practioner to pursue a varied set of approaches to validation with a diminished burden of methodological anxiety. Reciprocally this perspective does not let the modeler off of the hook but rather converts the validation problem into an ethical problem in which the practitioner must responsibly and professionally argue for the warrant of the model.\n      </p>", "An analytical review of the current situation of Christian philosophy in Russia is presented, aiming to explain, why so much expected renaissance of this philosophy in the post-soviet period did not take place.

It is the basic interest of Marx's philosophy of practice to find a way to end this separation via critique of civil society. Therefore, Marx's philosophy of practice has a clear significance, which manifests in the following aspects: one is \"liberation politics,\" and the other, \"the regulatory mode of the socio-political institution.\" /// \u63a2\u8ba8\u9a6c\u514b\u601d\u5b9e\u8df5\u54f2\u5b66\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u610f\u8574\u662f\u6df1\u5316\u5b9e\u8df5\u54f2\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u9a6c\u514b \u601d\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u54f2\u5b66\u6df1\u690d\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3\u6027\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\u4e2a\u4eba\u4e3b\u4f53\u6027\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u5171\u540c\u4f53\u7684\u5206 \u88c2\u4e0e\u51b2\u7a81\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u5176\u6df1\u5c42\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u80cc\u666f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5e02\u6c11\u793e\u4f1a\u6279\u5224\uff0c\u6765\u5bfb\u6c42\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e00\u5206\u88c2\u548c\u51b2 \u7a81\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u9053\u8def\uff0c\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u9a6c\u514b\u601d\u5b9e\u8df5\u54f2\u5b66\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u8bfe\u9898\u4e0e\u6df1\u5c42\u65e8\u8da3\u3002\u56f4\u7ed5\u8fd9\u4e00\u8bfe\u9898\u89e3 \u653e\u653f\u6cbb\"\u4e0e\u2018\u793e\u4f1a\u653f\u6cbb\u5236\u5ea6\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u6a21\u5f0f\"\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u9a6c\u514b\u601d\u5b9e\u8df5\u54f2\u5b66\u653f\u6cbb\u610f\u8574\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c \u5411\u5ea6\u3002\n      </p>", "The author examines, historically and theoretically, issues related to the state and current tendencies of post-Soviet Russian philosophy.

The article shows that although the adoption of a corporate management philosophy does not contribute to corporate financial performance directly, some value orientations might contribute to non-financial performance and longterm performance potentials. Especially, CSR environmental performance might be contributed by customer orientation and harmony; human resource management performance is associated with partner orientation and harmony; growth potential might be related with global orientation, entrepreneurship, and honesty.

Few areas of science raise such high expectations and meet with so much sceptical resistance as Artificial Intelligence (AI). So it is the task of philosophy of science and technology to analyze the factual methodological possibilities of AI-technology. After a historical sketch of AI-development (Chapter 2), the technological foundations of expert systems are described (Chapter 3). It is a surprising result of analysis that expert systems are technical realizations of well-known philosophical methodologies. In this very sense, AI is not only technology, but philosophy too (Chapter 4). On the other hand the question arises if knowledge-based systems can support the work of philosophers of science who want to explain the process of scientific research, inventions, and discoveries. This application of AI for the philosophical professionals is discussed in the 5th chapter. In the 6th chapter some scenarios of AI-technology are described which are expected in the nineties. Then, besides philosophy of science and technology, we have to consider the ethical questions which arise in evaluating the factual impact of AI-technology on our lives and society.\n      </p>", "Josef Boche\u0144ski, pioneer of the discipline of philosophical sovietology and one of the first to criticize Eurocentric attitudes, emphasized the central role of logic and sound argument in academic philosophy.

Any phylogenetic inference method can provide Popperian \"evidence\" or \"test statements\" based on the method's goodness-of-fit values for different tree hypotheses. Corroboration, or the severity of that test, requires that the evidence is improbable without the hypothesis, given only background knowledge that includes elements of chance. This framework contrasts with attempted Popperian justifications for cladistic parsimony-in which evidence is the data, background knowledge is restricted to descent with modification, and \"corroboration,\" as a by-product of nonfalsification, is to be measured by cladistic parsimony. Recognition that cladistic \"corroboration\" reflects only goodness-of-fit, not corroboration/severity, makes it clear that standard cladistic prohibitions, such as restrictions on the evolutionary models to be included in \"background knowledge,\" have no philosophical status. The capacity to assess Popperian corroboration neither justifies nor excludes any phylogenetic method, but it does provide a framework in phylogenetics for learning from errors-cases where apparent good evidence is probable even without the hypothesis. We explore these issues in the context of corroboration assessments applied to likelihood methods and to a new form of parsimony. These different forms of evidence and corroboration assessment point also to a new way to combine evidence-not at the level of overall fit, but at the level of overall corroboration/severity. We conclude that progress in an inclusive phylogenetics will be well served by the rejection of cladistic philosophy.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "There are 3 philosophies that differ in what they consider the ultimate goal of wildlife management and for whom we are managing wildlife. The philosophy, \"man is the measure of all things,\" is based on writings in the Old Testament and the ancient Greek philosopher, Protagoras. It argues that the goal of wildlife management is to satisfy immediate human needs and desires and that wildlife has no value except to fulfill human needs. This philosophy prevailed in North America from the era of colonization to the late 1800s. By the late nineteenth century, this dominant philosophy was challenged by its antithesis, which argued that wildlife has inherent value that must be recognized and preserved for its own right. This philosophy, which argues that we are managing \"for the resource,\" has been adopted by some wildlife professionals, but lacks public appeal. It also provides little guidance about how to prioritize environmental threats because of its abstractness. Too often, these 2 mutually exclusive philosophies have divided wildlife managers and kept them from working together. Between these 2 lies a third philosophy which holds that we have a fiduciary responsibility to manage the wildlife resource for future generations. The primary tenet of the fiduciary philosophy is that no generation should take actions affecting the wildlife resource which are irrevocable and cannot be undone. By upholding the idea that we manage for mankind's sake and yet calling for self-restraint and self-sacrifice, the fiduciary philosophy combines the key elements of both of the other philosophies. Society, which has never fully embraced the concept that wildlife should be protected for its own right, may be more receptive to a philosophy of preserving resources for our children.\n      </p>", "Gorbachev's ascent to power in the Soviet Union in 1985 and the events that followed appear to have led to a dramatic decline in philosophers' interest in Marxist philosophy.

Science and philosophy share certain methodological concerns and practices; therefore, scientists who disregard philosophy are vulnerable to critical conceptual mistakes.

These movements are contemporary expressions of resistance to centuries if not millennia of violent oppression.

Then it treats the emergence of the philosophy of science focussing on the most significant representatives of this branch of philosophy, which was up to that time almost unknown in Hungary. Due to the fact that the important results in Hungarian philosophy of science run parallel with the reception and translation of the significant products of Western philosophy, such as Wittgenstein's, Popper's, Kuhn's, or Polanyi's works, the report gives relatively significant room to treat these achievements.

Jonathan R\u00e9e, with his book \"I See a Voice,\" makes the point that a philosophical history, grounded in a phenomenological and causal concern with philosophical thought and social life, can offer an archaeology of philosophy's contribution to the social oppression of deaf people. This article offers support for such a project while being critical of R\u00e9e's philosophical phenomenology, since it presumes, \u00e0 priori, two ideas about deafness and sign language: firstly, that deaf experience is like hearing experience but without hearing; and secondly, that the iconic qualities of sign languages are strictly superficial phenomena. Both presumptions, it is argued here, derive from the same philosophical knowledge which has linked deafness to the sense of hearing and the voice, and in doing so secured an intellectual basis for the oppression of deaf people in social life. Instead it is proposed, using examples of sign language use, that deafness as sensory experience is best understood by reference to the sense of sight; that iconicity is a central creative resource in sign language formation, maintenance and productivity; that R\u00e9e's philosophical phenomenology, as a metatheoretical critique of philosophical knowledge, proves unable to self-reflexively uncover (let alone overcome) existing presumptions in philosophy and social life; and that as a consequence that project itself risks perpetuating, within philosophy, key conditions of the oppression of deaf people.\n      </p>", "This paper attempts to mediate between the extremes of a managerial conception of business ethics which subordinates it to management and a political conception which subordinates it to political philosophy. The mediated position arrived at sees the central focus of business ethics in the intersection of micro-managerial concerns with macro-political ones provided by the task of determining morally optimum forms of business. Involvement with the macro rules out subordination to management while, conversely, involvement with the micro rules out subordination to political philosophy. Moreover, such is the (increasing) social importance of business, that business ethics can have at least co-equal explanatory status with political philosophy as a discipline.\n      </p>", "There is a need to bring ethics and medical practice closer together, despite the risk and problems this may involve. Deontological ethics may promote sanctity of life considerations against the quality of life considerations favoured by consequentialists or utilitarians; while talk of respect for life and the value of life may point to more qualified ethical positions. This paper argues for a respect-for-life position, dismissing a utilitarian cost-benefit outlook as too simplistic; but an unqualified fixed principles approach is also ruled out, both because of its unacceptable consequences in individual cases and also because of its reliance on the slippery slope argument which, it is argued, is logically and psychologically deficient. The case of genetic engineering provides an example in which the notion of respect may operate, but in which broad general principles also apply. A cautious conservatism towards accepted principles is recommended in the development of medical technologies.\n      </p>", "James Campbell's recent book A Thoughtful Profession is an important contribution to our understanding of the state of professional philosophy at the turn of the 20th century, of the development of the American Philosophical Association, and the character of philosophy itself. Its value lies in several Points: 1) understanding the historical roots of the APA helps us to understand its contemporary condition; 2) by exploring the origins of the APA Campbell sheds light on the issues that moved philosophers a century ago, and how they envisioned the discipline developing as a serious, academic profession; 3) the survey the book provides of the arguments then current over the nature of the philosophical enterprise are relevant today as practicing philosophers continue to debate the nature of the discipline, and it suggests important similarities with other disciplines; and 4) the account of the reasons for the creation of the APA remind us how important it is that philosophers continue to have organized, institutional ways for us to communicate.

Three separate associations were formed during this period in response \"to the impact of contemporary science and technology on American thinking, ... the increasing democratizing of American higher education,\" and \"the impact of the German system of higher education. As a result of these three factors, higher education in America was fundamentally changed; and the practice of academic philosophy was changed with it\" (Campbell, p. 18). I recount how this book tells the story of that change and the eventual formation of the APA in the 1920s from these three associations. We still live with the effects of this professionalization of academic philosophy and of the decision to form a division-dominated national association.\n      </p>", "The German physicist Heinrich Hertz played a decisive role for Wittgenstein's use of a unique philosophical method. Wittgenstein applied this method successfully to critical problems in logic and mathematics throughout his life. Logical paradoxes and foundational problems including those of mathematics were seen as pseudo-problems requiring clarity instead of solution. In effect, Wittgenstein's controversial response to David Hilbert and Kurt G\u00f6del was deeply influenced by Hertz and can only be fully understood when seen in this context. To comprehend the arguments against the metamathematical programme, and to appreciate how profoundly the philosophical method employed actually shaped the content of Wittgenstein's philosophy, it is necessary to make an intellectual biographical reconstruction of their philosophical framework, tracing the Hertzian elements in the early as well as in the later writings. In order to write Wittgenstein's biography, we have to take seriously the coherence of his thought throughout his life, and not let convenient philosophical ideologies be our guidance in drawing up a \"Wittgensteinian philosophy\". To do so, we have to take a second look upon what he actually wrote, not only in the already published material, but in the entire Nachlass. Clearly, this is not easily done, but it is a necessary task in the historical reconstruction of Wittgenstein's life and work.\n      </p>", "Advocates of cladistic parsimony methods have invoked the philosophy of Karl Popper in an attempt to argue for the superiority of those methods over phylogenetic methods based on Ronald Fisher's statistical principle of likelihood. We argue that the concept of likelihood in general, and its application to problems of phylogenetic inference in particular, are highly compatible with Popper's philosophy. Examination of Popper's writings reveals that his concept of corroboration is, in fact, based on likelihood. Moreover, because probabilistic assumptions are necessary for calculating the probabilities that define Popper's corroboration, likelihood methods of phylogenetic inference-with their explicit probabilistic basis-are easily reconciled with his concept. In contrast, cladistic parsimony methods, at least as described by certain advocates of those methods, are less easily reconciled with Popper's concept of corroboration. If those methods are interpreted as lacking probabilistic assumptions, then they are incompatible with corroboration. Conversely, if parsimony methods are to be considered compatible with corroboration, then they must be interpreted as carrying implicit probabilistic assumptions. Thus, the non-probabilistic interpretation of cladistic parsimony favored by some advocates of those methods is contradicted by an attempt by the same authors to justify parsimony methods in terms of Popper's concept of corroboration. In addition to being compatible with Popperian corroboration, the likelihood approach to phylogenetic inference permits researchers to test the assumptions of their analytical methods (models) in a way that is consistent with Popper's ideas about the provisional nature of background knowledge.\n      </p>", "This paper is a response to a series of five papers\u2014by Michael Eldridge, Bruce Kuklick, John Lachs, Erin McKenna, and John Ryder\u2014that examine my recently published volume, A Thoughtful Profession: The Early Years of the American Philosophical Association.

Popper's approach is based on the naturalistic idea that society has developed through a process of solving problems using trial and error. The natural and social sciences have been born out of such problem solving and progressed by subjecting potential theories to vigorous testing and criticism. Falsified theories are rejected. Popper calls for a society which is conducive to such problem solving, a society which permits bold theorizing followed by unfettered criticism, a society in which there is a genuine possibility of change in the light of criticism: an open society.

I emphasize his seminal ideas concerning (a) the differentiation between the science of management and management science and (b) the resolution of dilemmas confronting the paradigm and discuss Churchman's ideas on how the modern inquiring system-a system dedicated to the acquisition and production of knowledge and to the ethical solution of contemporary management problems-should be designed.\n      </p>", "The concept of the tragic has been frequently discussed as a major theme in literary theory and the philosophy of art. Eventually it took renewed significance in the case of Unamuno when he assigned to this concept a central role in defining the meaning of human life. Whereas Unamuno had decidedly extended the concept of the tragic beyond anything the Greeks thought about it and attached to it his religious convictions about the meaning of life, Santayana regarded the tragic in a totally different way. He essayed to design it as a concept that could recapture the original classical view as far as modernity could assimilate it. The present article explores the basic ideas that Unamuno and Santayana employed in their respective views of the tragic and discussed the historical antecedents as well as the irreconcilable differences between the two thinkers.\n      </p>", "The view of language is greatly changed from early modern philosophy to later modern philosophy and to postmodern philosophy. The linguistic question in early modern philosophy, which is characterized by rationalism and empiricism, is discussed in this paper. Linguistic phenomena are not at the center of philosophical reflections in early modern philosophy. The subject of consciousness is at the center of the philosophy, which makes language serve purely as an instrument for representing thoughts. Locke, Leibniz and Descartes consider language from a representationalist point of view. To them, language itself is idealized and represents thought as if it were thought representing itself. Like the structural linguist Saussure, the founders of phenomenology and analytical philosophy give much attention to the logical or static structure of language, and stick up for the representationalism of early modern philosophy. However, their successors refuse to accept this attitude, meaning the final collapse of representationalism. /// \u4ece\u65e9\u671f\u73b0\u4ee3\u54f2\u5b66\u5230\u540e\u671f\u73b0\u4ee3\u54f2\u5b66\u518d\u5230\u540e\u73b0\u4ee3\u54f2\u5b66\uff0c\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u89c2\u4e0a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u91cd\u5927\u7684 \u53d8\u5316\u3002\u65e9\u671f\u73b0\u4ee3\u54f2\u5b66\u4ee5\u552f\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bba\u4e3a\u5178\u578b\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u8bed\u8a00\u73b0\u8c61\u6ca1\u6709\u6210\u4e3a\u8be5\u65f6\u671f\u54f2\u5b66 \u53cd\u601d\u7684\u4e2d\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898; \u610f\u8bc6\u4e3b\u4f53\u5904\u4e8e\u54f2\u5b66\u7684\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u8bed\u8a00\u4ec5\u4ec5\u5145\u5f53\u7740\u8868\u8c61\u601d\u60f3\u7684\u5de5 \u5177\u3002\u6d1b\u514b\u3001\u83b1\u5e03\u5c3c\u8328\u548c\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u90fd\u4ece\u8868\u8c61\u8bba\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u770b\u5f85\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5728\u4ed6\u4eec\u90a3\u91cc\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u672c\u8eab \u88ab\u89c2\u5ff5\u5316\u4e86\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u8868\u8c61\u601d\u60f3\uff0c\u5c31\u50cf\u601d\u60f3\u5728\u8868\u8c61\u5b83\u81ea\u8eab\u3002\u6b63\u50cf\u7ed3\u6784\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u5bb6\u7d22\u7eea\u5c14\u4e00 \u6837\uff0c\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u548c\u5206\u6790\u54f2\u5b66\u7684\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u90fd\u662f\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u7ed3\u6784\u6216\u9759\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5ef6\u7eed \u4e86\u65e9\u671f\u73b0\u4ee3\u54f2\u5b66\u7684\u8868\u8c61\u8bba\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u540e\u7ee7\u8005\u62d2\u7edd\u63a5\u53d7\u8fd9\u79cd\u6001\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u6700\u7ec8\u7a81 \u7834\u8868\u8c61\u8bba\u3002\n      </p>", "Teachings of Vedantic philosophy, developed in India several thousand years ago, are relevant to today's world.

The author rehearses previous critiques of positivist \"dogmas\" in education research and applies them to the new orthodoxy.

Its philosophical foundations and premises are not yet well understood. In recent times, members of the software engineering community have started to search for such foundations. In particular, the philosophies of Kuhn and Popper have been used by philosophically-minded software engineers in search of a deeper understanding of their discipline. It seems, however, that professional philosophers of science are not yet aware of this new discourse within the field of software engineering. Therefore, this article aims to reflect critically upon recent software engineers' attempts towards a philosophy of software engineering and to introduce our own philosophical thoughts in this context.

All historians are deeply familiar with Kuhn's work and influence, and most know of the remarkable impact Gould has had on evolutionary theory through both his professional and popular works. But little attention has been paid to the depth, scope, and importance of Gould's r\u00f4le as historian and philosopher of science, and his use of popular science exposition to reinforce old knowledge and generate new. This paper presents the results of an extensive quantitative content analysis of Gould's 22 books, 101 book reviews, 479 scientific papers, and 300 \"Natural History\" essays, in terms of their subject matter (Evolutionary Theory, History and Philosophy of Science, Natural History, Paleontology/Geology, Social Science/Commentary), and thematic dichotomies (Theory-Data, Time's Arrow-Time's Cycle, Adaptationism- Nonadaptationism, Punctuationism-Gradualism, Contingency-Necessity). Special emphasis is placed on the interaction between the subjects and themata, how Gould has used the history of science to reinforce his evolutionary theory (and vice versa), and how his philosophy of science has influenced both his evolutionary theory and his historiography. That philosophy can best be summed up in a quotation from Charles Darwin, frequently cited by Gould: 'All observation must be for or against some view if it is to be of any service'. Gould followed Darwin's advice throughout his career, including his extensive writings on the history and philosophy of science.\n      </p>", "In the late 1930's Blondel precipitated a debate over the question of a Christian philosophy in a series of articles on St. Augustine insisting on the philosophical nature of the saint's thought. Rationalist historian of philosophy Br\u00e9hier objected to the very idea of a Christian philosophy. Other historians like Gilson allowed that a philosophy could be characterized loosely as Christian when it was associated with Christian thought, as in the Middle Ages. But Blondel argued against both of these positions as presupposing a separation between philosophy and religion that allowed only for a false hybridization between the two when they were juxtaposed. His own approach to philosophy had been to show a necessary intersection between the two in the question about the ultimate meaning of human action as it relates to God in his infinite transcendence, as this had long been understood in the Catholic tradition, that is, as relating to something supernatural in the strictest sense, something bound to appear as scandalous and paradoxical to reason alone. The present article examines how he first came to his philosophical method for dealing with this question in the 1890's and how he later used this method in defending the idea of a philosophy that was integrally rational and Catholic in the strict sense of both terms. /// Na d\u00e9cada de 1930, Maurice Blondel desencadeou um importante debate acerca da quest\u00e3o da chamada Filosofia Crist\u00e3 mediante uma s\u00e9rie de artigos sobre Santo Agostinho, os quais insistiam em particular sobre a natureza filos\u00f3fica do pensamento do grande santo. Br\u00e9hier, um historiador da Filosofia de tend\u00eancia racionalista, objectou \u00e0 pr\u00f3pria ideia de uma Filosofia Crist\u00e3. Outros historiadores, tais como E. Gilson, concediam que uma Filosofia poderia ser vagamente caracterizada como Crist\u00e3 quando a mesma esteja associada com o pensamento crist\u00e3o, como era o caso na Idade M\u00e9dia. Mas Blondel argumentava contra estas duas posi\u00e7\u00f5es na medida em que achava que as mesmas pressuponham a separa\u00e7\u00e3o entre Filosofia e Religi\u00e3o, separa\u00e7\u00e3o esta que permitia apenas uma falsa hibridiza\u00e7\u00e3o entre as duas quando as mesmas eram justapostas. A sua posi\u00e7\u00e3o pessoal em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 Filosofia defendia que entre esta e a Religi\u00e3o existia uma intersec\u00e7do necess\u00e1ria acerca da quest\u00e3o relativa ao sentido ultimo da ac\u00e7do humana na medida em que esta remete para Deus na sua infinita transcend\u00eancia, tal como esta era desde h\u00e1 muito compreendida na tradi\u00e7\u00e3o Cat\u00f3lica, ou seja, enquanto que remetendo para algo sobrenatural no sentido mais estrito, algo destinado a aparecer como escandaloso e paradoxal \u00e0 raz\u00e3o enquanto que entregue a si mesma.

F. Losev's philosophy of music in the context of his entire religious worldview and as the part of his Christian-Neoplatonic philosophy. Synthesizing Pythagorean-Platonic and Romantic musical doctrines, Losev concludes: music is the expression of the life of numbers, a meonic-hyletic element that rages inside numeric constructions. So it is necessary to analyse the concept of number in the system of Neoplatonic thought. In the Neoplatonic hierarchy of the universe both numeric sphere and music are located at the source of all the eidei, above them and between the One (the first hypostasis) and the World Intelligence (the second hypostasis). Then music is considered in the context of the relation between the uncreated Absolute (Tetrade A) and the created world (Tetrade B). Losev's doctrine on the Tetrades A and B (connected not by essence but by energies) is the important modification of Neoplatonism. Finally the article considers Losev's account of music in relation to the absolutized individual person.\n      </p>", "This paper compares the statement 'Mathematics is the study of structure' with the actual practice of mathematics. We present two examples from contemporary mathematical practice where the notion of structure plays different roles. In the first case a structure is defined over a certain set. It is argued firstly that this set may not be regarded as a structure and secondly that what is important to mathematical practice is the relation that exists between the structure and the set. In the second case, from algebraic topology, one point is that an object can be a place in different structures. Which structure one chooses to place the object in depends on what one wishes to do with it. Overall the paper argues that mathematics certainly deals with structures, but that structures may not be all there is to mathematics.\n      </p>", "This article situates Josiah Royce's unpublished Pittsburgh Lectures on loyalty by presenting definitive evidence of the time and place of their occurrence.

Our only substantial information comes from Porphyry, who quotes a brief comment by a certain Didymus on his epistemological stance, and seeks to justify it through reflection on a rather startling technical doctrine which Archestratus propounded; and from Philodemus, who comments scathingly on his view of the relation between harmonic theory and philosophy. Neither passage is easy to interpret; this paper tries to make sense of them, and to set them in an intelligible relation to one another. It argues that the doctrine recorded by Porphyry becomes comprehensible when it is placed against the background of Aristoxenus' work in harmonics, and it discusses Porphyry's inferences about the way in which his epistemological position diveiged from that of Aristoxenus. It argues that Philodemus' report gives evidence of Archestratus' interest in issues of central concern to philosophy and in particular of an engagement with Aristotelian thought; it tries to identify some specific questions which attracted his attention, and to explain how he seems to have answered them, and why. It suggests that the two reports can be brought together as elements in a single, though fragmentary picture, and finally that Archestratus can be assigned an interesting though minor role in the history of Peripatetic philosophy and science.\n      </p>", "Strategic managers appear increasingly under pressure from stakeholder concerns regarding social and ethical issues. Partially in response, the supply of ethical decision-making models has grown rapidly. Business ethics scholars have broadened their scope to incorporate moral philosophies into their research endeavors. Despite these positive trends, the international focus of business ethics research has been slow to evolve. Yet, diverse moral philosophies, often most apparent across international borders, have important strategic implications for multinational firms. The ethical norms pursued by cross-cultural alliance partners, distributors, suppliers, customers, financiers, and foreign government agencies can create public relations disasters, foster shareholder unrest, lead to consumer boycotts, and impact organizational outcomes. We seek to rectify the deficiency in international business ethics scholarship with two distinct contributions. First, we develop a new cross-cultural, macro-level model of societal ethics. Second, we map moral philosophies onto an established framework for assessing socioeconomic environments. These theoretical tools should assist managers of multinational organizations, international policy-makers, and researchers to recognize and prepare for the ethical consequences of international strategic decisions.\n      </p>", "Frank Welz's \"Kritik der Lebenswelt\" undertakes a sociology of knowledge criticism of the work of Edmund Husserl and Alfred Schutz that construes them as developing absolutist, egological systems opposed to the \"processual\" worldview prominent since the modern rise of natural science.

Finally, Welz's charge that Schutz favors a Neo-Kantian social scientific methodology contradictory to his phenomenology neglects the levels of Schutz's discourse and ignores how the Weberian ideal-typical approach can be subsumed within phenomenology.\n      </p>", "This paper reflects on the postmodern challenge to human geography.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the presentation of the Thomson, Rutherford, and Bohr models of the atom in general physics textbooks based on criteria derived from history and philosophy of science. Forty-one general physics textbooks (all published in the United States) were evaluated on two criteria based on Thomson's work, three on Rutherford's work, and three on Bohr's work. Results obtained show that general physics textbooks do not systematically include a history and philosophy of science perspective. Most textbooks present an inductivist perspective in which experimental details are considered to be paramount. On the contrary, a historical reconstruction of the experimental details inevitably includes: the context in which an experiment is conducted, the theoretical framework that guides the scientist, and alternative interpretations of data that lead to conflicts and controversies. Examples are provided to show how historical reconstructions of atomic models can provide students an opportunity to appreciate how scientists work and science progresses. It is plausible to suggest that textbook presentations based on a history and philosophy of science perspective can perhaps arouse students' interest in the subject and hence lead to greater conceptual understanding.\n      </p>", "This paper gives a survey of the philosophy of science in Finland during the two decades 1970-90.

From Yijing (Book of Changes), Lunyu (Analects), Laozi and Zhuangzi to Wang Bi, \"yi\" which cannot be expressed fully by yan (language), is not only \"idea\" or \"meaning\" in the human mind, but is also some kind of ontological existence, which is beyond yan and emblematic symbols, and unspeakable. Thus, the debate on the yan-yi relation refers firstly to metaphysics, secondly to moral philosophy, and then to epistemology and philosophy of language. Guided by this view, this paper recalls the source of the debate on the yan-yi relation to Yijing and Lunyu, distinguishes four meanings of \"yi\" in Chinese philosophy, and reconstructs three arguments. These arguments are the \"yan cannot express yi fully\" argument, \"forget yan once you get yi\" argument, and \"yan can express yi fully\" argument.
