{"total_words": 94, "documents": ["This paper discusses the concepts of neoclassical, mainstream, orthodox, and heterodox economics, distinguishing temporally more general and more specific concepts. The concept of mainstream economics is based on prestige and influence and includes ideas taught in prestigious schools. Although the current mainstream (neoclassical economics included) is clearly diverse, commonality in it is more controversial. Heterodox economics can be defined negatively, in opposition either to the orthodoxy or to the mainstream. The lack of consensus generates communication problems. Another possibility would be to define heterodox economics positively, but the result in the current period may be an empty set.\n      </p>", "Dostoevskij's underground parody of confession paradoxically recovers an Orthodox morality by constructing an unorthodox model of authority and authorship. The authenticity and authority of underground discourse are both contingent on self-conscious parody, which also mediates Orthodox community or sobornost'. This essay critically reconsiders ethical, aesthetic and cultural dimensions of the self-conscious interpolation of literary and religious discourses in Dostoevskij's Notes from Underground. Arguing with and against Bakhtinian readings, it re-examines the underground narrator's secularized, Romanticized sensibilities, cynical critique of humanism, sacrilegious modes of laughter, usurpation of authority, internalization of dialogue, literary stylization and parody, aesthetic and moral self-critique, and, finally, insistence on \"a new word.\"\n      </p>", "Despite ultra-Orthodoxy being the fastest growing component of the British Jewish community (and Jewry worldwide), it has received little academic coverage by geographers. This paper provides an in-depth examination of a community of ultra-Orthodox Jews in Broughton Park, Manchester. It maps out the residential concentration of these Jews and, using in-depth qualitative interviews, discusses the construction of socio-spatial boundaries that are used to define and mark out 'them' from 'us'. Through this the paper contributes to wider geographic discussions about identity, segregation and religion. It shows how the power of religion to define people's beliefs and everyday practices remains, for certain groups, extremely strong.\n      </p>", "The Oromo, the largest single national group in Ethiopia, follow Islam and Christianity since the middle of the 19th Century particularly after the conquest of the Ethiopian State, which triggered, directly or indirectly, a massive conversion. This article highlights, the relationship between the Orthodox Church and Islam vis-\u00e0-vis the nascent but rapidly developing Oromo nationalism. Based on the analysis of Oromo ethnography, history, the system of thought and their contemporary political movements, the paper argues that Oromo nationalism is the antithesis of the Ethiopian state/official nationalism supported by the Orthodox Church. It also demonstrates that Islam is not a driving ideological force of Oromo's political struggle. On one the hand, it is in contradiction with many aspects of the pre-existing culture such as Gadaa-Qaaluu and other values from which the nationalists try to take inspiration to build their future. On the other hand, from the strategic perspective, the adoption of Islam or Christianity as an ideological tool of their nationalism would be a factor of more division and fragmentation. Thus Oromo mainstream nationalism is evolving on a secular political trajectory. /// Les Oromos, qui constituent le groupe ethnique le plus important d'\u00c9thiopie, embrass\u00e8rent l'islam et le christianisme \u00e0 partir du milieu du XIXe si\u00e8cle, notamment apr\u00e8s la conqu\u00eate men\u00e9e par l'\u00c9tat \u00e9thiopien, cette derni\u00e8re favorisant directement ou indirectement la conversion massive de la population. Cet article met en lumi\u00e8re les rapports existant entre l'\u00c9glise orthodoxe et l'islam d'une part et le d\u00e9veloppement du nationalisme oromo d'autre part. Fond\u00e9 sur l'analyse de l'ethnographie, de l'histoire, du syst\u00e8me de pens\u00e9e et des mouvements politiques contemporains, cet article tente de montrer que le nationalisme oromo est l'antith\u00e8se de l'\u00c8tat \u00e9thiopien et du nationalisme officiel soutenus tous deux par l'\u00c9glise orthodoxe. Il montre \u00e9galement que l'islam n'est pas une composante essentielle de la lutte politique du peuple oromo. En effet, il entre en contradiction avec nombre d'aspects de la culture pr\u00e9existante tels que le syst\u00e8me gadaa-qaaluu ainsi que d'autres valeurs dont les nationalistes s'inspirent pour construire l'avenir. Par ailleurs, d'un point de vue strat\u00e9gique, l'adoption de l'islam ou du christianisme en tant qu'outil id\u00e9ologique du nationalisme serait un facteur suppl\u00e9mentaire de division et de fragmentation. C'est pourquoi le nationalisme oromo \u00e9volue principalement sur une trajectoire politique essentiellement la\u00efque.\n      </p>", "We attempt to clarify divisions made by us in previous work (Colander et al., 2004a; 2004b) between \"orthodox, mainstream, and heterodox\" in economics, following useful remarks in Dequech (2007\u20138), whom we thank.

In particular because of the Reform sanction of patrilineal descent as a basis for Jewish identity, the early 1980s was a period of acute tensions. Various Orthodox parties gave the impression that they were on the verge of completely cutting themselves off from their Reform contemporaries. This article demonstrates that, in the subsequent decades, hostilities have diminished and a new style of Orthodox interaction with Reform has begun to emerge. This dynamic, though by no means leading to harmony between the religious streams, was far removed from prior predictions of \u201cseparation-cum-divorce\u201d of these two movements. The article analyzes a range of examples that manifest this transition and offer insight that helps to account for the ensuing changes.\n      </p>", "This paper analyzes the link between the changing geographical scale of dominant ideologies in Russian society and the architectural scales of different versions of the preeminent national monument, the Cathedral of Christ the Savior. The history of this process of national monumentalization in Russia is profiled by focusing on mutual influences between processes at these two scales, and the interplay between the state, society, and the Russian Orthodox Church. Within the context of the new Cathedral, ongoing but nevertheless understimated pre-Soviet and post-Soviet antireligious practices are revealed through an analysis of the politics of scale that shaped the monument's meanings at different historical periods. Thus, the paper also attempts to contribute to the understanding of the importance of scale in politicogeographical studies.\n      </p>"], "words": {"and": {"number": 4, "prob": 3.312505952159133e-05}, "economics,": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "work": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "savior": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "ith": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "scales": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "mainstream,": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "centuries,": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "general": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "past": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "middle": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "single": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "paper": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "in": {"number": 3, "prob": 2.4843794641193497e-05}, "monument,": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "follow": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "islam": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "different": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "scale": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "group": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "christ": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "discusses": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "since": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "two": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "ideologies": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "christianity": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "to": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "distinguishing": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "geographical": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "largest": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "previous": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "national": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "more": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "we": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "over": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "dominant": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "orthodox": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "judaism": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "between": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "ethiopia,": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "analyzes": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "oromo,": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "clarify": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "link": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "architectural": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "despite": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "russian": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "changing": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "by": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "divisions": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "made": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "attempt": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "society": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "this": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "of": {"number": 6, "prob": 4.968758928238699e-05}, "versions": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "temporally": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "us": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "specific": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "neoclassical,": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "concepts": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "the": {"number": 12, "prob": 9.937517856477399e-05}, "ultra": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}}}
