{"total_words": 632, "documents": ["Objective: To examine the actual and anticipated costs of a law regulating workplace smoking and smoking in restaurants, taking into consideration observed and anticipated infrastructure costs, lost productivity, increased absenteeism, and loss of clientele. Setting and design: A survey of 401 Qu\u00e9bec restaurants and 600 Qu\u00e9bec firms conducted by the Qu\u00e9bec Ministry of Health before the enactment of the law was used to derive costs incurred by those who had already complied and anticipated by those that did not. Results: Direct and indirect costs associated with tobacco regulation at work and in restaurants were minimal. Annualised infrastructure costs amounted to less than 0.0002% of firm revenues and 0.15% of restaurant revenues. Anticipated costs were larger and amounted to 0.0004% of firm revenues and 0.41% of restaurant revenues. Impacts on productivity, absenteeism, and restaurant patronage were widely anticipated but not observed in currently compliant establishments. Conclusion: Firms and restaurants expected high costs to result from strict tobacco regulation because of infrastructure costs, decreased productivity, and decreased patronage. That none of these were actually observed suggests that policy makers should discount industry claims that smoking regulations impose undue economic hardship.\n      </p>", "The article shows that, contrary to a commonly accepted assumption, no public consumption facilities such as restaurants, taverns or inns existed in medieval Cairo. This was caused on the one hand by the Egyptians' faithfulness to their own ancient practices and their indifference to pre-Islamic influences of foreign origin, and on the other by the Cairenes' compliance with the ordinances of the legal sources of Islam. These two factors led to the results described in the article because they complemented each other, as Islam was rooted in the same ancient social and cultural tradition as Egypt. /// Dans cet article on a avanc\u00e9 une th\u00e8se que - malgr\u00e9 une opinion bien etendue - les \u00e9tablissements alimentaires, tels que les restaurants, les tavernes et les auberges, n'existaient pas au Caire m\u00e9di\u00e9val. Les causes de cette situation on peut expliquer, d'une part, par l'attachement des \u00c9gyptiens \u00e0 leur cultures indig\u00e8nes et leur indiff\u00e9rence aux traditions culturelles \u00e9trang\u00e8res, alimentaires inclues, provenant d'une \u00e9poque preislamique; d'autre part, par le fait que le comportement des Cairots \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s strictement li\u00e9 aux ordonnances de la religion islamique, enracin\u00e9es dans la m\u00eame tradition sociale et religieuse que les traditions \u00e9gyptiennes. Or, on peut conclure que les \u00e9v\u00e8nements d\u00e9crits dans cet article pouvaient avoir lieu puisque la tradition musulmane concernante les questions present\u00e9es ici \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s strictement li\u00e9e \u00e0 la culture indig\u00e8ne.\n      </p>", "A 25-year observation of Turkish restaurants in the heart of the Turkish neighbourhood of Brussels shows considerable changes in the characteristics of the restaurants and in their location. Both dimensions of change are interrelated and are explained on the one hand by strategies of ethnic minority entrepreneurship and on the other by the Hotelling effect.\n      </p>", "Objective - To assess effectiveness of a 1984 state law requiring restaurants to seat smokers and non-smokers in separate areas. Design - Physical inspections of restaurants with face to face interviews of restaurant managers. Setting - College town in Wisconsin, USA. Subjects - 18 restaurants with more than 50 seats, chosen randomly from all 47 restaurants in the city. Main outcome measures - Managers' knowledge of the Clean Indoor Air Act, presence of required signs, and proportion of seats for non-smoking patrons. Each restaurant was categorised as having alcohol or not, chain or local, and fast food or table service. Results - All restaurants permitted smoking. One third were unfamiliar with the law, and three fourths lacked the required signs. Restaurants allocated an average of 53% of their seats for smoking. Fast food restaurants appeared to be more likely to know the law and to have legal signs. Restaurants without alcoholic beverages, chain restaurants, and fast food restaurants tended to be more likely to have large non-smoking areas. Conclusions - There is a gap between legislated prescription and actual practice. Laws that permit each restaurant to determine the size of its non-smoking area and have no provision for adequate monitoring of compliance may be ineffective. The findings of this and other similar surveys suggest that proponents of legislative strategies to reduce smoking in restaurants need to give more attention to policy implementation and evaluation.\n      </p>", "This article examines intercultural contact in Quebec City's ethnic restaurants. The results of this multisited inquiry show that ethnic restaurants have developed rapidly, representing microspaces of intercultural encounter and exchange, places where people can see, touch, and consume the cuisine of the \"other.\" More specifically, this article explores the ways in which eating reduces difference and distance; how it evokes cultural and geographical appropriation. Ethnic restaurants represent deterritorialized \"ethnosites\" in which the foreign is made familiar and the global miniaturized. They provide the opportunity to \"taste\" difference and to \"eat\" exotic cultures from faraway places without leaving home. In the same way that the bourgeois restaurant of the 19th century was a site for the consumption of the nation, through the presentation of regional cuisine, the ethnic restaurant has become in postcolonial societies a place for the consumption of the world.\n      </p>", "Several issues, ranging from sustainability to health, may interest the consumers in the corn content of their food. However, because restaurants are excluded from the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990, national chain restaurants provide nonspecific ingredient information and small businesses supply none. We measured the carbon isotope composition of fry oil in French fries purchased from 68 (67%) of the 101 national chain fast food restaurants on Oahu (i.e., McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, Arby's, and Jack in the Box), and paired this with a similar number of small businesses (n = 66) to calculate minimum percent contribution of corn to total fry oil. We found that the majority (69%) of the national chain restaurants served fries containing corn oil, whereas this was true for only a minority (20%) of the small businesses. Corn oil is more expensive than soybean oil (for example) when purchased from a small business supplier, suggesting that large-scale corporate agreements are necessary to make corn oil frying cost-effective. When considering French fry oil along with cornrfed beef and chicken, as well as high-fructose corn syrupsweetened soda, we see the pervasive influence of corn as an ingredient in national chain fast food.\n      </p>", "Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a food manager training and certification program in increasing compliance with restaurant sanitary codes. Methods: Using routine sanitary inspection records, the authors compared pre- and post-training inspection scores for 94 restaurants falling into three groups: a \"mandatory\" group (managers' attendance was mandated for these restaurants); a \"voluntary\" group (managers attended the training voluntarily); and a control group (no staff attended the training program). Results: Restaurants for which managers were mandated to attend a training and certification program demonstrated a significant improvement in inspection scores, an improvement that was sustained over a two-year follow-up period. The mean inspection scores for a control group did not change significantly over time. However, improvements were not noted in all areas of food safety. Conclusions: Food manager training and certification programs may be an effective way to improve the sanitary conditions of restaurants and reduce the spread of foodborne illnesses.\n      </p>", "In the last 20 years, the growth of Chinese immigration in Italy has increased, being characterized by multiple migration strategies linked to transnational economic activities. This has been particularly the case with the Chinese immigrant community in Rome, where many of these immigrants are involved in the restaurant or import-export business. In this context, the Chinese immigrant presence in the restaurant sector will be analysed in detail within a multimethod approach developed to explore the number, location and characteristics of all Chinese restaurants that were opened and closed since the 1970s. This exercise in economic geography is linked to other questions such as power and cultural relations, urban planning practices and the discourses of racism. The development and the geography of the Chinese restaurants allow us to understand not only how far or close they are to the mainstream Italian restaurant sector, but also the spatial trajectories of Roman Chinese in general within the urban landscape. As Chinese restaurants outside China have become a symbol of transnational Chinese identity, it is worth considering the real spatial practices attached to the construction and negotiation of this transnationality.\n      </p>", "Une \u00e9tude a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9e en vue d'am\u00e9liorer l'acc\u00e8s des handicap\u00e9s aux 19 restraurants universitaires de Valence en Espagne, puisque le taux des \u00e9tudiants handicap\u00e9s, ces trois derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es universitaires, est de Vordre de 0,12 \u00e0 0,13%.

A study was carried out to improve accessibility of the disabled at the nineteen University restaurants in Valencia (Spain) due to that the incidence of the disabled during three studied academic years is ranged from 0.12 to 0.13% of all studied University student. At the beginning of this study, sixteen of these establishments had good accessibility with a percentage of 87.5, 25 and 6.3 of ramps, elevators and handraih, respectively. Furthermore, all access doors of these establishments are equipped with lever handles or are designed in a way that makes tight grasping and twisting of the wrist to open them unnecessary. On the one hand the architectural design of the other establishments did not take into account the access of the disabled. Subsequent to the preliminary study, the other restaurants installed platform lifts to make access possible. The improvement in accessibility through ramps, elevators, handra\u00fcs and platform lifts has made it possible to eliminate discriminatory infrastructure barriers in restaurants and has helped to ensure safe access for the disabled. On the other hand, interviews were carried out to know their opinions and one hundred percentage think that the accessibility at University restaurants is better that to the beginning of this study.\n      </p>", "This essay explores the psychological calculations behind our judgments that a restaurant meal was either \u201cworth it\u201d or \u201cnot worth it.\u201d It inquires into the way we try to place a cash value on essential ephemeral sensations and experiences, such as those supplied by fancy restaurants. More abstractly, this essay asks why we tend to rely on such abstract standards of judgment, and deploy the language of \u201cworth\u201d for sensations that lie outside the bounds of economic calculation. Without becoming critical of our use of such language, it asks why we continue to use modes of expression that cannot help but fail to capture the full dimensions of our gastronomic experiences.\n      </p>", "We investigate how changes in the supply of fast food restaurants affect weight outcomes of 3 million children and 3 million pregnant women. Among ninth graders, a fast food restaurant within 0.1 miles of a school results in a 5.2 percent increase in obesity rates. Among pregnant women, a fast-food restaurant within 0.5 miles of residence results in a 1.6 percent increase in the probability of gaining over 20 kilos. The implied effects on caloric intake are one order of magnitude larger for children than for mothers, consistent with smaller travel cost for adults. Non-fast food restaurants and future fast-food restaurants are uncorrelated with weight outcomes.\n      </p>", "While many researchers and policymakers infer from correlations between eating out and body weight that restaurants are a leading cause of obesity, a basic identification problem challenges these conclusions. We exploit the placement of Interstate Highways in rural areas to obtain exogenous variation in the effective price of restaurants and examine the impact on body mass. We find no causal link between restaurant consumption and obesity. Analysis of food-intake micro-data suggests that consumers offset calories from restaurant meals by eating less at other times. We conclude that regulation targeting restaurants is unlikely to reduce obesity but could decrease consumer welfare.\n      </p>", "Foodborne disease is a common, but preventable, burden of illness worldwide. Almost one-half of every dollar spent on food in the United States is spent on food from restaurants. A growing body of data from foodborne disease outbreaks and studies of sporadic (non-outbreak-associated) gastrointestinal disease of various etiologies suggest that eating food prepared in restaurants is an important source of infection. These data suggest a critical need for action that is focused on preventing disease transmission within the food service industry. Clinicians should report all suspected foodborne disease to public health authorities to ensure appropriate epidemiologic investigation.\n      </p>", "The high-end restaurant segment in Britain and Germany has long been shaped by the cultural hegemony of French haute cuisine, perpetuated by multiple processes, including the influence of the Michelin or Red Guide. Traditionally, this hegemony has been expressed in the prevalence of French expatriate chefs, culinary techniques and style and even restaurant culture. This paper investigates whether processes of globalization have weakened or even undermined this French cultural dominance in fine-dining restaurants and their culinary culture. To this end, the study identifies the various forms taken by globalization processes in this industry segment and then assesses their impact on the dominance of the French paradigm of culinary culture. The investigation focuses on British and German Michelinstarred restaurants, underlining both commonalities and divergences in the process of interaction between French, global and local influences. The study employs a qualitative method, using a number of case studies to discern crossindustry patterns. All chefs with two or three stars in the two countries, i.e. 45 chefs, were selected for the analysis of their cuisine.\n      </p>", "Objectives: To assess internal dose and oxidative stress in male restaurant workers exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from cooking oil fumes (COFs) in Chinese restaurants. Methods: The study participants included 288 male restaurant workers (171 kitchen and 117 service staff) in Chinese restaurants in Taiwan. Airborne particulate PAHs were measured over 12 h on each of two consecutive work days and then identified using high performance liquid chromatography. Urinary 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP) measurements were used to indicate COF exposure, and urinary malondialdehyde (MDA) was adopted as an oxidative stress marker. Multiple regression models were used to assess the relationship between MDA and 1-OHP levels after adjusting for key personal covariates. Results: Summed particulate PAH levels in kitchens (median 23.9 ng/m\u00b3) were significantly higher than those in dining areas (median 4.9 ng/m\u00b3). For non-smoking kitchen staff, mean MDA and 1-OHP levels were 344.2 (SD 243.7) and 6.0 (SD 8.0) \u03bcmol/mol creatinine, respectively. These levels were significantly higher than those for non-smoking service staff, which were 244.2 (SD 164.4) and 2.4 (SD 4.3) \u03bcmol/mol creatinine, respectively. Urinary 1-OHP levels were significantly associated with work in kitchens (p&lt;0.05). Furthermore, urinary MDA levels were significantly associated with urinary 1-OHP levels (p&lt;0.001) and working hours per day (p&lt;0.05). Conclusions: These findings indicate that urinary 1-OHP and MDA levels reflect occupational exposure to PAHs from COFs and oxidative stress in workers in Chinese restaurants.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

In Singapore's Little India, food has been commercialized as a public good of consumption, integral of a broadly defined ethnic Indian identity and representation. Over the years, within the spatial setting of Little India, the ethnic Indian cuisine has been adapted for rapid change in new environments. These include the impacts of the government's policy to use it to promote multiculturalism, the Urban Redevelopment Authority's earmarking of Little India as a conservation area in 1989, and the Singapore Tourism Board's campaign to attract international tourists. For restaurant operators, it is the pragmatic business adaptation and cuisine hybridization that is most essential for survival. Consequently, the outcome of this process of accommodating change has produced a new breed of cityscape in a systematically identified zone of the increasingly cosmopolitan Singapore.\n      </p>", "Aim: To examine how household expenditure on food at restaurants, alcohol, gambling and insurance vary between smoking and non-smoking households. Design: Cross sectional survey of households from private dwellings, conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), using a stratified multistage area sample design. Setting: Australia, 1998-99. Participants: Nationally representative sample of households (n = 6892). Main outcome measures: Expenditure on meals at restaurants, alcohol, alcoholic beverages at licensed premises, gambling, and insurance. Results: The odds of reporting expenditure on restaurant food and health insurance were 20% and 40% smaller for smoking than non-smoking households, respectively. The odds of reporting expenditure on alcohol (not including expenditure at licensed premises), drinking at licensed premises, and gambling were 100%, 50%, and 40% greater for smoking than for non-smoking households, respectively. Conclusions: The study suggests that smokers are more likely to engage in risky behaviour. Implementing smoking bans in licensed premises and gambling venues can provide an opportunity to reduce smoking prevalence. Quitting or cutting down smoking can provide opportunities for expenditure on other products or services, and enhance standards of living.\n      </p>", "One of the latest technologies to garner attention from the food world is the Web site Kickstarter, and it has already affected the restaurant industry in a number of ways. The Web site is a crowd-funding platform for \u201ccreative projects\u201d in multiple disciplines\u2013several restaurant owners have already used Kickstarter to raise capital toward opening and sustaining restaurants.\n         The Kickstarter team's definition for a \u201ccreative project\u201d is vague at best, and patterns have already emerged that raise questions about whether restaurants are an appropriate type of project to harness this platform. So far, three patterns have taken shape: the neighborhood restaurant, the philanthropic restaurant, and the experimental spot, as evidenced by Colonie in Brooklyn, Mission Chinese Food and Commonwealth in San Francisco, and What Happens When in New York, respectively.\n         While restaurants use many creative elements, they also are businesses at the core. Thus, the best restaurant-oriented candidates for Kickstarter are those who aim to go beyond the conventional expectations of what a restaurant should provide. Ideally they will use Kickstarter's crowd-sourced funds to bring more to the community than what the charge for on the plate.\n      </p>", "We assemble a panel of 2,500 restaurants in Italy over the period 1998-2004 to study whether, and through which channels, the introduction of euro coins and banknotes had an impact on individual pricing behaviour. We reach three conclusions. Firstly, while the evidence rejects the hypothesis that the changeover led to a \"doubling of prices\" in this industry, the event may have focussed public attention on the cumulative price increases which took place before the changeover, reflecting costs and demand. Secondly, the rise in the average meal price was due more to a larger proportion of restaurants revising their prices than to large individual revisions. Lastly, more local market power (as proxied by a concentration index) was associated with a larger price increase; an interpretation of the latter finding is proposed which also explains why the effects of the cash changeover were stronger in less competitive industries.\n      </p>", "Objective: In February 2009, Guatemala implemented a comprehensive smoking ban. We assessed air nicotine levels in bars and restaurants 6 months after the ban (post-ban) and compared them with levels found in 2006 (pre-ban). Methods: Exposure was estimated by passive sampling of vapor-phase nicotine using samplers (n = 50) placed for 7 working days in 10 bars and 11 restaurants in Guatemala City. Air nicotine was measured by gas chromatography, and the time-weighted average concentration in \u03bcg/m\u00b3 was estimated. Employees answered a survey about smoke-free workplaces (n = 32) and compared with pre-ban (n = 37) results. Results: Nicotine was detectable in all bars pre-and post-ban. In restaurants, it was detectable in all pre-and 73% post-ban. Median nicotine concentrations in bars significantly decreased from 4.58 \u03bcg/m\u00b3 (IQR, 1.71, 6.45) pre-ban to 0.28 \u03bcg/m\u00b3 (IQR 0.17, 0.66) post-ban (87% decrease). In restaurants, concentrations significantly decreased from 0.58 \u03bcg/m\u00b3 (IQR, 0.44, 0.71) to 0.04 \u03bcg/m\u00b3 (IQR 0.01, 0.11) (95% decrease). Employees' support for a smoke-free workplace increased in the post-ban survey (from 32 to 81%, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Six months after the implementation of a smoke-free law in Guatemala, nicotine levels were significantly decreased in bars and restaurants and workers' support for the law substantially increased.\n      </p>", "Objective: To examine the relation between strength of local restaurant smoking regulations and smoking related social norms among youths and adults. Design: We used generalised estimating equations logistic regression analysis to examine the relation between regulation strength and youths' and adults' perceptions of adult smoking prevalence and the social acceptability of smoking in their town, while controlling for baseline anti-smoking sentiment in the town. Setting: Each of the 351 Massachusetts towns were classified as having strong (complete smoking ban), medium (restriction of smoking to enclosed, separately ventilated areas), or weak (all others) restaurant smoking regulations. Subjects: 1147 Massachusetts youths ages 12-17 years and 2116 adults who reported that they often or always eat out in their own town, drawn from a random digit dial survey. Main outcome measures: Perceived adult smoking prevalence and perceived social acceptability of smoking in restaurants, in bars, or in general. Results: Compared to youths from towns with weak regulations, youths from towns with strong regulations were more likely to perceive lower adult smoking prevalence (odds ratio (OR) 1.71; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 2.84) and social unacceptability of adult smoking (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.29 to 3.08) in their town. Adults from towns with strong regulations were not more likely to perceive lower adult smoking prevalence, but had more than twice the odds of perceiving that smoking was unacceptable in restaurants (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.58 to 3.02) or bars (OR 2.51, 95% CI 1.90 to 3.31). Conclusions: Strong local restaurant smoking regulations are associated with favourable smoking related social norms among youths and adults.\n      </p>", "The food service sector continues to be the most common setting for reported foodborne disease outbreaks in England and Wales. Using restaurant-associated foodborne outbreaks reported in England and Wales from 1992 to 2009, cuisine-specific risk factors were examined. Of 677 restaurant outbreaks, there were 11 795 people affected, 491 hospitalizations, and seven deaths; and Chinese, Indian, British and Italian cuisines were the most commonly implicated (26%, 16%, 13% and 10%, respectively). Salmonella spp. accounted for most outbreaks of all cuisine types, and particularly Chinese (76%, 133/175) and Italian (55%, 38/69). Poultry meat was the most frequently implicated food vehicle in outbreaks associated with Indian (30%), Chinese (21%), and British (18%) cuisines while for Italian cuisine, desserts and cakes were more frequently implicated (33%). Rice dishes were also a common outbreak food vehicle in those restaurants serving Chinese (22%) and Indian (16%) cuisine. Cross-contamination was the biggest contributory factor associated with Chinese (46%), British (33%) and Indian (30%) cuisines whereas inadequate cooking (38%) and use of raw shell eggs in lightly cooked or uncooked food (35%) were more often associated with Italian cuisine. Over the surveillance period, the proportion of Salmonella Enteritidis PT4 outbreaks in restaurants serving Chinese cuisine significantly decreased (P&lt; 0\u00b70001) and this was mirrored by an increase in S. Enteritidis non-PT4 outbreaks (P &lt; 0\u00b70001). Despite this change in proportion, contributory factors such as cross-contamination have continued to cause outbreaks throughout the 18 years. The results show that by stratifying the risks associated with restaurants by cuisine type, specific evidence of food control failures can be used to target foodborne illness reduction strategies.\n      </p>", "This paper explores some of the unique characteristics that define globalization and global cities through an investigation of recent design trends in New York City restaurants, specifically gentrification, new users of global cities, casualization, and the processes of contestation and absorption of the dominant as well as nondominant cultures and classes in the city as they are played out in the physical, social, and economic morphology of the city over the past fifteen years. I will argue that these features define place in very specific and complex ways. Although locally oriented, restaurants reflect deeper and broader social and economic global forces that help to create the meaning of that space. The importation and exportation of specific restaurants to other existing and emerging global cities is already in progress. As such, restaurants offer a basis for analyzing emerging cities -- those that, although not global, have an important relationship to global cities. The findings offered here are part of a larger five-year study of restaurants and come from personal interviews, questionnaires, onsite observations, and sources internal to the restaurant industry as well as other relevant sources.\n      </p>", "Survey techniques are combined with behavioral observations in this attempt to replicate a 1950 baseline study in order to examine trends in racial discrimination. In the 1950 study, treatment of black and white couples was compared in a sample of 62 restaurants drawn from a population of all restaurants in a large area of East Side Manhattan. In 1981 we carried out similar comparisons in a sample of 20 restaurants (plus four replications) drawn from the same area, following as closely as possible the procedures used in the baseline study.

Respondents labeled sexual advances as sexual harassment only in four specific contexts: (1) when perpetrated by someone who exploited their powerful position for personal sexual gain; (2) when the perpetrator was of a different race/ethnicity than the victim-typically a minority man harassing a white woman; (3) when the perpetrator was of a different sexual orientation than the victim-typically a gay man harassing a straight man; or (4) when violence or the threat of violence was used.

This is opposed by certain sections of the catering industry. Objective: To assess public opinion on smoke-free restaurants and to estimate changes in patronage. Design: A population based, cross sectional random digit dialling telephone survey conducted from November 1999 to January 2000. Setting and participants: 1077 randomly selected subjects age 15 years or over (response fraction of 81.6%). Results: 68.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.2% to 71.7%) supported a totally smoke-free policy in restaurants. Experiences of discomfort or symptoms from second hand smoke in restaurants were common. The majority (77.2%, 95% CI 74.7% to 79.7%) anticipated no change in their frequency of use of restaurants after a smoke-free policy. Increased use was predicted by 19.7% (95% CI 17.3% to 22.1%) of respondents, whereas 3.2% (95% CI 2.2% to 4.4%) stated that they would dine out less often. In multivariate analyses, non-smokers (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 4.9), people who ate three times or less per week in restaurants as compared to those who ate &amp;gt; 10 times per week (OR 2.1), those who had previous experience of discomfort from exposure to passive smoking in restaurants (OR 2.8), or who had avoided restaurants in the past because of smoking (OR 1.9), were more likely to support a totally smoke-free policy in restaurants. Smoke-free policies do not appear to have an adverse effect on restaurants, and may increase business by a considerable margin. Conclusion: This comprehensive survey--the first in Asia--shows strong community support for smoke-free dining and predicts an overall increase in the patronage of restaurants after the introduction of legislation for totally smoke-free restaurants.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

We examine how in this context employers seek and evaluate information on potential job candidates (extensive search) and the hiring criteria they use to select new employees (intensive search). We find that employers in the restaurant sector are often passive or reactive about recruitment, distrust standard sources of information, and reject the use of educational credentials and work experience as hiring criteria. They do, however, find ways to signal workplace information to potential job candidates, develop schemes to gather reliable information, and closely evaluate job history data when hiring. Some develop signaling strategies to alert potential employees that their stores are sufficiently different from apparently similar stores to make them unusually attractive places to work. To help secure a sufficiently motivated work force, managers eschew standard measures of potential productive capacity or skills and adopt instead indicators of a modicum of employee motivation.

Design: Population based annual site inspection survey of a random sample of Los Angeles County freestanding bars and bar/restaurants was conducted from 1998 to 2002. Main outcome measures: The primary outcomes of interest were patron and employee smoking. The secondary outcomes of interest were the presence of ashtrays and designated outdoor smoking areas. Results: Significant increases in patron non-smoking compliance were found for freestanding bars (45.7% to 75.8%, p &amp;lt; 0.0001) and bar/restaurants (92.2% to 98.5%, p &amp;lt; 0.0001) between 1998 and 2002.

Conclusions: This study provides clear evidence that the California Smoke-Free Workplace Law has been effective at reducing patron and employee smoking in Los Angeles County bars and restaurants. Recommendations include educational campaigns targeted to freestanding bar owners and staff to counter perceptions of lost revenue, more rigorous enforcement, and more severe penalties for repeat violators such as alcohol licence revocation.

Prior to that he was on the board of directors for General Mills, where he served as vice chairman. Joe began his career in the restaurant industry in 1967 as a team member in the original Red Lobster working for his mentor, the namesake of Darden Restaurants and the founder of the Red Lobster concept, Bill Darden. Red Lobster was acquired by General Mills in 1970, and Joe became president of Red Lobster in 1975. He served as president of the National Restaurant Association and has received numerous awards including the food industry's highest award, the Golden Plate, in 1995. Darden is the largest casual-dining restaurant company in the world, serving over 300 million meals annually in 1,200 company-owned restaurants across the United States and Canada. Since it separated from General Mills, Darden has grown under Joe's leadership approximately 7% annually. Total sales for Darden's fiscal 2001 exceeded $4 billion in the over $45 billion casual-dining sector of the restaurant industry. Both Darden and this sector are growing at a 6-8% annual rate. Darden, based in Orlando, Florida, employs more than 128,000 people. Its restaurant brands include Red Lobster, Olive Garden, Bahama Breeze, and Smokey Bones BBQ Sports Bar. It has been on Fortune's list of America's Best Companies for Minorities for three consecutive years. Because Darden purchases over 100 million pounds of seafood annually, it has a unique interest in wild-caught and sustainable aquaculture resources. Several years ago the Darden Environmental Trust was established to help countries throughout the world better manage their wild-caught and sustainable natural resources.\n      </p>", "In a previous risk factor study in Jakarta we identified purchasing street food as an independent risk factor for paratyphoid. Eating from restaurants, however, was not associated with disease. To explain these findings we compared 128 street food-vendors with 74 food handlers from restaurants in a cross-sectional study in the same study area. Poor hand-washing hygiene and direct hand contact with foods, male sex and low educational level were independent characteristics of street vendors in a logistic regression analysis. Faecal contamination of drinking water (in 65% of samples), dishwater (in 91%) and ice cubes (in 100%) was frequent. Directly transmittable pathogens including S. typhi (n=1) and non-typhoidal Salmonella spp. (n=6) were isolated in faecal samples in 13 (7%) vendors; the groups did not differ, however, in contamination rates of drinking water and Salmonella isolation rates in stools. Poor hygiene of street vendors compared to restaurant vendors, in combination with faecal carriage of enteric pathogens including S. typhi, may help explain the association found between purchasing street food and foodborne illness, in particular Salmonella infections. Public health interventions to reduce transmission of foodborne illness should focus on general hygienic measures in street food trade, i.e. hand washing with soap, adequate food-handling hygiene, and frequent renewal of dishwater.\n      </p>", "This paper describes how a major fast food restaurant system uses simulation to dramatically improve efficiency, productivity, and sales in its more than 3,000 restaurants worldwide. With a capacity to project and solve business problems, Burger King Corporation has been able to upgrade and streamline restaurant operations, contributing significantly to the continued growth of what is now the second largest restaurant system in the world. Among the substantial changes in the last five years, the introduction of drive-thru service and new menu items has transformed a once simple operation into a sophisticated production process. Consequently, management turned increasingly to Operations Research for answers to operational questions ranging from the most efficient restaurant design to the optimum number of employees needed to serve customers as sales vary. The impact of simulation models has produced millions of dollars in savings, or profits, in a number of operational, design, and procurement areas.\n      </p>", "Objective: To examine the effect of smoking regulations in local restaurants on anti-smoking attitudes and quitting behaviours among adult smokers. Design: Hierarchical linear modelling (HLM) was used to assess the relationship between baseline strength of town-level restaurant smoking regulation and follow-up (1) perceptions of the social acceptability of smoking and (2) quitting behaviours. Setting: Each of the 351 Massachusetts towns was classified as having strong (complete smoking ban) or weak (all other and no smoking restrictions) restaurant smoking regulations. Subjects: 1712 adult smokers of Massachusetts aged \u226518 years at baseline who were interviewed via random-digit-dial telephone survey in 2001-2 and followed up 2 years later. Main outcome measures: Perceived social acceptability of smoking in restaurants and bars, and making a quit attempt and quitting smoking. Results: Among adult smokers who had made a quit attempt at baseline, living in a town with a strong regulation was associated with a threefold increase in the odds of making a quit attempt at follow-up (OR=3.12; 95% CI 1.51 to 6.44). Regulation was found to have no effect on cessation at follow-up. A notable, although marginal, effect of regulation was observed for perceiving smoking in bars as socially unacceptable only among smokers who reported at baseline that smoking in bars was socially unacceptable. Conclusions: Although local restaurant smoking regulations did not increase smoking cessation rates, they did increase the likelihood of making a quit attempt among smokers who had previously tried to quit, and seem to reinforce anti-social smoking norms among smokers who already viewed smoking in bars as socially unacceptable.\n      </p>", "The objective for this formative evaluation was to establish baseline data for informing a community coalition's strategic planning in environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) risk reduction. The coalition had chosen 3 targeted settings for ETS risk reduction: restaurants, childcare facilities, and government buildings. The evaluation methodology involved telephone interviews (restaurants, n = 805; governmental buildings, n = 258) and mailed surveys (childcare facilities, n = 1,142). Data on county residents and businesses were used for comparison purposes and were analyzed from the Nebraska Social Climate Survey (2001; n = 558). Evaluation baseline findings showed that licensed childcare facilities were more ETS knowledgeable, less ETS tolerant, and more smoke-free than restaurants. Residents were more bothered by ETS than what restaurant proprietors perceived. The majority of governmental buildings were not smoke-free. Conclusions were that community health nurse evaluators can provide coalitions with formative evaluative data to inform strategic planning and increase the likelihood of effective program interventions for community impact on ETS.\n      </p>", "In the debate about laws regulating smoking in restaurants and pubs, there has been some controversy as to whether smoke-free laws would reduce revenues in the hospitality industry. Norway presents an interesting case for three reasons. First, it was among the first countries to implement smoke-free laws, so it is possible to assess the long-term effects. Second, it has a cold climate so if there is a negative effect on revenue one would expect to find it in Norway. Third, the data from Norway are detailed enough to distinguish between revenue from pubs and restaurants. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) intervention analysis of bi-monthly observations of revenues in restaurants and pubs show that the law did not have a statistically significant long-term effect on revenue in restaurants or on restaurant revenue as a share of personal consumption. Similar analysis for pubs shows that there was no significant long-run effect on pub revenue.\n      </p>", "The relationship between visual inspections carried out by environmental health officers and microbiological examination was studied in 89 restaurants. Using 30 variables a standardized inspection procedure was developed and each of the premises was assessed in six main areas - structure and design, cleaning and cleanliness, personal hygiene, risk of contamination, temperature control, and training and knowledge about food hygiene. Selected foods and specimens from hands, surfaces, and wiping cloths were examined. There were significant associations between all six areas of the inspections. The structure and design were significantly related to the combined score from all the other areas (P &lt; 0\u00b7001). There were no highly significant associations between microbiological examination and visual assessments. The microbial contamination of wiping cloths, however, was related to the cleaning and cleanliness (P = 0\u00b7005). Microbial sampling provided additional information to inspections and was a valuable aid. Further development of this risk-assessment approach could provide an effective system for monitoring potential health risks in high-risk food premises.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

As the practice moves from a stopgap procedure to a management technique, information is needed on the effects of variations in feeding regime on vulture behavior. We provided food to Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus) in the Negev Desert, Israel, under 2 regimes. A regular feeding station (RFS) was stocked daily with 5-10 kg of chicken carcasses, and an irregular feeding station (IFS) was stocked approximately twice monthly with 20-350 kg of livestock carcasses. At the RFS, numbers peaked at 20-30 birds; flock size at the IFS peaked at 30-40 birds. Adults feeding on chickens could dominate individual carcasses and fed in higher proportions than younger birds. Large carcasses and scattered scraps at the IFS could not be defended by individuals, and adults did not feed preferentially. Small, daily food deliveries favored adults and resulted in higher proportions of flocks feeding. Large, infrequent deliveries did not favor any age class; however, infrequent food deliveries may not provide sufficiently regular food for adults feeding young. Smaller competing scavengers at the RFS did not exclude Egyptian vultures from food. At the IFS, large mammals briefly excluded vultures but often improved access to food by tearing open carcasses. Eurasian griffons (Gyps fulvus) at the IFS excluded Egyptian vultures and consumed most of the available food.

However, there is no specific evidence that fast food is worse than other food eaten away from home (FAFH). We use the Continuing Survey of Individual Food Intake to compare fast food and table service meals. We find that both are larger and have more calories than meals prepared at home, with table service exceeding fast food, possibly due to different pricing methods. However, for the full day, both result in similar calorie increases relative to no FAFH, with fast food perhaps somewhat worse.\n      </p>", "New York City's Chinatown established itself at the turn of the twentieth century as an important site of urban tourism. By marketing their unfamiliar culture to tourists, the residents of Chinatown were able to bring outside capital into their otherwise marginal economy. The Chinese restaurant, for many, came to define the Chinatown experience and quickly became a popular destination beyond Chinatown's bounds. As many writers of the period made clear, Chinatown offered thrills and visual pleasures comparable to those had at other turn-of-the-century sites of urban leisure, such as Broadway and Coney Island. In this article, I examine a diverse set of paintings from the early twentieth century representing New York's Chinatown and Chinese restaurants. These paintings, ranging in formal idiom from Ashcan School realism to cubo-futurism, are examined in relation to a number of related themes, including tourism, prostitution and ethnic caricature. I emphasise not only the striking formal differences between these images, but also the equally important similarities in their engagement with the increasingly unstable social relations of the modern metropolis. My interpretation of these images proposes a means of understanding the interrelationships between art, identity and the transformation of the urban environment into an arena of display in an emerging consumer economy.\n      </p>", "Objectives: Exposure to second-hand smoke (SHS) is widespread in restaurants in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

Two distinct epidemic waves of illness occurred, and investigation implicated two local restaurants as sources of infection, one for each epidemic wave. An index patient who prepared food was identified at each restaurant, and the two restaurants were linked by the fact that the index patient who worked at the second restaurant had patronized the first restaurant. Foods implicated as vehicles of transmission included \"guacamole,\" green salad, spaghetti, and hamburger. The findings represent a rare example of a \"double\" common-source outbreak with two distinct epidemic waves related to two separate eating establishments.\n      </p>", "Despite popular claims that racism and discrimination are no longer salient issues in contemporary society, members of racially underrepresented groups continue to experience disparate treatment in everyday public interactions. The context of full-service restaurants is one such public setting wherein African Americans, in particular, encounter racial prejudices and discriminatory treatment. To further understand the pervasiveness of such anti-Black attitudes and actions within the restaurant context, this article analyzes primary survey data derived from a community sample of servers (N = 200). Participants were asked a series of questions ascertaining information about the racial climate of their workplaces. Findings reveal substantial server negativity toward African Americans' tipping and dining behaviors. Racialized discourse and discriminatory behaviors are also shown to be quite common in the restaurant context. The anti-Black attitudes and actions that the authors document in this research are illustrative of the continuing significance of race in contemporary society, and the authors encourage further research on this relatively neglected area of inquiry.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Workers formed their own organizations, notably the Association des Cuisiniers Indochinois and the Association Amicale des Indochinois (Travailleurs Manuels).

By 1914, when Davis published Gourmet's Guide to London, he had launched a restaurant revolution. Unlike gastronomes before him, Davis systematically demystified the protocol of restaurant dining for hundreds of middle-class people who had been too intimidated to step inside one of them or to visit locales where less-expensive restaurant meals were available. Newnham-Davis recognized that his target audience\u2014\u201cthe Respectable Classes,\u201d as he referred to them\u2014had little experience with the notion of eating for pleasure or leaving the security of home to venture out to a restaurant.

Twelve percent of respondents reported diarrhea; the risk of diarrhea was significantly higher in those who ate raw or cooked oysters (relative risk = 1.5, P = .005). At least one Vibrio species was recovered from 51 (11%) of 479 persons submitting stool specimens; however, only 15 (29%) of those with a positive stool culture also reported diarrhea. Of the five Vibrio species identified, V. parahaemolyticus was most common and was most strongly associated with diarrhea. V. cholerae serogroup 01 was not isolated despite the occurrence of a cholera outbreak during the same time period in Louisiana. Cultures of raw and cooked seafood served in local restaurants yielded five different Vibrio species. Although asymptomatic passage of Vibrio organisms was common among persons eating seafood, the risk of Vibrio gastroenteritis was low.\n      </p>", "This paper evaluates the simplifying assumption that producers compete in a large market without substantial strategic interactions using nonparametric regressions of producers' choices on market size. With such atomistic competition, increasing the number of consumers leaves the distributions of producers' prices and other choices unchanged. In many models featuring non-trivial strategic considerations, producers' prices fall as their numbers increase. I examine observations of restaurants' sales, seating capacities, exit decisions, and prices from 222 US cities. Given factor prices and demographic variables, increasing a city's size increases restaurants' average sales and decreases their exit rate and prices. These results suggest that strategic considerations lie at the heart of restaurant pricing and turnover.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "           ", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
