And if so, can such socialization \"trickle up\" to influence the political socialization of these students' parents? We examine the effects of Kids Voting USA in Kansas to answer these questions. By the 1996 presidential election, Kids Voting was implemented in several Kansas counties. Consequently, we are able to compare turnout\u2014and change in turnout across different elections\u2014in such counties with those that did not adopt the program. After controlling for a variety of county-level characteristics that are likely to affect turnout, regression analyses indicate a positive and significant contribution of Kids Voting to county turnout, and change in turnout across elections. We address the practical implications of this study and emphasize its theoretical contribution to theories of political socialization.\n      </p>", "Although it is known that the young play an active role in the formation of mother-young attachment in ruminants, there is scant knowledge of how neonates identify their mothers. This research investigated the use of visual cues, particularly pelage pigmentation, in maternal recognition by domestic goat kids. Observations on the use of auditory cues were carried out secondarily. The findings of this study were: (1) The analysis of error patterns revealed that goat kids performed phenotype matching on the basis of pelage pigmentation when seeking their mothers in two- and six-choice tests, at a distance of 10 m. Presenting the kids with a choice between two females of the same colour resulted in more vacillation, and fewer kids were able to go to their mother directly than when the adults were of different colours. The phenomenon was not evident when the kids were 3 days old. Because it occurred at all other ages, regardless of whether the mother was absent, covered, or fully visible, colour-matching seems to be an important aspect of maternal recognition. (2) Visual cues were important for recognition, as evidenced by the performance of kids when maternal cues were limited (i.e. the mother was covered). (3) The efficiency measures did not correlate strongly with maternal vocalizations when visual cues from the mother were not completely present or when pelage pigmentation was not a good cue for discrimination. On the contrary, kids unexpectedly vocalized more in the conditions in which they could discriminate on the basis of visual cues, that is, when the mother was bare rather than covered, and when she was paired with a doe of a different colour category rather than one of the same colour category. (4) Five-day-old domestic goat kids recognized their mothers efficiently, even within a group, and at a distance of at least 10 m. Most 3-day-kids were not able to find their mothers efficiently in the six-choice test. Errors were made at all ages. The observed performance is consistent with the abilities required of kids under natural conditions.\n      </p>", "American Indian/Alaska Native well-being, survival-based data are rare. This study explores the question of whether or not it is possible to produce such well-being information using secondary data sources. The answer is yes, with some limitations. Hence, Native American data for 10 well-being indicators nationally and for New Mexico and South Dakota, using a model like Kids Count (Annie E. Casey Foundation: 2003a, 2001 KIDS COUNT Data Book: State profiles of child well-being (Annie E. Casey Foundation, Baltimore, MD)) are reported; thereby reducing the gap in survival indicators for U.S. Indigenous children and youths. Comparisons between all children and American Indian children demonstrate that Native American children have comparatively worse well-being rates at the national level and in South Dakota, whereas New Mexico Native kids compare favorably to their non-Native peers. Policy recommendations conclude the paper.\n      </p>", "Parent-offspring recognition is crucial for offspring survival. At long distances, this recognition is mainly based on vocalizations. Because of maturation-related changes to the structure of vocalizations, parents have to learn successive call versions produced by their offspring throughout ontogeny in order to maintain recognition. However, because of the difficulties involved in following the same individuals over years, it is not clear how long this vocal memory persists. Here, we investigated long-term vocal recognition in goats. We tested responses of mothers to their kids' calls 7-13 months after weaning. We then compared mothers' responses to calls of their previous kids with their responses to the same calls at five weeks postpartum. Subjects tended to respond more to their own kids at five weeks postpartum than 11-17 months later, but displayed stronger responses to their previous kids than to familiar kids from other females. Acoustic analyses showed that it is unlikely that mothers were responding to their previous kids simply because they confounded them with the new kids they were currently nursing. Therefore, our results provide evidence for strong, long-term vocal memory capacity in goats. The persistence of offspring vocal recognition beyond weaning could have important roles in kin social relationships and inbreeding avoidance.\n      </p>", "The spatial world of the child comprises two great realms, \"in\" and \"out,\" more or less corresponding to the great behavioral domains of \"got to\" and \"doing nothing.\" Within the \"got-to\" domain-and thus \"in\"-are home, school, and other loci of secure, stable authority. Included in \"doing nothing\"-and so \"out\"-are street and yard, field and stream, pool hall and movie theater, the spaces of games, things to do, and really doing nothing. This study looks at the shifting relationships of these realms across the life cycle of kids in the highlands of Puerto Rico in 1969-1970.\n      </p>", "This study focuses on the distribution of arsenic (As) and lead (Pb) in surface sediments at Three Kids Mine located in Henderson, Nevada. The mine is comprised of approximately 470 acres of desert and is situated above the large development of Lake Las Vegas and the Las Vegas Valleys water supply, Lake Mead. Transport of arsenic and lead appears to have occurred within a limited range in both the eastern and western washes of Three Kids Mine. Concentrations of arsenic and lead range between 200 ppm and 1130 ppm and 20 ppm and 8400 ppm, respectfully, in soils collected from washes at Three Kids Mine. Samples collected from the north side of the site indicate a mixing of the natural soils which are low in arsenic and lead with milling waste from historic mining practices, which are higher in arsenic and lead concentrations. The migration of arsenic and lead apparently resulted from the transport of sediments containing these contaminants down gradient in surface runoff during storm events. Adsorption of arsenic and lead onto the surface of soil particles is postulated to be the major source of transport during wet periods for this site. As a result, transport of arsenic and lead from historic Three Kids Mine could possibly pose a threat to Lake Las Vegas and Lake Mead if a catastrophic storm event or repeated storm events were to occur within a short period of time.\n      </p>", "This study evaluated how different systems of feeding may influence the appearance, maintenance, or both of cryptosporidial infection. Animals reared with natural lactation, a traditional artificial feeding system, and a variety of the latter were studied for oocysts in feces. The diagnosis was made by examination of fecal smears stained with auramine-O. Morbidity and mortality were high, particularly in farms with bad hygienic conditions and natural feeding systems. The traditional artificial feeding system is not enough to reduce the presence of parasites. Isolation of newborns at birth and colostrum administration with a feeding bottle, obtained in the most aseptic conditions possible, seems to be an effective prophylactic method for cryptosporidiosis control.\n      </p>", "Objectives: To examine the relationship of enrollment in Healthy Kids insurance (locally funded insurance products for low-income children ineligible for other public insurance) with parent-reported experiences of primary care medical home quality. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of parents of 4011 children stratified by established enrollees in Healthy Kids (enrolled 1 y or longer), new enrollees (less than 1 y), and children on a waitlist. We examined differences across groups in having an ongoing source of primary care, and experiences of 6 features of a medical home\u2014accessibility, continuity, comprehensiveness, contextual knowledge, communication, and coordination\u2014and a summary medical home measure. Results: Compared with waitlisted children, new and established enrollees were more likely to have a regular source of care [odds ratio (OR) = 2.49; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.74-3.57 and OR = 6.51; CI: 4.64-9.13, respectively] and a personal doctor or nurse (OR = 3.41; CI: 2.42-4.80 and OR = 7.00; CI: 5.07-9.66). Among those with a regular source of care and visit in the past year, new and established enrollees reported better medical home experiences in 4 and 6 of the 7 measures, respectively. Conclusions: Despite many barriers to care for vulnerable children, Healthy Kids enrollment was positively associated with having an ongoing source of primary care and better medical home experiences. As these children are mostly left out of healthcare reform, Healthy Kids programs may be a good model for other counties and states to help to connect such children to primary care.\n      </p>", "Eighty-seven parents and primary caregivers of children aged 10 years or younger participated in a study examining the effects of the ACT Raising Safe Kids program on children's behavior. It was hypothesized that children of caregivers who complete ACT-RSK would demonstrate reduced behavior problems compared to children of caregivers in a treatment-asusual comparison group. Results indicated that the behavior of children of treated caregivers improved significantly more than comparisons on a measure of conduct problems. Although further research is needed, these results suggest that ACT-RSK may contribute to the prevention of behavior problems in early childhood.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Over the past decade, anti-panhandling bylaws have been adopted in several Canadian cities including Vancouver, Winnipeg, and Montreal.

We focus specifically on strategies of inclusion and exclusion. Strategies of inclusion are attempts by homeless kids to establish harmonious relationships with both peers and strangers. The most common are forging friendships, passing, and covering. Strategies of exclusion are aggressive and nonconciliatory attempts to gain social acceptance. They include verbal denigration and physical and sexual posturing. Some of these strategies successfully protect the kids' sense of self, while other strategies had the unintended effect of reinforcing their spoiled identities. We argue that these stigma management strategies are both informed by and interpreted through their disadvantaged social structural location.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

In this article, I present an analysis of the main errors that have been reported in the literature. My proposal is based on an old idea, namely, that children's errors are caused by a noncanonical mapping from syntactic form to semantic representation. Previous theories based on this assumption were not entirely successful because they lacked the proper framework for dealing with quantification. In particular, they failed to recognize the importance of the distinction between weak and strong quantifiers. Everything falls into place, or so I argue, if this distinction is taken into account.\n      </p>", "The background quality of the geomorphic landscape little encourages it as a subject for children's attention. Geomorphic features appeared in fewer than 8% of a large sample of children's drawings; geomorphic features were referred to less than 11% of the time in 500 hours of sandbox play. Because of this (relatively) transparent quality, earth takes on a great variety of roles in sandbox play, playing food more often than anything else (vanilla, salt, vinegar, cake, and meatballs, for example). Dirt play is dominated by young children who distinguish three forms of earth: sand, dirt, and mud. Older kids find little room for things-of-action in the sandbox, and the earth's surface is an even less compelling subject for them than it is for younger children.\n      </p>", "Faeces samples from diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic lambs and goat kids aged 1-45 days were examined for enteric pathogens.

Somewhat. Professor Raelin of Boston College has devoted a number of years to studying the '60s kids, defined as those who were between the ages of 12 and 20 in 1963, the year he believes best represents the beginning of an impactful decade. The fact is that '60s kids, compared with those a decade before and a decade after, more frequently chose professions as their career. They did not necessarily \"hang out a shingle,\" but have opted for professional occupations (engineers, lawyers, scientists, doctors, social workers, etc.) within organizations. Moreover, they have tended to avoid taking a position in management. This \"new class professional,\" Raelin believes, while obviously not radical, does maintain stronger values regarding professional behavior. Their loyalty is more to the standards of their profession than to the dictates of their employing organization. Raelin, a '60s kid himself, advises that to manage these '60s kids best, executives need to create an organizational climate that will encourage individual initiative, autonomy, some degree of participation in decision making, and a quality of life that fosters more of a human touch rather than a highly formalized, bureaucratic relationship.\n      </p>", "As digital technology rapidly invades more aspects of human life and culture than ever before, our ideas of art, art making, and art education are continually questioned. Theories of visual culture in art education (Duncum, 2002; Freedman, 2003) challenge art educators to include images and objects from everyday life such as television, the World Wide Web, video games, cartoons, theme parks, and malls as foci for exploring the social and political implications of our visual world. The visual art world itself has become a digital extravaganza of interactive exhibitive space, collaborative art making, pastiches of old and new, performances, and new media that fuse light, sound, and kinetics. Although new to many practicing artists and art teachers, the rapid, fast-paced way of digitally seeing is routine for contemporary \"digital kids\" (Jukes, 2005) who are not amazed by the current or latest advances in technology. And yet they, as well as we, are a part of what Daniel Pink (2005) calls a change in hands of the kingdom from those who could crank code, craft contracts, and crunch numbers to those known as creators, empathizers, pattern recognizers, and meaning makers (p. 1).\n      </p>", "Background: Pediatric observation units provide an alternative to traditional hospitalization. The extent to which observation units could replace inpatient care for asthmatic children is unknown. Objective: To describe brief inpatient (\"high-turnover,\" HTO) stays for US children hospitalized with a principal discharge diagnosis of asthma, to characterize cases that may be appropriate for observation. Design: We analyzed the 2006 Kids' Inpatient Database, a nationally representative sample of hospital discharges. HTO stays were defined as hospitalizations of 0 or 1 night in duration. We conducted descriptive statistics and case-mix adjusted, sample-weighted regression analysis of HTO stays, and associated hospital charges. Subjects: Discharges among children aged 2 to 20 years with a principal discharge diagnosis of asthma. Measures: HTO stays and total charges. Results: Overall, 34,592 (34%) pediatric asthma hospitalizations were HTO, accounting for 66,278 hospital days in 2006. HTO stays were associated with younger age, uncomplicated asthma, and private insurance. Freestanding children's hospitals had the highest proportion of HTO stays, 38% (95% CI: 34%\u201342%) compared with 32% (95% CI: 28%\u201336%) for children's units and 33% (95% CI: 31%\u201334%) for general hospitals. In multivariate regression analyses, charges were significantly higher across hospital types when HTO stays begin in the emergency department. Conclusions: The presence of a large number of HTO stays for children hospitalized for asthma suggests the need to explore opportunities to restructure care for this condition, perhaps through the development of physically or operationally distinct observation units.\n      </p>", "This study explores how preadolescents engaged in different interactional approaches to whiteness in racially distinct summer camps. Kids in the predominantly white and predominantly black contexts created peer cultures that differed in the following ways: (1) how they marked and defined whiteness, (2) how they made subject positions toward whiteness problematic, and (3) how they maintained different racial hegemonies. Mere numerical majority/minority relations, as well as differences in racial hegemony, caused kids to vary the meanings of whiteness, especially as the value of maintaining color-blind and color-aware orientations fluctuated. The findings suggest that the racial composition of a context may be key to encouraging recognition that white racial subjectivities are as subject to multiple interpretations, expressions, and embodiment as are racial subjectivities of color.\n      </p>", "In temperate environments, early-born ungulates may enjoy a longer growth period before winter, and so attain a higher body mass and an increased probability of survival compared to late-born ones. We assessed the effects of maternal characteristics, forage quality and population density on kid birthdate, mass and survival in a population of marked mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) in Alberta. The duration and timing of the birth season were similar in all years. Births were highly synchronised: 80% of kids were born within 2 weeks of the first birth. Maternal age, maternal social rank and density did not affect kid birthdate or mass. Previous breeding experience was not related to kid birthdate, but kids born to pluriparous mothers were heavier during summer than kids born to primiparous mothers. Male and female kids had similar mass and accumulated mass linearly during summer. Early-born kids were heavier than late-born kids. Faecal crude protein (FCP) in late spring and maternal mass were positively related to kid mass. Survival to weaning appeared higher for males (90%) than for females (78%), but survival to 1 year was 65% for both sexes. FCP in late spring, density, birthdate and mass did not affect kid survival to weaning in either sex. Survival to 1 year increased with FCP in late spring for females, but not for males. Survival to 1 year was independent of birthdate for both sexes, but heavy females survived better than light ones. Multiple logistic regression revealed a positive effect of mass on survival to 1 year when the sexes were pooled. Our results suggest that mountain goats are constrained to give birth in a short birth season synchronised with forage productivity.\n      </p>", "Based on in-depth interviews and fieldwork, this article examines mothers raising kids with invisible, social/emotional/behavioral disabilities to refine feminist theories of mother-blame. The mother-valor/mother-blame binary holds mothers responsible for families and future citizens, maintaining this \"natural\" care at the center of normative femininity. The author explores how mothers raising such burdensome children understand their experiences and makes three arguments: (1) Fewer mothers are blamed for causing their child's troubles in an era of \"brain-blame,\" but more are blamed as proximate causes if they do not make unrelenting efforts, paralleling \"concerted cultivation,\" to resolve them; (2) such mothers often exceed concerted cultivation, as they seize authority, as vigilantes, within educational and medical systems in the midst of turf wars, cost containment, and a resulting proliferation of medication treatments; and (3) this maternal speedup holds mothers accountable for feminizing ties to sons, for policing gender boundaries while policing their own feminine care. In sum, mothers raising invisibly disabled kids may represent the model of maternal valor for an era of public stinginess and extensive medicalization.\n      </p>", "Using an interactionist approach, this study compares the ways that older preadolescents established and negotiated peer relations by engaging in racialized and gendered age processes at two summer day camps. The camps differed in their racial compositions, their organization of activities by age and gender, and their rules delineating camper behavior. Campers in both settings used notions of modesty and relations of dominance over younger children similarly in organizing their peer relations. They differed, though, in how they used a stance uncooperative toward adults and a stance of being \"just kids\" together to create racialized, aged, and gendered boundaries. Thus, campers created peer cultures with variably hierarchical cliques using inclusive and exclusionary dynamics that held each other accountable to emergent and racialized conceptions of gender and age in ways that actively and creatively used the adult cultures around them.\n      </p>", "Using qualitative in-depth interviews with a sample of adult male youth workers (n = 55), including a subset of twenty-nine fathers, the author explores how men's fathering and youth experiences can be viewed as part of a larger, integrated social mosaic. Informed selectively by social constructionist, symbolic interactionist, life course, and generativity themes, the analysis expands the fatherhood literature by connecting it to men's volunteering and work with kids in public settings. While extending his framework of fathering trajectories (self-as-father, father-child, and coparental) to examine similar processes defining men's youth work, the author explores key points of intersection between youth work and fathering: youth work as inspiration and training for fathering, reciprocal influences between youth work and fathering, and men's contributions to social capital for lads in public settings. The author also sketches several ideas to foster conceptual and practical ties between youth work and fathering to benefit youth.\n      </p>", "A simple method is presented to show kids the size of a microbe \u2013 a fungus hypha \u2013 compared to a human hair.

Mold fungi can be easily and safely grown on the medium from the classroom environment. A microscope capable of 200\u2013400\u00d7 is necessary. Students can use a hair from their own head to view a fungus and a hair side-by-side on the same slide. They will see that a microscopic fungus hypha is 20\u201350\u00d7 smaller in diameter than a hair. Older students will also learn that microbes are measured in micrometers, that fungi are ubiquitous, and that decay is an inevitable part of Earth\u2019s processes.\n      </p>", "A study to assess characteristics of coyotes (Canis latrans Say) that attack livestock was conducted in southern New Mexico. During 4-16 April 1991, 38 Angora does (Capra hircus L.) and their 34 offspring (kids) were exposed to coyote predation in 3 small experimental free-ranging flocks on the study area. One doe and 14 kids were killed by predators, including at least 12 cases of coyote predation. Coyotes selectively preyed on the smaller kids, and on goats in relatively small groups. Remains of 11 kids killed by predators were cached within the core areas of territorial coyotes. Six of 8 territorial coyotes and 5 of 9 transients (nonterritorial coyotes), with ranges that overlapped the distribution of flocks, consumed goats.\n      </p>", "\"Kids 'N' Cars\" is a 5 year matched case control study of pedestrian injury (PI) affecting school-aged children in Chicago.

They are products of poverty, war, urbanization, political instability, family breakdown, and HIV/AIDS, among others. Many are not homeless, but primary income earners for their extended families. Many participate in the sex and drug trade because of limited income generation alternatives. How can we support these youth and increase their opportunities while respecting them as independent actors in their own lives? Street Kids International suggests a critical paradigm shift as the basis for being responsive and effective and describes its approaches for working with street youth as participants and assets within their present communities.\n      </p>", "The Strong Women from the Tiwi Islands (northern Australia) are concerned that young Tiwi people are straddling two cultures, losing their language and their Tiwi identity. The women and their grandchildren have composed a song that emphasizes connection to the ancestors, to country, to language and to the elders. With lyrics in English, traditional Tiwi song language, and the contemporary spoken language, and with a hip-hop dance-mix sampling an ethnographic recording made in 1912, the \u201cStrong Kids Song\u201d is an example of new music helping to preserve tradition.\n      </p>", "The endogenous development and prepatent and patent periods of Eimeria ninakohlyakimovae were studied in 43 1-3-wk-old coccidia-free kids inoculated with 5.0 x 104, 1.5 x 105, 2.0 x 105, or 9.0 x 105 sporulated oocysts/kg. Twenty-five kids were killed at 24- or 48-hr intervals, 2-18 days after inoculation (DAI). Two generations of meronts, gamonts, gametes, and oocysts were found in sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined using under light microscopy. The first generation of meronts developed in the endothelium of the lacteals, in the lamina propria, and in the lymphatic vessels of the ileum submucosa. Mature, first-generation meronts, 165.5 x 123.6 \u03bcm, were first found 10 DAI. Second-generation merogony developed in the crypt epithelial cells of the cecum and colon; mature meronts, 16.8 x 11.6 \u03bcm, were first seen 12 DAI. Gametogenesis occurred in the cecum and colon epithelium; mature microgamonts (16.1 x 13.0 \u03bcm), microgametes, macrogametes (14.7 x 12.5 \u03bcm), and oocysts (18.3 x 13.3 \u03bcm) were seen at 13 DAL The course of the infection was followed in 18 kids examined every day until 24 DAL The prepatent period was 14.7 (13-17) days and the patent period 6.8 (4-10) days. The sporulation time at 30 C, with constant aeration, was 2-3 days.\n      </p>"], "words": {"summer": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "ith": {"number": 8, "prob":
