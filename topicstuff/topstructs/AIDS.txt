Method: This study applied the AIDS case-finding algorithm to paid Medicaid claims linked to New Jersey AIDS surveillance data and assesses its sensitivity across subgroups of patients. Findings: Of the 7183 cases with confirmed AIDS, based on the state's registry information, 95% (n = 6818) were correctly detected using all Medicaid claims, including pharmacy. For patients in a community-based waiver program, covered by Medicare, diagnosed with a severe mental illness, or continuously enrolled in Medicaid, with regular contact with the medical system, the algorithm identified almost all patients. To further evaluate algorithm performance, it was used with 2 groups of interest to researchers. For AIDS patients in the last 6 months of life, 88% were correctly detected without use of pharmacy claims and 95% when pharmacy claims were included. For pregnant women, data from the 6 months before the latest delivery date identify 27% of pregnant women without pharmacy claims and 41% when pharmacy claims were included. Using claims made after the latest delivery date, 81% of pregnant women were detected without pharmacy claims and 93% when pharmacy claims were included Conclusion: Results demonstrate that a multilevel screen can be used with Medicaid claims to effectively to detect most patients with AIDS. Detection is lower for some subgroups, and the absence of pharmacy claims can compromise detection.\n      </p>", "We utilize a 1992 survey of approximately, 2500 AIDS activists to analyze their degree of participation. Activity levels were affected by several traditional predictors, but the inclusion of contextual measures indicating the activists' connection with AIDS, especially the pain and loss incurred, led to a much fuller and more complex explanatory model. We argue that a richer comprehension of political participation requires more studies of issue-specific activists and the specification of contexual features that serve to motivate more intensive degrees of participation.\n      </p>", "This article addresses the relatively scant sustained attention to HIV/AIDS in the South African academy as we try to re-conceptualise the university as a space for various kinds of activism and education. We distinguish twin dimensions of the AIDS pandemic: the virus's physical, social, and economic effects and its multiplying meanings. In order to understand the inaction to date, we sketch some broad contextual features of the AIDS landscape in South Africa and particularly in universities. We examine the nature of academic work and the context in which it is performed, evaluated and rewarded. We also explore the impact these features have on education-and-activism in the context of AIDS. The gendered landscape of the academy and its interaction with the HIV/AIDS pandemic are also analysed. We end with an overview of a range of alternative approaches to education-and-activism: from curricular approaches to AIDS that address the epidemic of narratives, to university-wide programmes and outreach activities beyond the university campus.\n      </p>", "Between 1981 and August 1997, 100,000 AIDS cases were reported in New York City (NYC): 77,067 men, 20,818 women, 307 teenagers, and 1,808 children. This report examines AIDS trends in NYC as the epidemic evolved from a predominantly white male epidemic among men with same sex contact (MSM) mostly from a single borough to a geographically diffuse epidemic that includes injecting drug users (IDU), persons of color, and women infected heterosexually. Case data were collected by active surveillance methods augmented by electronic laboratory based reporting. Mortality data were obtained from NYC Vital Statistics. 1990 Census data were used to derive incidence rates and prevalence by neighborhood income. Rates per 100,000 adults by neighborhood ranged from 260 to 5,500. Total AIDS incidence peaked in 1993 and has subsequently declined. Among men there was a shift from MSM to IDU as the predominant risk group, and increasing incidence among men reporting heterosexual contact. IDU was the leading risk factor among women, and women increased from 8 to 30 percent of all cases between 1982 and 1997. Unlike incidence, AIDS prevalence is rising among socially and economically marginalized populations, and will remain a major public health challenge well into the next century.\n      </p>", "The HIV/AIDS infection rates are increasing in predominantly Black communities while decreasing among other previously at-risk groups. This study reviews the prevention strategies of three agencies operating within three Black communities in the state of Louisiana. Research findings indicate that state agencies failed to consider salient issues that would permit effective confrontation of this disease in Black communities. Their initial failure equates to nondecision and renders subsequent formulations of policy, present and future, grossly inadequate.\n      </p>", "Replicating a prior U. S. study, data were gathered from preschool and school-age children in Thailand (n = 80). Taking a developmental perspective, Thai children's knowledge and understanding of AIDS was assessed, and results were compared with those of the U. S. sample. The findings show that Thai children in each of four designated age groups have higher levels of accurate knowledge of AIDS compared with their U. S. counterparts. The findings of these early studies are discussed in terms of current AIDS infection rates and educational prevention efforts in both cultures.\n      </p>", "This briefing describes ways in which the politics of gender and sexuality influence contemporary global AIDS activism, seen at the recent Bangkok International AIDS Conference. Such activism melds identity-based activism around gender and sexuality with activism advocating for socioeconomic justice through wider HIV treatment access. Historically, both in South Africa and the United States (US), gay rights activism has played a key role in the evolution of AIDS activism. This is a legacy which has influenced contemporary AIDS activism lobbying for wider HIV treatment access. By contrast, feminists may have been slower to politically respond to the epidemic. Today, women make up the majority of members of contemporary South African AIDS activist organisations, but are often under-represented in leadership positions. Similarly, at Bangkok, women living openly with HIV were not given a voice at politically significant events. AIDS activists also highlighted the sexual conservatism promoted through the Bush Administration's foreign aid to fight AIDS.\n      </p>", "The purpose of this article is to examine ethnographic methodologies (and the conceptual frame used to define and apply such methodologies) relevant to the global study of AIDS. Included for consideration are participant observation, category systems, interviewer bias, formal/informal language and developmental perspective. As an illustration of ethnographic methodology, the present article also examines the significance of such methods within the Chicago Women and Children with AIDS Project.\n      </p>", "The psychosocial morbidity associated with HIV infection and responses to such infection may exceed morbidity associated with medical sequelae of such infection. This paper argues that negative judgements on those with HIV infection or in groups associated with such infection will cause avoidable psychological and social distress. Moral judgements made regarding HIV infection may also harm the common good by promoting conditions which may increase the spread of HIV infection. This paper examines these two lines of argument with regard to the ethical aspects of psychological bases of health care, clinical contact, public perceptions of AIDS and the comparative perspective. It is concluded that the psychosocial aspects of HIV infection impose ethical psychological, as well as medical, obligations to reduce harm and prevent the spread of infection.\n      </p>", "Advances in recent treatments for HIV/AIDS patients have shown dramatic outcomes in extending the incubation period and AIDS survival time, while also providing significant improvements in the quality of patients' lives. A compartmental model is proposed to analyse the effects of the various treatment regimens which have been introduced. The results produced are in good agreement with routinely collected data relating to levels of HIV/AIDS incidence and prevalence in the UK homosexual population. Some parameter values within the model are obtained from surveys, census results, etc, but others are derived using a maximum likelihood estimation procedure. Finally, the model is used to project levels of incidence and prevalence over the next few years, and to investigate several possible scenarios.\n      </p>", "In the literature, a variety of approaches have been used to calculate demand elasticities in almost ideal demand system (AIDS) models of demand. It is common to estimate the linear approximate almost ideal demand system (LA/AIDS) instead of the AIDS. When the LA/AIDS is estimated, all of the previously reported approaches to compute elasticities are theoretically incorrect. This paper presents correct formulas for LA/AIDS elasticities and illustrates the potential errors from using incorrect computing formulas.\n      </p>", "Geographically-related computer databases on the global incidence of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection are being maintained in the Department of Geography, University of Cambridge. By Summer 1991, these databases contained over 0.2 billion entries originating from 200 countries. This information permits a reconstruction of the documented diffusion corridors by which HIV-1 and HIV-2 have spread around the world from their original infection heartlands. These intercontinental diffusion patterns are contrasted with evidence regarding local HIV spread processes in Central Africa. The analysis suggests that the historical association between soldiers, prostitute contact and sexually-transmitted diseases explains the current geographical distribution of clinical AIDS in one country of the region, Uganda. The potential economic impact of the disease to the year 2000 is considered in the light of these results.\n      </p>", "Between 1985-1989 were diagnosed 376 cases of TBC in \"La Fe\" hospital in Valencia. 36 of this cases also had AIDS. We have carried out a compared study among the 340 cases of TBC and the 36 cases of AIDS+TBC. In this way we have described the social and work conditions of both groups, the hospitalization, the associated patologies, the differents risk factors, the different characteristics of the disease in each group of TBC, the diagnoses methods and the treatment of each case.\n      </p>", "Despite different models to project the course of the AIDS pandemic and a scarcity of data to provide standard input parameters for those models, a limited consensus emerges from distinct sets of population projections. In sub-Saharan Africa, population growth rates are projected to remain positive in spite of the pandemic over the next few decades. To investigate this conclusion, alternative projections of an HIV/AIDS epidemic and its related mortality are first produced from different sets of input parameters and assumptions. Their incorporation into the population projections of a fast-growing country illustrates the robustness of projected population growth rates under very different scenarios of the future epidemic but with the common assumption that it will not affect the mortality of the uninfected population, fertility nor migration. This paper then shows that the projected growth rates are much less robust when interactions between the epidemic and the demographic regime are allowed and identifies several potential mechanisms for such interactions. In particular, it suggests that improving our confidence in the medium-term projections of the demographic impact of AIDS in the region requires less a refinement of the projections of the epidemic than a better understanding of its impact on the timing of the postulated fertility decline.\n      </p>", "This paper is not about the medical condition of AIDS. Nor is it about the history of the condition since it was first reported in Atlanta, Georgia in 1981. It looks rather, at the catalogue of legislative and other legal responses to the spread of AIDS. The paper analyses the AIDS condition in its historical context. The hysteria accompanying the outbreak of AIDS is contrasted with the similar hysteria associated with other previous epidemics experienced in Australia over the past two centuries. The paper categorises the responses of lawmakers to the condition, according to the approach taken; from 'full blast', through 'moderate heat' to 'low key' or an attempt to avoid or minimise legal intervention. It is suggested that the appropriate response should depend upon such factors as the present magnitude of the condition, its likely future course, the availability of cures and protections against its spread and objectives being sought by intervention. Unless these factors are taken into account gross over-reaction can occur, causing social disruption and much personal injustice. This paper is based on a speech delivered at the Commonwealth and Victorian Health Department's National Conference on AIDS, in Melbourne on the 16th of November 1985. The views expressed are purely personal.\n      </p>", "The current 5% prevalence rate of HIV in Nigeria represents a significant population of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Discrimination against PLWHA has profound impact on the care and support required for their optimal management particularly in resource-constrained settings. The study sought to assess the knowledge of health-care providers about HIV/AIDS, determine the potential for discrimination in the provision of services based on patients' HIV sero-status and review the factors that may contribute to such attitude. Self-administered semi-structured questionnaires were administered to respondents who were selected by multi-stage sampling technique. The questionnaires explored the respondents' knowledge about HIV and their attitude and practice regarding PLWHA. Three hundred and forty-five questionnaires were completed. Only 77.1% correctly identified breastfeeding as a source of HIV transmission; 5.2%and 2.6% respectively thought transmission was possible through mosquito bite and handshake. About 10% and 15% respectively among trained nurses and auxiliary nurses were unaware that HIV could be transmitted to the child during delivery. Some 13.9% and 12.7% of respondents respectively were unwilling to take vital signs and carry out physical examination on PLWHA. Compared to physicians, trained nurses and auxiliary nurses were more likely to deny services based on HIV sero-status. Negative attitude was more likely if the source of the HIV infection was from homosexual exposure or bisexual indiscretion. The health-care workers studied manifested certain attitudes that are potentially discriminatory of PLWHA.. Well-coordinated continuing education of HIV/AIDS for all categories of health-care workers is recommended as a vital strategy in the crusade against the epidemic. /// L'actuel taux de 5% de fr\u00e9quence du VIH/SIDA au Nig\u00e9ria repr\u00e9sente une population importante de gens vivant avec le VIH/SIDA (GVAVS).

Benin City the capital of Edo State, Nigeria, has 40 government owned secondary schools comprising 6 boys, 10 girls, and 24 mixed. Out of these 3 schools were randomly selected for survey viz; Adolor (boys only), Iyoba (girls only), Army Day (mixed). The sample size for the survey was 920 while the total population for selected schools was 1692 giving a sampling ratio of 1:2. Using the systematic sampling method and class register as sampling frame every other child was selected for the study. However, only 852 students consented to participate giving a response rate of 92.6%. An overwhelming majority of the adolescents were aware of HIV/AIDS but only 16.2% knew the cause of the disease. The submission that kissing, living with infected persons and sharing their utensils could lead to infection was an indication of ignorance. Sexual intercourse was the predominant route of transmission mentioned by 60.0% while multiple sexual partners was prevalent among age group 13-15 years. Playing with sharps, frequent clean head shave with unsterilised instruments in the barbing saloon and promiscuity were some of the activities that adolescents were involved in that could lead to HIV/AIDS infection. In conclusion, the knowledge of the study population was poor and correlates with their reckless sexual practices. Prevention is the best option to the disease. Better informed youths on HIV/AIDS will enhance the principle of prevention.

More specifically, since the family provides the main context in which young children learn, the role of family life educators is an important one in helping parents provide accurate and timely information to their children. This study is designed to clarify questions regarding children's knowledge of AIDS from a developmental viewpoint. Children in preschool, first grade, third grade, and fifth grade were interviewed. The findings suggest that children's knowledge of AIDS is associated with general perceptions children have regarding illness, and that accurate knowledge of AIDS is directly related to age.\n      </p>", "The great variability in the time between infection with HIV and the onset of AIDS has been the object of intense study. In the current work, we examine a mathematical model that focuses on the role of immune response variability between patients. We study the effect of variation in both the avidity and the breadth of the immune response on within-patient disease dynamics, viral setpoint and time to AIDS. We conclude that immune response variability can explain the observed variability in disease progression to a large extent. It turns out that the avidity, more than the breadth of the immune response, determines disease progression, and that the average avidity of the five best clones is a much better correlate for disease progression than the total number of clones responding. For the design of vaccines, this would suggest that, if given the choice between stimulating a broader, but average avidity response or a narrower high-avidity response, the latter option would yield better control of virus load and consequently slow down disease progression.\n      </p>", "The United Nations publishes estimates of HIV prevalence, AIDS mortality, and orphan numbers for all countries of the world. It is important to assess the validity of these model-based estimates since they underpin much policy concerned with care and prevention. Household surveys that ask questions about the survival of children's parents (orphanhood) offer an independent source of data with which these estimates can be compared. Survey estimates of maternal and paternal orphans are significantly lower than model estimates for 40 surveys in 36 countries of sub-Saharan Africa (p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.002). This is probably because adult mortality from causes other than AIDS is lower than assumed in the models, although under-reporting of orphanhood in surveys may also play a role. Reducing adult mortality from causes other than AIDS brings the model estimates into close agreement with the surveys. This suggests that the fraction of orphans attributable to AIDS is greater than estimated previously.\n      </p>", "A widespread theory in the province of Papua, Eastern Indonesia, links the spread of sex workers and HIV/AIDS to a broader government conspiracy to eliminate indigenous Papuans. Explicit conspiratorial thinking by indigenous Papuans draws from diverse evidence such as provincial partition legislation, patterns of sex-industry usage, economic transformations, rumors of witchcraft, and new automobile technology. This article argues against treating conspiracy theories about AIDS simply as symbolically powerful rumors expressing indigenous Papuans' perceptions of oppression and unequal access to state resources. Rather, conspiracy theories articulate awareness of inconsistencies in the government's formulation and administration of sexual regulations and AIDS-prevention policies. AIDS conspiracy theories can therefore be understood as pragmatic and detailed interpretations of Papuan lived experiences in a context of ethnically disenfranchising forms of power in post-Suharto Indonesia.\n      </p>", "Papua New Guinea has experienced a growing HIV/AIDS epidemic. The Christian Churches have played a vital role in responding to HIV, through community support, encouragement and social change. Strong, effective Church leadership can help create safe environments of care and support for those infected and for prevention of HIV. Method A series of trainings in capacity development for clergy were undertaken by the National AIDS Council Secretariat (NACS)/National HIV/AIDS Support Project (NHASP). Results A model \"Church's Response to HIV and AIDS in a Care Continuum\" was developed to assist the training. This paper discusses the model and the lessons learned.\n      </p>", "There are religous and philosophical versions of the thesis that AIDS is a punishment for homosexual behaviour. It is argued here that the religious version is seriously incomplete. Because of this incompleteness and because of the indeterminacies that ordinarily attend religious argumentation, it is concluded that the claim may be set aside as unconvincing. Homosexual behaviour is then judged for its morality against utilitarian, deontological, and natural law theories of ethics. It is argued that such behaviour involves no impediment to important moral goals and is not therefore immoral. Where natural law might be used to condemn homosexual behaviour, it is argued that the theory itself is not well established. Consequently there is a prima facie reason for rejecting the philosophical version of the punishment thesis. This conclusion is further supported by noting the lack of proportion between the purported immorality of homosexuality and a punishment as devastating as AIDS.\n      </p>", "Wild foods may offer unique benefits to households afflicted by AIDS, providing a nutritious and freely available food source at minimal labour and financial costs. This article presents the results of food security assessments in two rural South African sites. Detailed household dietary recalls from 227 households, combined with qualitative work, explored the association of household AIDS proxies (recent morbidity, mortality and orphan fostering) with household food security and dietary composition. The study found that AIDS-proxy households were significantly more food insecure, and households fostering orphans were both poorer and more food insecure. Wild foods were evident in 40.3% of the 48 h recalls, with significantly greater likelihood of use in households with fostering paternal orphans, and/or with at least one AIDS proxy. Only paterrial orphans were significantly associated with likelihood of using wild foods when Controlling for household socio-economic Status. Qualitative data suggests that households afflicted by AIDS might curtail their use of wild foods due to household labour shortages and Stigma. This is unfortunate, as regressions indicate that households using wild foods may be more economically resilient. This may be particularly important for households registering AIDS proxies, due to a demonstrated negative correlation between accumulated household AIDS proxies and household income.\n      </p>", "Mathematical and computer-simulation models of sexually transmitted diseases, which have been used to study gonorrhoea and human papilloma virus transmissions, are applied to the study of AIDS. The problems of adapting the general model to the new problem, within already established principles, are described; and solutions offered. The objective is to predict equilibrium levels for the prevalence and incidence of HTLV-III infection in the U.K. Within the uncertainties of the available information on sexual behaviour in our society, on the risk of transmission and on the natural history of the infection, the model predicts: a) the infection will be self-sustaining in the heterosexual as in the homosexual population, b) the equilibrium prevalence of HTLV-III infection may attain 500-800 per 1000 among promiscuous male homosexuals and female prostitutes: 1 to 5 per 1000 among non-promiscuous heterosexual males and females: and 8 to 15 per 1000 overall, c) these equilibria will be reached in about 10 years among the promiscuous classes, but not for 40 years among the less promiscuous, d) this implies 20,000 to 40,000 deaths from AIDS per year in the U.K., e) these estimates will be modified by behaviour changes in the population as a whole, responding to fear of infection and to health-education approaches, but substantial control will depend upon the production of a vaccine and its preferential use in the promiscuous classes.\n      </p>", "This article assesses AIDS from a family perspective. The problem of AIDS in children and the particular needs of their families are discussed.

Classes within-schools were designated as either intervention classes or nonintervention classes. Students in intervention classes received 3 class periods of AIDS instruction with a newly developed curriculum. Students in nonintervention classes did not receive any special AIDS instruction. All students completed a pretest and posttest AIDS knowledge and attitude survey. The results indicated that AIDS instruction classes demonstrated a significant knowledge-advantage, as well as change in attitudes (e.g., reflecting greater tolerance for attending class with students who may have AIDS or HIV infection).\n      </p>", "This paper examines the belief that AIDS originated in Haiti. More specifically, this paper addresses how this belief affected Haitians living in North America, and how this belief complicated efforts to prevent AIDS among Haitians.

A total of 412 references were listed between 1983 and the end of 1987. Examination of the quantitative increase of articles over these years shows that, while references to AIDS and/or HIV infection \u2013 referred to as 'AIDS' for brevity \u2013 increased by about one third per year, the number of papers treating ethical problems linked to AIDS doubled each year. This increase makes it clear that these problems are important and pressing, that they are evolving rapidly and can be given no easy solution. After reading and analysis of accessible articles in readily comprehensible languages, the different themes can be classified in two categories: 1 \u2013 Measures intended to protect society (starting with the most coercive) \u2013 quarantine and isolation; \u2013 discriminatory measures concerning specific groups; \u2013 non-respect of the confidential nature of medical information; \u2013 application of the penal code; \u2013 screening; \u2013 obligatory declaration and registration; \u2013 testing of blood given by donors; \u2013 vaccination and medical innovations, therapeutic assays; \u2013 inforation, education. 2 \u2013 Measures intended to protect the individual \u2013 fundamental rights of the patient: his/her right to confidentiality, to information and to treatment; \u2013 civil rights: civil liberty, right to education, right to work, etc... \u2013 rights of the healthy individual: right of those in contact with the patients, safety of hospital staff, of those receiving blood-transfusions, etc... The legislation adopted in the various countries and the main opinions to be found in these articles are listed and analysed, and for each particular theme it is possible to refer to a list of the 232 most important articles. While the debate seems to concentrate on the conflict between the right of society to protect itself against the spread of infection and the 'civil' rights of the infected minorities, our conclusion tends to reduce this antagonism, showing that, particularly as far as the confidential nature of medical information is concerned, measures intended to protect the individual also protect society.\n      </p>", "Three hundred ninety-eight randomly selected Nigerian adolescents were surveyed using well structured questionnaires to collect all information on their knowledge, attitude, beliefs and practice regarding AIDS. The questionnaires were carefully administered and analysed. Most of the respondents, aged 10-20 years, were born in metropolitan cities (83.9%), grew up in such cities (93.2%) and have always lived in them (92.7%). Only 37.9% of them knew the causative agent of AIDS, although 96% claimed to have heard of the disease called AIDS. Seventeen percent (17%) knew all the important routes of transmission and 19.1% identified the groups at high risk for contracting AIDS. Limited knowledge and practice of preventive measures were demonstrated. AIDS was identified as a serious health problem for the world but not yet for Nigeria. Nigerian urban youths have been found to be sexually active with multiple sexual partners. Their knowledge of AIDS is limited, and few of them practice preventive measures. They should, thus, be regarded as a high risk group. Coordinated health education programmes coupled with communication and involvement of these youths should be urgently undertaken.\n      </p>", "We studied the incidence of TB and TB-AIDS in the area served by \"La Fe\" hospital in Valencia. We also studied the different evolution of the incidence of TB and TB-AIDS during the 1985-1989 period. We noticed the progressive increase of the incidence of TB in AIDS patients, while the incidence of TB without AIDS remained the same.\n      </p>", "The origin of the unusual incubation period distribution in the development of AIDS is largely unresolved. A key factor in understanding the observed distribution of latency periods, as well as the occurrence of infected individuals not developing AIDS at all, is the dynamics of the long-lasting struggle between HIV and the immune system. Using a computer simulation, we study the diversification of viral genomes under mutation and the selective pressure of the immune system. In non-HIV infections, vast spreading of viral genomes in genome space usually does not take place. In the case of an HIV infection, this may occur, as the virus successively weakens the immune system by the depletion of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells. In a sequence space framework, this leads to a dynamically induced percolation transition, corresponding to the onset of AIDS. As a result, we obtain a prolonged shape of the incubation period distribution, as well as a finite fraction of non-progressors that do not develop AIDS, comparing well with results from recent clinical research.\n      </p>", "The authors present the AIDS cases (CDC '93) observed in Brescia from 1983 to 1994. They observed 1189 subjects (M 84%, F 16%) with a mean age of 32.7 years (intra-venous drug users 75.1%, heterosexuals 14%, homosexuals 9.6%). The mean survival observed was 56.7 weeks from the diagnosis of AIDS (mortality per year 78%). The most frequent AIDS-defining events were Visceral Candidiasis, P. carinii Pneumonia (PCP) and Neurotoxoplasmosis, while the longest and shortest mean survival was for Kaposi's Sarcoma (89 weeks) and Wasting Syndrome (8.4). The mean value of CD4+ lymphocyte counts on AIDS diagnosis was 72.6/\u03bcl (1166 cases) and the highest and lowest were in non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL; 147.6/\u03bcl) and Cryptosporidiosis (18.8/\u03bcl). Antiretroviral therapy had been given for at least a month in 41.4% subjects (mean treatment duration of 74.8 weeks). The Cox model has demonstrated the favourable effect on survival of high CD4+ lymphocyte counts on diagnosis, antiretroviral therapy, the diagnosis of Tuberculosis (TBC) and PCP as initial markers and the diagnosis of TBC, PCP or Cytomegalovirus infection (CMV) during the entire clinical evolution. Moreover, the unfavourable effect of high age, diagnosis of Progressive Multifocal Leucoencephalopathy (PML), Wasting Syndrome and NHL as initial markers and diagnosis of PML or NHL in any moment of the disease has been demonstrated.\n      </p>", "Information from 12 studies is combined to estimate the AIDS incubation distribution with greater precision than is possible from a single study. The analysis uses a hierarchy of parametric models based on a four-parameter generalized F distribution. This general model contains four standard two-parameter distributions as special cases. The cases are the Weibull, gamma, log-logistic, lognormal distributions. These four special cases subsume three distinct asymptotic hazard behaviors. As time increases beyond the median of approximately 10 years, the hazard can increase to infinity (Weibull), can plateau at some constant level (gamma), or can decrease to zero (log-logistic and lognormal). The Weibull, gamma and 'log-logistic distributions' which represent the three distinct asymptotic hazard behaviors, all fit the data as well as the generalized F distribution at the 25 percent significance level. Hence, we conclude that incubation data is still too limited to ascertain the specific hazard assumption that should be utilized in studies of the AIDS epidemic. Accordingly, efforts to model the AIDS epidemic (e.g., back-calculation approaches) should allow the incubation distribution to take several forms to adequately represent HIV estimation uncertainty. It is recommended that, at a minimum, the specific Weibull, gamma and log-logistic distributions estimated in this meta-analysis should all be used in modeling the AIDS epidemic, to reflect this uncertainty.\n      </p>", "The study presented here is an investigation of the importance of social interactions to perceptions of the risk of AIDS, and explores spousal communication about the AIDS epidemic in rural Malawi. A fixedeffects analysis based on longitudinal data collected in 1998 and 2001 shows that social interactions on the subject of HIV/AIDS have significant and substantial effects on respondents' perceptions of the risk of HIV/AIDS, even after controlling for unobserved factors that affect the selection of social networks. These effects are more complex than previously thought. The dominant mechanisms-social learning and social influence-are found to vary by sex and by region, because of regional variations in the marriage pattern and the resulting implications for the formation of local social networks. The conclusion of the study is that rather than fostering denial and inaction, social interactions are an important vector of change in the face of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\n      </p>", "Objectives To assess the concurrent validity and responsiveness of the Health Utility Index 3 (HUB) in patients with advanced HIV/AIDS, and to determine the responsiveness of this measure, the MOS-HIV and EQ-5D to HIV-related clinical events. Methods Data from the OPTIMA (OPTions In Management with Antiretrovirals) trial was analyzed. Two aspects of the validity of the HUI3 were considered: concurrent validity was evaluated using Spearman correlations with MOS-HIV component and summary scores. Responsiveness to AIDSdefining events (ADE) and all adverse events (our external change criterion) was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves. Results The study enrolled 368 patients (mean follow-up: 3.66 years); 82% had at least one severe adverse event and 27% had at least one ADE. The HUI3 scale and items showed good concurrent validity, with 85% of the expected relationships with the MOS-HIV subscales verified. The HUI3 was responsive to both adverse events (AUROC [95% CI]: 0.68 [0.57, 0.80]) and ADEs (0.62 [0.51, 0.74]). The EQ-5D was responsive to ADEs (0.66 [0.56,0.76]), but not responsive to adverse events (0.56 [0.46, 0.68]). Conclusion The HUI3 is a valid and responsive measure of the change in HRQoL associated with clinical events in an advanced HIV/AIDS population.\n      </p>", "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection was one of the most common opportunistic infections in AIDS patients, leading to blindness or life-threatening disease in about 40% of patients in the later stages of AIDS before highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In a retrospective multicenter study we investigated the incidence of CMV retinitis and organ involvement in Northern Italy before (1995 and 1996) and after the introduction of HAART (1997 and 1998) as well as the data regarding CMV antigenemia. We found a sharp drop in the incidence of CMV disease in AIDS patients as well as a decline in the incidence of relapses of CMV-disease after the widespread introduction of HAART. Moreover, there was a decrease in the incidence of antigenemia-positive cases in AIDS patients in the era of HAART and the median CMV viral load was significantly higher in patients who didn't receive HAART than in patients who received HAART (p = 0.001, t test).\n      </p>", "Behaviour change models in HIV prevention tend to consider that risky sexual behaviours reflect risk assessments and that by changing risk assessments behaviour can be changed. Risk assessment is however culturally constructed. Individuals use heuristics or bounded cognitive devices derived from broader cultural meaning systems to rationalize uncertainty. In this study, we identify some of the cultural heuristics used by migrant men in Goa, India to assess their risk of HIV infection from different sexual partners. Data derives from a series of in-depth interviews and a locally informed survey. Cultural heuristics identified include visual heuristics, heuristics of gender roles, vigilance and trust.

There were a total of 931 cases of hepatitis B in Zagreb in the period 1979-1995, the annual rate ranging from 3.1 to 15.4 per 10,000. The highest relative risk for hepatitis B for the 1979-1995 period was in the Pescenica district (Relative risk (RR): 1.4). There were 108 cases of HIV/AIDS diagnosed in Croatia in the period 1986-1996, with 34% from Zagreb. The highest relative risk for HIV/AIDS was within the Pescenica district (RR: 2.3). Pescenica had also a significantly higher incidence of hepatitis B when compared to other districts (p = 0.005). The cumulative incidence of hepatitis B in Zagreb was directly related to levels of neighborhood discomfort as determined by an index including unemployment, inflation and housing conditions (p = 0.005). This research demonstrates that the poor areas of the city with higher incidence of hepatitis B hold the greatest threat for the spread of HIV/AIDS.\n      </p>", "This article describes the use and value of 'memory boxes' that were created for South African children who had lost a parent to HIV/AIDS. The Memory Box Programme, an initiative of the Sinomlando Project, an oral history centre based at the School of Theology, University of Natal, was established in 2000 to respond to the emotional needs of children of families affected or infected by HIV/AIDS. The purpose of the memory boxes is to promote what psychologists call resilience in these children. Sharing of memories of the sick person or of the deceased, and recording those memories and storing them in a memory box, helps family members to break the silence about disease or death. The memory boxes create a space to talk about sickness and death and in this way help families to cope with the loss of the loved person. The article describes the process of creating memory boxes in partnership with family members in Durban, and discusses the value of this type of memory work.\n      </p>", "The paper presents a preliminary attempt to predict the numbers of AIDS cases in the Community of Madrid (CAM) up to 1992.

The data are drawn from in-depth interviews with 16 nurses working as counsellors in their spare time in an antenatal trial of prevention of mother-to-child transmission, five local HIV/AIDS counsellors and two medical doctors, whose counselling experience ranged from less than six months to nine years. Informed choice of infant feeding method by HIV-infected women, as recommended by UNAIDS/WHO/UNICEF Guidelines, was seriously compromised by the actual advice given, directive counselling, lack of time to cope with a positive HIV test result, and lack of follow-up support, regardless of socio-economic status. Infant feeding options were not always accurately explained, but counsellors believed most women had little choice but to breastfeed and were unlikely to exclusively breastfeed, despite advice. It was apparent that the risks and benefits of the options open to HIV-infected women were complicated for the counsellors, not only the women. Counsellors needed additional training in non-directive counselling and infant feeding options to ensure a better quality of advice-giving and support to follow-up women at home. /// Cette recherche analyse les conseils donn\u00e9s par les consultants aux femmes enceintes s\u00e9ropositives sur l'alimentation des nourrisons \u00e0 Moshi, Tanzanie, les facteurs pouvant selon eux influencer le choix des femmes et leur r\u00f4le dans ces d\u00e9cisions.

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the completeness of AIDS cases reported and the quality of AIDS death certification in an Italian Region (Tuscany, about 3,500,000 inhabitants). The 737 AIDS cases reported to RAIDS as residents in Tuscany (1987-91) were cross-linked (key link: name and date of birth) with the data of the Region (RMR). For the residents in Tuscany deceased with a 279.1 death diagnosis (the code for AIDS deaths stated by the Italian Census Bureau) and not reported to RAIDS as AIDS cases, the clinical records were reviewed to check whether the diagnosis fitted the 1987-CDC diagnostic criteria. This study shows that there is a high completeness (97-98%) of the AIDS cases resident in Tuscany, reported to the RAIDS. The quality of RAIDS data is not as good with regard to life status assessment 23% of under-reporting of death). In Tuscany, the death certification for AIDS (code 279.1 of ICD IX) has a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity around 100% in comparison to RAIDS. About 50% of 'false negatives' in death certification are due to causes of death presumably unrelated to HIV infection.

The objective was to develop an extension of the back-calculation model by including pre-AIDS mortality and to estimate HIV prevalence in France. Our previous back-calculation model was modified to take into account the probability of survival for HIV-infected individual using the relative risk to die at different period for an HIV-infected person versus the general population (\u03c8). AIDS cases reported to InVS (Institut de Veille Sanitaire) until March 2003 were back-calculated to estimate HIV incidence until December 2000. AIDS deaths occurring until December 2000 were used to obtain HIV prevalence in 2000. Plausible intervals were calculated taking into account uncertainties on AIDS incubation time. Taking into account pre-AIDS mortality increased the goodness-of-fit of the model to the data. The relative risk, \u03c8, was estimated as 3 for homo-bisexual men, haemophiliacs and transfused cases, 10 for intravenous drug users, and 4 for heterosexual cases, with no difference over period. HIV prevalence in 2000 was estimated as 88,200 (with a plausible interval of 52,300-168,000), versus 78,200 when mortality was not considered. Pre-AIDS mortality estimates show the amount of this mortality during the era of HAART but also evidenced its existence before HAART. Taking into account pre-AIDS mortality of HIV-infected person in the back-calculation model increased the estimated HIV prevalence.\n      </p>", "Objective. To compare differences in AIDS patients' 30-day mortality and satisfaction with care in dedicated AIDS units, scattered-bed units in hospitals with and without dedicated AIDS units, and in magnet hospitals known to provide good nursing care. Methods. Data were obtained on 1,205 consecutively admitted patients in 40 units in 20 hospitals and on 820 of their nurses. Results. Mortality was lower and satisfaction was higher for AIDS patients in dedicated AIDS units and in nursing magnet hospitals. Primary nursing, end-of-life care counseling, and discharge planning were also more common. Higher nurse to patient ratios and AIDS physician specialty services were strongly associated with lower mortality. Patient satisfaction was strongly associated with organizational control of care by bedside nurses. Homosexuals were more likely to be admitted to dedicated AIDS units, which largely explains the under-representation of minorities and women. Conclusions. Dedicated AIDS units and magnet hospitals offer important benefits to AIDS patients, including lower odds on dying within 30 days of admission, higher patient satisfaction, and care meeting professional standards. Better nurse staffing, AIDS physician specialty services, and more organizational control by bedside nurses improve patient outcomes.\n      </p>", "When an adult contracts AIDS, it may be particularly difficult to go to family for help because it may also involve the disclosure of homosexuality.

The sample included health and social service providers, HIV positive men and women, and men and women with same sex partners in urban and rural Jamaica. A strong and consistent relationship between homophobia and HIV/AIDS-related stigma was reported, but the relationship varied according to geographic location, social class, gender, and skin colour (complexion)--to the extent that this coincided with class. Stigma against people living with HIV/AIDS and homosexuality was implicated in low levels of use of HIV testing, treatment and care services and the reluctance of HIV positive people to reveal their serostatus to their sexual partners.

In agreement with these data, knowledge was better about AIDS than about sexuality. Risk perception was positively influenced by the AIDS-related knowledge for called youth and a greater intolerance towards infected people was observed among the less educated and the less AIDS-aware subjects. On average 46% of the called up young men and 74% of recruits declared to be sexually active: among these, the mean age at the first sexual intercourse was 16, over 60% declared to have had multiple partners, over 30% unknown partners and over 30% didn't use condoms; 20% of called up and 38% of recruits indicated 2 or 3 risk behaviours. Factors determining sex-related risks were different according to the behaviour and the considered group. These results suggest that it is important for young people to be well informed about sex and AIDS before the beginning of sexual activity, if possible during compulsory school.\n      </p>", "Persons with AIDS (PWAs), who are marked by a diminution of their immune systems, are catapulted into a very different social reality. Thus, special attention is given to the necessity for legal empowerment and occupational contagion in the delivery of health care services by medical professionals. Unfortunately, choices made by some members of the medical community (and by representatives of other social organizations dealing with PWAs) promote economic and political interests. Thus, this paper concludes that the medical system (and related service organizations) are now fraught with \"cracks,\" through which many individuals fall, and it is at this system's level that ethical quandaries emerge as problems. Furthermore, it is suggested that the quality of our society may well be judged by the ways in which we deal with the ethical dilemmas that arise in the delivery of health care to persons with AIDS.\n      </p>", "Many AIDS-related issues are polarised. At the social level, civil rights or liberties are seen as being in conflict with general utility, and an analogous distinction is often assumed to exist at the one-to-one, individual level at which doctors work. In this paper the latter form of the distinction is argued to be false. By seeing autonomy as part of welfare, doctors can think more directly about such issues as paternalism, confidentiality, and consent. A number of these issues are discussed in the light of the revised conception of welfare, in the form of simplified case studies.\n      </p>", "The goal of the current study was to explore notions of masculinity and their linkages to HIV/AIDS among Owambo men and women in Namibia, where an estimated one-fifth of 15-49 year-olds have acquired HIV. Thirteen open-ended interviews and three focus groups were conducted with 50 male and female participants aged 19-50 in rural and urban Namibia. Qualitative analysis revealed six central themes: the evolving meanings of masculinity, power dynamics between men and women, women as active agents, the tension between formal and informal education and HIV transmission, alcohol and masculinity, and the blending of masculinity and explanations of HIV and AIDS. The findings suggest both direct and indirect linkages between notions of masculinity and AIDS, and highlight the need for prevention efforts that focus on providing alternative avenues for attaining culturally recognized markers of masculinity. /// L'objectif de cette \u00e9tude \u00e9tait d'explorer les notions de masculinit\u00e9 et leurs liens avec le VIH/sida chez les hommes et les femmes Owambo de Namibie, o\u00f9 l'on estime que un cinqui\u00e8me des personnes de 15 \u00e0 49 ans sont infect\u00e9es par le VIH.

We analyzed the official mortality data for Italy: the most recent data available being from 1990. General mortality trends show that while mortality among young women is still decreasing (i.e. from a standardized rate of 83.8 per 100,000 in 1980 to 68.4 in 1990), mortality among young men began to rise in the mid-1980s, after a steady decrease over many years. Among the 25-34 year olds, however, this reversal in trend is more marked, notwithstanding a decrease or stabilization in most major causes of death. In fact it coincides with the appearance and spread of AIDS in Italy, which has affected young men in particular. (The peak age group for AIDS deaths is the 25-34 year olds). Mortality data from 1990 reveal that AIDS is the fourth leading cause of death in Italy among men between the ages of 25 and 44 years. Among 25-34 year-old men, however, AIDS is the second leading cause of death, after road accidents. AIDS also contributes greatly to the general mortality in individual regions, both among 25-44 year-old men (Lombardy, Liguria, Lazio, Emilia-Romagna, Tuscany), and especially among 25-34 year-old men (Lombardy, Liguria, Lazio, Sardinia, where it is the number one cause of death, Emilia-Romagna, Tuscany, and Veneto, where it is the number two cause of death).\n      </p>", "During a stay in South Africa in 2002-2003, we learned that public sector nurses dealt with serious community and workplace impacts from the HIV/AIDS epidemic; and were reluctant to report occupational exposures to HIV or take a short-course of antiretroviral post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent HIV infection. In May 2003, in South Africa's KwaZulu Natal province, we explored perspectives of 34 public hospital nurses in nine group interviews on workplace safety; the impact of HIV/AIDS on nurses' work environments; and, hospital and government policy. The information they provided illustrates that the views of nurses are vitally important to policy-making. We conclude that seeking nurses' views and involving them in policy processes could contribute to worker health, to addressing the dramatic shortage of nurses, recently identified as the largest threat to providing HIV/AIDS treatment in sub-Saharan Africa, and to improving quality of care.\n      </p>", "One of the more striking features of international responses to HIV/AIDS has been the framing of the pandemic in terms of security. But while a growing literature attempts to establish and explain putative linkages between HIV / AIDS and security, little work has addressed HIV / AIDS-security discourse with critical reflexivity or applied such an approach to particular cases. This article makes contributions in both these areas, locating discussion in the context of post-Cold War and post-9/11 shifts in geopolitics and biopolitics. It argues that while analyses employing securitization theory and biopolitics have advanced critical understanding of HIV / AIDS and security, a more historicized approach and greater attention to geopolitics and gender are required. The article then reviews increasing US strategic interest in Africa and considers the emergence of particular formations of geopolitics and biopolitics around HIV / AIDS and security in the relationship between the US and Nigeria, drawing particular attention to the role of US-based think tanks. It shows how US strategic discourse has targeted the Nigerian state not just as a partner in energy security and counter-terrorism, but also as a key locale in the 'next wave' of HIV / AIDS. The article describes HIV / AIDS interventions that the US is supporting in Nigeria, identifies connections between HIV / AIDS relief and questions of security and gender, and considers some implications of the convergence of multiple security logics on Nigeria. The article concludes with reference to the political sociology of HIV / AIDS relief and the era of formal colonialism.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

This report also elaborates those cultural, social, and political factors involved in China's attempt to manage its growing HIV epidemic. Contemporary attitudes toward sexuality in China which impinge upon such management, as revealed through ethnographic interviews, are reviewed. Data from the First Sino-American Management of HIV Disease Symposium (to which the author was a delegate) are also blended with the ethnographic material to further clarify the cultural and epidemiologic status of HIV/AIDS in China.

Method The study group included patients registered in the HIV Cancer clinic at the Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH), Mumbai, which is the largest tertiary referral cancer center in India. We used the gender and age-specific proportions of each cancer site of the year 2002 that was recorded in the Hospital Cancer Registry to estimate an expected number of various cancer sites among HIV positive cancer patients during the period 2001\u20132005. The observed number of site-specific cancer cases was divided by the expected number to obtain proportional incidence ratio (PIR). Results No case of Kaposi's sarcoma was observed. Increased proportion of non- Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) was observed (PIR in males = 17.1, 95% CI 13.33-21.84, females = 10.3, 95% CI 6.10-17.41). In males, PIR was increased for anal cancer (PIR = 10.3, 95% CI 4.30\u201324.83), Hodgkin's disease, testicular cancer, colon cancer, and few head and neck cancer sites. Among females, the PIRs for cervical cancer (PIR = 4.1, 95% CI 2.90\u20135.75), vaginal cancer (PIR = 7.7, 95% CI 2.48\u201323.85), and anal cancer (PIR = 6.5, 95% CI 0.91\u20135.88) were increased. Conclusions The absence of Kaposi's sarcoma and increased PIRs for certain non \u2013AIDS defining cancers among HIV infected cancer cases indicates a different spectrum of HIV associated malignancies in this region. The raised PIR for cervical cancer emphasizes the urgent need for screening programs for cervical cancer among HIV infected individuals in India.\n      </p>", "Note from Dr. Merle A. Sande - Progressive dementia has been recognized as a complication of human immunodeficiency virus infection almost since the beginning of the epidemic. To many infectious diseases clinicians, however, the AIDS dementia complex remains ambiguous, and the clinical approach to this problem is less clearly defined than that for other infection-associated syndromes. Dr. Richard W. Price and his colleagues at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center have, to a large extent, been responsible for defining this entity. In this AIDS Commentary they present their views of the current state of knowledge regarding the etiology, clinical presentation, and diagnostic and ther apeutic approaches to the AIDS dementia complex.\n      </p>", "Livelihood insecurity, HIV and AIDS, and environmental change, including high climate variability, have negatively impacted the southern African region for the last decade. It is increasingly evident that there is a complex interplay of factors shaping rural livelihoods at various scales. Recognition of the varied impacts of HIV and AIDS has led to development of a conceptual framework that utilises the 'AIDS Timeline' or 'Programming Matrix', which enables differential intervention strategies to be adopted depending on the dominant impacts and trends on livelihoods. This paper presents this approach and links it to case study material from two districts in Malawi and South Africa. The evidence suggests that although there are some areas where HIV and AIDS are mainstreamed into livelihood security interventions, this is not sufficient, as holistic environmental and social approaches are not adopted. This paper reflects on the fieldwork findings to link to the AIDS Timeline in support of appropriate interventions. At the same time, we highlight the urgency in addressing the meso-scale and adopting a holistic framework that addresses livelihood security from a range of angles, including the implications for the chronically ill, interactions with environment and the capacity to implement change.\n      </p>", "Questionnaires were mailed to a random sample of students at a university in Southern California. The results revealed that for the most part, students were engaging in few activities that would protect them from contracting the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Regression analyses were used to evaluate several variables related to sexual risktaking, i.e., condom use, number of sexual partners in the last three months, and casual sex. The most consistent predictors of cautious sexual behaviors were age at first intercourse, average number of partners per year, being female and using seatbelts while driving. Safer sexual practices were not influenced by religiosity or having had a course on human sexuality or religiosity. The findings lead us to conclude that AIDS-related education must not rely solely on programs designed to relay AIDS information only, but must also stress the value of certain lifestyle habits, social responsibility, and caution in face of risky activities.\n      </p>", "Black men suffer the highest rates of HIV infection in Alabama. However, little is known about the HIV risks of this sector of the population, primarily because the current public health focus is on women and children. The dearth of research on HIV risk among black men in Alabama is addressed by drawing on focus group, elicitation, and key informant data from an ongoing epidemiologic study on AIDS in that state. These hypothesis-generating qualitative interviews were used to identify three high-risk scenarios: \"sex for money or drugs\"; \"prison sex\"; and \"sneaky sex\" by married or nominally heterosexual men. It was found that covert and unprotected sex among bisexually active black men was commonplace for reasons that included prostitution, habituation to same-sex relations during incarceration, and the desire to maintain a facade of heterosexuality in homophobic communities. It was concluded that bisexual activity is highly correlated with secrecy and unprotected sex. The risks of bisexuality among black men are exacerbated by incarceration, homophobia, drug use, and the prison and public health focus on surveillance rather than prevention.\n      </p>", "Objective: to evaluate the psychometric performance of a new human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS)-targeted quality of life (QoL) instrument in asymptomatic HIV-seropositive individuals. Methods: 201 urban and rural, HIV-seropositive subjects were recruited to complete a 76-item pilot QoL measure developed using content provided in group process by seropositive individuals. Questionnaire responses from the full sample (n = 201) were used to identify dimensions and to reduce the number of items to 42. The responses to the retained items were then analysed for the asymptomatic subsample (n = 106). Results: 9 multi-item dimensions were identified: overall function (OF), sexual function (SF), disclosure worries (DW), health worries (HW), financial worries (FW), HIV mastery (HM), life satisfaction (LS), medication concerns (MC) and provider trust (PT). The responses by asymptomatic subjects (74% male, 64% non-White and 63% homosexual/bisexual) revealed no substantial floor or ceiling effects, except for the PT dimension (where 44% were found to have scored the highest score). The internal consistency coefficients (Cronbach's alphas) were between 0.80 and 0.89 for six dimensions. The coefficients were lower for the SF (0.52), HM (0.67) and MC (0.48) dimensions. Construct validity assessments, using self-reported HIV disease-severity and sociodemographic variables, revealed some significant relationships (p \u2264 0.05) for all dimensions except SF, MC and PT. Conclusions: the results suggested that five dimensions (OF, DW, HW, FW and LS) from the new instrument have good psychometric properties for asymptomatic HIV-seropositive individuals. These dimensions may be useful in the study of asymptomatic, seropositive individuals' QoL. Four dimensions (SF, HM, MC and PS) require additional refinement for this subpopulation.\n      </p>", "The study defines the epidemiological characteristics of HIV-infection in the population of Genoa and estimates the entity of AIDS-cancer association.

With support from local politicians and members of various government ministries, several self-styled guardians of tradition have emerged to form organizations that advocate and conduct regular virginity testing of girls. Reference to the current HIV/AIDS epidemic is central to calls for greater support of this practice. Drawing on original research among Zulu-speaking people in the periurban communities of Durban, this article examines the sociocultural construction of HIV/AIDS and locates the growing popularity of virginity testing within a gendered meaning-making process consistent with commonly held beliefs that the epidemic is the result of women being sexually \"out of control.\" With the social impact of AIDS starting to take its toll in the forms of increasing AIDS-related deaths and a growing population of orphans, I argue that virginity testing is an attempt to manage the epidemic by exerting greater control over women and their sexuality. In addition, virginity testing of girls helps to draw attention away from the role of men in the maturing epidemic, consideration of which has been conspicuously absent in the popular discourse on AIDS at all levels of South African society.\n      </p>", "Black women comprise 52% of women with AIDS, yet there is minimal development of prevention efforts geared to needs of black women. This paper presents the results of intensive group discussion with 28 lower-income black women and teenage girls in San Francisco examining patterns of sexual behavior. The comments of participants suggest that traditional sexual roles, which permit men to have sexual freedom but censure women for the same activities, are still operating in the black community. A major problem in relationships between men and women is the lack of effective communication about sexual practices, particularly the use of condoms when partners are not mutually monogamous. The communication difficulties are aggravated by imbalance of power between the sexes, as well as dramatic shifts in the economy of the black community. Suggestions are made for effective AIDS prevention programs, based on improved communication in the context of efforts to rebuild communities.\n      </p>", "In epidemiologic studies of infectious diseases, the times of infection may be known only up to an interval. A two-stage parametric regression model is proposed for the analysis of cohort studies during an epidemic in which the exact times of infection cannot be ascertained. The methods permit joint estimation of the effects of covariates both on the risk of infection and the risk of progression to clinical disease once infected. The methodology is applied to a cohort of hemophiliacs who were at risk of infection with the AIDS virus. It was found that hemophiliacs with severe Type A hemophilia were at highest risk of infection, and the risk of infection increased sharply in the early 1980s. Hemophiliacs who were over the age of 20 at infection were at higher risk of progression to AIDS than hemophiliacs who were under age 20. The estimate of the cumulative probability of developing AIDS within t years of infection (the incubation period distribution) for hemophiliacs over age 20 was 1 - exp(-.0021t2.516). Since follow-up in this cohort was restricted to about 10 years from infection, estimates of the incubation period distribution beyond 10 years depend on model extrapolation and should be interpreted cautiously.\n      </p>", "In 1986-87, when it could be no longer denied that women, and therefore, heterosexual men, were at risk for AIDS, the makers of mainstream media faced a difficult dilemma. How could they resolve their urge to represent women in the way patriarchy knows best, as culpable vector for the spread of disease, while at the same time perpetuating the myth that the middle-class, white male spectator need not worry about becoming infected? In the AIDS documentaries of this time, women were depicted as contained threats: an oxymoronic representation that allowed them to register simultaneously as iconographic site of danger and as easily controlled subject. In this analysis of four mainstream media documentaries which were made to address the issue of heterosexual transmission, I discuss how women's sexuality is contained and controlled through representation. Furthermore, I examine whether the attempt to construct control over anxiety about AIDS is in any way similar to other social controls over women.\n      </p>", "This study provides an original method of analysing maternal mortality in Brazzaville, based on all deaths collected in the mortuaries in August 1996. During the study period, a clinical examination of all cadavers brought to Brazzaville's three mortuaries was done, and the relatives who had delivered the bodies were interviewed on signs and symptoms preceding and the actual circumstances surrounding the deaths. A maternal mortality ratio of 652 per 100,000 was found in the age range 15-49 years, and the risk of death from all causes in women while pregnant, parturient or postpartum was estimated as double the baseline. The different indicators of risk of death attached to childbearing were shown to vary considerably according to age. In relative terms, the increase in all-cause risk of death was high for \"early\" pregnancies (estimated as nearly three fold below age 25), much more so for \"late\" pregnancies (nearly six fold above age 40), and much less for those pregnancies between these two age groups (less than two fold). In absolute terms, the excess risk of death associated with childbearing was maximum after (estimated at 40 per 1,000), and much lower before age 40 (5 to 6 per 1,000). In the age group most affected by AIDS (25 to 39 years), only 37% of all deaths in pregnant, parturient or postpartum women were from direct obstetric causes, versus about 60% before age 25 and 80% after age 40.

We apply the approach to data from an AIDS clinical trial comparing ZDV and placebo, in which CD4 count is the time-dependent auxiliary variable. To facilitate imputation, a joint model is developed for the data, which includes a hierarchical change-point model for CD4 counts and a time-dependent proportional hazards model for the time to AIDS. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are used to multiply impute event times for censored cases. The augmented data are then analyzed and the results combined using standard multiple-imputation techniques. A comparison of our multiple-imputation approach to simply analyzing the observed data indicates that multiple imputation leads to a small change in the estimated effect of ZDV and smaller estimated standard errors. A sensitivity analysis suggests that the qualitative findings are reproducible under a variety of imputation models. A simulation study indicates that improved efficiency over standard analyses and partial corrections for dependent censoring can result. An issue that arises with our approach, however, is whether the analysis of primary interest and the imputation model are compatible.\n      </p>", "Mycological, cultural and/or serological studies were performed on 98 patients hospitalized in the Department of Infectious Diseases of the Catholic University in Rome with diagnoses of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex (ARC) diseases. The incidence of mycoses was evaluated by retrospectively analyzing the results of mycological examinations and comparing them with clinical manifestations. The presence of concomitant bacterial, viral and parasitic infections was also examined. For epidemiological purposes, the study was extended to include the biotyping of all yeasts isolated from patients hospitalized between September 1988 and February 1989 in the same Department. Antimycotic susceptibility was also determined for the first yeast isolate obtained from each of these patients. Oral candidiasis (50 cases) caused by Candida albicans was the most frequent mycosis, followed by esophageal candidiasis (13 cases) and cryptococcosis (6 cases). Four out of the 6 cryptococcosis patients had meningeal involvement. Systemic candidiasis (2 cases) and aspergillosis (1 case) were less common. Biotyping of yeasts isolated between September 1988 and February 1989 with the killer system revealed type 377 to be the most common among the C. albicans isolates. It represented 70% of all the yeasts isolated.\n      </p>", "Although AIDS is a leading cause of death worldwide, the consequences of the pandemic are remarkably unequally distributed cross-nationally. This unequal global distribution of AIDS deaths should be of interest to sociologists because of the potential role of structural forces in accounting for these disparities. Yet, there has been relatively little sociological research on this topic. Using underutilized cross-national data on AIDS deaths, this study examines the macro-level sources of variation in AIDS death rates across 115 countries. The analysis focuses on secondary school enrollment as a key structural factor in reducing AIDS deaths. After controlling for the prevalence of HIV infection, secondary school enrollment has the second largest and most robust effect on AIDS death rates. Economic development also reduces AIDS death rates, but this effect is mediated by secondary school enrollment. Schooling matters partly because it reduces HIV prevalence, but education still continues to have a significant negative effect on AIDS deaths even after controlling for prevalence. The education effect is robust in a variety of sensitivity analyses. Ultimately, this study underscores the role of structural factors, particularly education, for understanding the AIDS crisis.\n      </p>", "As a sexually transmitted disease, AIDS spreads along social networks; consequently, it is reasonable to propose to utilize these networks in teaching people to avoid practices that put them at increased risk of contracting AIDS. Most obviously, homosexual men are both at relatively high risk of contracting AIDS, and in many urban areas have well crystallized community structures and high social connectivity. We present evidence suggesting that using such social networks can have the unanticipated consequence of reaching a set of men who are at relatively low risk. Evidently, there is great unobserved heterogeneity among the population in terms of risk, and while this heterogeneity is not captured by conventional measures of risk behavior, it is closely linked to network processes.\n      </p>", "This paper introduces the UNESCO By Children for Children book series, begun through the Growing up in Cities program. It describes how the book written by nine-year old Siphelele Ndlovu communicates how he learned to live with the fact that his mother is HIV-positive and places his experience in the context of local community life. While the narration of personal experience can foster personal resiliency, Siphelele told his story to strengthen understanding and reduce prejudice against people infected and affected by HIV and AIDS. Committed to filling a gap in HIV/AIDS education in South Africa, he wants to encourage HIV-infected caregivers to disclose their status to children in their care.\n      </p>", "The HIV epidemic is lowering fertility in sub-Saharan Africa. This decline in fertility appears to reflect a fall in the demand for children, and not any adverse physiological consequences of the disease, as it is matched by changes in the expressed preference for children and the use of contraception, and is not significantly correlated with biological markers of sub-fecundity. A fall in fertility lowers dependency ratios and, for a given savings rate, increases future capital per person. These two effects more than offset the loss of prime working age adults and reduced human capital of orphaned children brought by the epidemic, allowing 27 of the nations of sub-Saharan Africa to cumulatively spend US$ 650 billion, or $5100 per dying adult AIDS victim, on patient care without harming the welfare of future generations. In sum, the behavioral response to the HIV epidemic creates the material resources to fight it.\n      </p>", "photovoice is a method in which participants use photography to identify, express, and disseminate their experiences. We conducted photovoice projects with women living with HIV/AIDS (N=21) to explore opportunities and challenges associated with the method. Photovoice provided a means to achieve two key principles of ethical public health practice: It gives participants opportunities to define their health priorities, and facilitates participant empowerment. Ethical challenges that were encountered related to exposing, through photographs, one's identity as living with HIV/AIDS, illicit activities, and other people. We discuss lessons learned for future practice to maximize the ethical opportunities and manage the challenges associated with using photovoice as an HIV-related CBPR strategy.\n      </p>", "Applied anthropologists have unique opportunities to use their skills as ethnographers in the fight against HIV infection and AIDS.

Since there is currently no chemical cure or vaccine for the AIDS virus, the only weapons available for prevention are public information and education. This study assesses the role of advertising in disseminating information during the AIDS crisis by interviewing the state AIDS coordinators in each of the 48 contiguous United States. The results of the study summarize what the states are currently doing with their AIDS advertising campaigns. Additionally, state AIDS coordinators' perceptions are presented on advertising's role during the AIDS crisis, and what can be done to improve current AIDS advertising campaigns. Finally, implications for public policy makers are discussed.\n      </p>", "Note from Dr. Merle A. Sande-The number of reported cases of disseminated histoplasmosis in individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus is increasing, and disseminated histoplasmosis now constitutes one of the critera for establishing a diagnosis of AIDS. Initial infection (inhalation of infected spores) usually takes place in areas along river valleys in the eastern United States. However, because the infection may have occurred during a brief visit to an endemic area in the distant past and is often asymptomatic, historical epidemiological data are often vague or inaccurate. Thus, the physician must consider a diagnosis of histoplasmosis in a member of a group at high risk for AIDS, even though the patient resides in a nonendemic area. Dr. John R. Graybill has a long and distinguished career studying human mycoses. We have asked Dr. Graybill to share with us his thoughts on current approaches to the diagnosis of and therapy for this often rapidly fatal disease.\n      </p>", "Objectives: The revision of the case definition for AIDS within a given observation period causes discontinuity points on the epidemic curve to which back-calculation procedures can be sensitive. The aim of this work is to characterize the impact of the 1993 European revision of AIDS case definition and to evaluate the degree of distortion by which back-calculation estimates obtained on Italian data are affected. Methods: The back-calculation procedure used, is a generalization of standard methods for estimating and projecting the AIDS epidemic. Age at onset of HIV infection, incubation time distribution, susceptible population and competitive non-AIDS mortality rates for infected persons are included in the estimation process. Results: Back-calculation estimates resulted to be sensitive to the discontinuity point that the 1993 revision of AIDS case definition induced on the epidemic curve. The resulting effect is a tendency to overestimate HIV incidence in recent years by 20-40%. The maximum effect was found using data with end of AIDS cases at December 1993. The overestimation is a transient effect, that is, it is expected to almost disappear in 1995-1996. Conclusions: The introduction of the 1993 European revision of AIDS case definition caused distortion of back-calculation estimates in Italy, leading to overestimate incidence and prevalence of HIV infection for recent years. It is believed that this effect has occurred in all countries that adopted the 1993 European revision of AIDS case definition, and its characterization is potentially useful for further changes of AIDS case definition in the future.\n      </p>", "In the second phase of the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Africa, women have taken the lead in providing community-based care for growing numbers of AIDS-affected people. This briefing explores the role of woman-as-caregiver and how attempts to construe caregiving as a form of leadership are misleading and ultimately undermining to the progress of women. The author draws attention to the need for women's leadership in AIDS activist organisations to challenge gender role expectations and inequalities that are reproduced and reinforced through the mass conscription of women into the service of caregiving.\n      </p>", "Sun, Liao, and Pagano (1999) proposed an interesting estimating equation approach to Cox regression with doubly censored data. Here we point out that a modification of their proposal leads to a multiple imputation approach, where the double censoring is reduced to single censoring by imputing for the censored initiating times. For each imputed data set one can take advantage of many existing techniques and software for singly censored data. Under the general framework of multiple imputation, the proposed method is simple to implement and can accommodate modeling issues such as model checking, which has not been adequately discussed previously in the literature for doubly censored data. Here we illustrate our method with an application to a formal goodness-of-fit test and a graphical check for the proportional hazards model for doubly censored data. We reanalyze a well-known AIDS data set.\n      </p>", "This paper reports on preliminary efforts to study at the census tract level the reciprocal relationships between AIDS and street crime, particularly prostitution and drug offenses and the prevalence of AIDS. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health provided the number of reported AIDS cases by census tract. The data on reported crimes and arrests, organized by reporting districts, came primarily from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and the Los Angeles City Police Department. Although this strategy needs replication and extension, the present findings suggest that sexual orientation, drug use and prostitution are useful risk variables at the census track level.\n      </p>", "Subjects aged 18-25 were surveyed regarding their beliefs about susceptibility to getting AIDS. Males generally viewed their probability of contracting AIDS under conditions of risky sexual behavior to be significantly lower than did females. Subjects' risk status was classified based on their recent self-reported condom use and the number of different partners with whom they had sexual intercourse during the past year. High-risk males perceived themselves to be at significantly lower risk than others who engaged in the same practices. High-risk females perceived themselves to be at equal risk to others who engaged in unprotected sex with numerous partners. Condom use was significantly related to subjects' socioeconomic status. These findings indicate that information about factors that augment risk for contracting HIV may, in and of itself, be insufficient to foster adequate preventive behaviors among many sexually active individuals.\n      </p>", "In much of HIV/AIDS prevention literature, women are depicted as passive and ill-equipped to confront the epidemic without external support to enhance their status, autonomy, and negotiation skills. This paper critically evaluates this depiction, using data from in-depth interviews conducted with married couples in rural Malawi. It focuses on the extent to which married women perceive that they have the ability to protect themselves from infection and on the prevention strategies that they employ. Interview data suggest that women have identified a range of contextually appropriate ways to resist exposure to HIV. These strategies include sitting and discussing the dangers of HIV/AIDS with their husbands; utilizing social networks for advice and as advocates; publicly confronting husbands' girlfriends; and divorcing men who do not adopt safer practices. These locally-formulated strategies are not likely to be followed consistently, and they may not be the most effective strategies in preventing husbands from straying or protecting women from contracting HIV/AIDS. Their existence, however, demonstrates that rural Malawian women believe that they have some agency to protect themselves; and, they are in fact using locally appropriate strategies to do so. /// Dans beaucoup de publications sur la pr\u00e9vention du VIH/Sida, les femmes sont repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es comme passives et mal pr\u00e9par\u00e9es face \u00e0 l'\u00e9pid\u00e9mie, sans soutien ext\u00e9rieur pour am\u00e9liorer leur statut, leur autonomie, et leurs aptitudes \u00e0 n\u00e9gocier.

These patients require medical care from physicians who are well trained and who are willing to provide that care. In 1985, we undertook a survey of 314 heterosexual and homosexual physicians in Los Angeles County to determine their willingness and perceived ability to care for patients with AIDS. This survey indicates that most physicians believe that special clinics staffed by physicians who have a particular expertise in caring for AIDS patients should be established. Many of the physicians surveyed indicated that concerns about the risk of contagion with AIDS is a deterrent to treating AIDS patients. Current evidence indicates this concern is unfounded. Both heterosexual and homosexual physicians indicated a lack of medical knowledge and experience regarding the opportunistic infections and cancers that are associated with AIDS, although many physicians in both groups expressed a desire to receive more training in this regard. Our survey indicates that there is a definite need for more clinically based training opportunities for physicians who would like to provide care for AIDS patients. If such training were to become available, it is likely that sufficient numbers of physicians would be willing to care for AIDS patients.\n      </p>", "Two well-cited studies (Fisher, 1980; Schwartz, 1973) have suggested that people with negative emotional orientations toward sexuality (i.e., \"erotophobia\" or \"sex guilt\") have difficulty learning contraceptive information. However, a recent laboratory study (Goldfarb, Gerrard, Gibbons, &amp; Plante, 1988) has raised doubts about this conclusion by demonstrating that erotophobic women can learn contraceptive information if they are exposed to it. The current study was designed to further clarify the relationship between emotional orientation toward sex and ability to learn sexually relevant material. Specifically, it compared pretest and post-test knowledge of contraception and AIDS in erotophobic and erotophilic students in a university class on human reproduction. While the results indicated that male erotophobics initially knew less, there were no knowledge differences between males and females or erotophobics and erotophilics at the end of the course. Thus, these results support the conclusion that erotophobics are capable of learning sexual material if they are exposed to it. The implications of these results for educational strategies for decreasing unplanned pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases are discussed.\n      </p>", "Mycobacterium genavense is a frequently missed agent of disseminated disease in AIDS patients. The increasing frequency with which such organism is being isolated in Italy suggested a comparison of local survey with data reported in literature. Isolates presumed to belong to the species M. genavense were centralized and identified by means of genomic sequencing and/or HPLC analysis of cell wall mycolic acids; clinical data were obtained from relevant patients' record and collected using a proper questionnaire. In 24 cases in which this organism has been isolated in Italy M. genavense was grown, prevalently from blood, in liquid medium after an average of six weeks of incubation. In overwhelming majority, patients were males, presented other opportunistic diseases and were characterized by very low ${\\rm CD}_{4}^{+}$ counts (average 23/\u03bcl); most frequent symptoms were fever, anemia and weight loss. All but two patients, who died before the mycobacterial infection was diagnosed, were treated with at least three drugs; the mean survival was close to one year. A review of literature reports revealed a wide overlapping of clinical and microbiological features.\n      </p>", "Until very recently, researchers paid little attention to sex or gender issues in HIV / AIDS. When differences between females and males on health matters were considered at all the focus was clearly on womens' reproductive lives and not on factors affecting the spread of the disease. There was hardly any consideration of the influence of inequalities on the spread of HIV / AIDS and on outcomes of infection between the sexes. Hitherto, health policies and programmes focused on biological aspects of diagnosis, treatment and prevention. In this paper, the author seeks to provide an understanding of the social factors as well as identification of the capacity of human rights to develop an effective response to the disease.
