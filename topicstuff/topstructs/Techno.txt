Die Analyse des musikalischen und zeitlich-sozialen Wirkungspotentials (Hans Robert Jau\u00df) von Techno-Tracks und Clubkultur offenbart ein paradoxes Bild: Im schnellen Techno-Tanz ergibt sich durch musikalisches und t\u00e4nzerisches Gleichma\u00df die M\u00f6glichkeit, in einer stets schneller werdenden Welt Momente der Entschleunigung zu erleben. Die Beschleunigung wird mit ihrem eigenen Produkt, dem Tempo, \u00fcberlistet. /// In this article I discuss certain sociological and aesthetical dimensions of techno and its perception. My starting point is the question, if there is a potential of sociopolitical resistance in this culture - a discussion, which divides the scholarly world in two parts up to day. While most scholars, like Peter Wicke, evaluate techno as a merely hedonistic and economically highly organised movement, only few believe in the (micro)political power of technoid DJ culture (e.g. Ulf Poschardt following an approach deeply influenced by Foucault). My article suggests another solution of this problem: I choose a completely different approach which is derived from the 'sociology of time' by Hartmut Rosa and his theory of the speeding-up (Beschleunigung) of social time (2005). Following Rosa's main idea, that modern societies organise power by accelerating all kinds of processes in life, I see \"time\" as a fundamental link between the aesthetical dimension of the high-speed music 'techno' and its social function. Is techno just a symptom of this development, as Rosa believes? My analysis of the perceptive dimensions of time in techno music and club culture (with the methods of reception-theory of Hans Robert Jau\u00df) shows its different time layers and their complex interrelationships, which leads to the result, that techno has the potential to stop the permanent speeding-up, e.g. by means of a constant tempo (Gleichma\u00df) on a high speed level. Thus the perception of techno tends to overcome the permanent speeding-up of social time: it is a strategy of time appropriation. However, this highly individual way of 'time resistance' on a high-speed level does not lead to a social movement nor does it change the social time concepts outside the club, as techno is deeply dependent on the time processes and its produced speed. Therefore I call ravers 'parasites of time', living in an ambivalent mode between resistance against and alliance with the time concepts reigning outside the club. /// U \u010dlanku se raspravlja o nekim sociolo\u0161kim i esteti\u010dkim dimenzijama tehno glazbe i njezine percepcije.

The argument first surveys recent accounts of intellectual property law's responses to sound recording technologies, then historicises the modern discourse of technology, which subtends such responses, as a fetish of industrial capitalism conditioned by \"Frankenstein\". The increasing ubiquity of cinematic \"Frankenstein\" adaptations in the latter two decades of the twentieth century outlines the popular cultural milieu in which Detroit techno developed its futuristic aesthetic, and which provided subsequent dance music producers with samples that contributed to techno's popularisation.

Our objectives include demonstrating the impact of key parameters on the overall process economics (e.g., plant capacity, raw material pricing, and yield) and comparing how next-generation technologies and fuels will differ from today's technologies. The commercialized processes and corresponding economics presented here include corn-based ethanol, sugarcane-based ethanol, and soy-based biodiesel. While actual full-scale economic data are available for these processes, they have also been modeled using detailed process simulation. For future biofuel technologies, detailed techno-economic data exist for cellulosic ethanol from both biochemical and thermochemical conversion. In addition, similar techno-economic models have been created for n-butanol production based on publicly available literature data. Key technical and economic challenges facing all of these biofuels are discussed.\n      </p>", "In assessing the American character of a musical genre that has only become part of American popular culture in the past twenty years, one is likely to be misled. Certainly, there is a general agreement on the role played by black artists in Chicago, New York and Detroit. But that does not settle the question of the European influences that have gone into the making of this tradition. Techno and house would not have achieved their present fame and status without the subsequent extension of the genre in Europe. The very notion of establishing itself as a genre goes against the \"living spirit\" of the techno \"scene.\" Indeed, the ideology that drives it insists on transcending differences and overcoming boundaries, a priority that expresses itself in an aesthetics of collage, sampling and mixs. For those who support these claims, defining the origins of techno and setting it down on the map can only arrest the movement that animates it.\n      </p>", "This paper examines how Spanish techno-scientific discourses and practices shaped metropolitan Spanish and colonial Guinean bodies and identities. It focuses on the range of technologies of biopower - from fingerprinting and blood testing to racial and geographic discourses - that constituted Guinean bodies in ambivalent ways during two periods: the first decades of the 20th century, and the post-Civil War period of the Francoist regime. In the first decades of the 20th century, blood tests were imposed on the local population as a legal requirement for obtaining identity cards in colonial Guinea; the identity cards offered them a severely restricted citizen status, especially if they were female. Indeed, the new blood testing technologies played a key role in efforts to control, reform and identify 'natives', less as subjects than as labouring bodies. During Franco's dictatorship, following the end of the Spanish Civil War (1939), the colonies became a space for the reconstruction of a unified Spanish national identity through two key strategies: 'detribalization' and 'hispanicization', which were carried out through a web of techno-scientific practices - in medicine and psychology as well as geography and anthropology - that included fingerprinting, blood testing, measurements of intelligence and racial discourses. Under the Franco regime, these practices not only justified violent, racist forms of exploitation, but were also used to stake a claim on Guinean colonial territories and bodies by emptying them of their existing identities and then reconstituting them under a single Spanish national identity.\n      </p>", "The integration of traditional (offline and face-to-face) and virtual ethnographic methods can aid researchers interested in developing understandings of relationships between online and offline cultural life, and examining the diffuse and sometimes global character of youth resistance.

The article also examines the structure of contemporary consortia in terms of techno-nationalism. It contends that Richard Samuels' notion of techno-national ideology fails to capture the nuances across MITI's international consortia which cover a range of technologies and forms of collaboration. These programs are not the efficient mechanisms for indigenizing foreign technologies that techno-national ideology suggests. Moreover, internationalization is not simply a token gesture.

It must be anticipated that in the early part of the period considered, a great part of the developments will be concentrated on improving the efficiency of the existing industry. Future developments will be dictated by techno-economic considerations. It is likely to be the middle 1980s before the scene is substantially changed by nuclear power and fluidics.

For power from DPC to be viable for MSEB, the latter's average tariff will have to keep rising by over 14.5 per cent per annum over the 20-year period.

In this article we analyze the theoretical implications of this explanation of the entrepreneurial state. A formal model is constructed of the relationship between state entrepreneurship, material consequences for the techno-bureaucratic elite, and important domestic and international constraints. We then use deductive methods to analyze the logic of state entrepreneurship. Among other things, we show how cyclical fluctuations in the global economy are reflected in constantly changing levels of state entrepreneurship, and we investigate the consequences of alternative kinds of dependency syndromes for histories of entrepreneurial substitution and for streams of benefits to the techno bureaucratic elite. It is demonstrated that there is an inverse relationship between the tendencies to reach stable levels of state entrepreneurship and the long-term potential for economic growth.\n      </p>", "Une approche techno-\u00e9conomique a guid\u00e9 l'\u00e9tude de l'assemblage lithique de Mauran, gisement du Pal\u00e9olithique moyen r\u00e9cent situ\u00e9 en Pi\u00e9mont pyr\u00e9n\u00e9en.

Location matters: by refusing to isolate the South from the West in the study of science, one leaves open the possibility of seeing multi-directional influences and channels simultaneously.

This \"techno-arrogance\" fails to recognize limitations on, and ramification of, attempted control of nature. An example of techno-arrogance is the flawed attempt to recover Pacific salmonid fisheries through technological application in the form of hatcheries. Countless salmon stocks have declined precipitously over the last century as a result of overfishing and widespread habitat destruction. A central feature of recovery efforts has been to build many hatcheries to produce large quantities of fish to restock streams. This approach addresses the symptoms but not the causes of the declines (an example of a halfway technology), because the habitats remain largely unsuitable for salmon. There are at least six reasons why the hatchery approach will ultimately fail: (1) data demonstrate that hatcheries are not solving the problem--salmon continue to decline despite decades of hatchery production; (2) hatcheries are costly to run, and divert resources from other efforts, such as habitat restoration; (3) hatcheries are not sustainable in the long term, requiring continual input of money and energy; (4) hatcheries are a genetically unsound approach to management that can adversely affect wild populations; (5) hatchery production leads to increased harvest of declining wild populations of salmon; and (6) hatcheries conceal from the public the truth of real salmon decline. I recommend that salmonid management turn from the symptoms to the causes of decline. Overharvest and habitat destruction must be directly addressed in a major, land-scape-level effort, on a scale comparable to the hatchery program, if salmonid fisheries are to remain a part of the ecological, recreational, commercial, and asthetic arenas in the long term.\n      </p>", "Quelle place faut-il donner aux analogies biologiques dans la th\u00e9orie de l'\u00e9conomie \u00e9volutionniste?

Les \u00e9conomistes et th\u00e9oriciens des sciences sociales n'ont par cons\u00e9quent pas d'autres alternatives que d'abandonner les mod\u00e8les des sciences de la nature, qu'ils savent m\u00e9caniques ou biologiques, pour construire leurs propres mod\u00e8les adapt\u00e9s aux syst\u00e8mes qu'ils \u00e9tudient. Une approche possible est la notion de paradigme techno-\u00e9conomique. /// This paper discusses the use of biological analogies in the theory of evolutionary economics. Whilst recognising the positive role of such analogies in stimulating an historical approach to economic systems and whilst also recognising that selective processes do indeed play an important part in the development of science and technology, the paper nevertheless argues that there are serious dangers in pushing the biological analogy too far. Not only is the social environment much more complex than the natural environment but the role of purposive intervention is altogether different in the evolution of technology. Economists and other social scientists therefore have no other alternative but to leave the models of the natural sciences, whether mechanical or biological, and develop their own models appropriate to the systems which they investigate. One such possible approach is the notion of the techno-economic paradigm.\n      </p>", "When scientific and technical work goes on within a formal organization, what effect, if any, does the organizational setting have on the production of facts and artefacts? This question has not yet been thoroughly explored in science and technology studies. Organizations are meso-level structures: located between the macro-level contingencies and the micro-level interactions that are known to affect the interpretive work of scientific and technical experts, organizations also play an important role. To encourage discussion about the role of organizations in knowledge production processes, I first draw on organization theory to demonstrate the ironic fact that organizations, necessary to produce, coordinate and maintain complex techno-scientific systems, also have irreducible and emergent effects on the way complex information is transmitted, communicated, processed and stored. Then, to illustrate empirically how organizations affect knowledge processes in the workplace, I reconsider data on engineering decisions at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), presenting a new interpretation that focuses on the role of the organization in knowledge production. In combination, organization theory and the empirical analysis suggest that certain structures, processes and transaction forms are generic across organizational settings, having ramifications for knowledge production by technologists and scientists in a variety of knowledge sites. In conclusion, I frame this discussion within the traditions of science and technology studies, suggesting the integrative, theory-building potential of future research that takes into account formal organizations as contemporary machineries of knowing.\n      </p>", "Inspired by hip-hop and techno-music, Darren Aronofsky applied various musical techniques and models of structuring typical of the aforementioned musical styles in his film \u03c0, which resulted in an innovative approach to editing and an inherently musical audiovisual style.\n      </p>", "El conocimiento no solamente es una construcci\u00f3n hist\u00f3rica, sino tambi\u00e9n uno de los principales factores de cambios sociales.

Several kinds of impacts arising from techno-scientific development are analyzed, taking as a reference the outbreak of the Industrial Revolution and romantic, scientist modernist, and technicist reaction to it. The aim is to set up a series of questions facing the fact that natural science develops faster and enjoys more financial support than the humanities and social policies. This has led to indifference towards ethical, economic, psychological, and spiritual issues, as well as towards social injustice. There are objects of scientific knowledge that are constructed regardless of an interaction with multiple social realities, and techniques that overlook shared values and hopes in their general orientation.

Le plus r\u00e9cent est celui de l'informatique. Lorsque le nouveau paradigme appara\u00eet, une tension se d\u00e9veloppe entre celui-ci et le cadre socio-institutionnel existant.

Sur base d'une \u00e9tude empirique men\u00e9e en 1999-2000 et 2005, nous montrons que le Royaume Uni est toujours loin, dans la plupart de l'\u00e9conomie, de voir un nouveau rapprochement cr\u00e9atif entre capital financier et capital industriel qui puisse laisser \u00e9merger le potentiel du nouveau paradigme. Nous tra\u00e7ons ensuite un bref aper\u00e7u de la forme qu'un tel rapprochement pourrait prendre. This paper assumes, with Perez (1983, 2002), that technological development follows a 'long wave' rhythm, in which new 'techno-economic paradigms' succeed one another at long intervals; the latest being the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) paradigm. When the new paradigm appears a tension develops between it and the existing socio-institutional framework. We argue that the financial and corporate governance system (FCGS), is a key element ofthat framework which is unusually resistant to change. The focus is on the UK FCGS, an outsider-dominated/stockexchange-based system, though with comparisons with the US and with 'insider-dominated' economies. Based on field work conducted between 1999 and 2005, we find that Britain is still a long way from witnessing a new creative partnership of financial and industrial capital in most of the economy, needed to fully release the potential of the new paradigm. We discuss what form that might take.\n      </p>", "In 1935, N. C. Nelson raised the possibility of a prehistoric trans-Beringian migration. His hypothesis was unique in that it was based upon specific artifactual evidence. New data from northern British Columbia and comparative technotypological analysis of microblade core production provide additional support for Nelson's hypothesis. It is possible to recognize a Northeast Asian-Northwest American Microblade Tradition (NANAMT) and to define several subtraditions. The distribution of NANAMT manifestations through space and time indicate the spread of the tradition from its presumed origin in southern Siberia/northern China to other parts of Asia and across Beringia to the New World. The \"spread\" of the culture complex may have been brought about through diffusion, migration, or both. In evolutionary terms, it seems to be the Advanced Palaeolithic-Mesolithic northeast Asian equivalent of southwest Asia's microlithic industries.\n      </p>", "A techno-economic evaluation of the Chromium Recovery Pilot Plant installed by KTWMA at Kasur Tanneries Complex was carried out. The data were collected from KTWMA by paying visits to the office of the General Manager, Tanneries Water Pre-treatment Plant at Kasur to obtain general information and to have a view of the work-in-progress. The General Manager and the Plant Supervisor were interviewed. Detailed information was also supplied by the Plant Supervisor through a questionnaire provided to him. Subsequently, the data were analysed to determine the B/C Ratio, NPV, and Payback Period of the Project. The analysis led to the B/C Ratio of 0.5, negative NPV of Rs 14,650,011, and payback period 36. These indicators are far below the decision criteria. Thus, the installation is not viable financially or economically. The study, of course, recommends that the installation, being a social and legal obligation, is socio-economically justified even if the tanner has to invest the capital required from his own resources.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

I argue that Tank Girl offers opportunities for integrating a Goddess ethos with a vision of a heteroglossic cyborg-like body politic. Through this integration, Tank Girl offers alternative visions of social organization to those promoted in narratives like those that form the Star Trek corpus, which legitimate a vision of body politic that, derived from Enlightenment idealisms, is based on relationships of government and subjection. I argue that the graphic texts of the Tank Girl corpus produce an antisocial myth that engenders heteroglossic subjectivity, allowing a Goddess ethos to emerge at the expense of not only myths of male heroes and gods but also male-generated Goddess myths.\n      </p>", "           ", "The study examines the predicted and actual impact of new flexible production technologies on industrial production organisation in industrial countries.

The goal of this work is to provide the reader with a glimpse of a richly developed Christian subculture in a brief moment of time as it is faced with technological uncertainty. Millennial Christians, as I refer to them to distinguish them from other Christians, have drawn upon the three sources of millennial belief and behavior to form its millennial response to Y2K, including; traditional Christian doctrine, modern American interpretations, and national Christian interpretations of Y2K. The subjects of this study were influenced by several sources of millennial belief both religious and secular, and both ancient and modern. I used two methodologies; I conducted a content analysis of several representative periodicals within the subculture during 1999 and I conducted longitudinal in-depth interviews with members of the subculture during the summer of 1999 and January 2000. By combining the data from both the content analysis and interviews I created a richly detailed picture of the subculture's response to Y2K. This work adds to the understanding of the religious subculture and its interaction with technological cultural objects.\n      </p>", "           "], "words": {"essay": {"number": 1, "prob":
