Taking into consideration their nature, spatial diffusion and distribution, the most important cable-car innovations in Austria are examined within a systematic empirical analysis. The quantitative approach is supplemented by qualitative analysis of expert interviews. Cable-cars are suitable examples for innovations in tourism but they are not tourist innovations in the narrow sense. The early adopters of innovations are able to realize certain advantages in contrast to laggards. But it should be clear that important investments in infrastructure are not sufficient to meet increasing customer expectations. A modern cable-car system represents a constitutive basic factor for ski tourism which is taken for granted by the guests. In general, cable-cars today do not constitute a tourist attraction per se any more. Incremental innovations establish too quickly as nearly ubiquitous standards. But it is possible to generate added value for customers in form of innovative features provoked by especially innovative cable-cars. /// Um bei stagnierender Wintersportnachfrage neuen Konsumentenpr\u00e4ferenzen zu gen\u00fcgen, k\u00f6nnen von touristischen Unternehmern eingef\u00fchrte Seilbahninnovationen zur Produktdifferenzierung dienen. Die bedeutendsten Seilbahninnovationen in \u00d6sterreich werden bez\u00fcglich ihres Wesens, ihrer r\u00e4umlichen Ausbreitung und Verteilung systematisch empirisch analysiert. Der quantitativ-statistische Ansatz wird durch die qualitative Analyse von Expertengespr\u00e4chen erg\u00e4nzt. Seilbahnen sind geeignete Anschauungsobjekte f\u00fcr Innovationen im Tourismus, aber sie sind keine touristischen Innovationen im engeren Sinne. Die fr\u00fchen Adoptoren von Innovationen sind in der Lage gewisse komparative Wettbewerbsvorteile gegen\u00fcber den Nachz\u00fcglern zu erlangen. Aber es sollte klar gemacht werden, dass bedeutende Investitionen in die Infrastruktur nicht ausreichend sind, um den steigenden Erwartungen der Kunden zu begegnen. Ein zeitgem\u00e4\u00dfes Seilbahnsystem stellt einen konstitutiven Basisfaktor f\u00fcr den Skitourismus dar, der von den G\u00e4sten vorausgesetzt wird.

In this paper, we propose a multicommodity network flow-based model for assigning locomotives and cars to trains in the context of passenger transportation. The model has a convenient structure that facilitates the introduction of maintenance constraints, car switching penalties, and substitution possibilities. The large integer programming formulation is solved by a branch-and-bound method that relaxes some of the integrality constraints. At each node of the tree, a mixed-integer problem is solved by a Benders decomposition approach in which the LP relaxations of multicommodity network flow problems are optimized either by the simplex algorithm or by Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition. Some computational refinements, such as the generation of Pareto-optimal cuts, are proposed to improve the performance of the algorithm. Computational experiments performed on two sets of data from a railroad show that the approach can be used to produce optimal solutions to complex problems.\n      </p>", "In Western Australia, coastal dynamics are influenced by a major ocean boundary current system, the Leeuwin Current, which is characterised by mesoscale features. To fully understand the Leeuwin Current using satellite altimeter measurements, we must have a precise (1\u20142 cm) and full-spatial-scale (&lt;100 km) geoid model. This paper focuses on a comparison between two mean dynamic ocean topography models derived from independent hydrographic climatologies, and an altimeter-observed mean sea surface referenced to recently released geoid models offshore of Western Australia (20\u00b0S to 45\u00b0S, 108\u00b0E to 130\u00b0E). The geoid models used include combined global geopotential models from the GRACE satellite mission and AUSGeoid98. The estimated mean dynamic ocean topography models are compared with independent dynamic ocean topography from CSIRO's Atlas of Regional Seas (CARS) climatology. The results show that the EIGEN_GL04C and GGM02C + EGM96 global geopotential models to degree and order 360 give the best comparisons against CARS in the Leeuwin Current region, suggesting that they should be used in the future for computing ocean transport, surface current velocities, and dynamic topography, and be used as a reference field for future computations of regional marine geoid models.\n      </p>", "Recent advances in coherent Raman spectroscopy hold exciting promise for many potential applications. For example, a technique, mitigating the nonresonant four-wave-mixing noise while maximizing the Raman-resonant signal, has been developed and applied to the problem of real-time detection of bacterial endospores. After a brief review of the technique essentials, we show how extensions of our earlier experimental work [Pestov D, et al. (2007) Science 316:265-268] yield single-shot identification of a small sample of Bacillus subtilis endospores (\u224810\u2074 spores). The results convey the utility of the technique and its potential for \"on-the-fly\" detection of biohazards, such as Bacillus anthracis. The application of optimized coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering scheme to problems requiring chemical specificity and short signal acquisition times is demonstrated.\n      </p>", "Objectives: To establish a reproducible method to estimate he point prevalence of smoking and second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure in cars, and to compare this prevalence between two areas of contrasting socioeconomic status. Method: A method involving two teams of observers was developed and evaluated. It involved observing 16 055 cars in Wellington, New Zealand. Two of the observation sites represented a high and a low area of deprivation (based on a neighbourhood deprivation index) and three were in the central city. Results: A 4.1% point prevalence of smoking in cars was observed (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.8% to 4.4%). There was a higher prevalence of smoking in cars in the high deprivation area relative to the other sites, and particularly compared to the low deprivation area (rate ratio relative to the latter 3.2, 95% CI 2.6 to 4.0). Of cars with smoking, 23.7% had other occupants being exposed to SHS. Cars with smoking and other occupants were significantly more likely to have a window open (especially if the smoker was not the driver). The observation method developed was practical, and inter-observer agreement was high (\u03ba value for the \"smoking seen in car\" category 0.95). Conclusions: Observational studies can be an effective way of investigating smoking in cars. The data from this survey suggest that smoking in cars occurs at a higher rate in relatively deprived populations and hence may contribute to health inequalities. Fortunately, there are a number of policy options for reducing SHS exposure in cars including mass media campaigns and laws for smoke-free cars.\n      </p>", "On a peak day, New York City's Department of Sanitation deploys 354 mechanical sweepers to pick up a substantial portion of the 100 tons of litter deposited daily on the city's 6,000 street miles. Field studies conducted by the department indicated that the major obstacle to doing a thorough job of cleaning was the number of illegally parked cars blocking the curb. We used Monte Carlo simulations to determine the increase in sweeping effectiveness that could be expected from significant reduction in illegally parked cars. The simulations provided information that was critical to the decision making process and resulted in the redeployment of 30% of the city's mobile traffic enforcement agents. The redeployment led to fewer illegally parked cars and more curb space available for cleaning.\n      </p>", "Legionnaires' disease (LD) is a major cause of severe community-acquired pneumonia but the source and mode of transmission are not always apparent, especially in sporadic cases. We hypothesized that LD can be acquired from the air- conditioning systems of motor cars. Swabs were taken from the evaporator compartments of the air-conditioning system of scrapped cars. Healthy subjects who were mainly employees of regional transportation companies were tested for antibody to Legionella pneumophila serogroups 1-6; they also completed a questionnaire. Legionella species were detected in 11/22 scrapped cars by the loop-mediated isothermal amplification method. The prevalence of microplate agglutination titres \u22651: 32 was significantly higher in subjects who sometimes used car air-conditioning systems. Although we did not prove a direct link between Legionella spp. in the car evaporator and LD, our findings point to a potential risk of car air-conditioning systems in LD, which needs further investigation.\n      </p>", "Whereas most prior research on the learning curve has focused on improvements in efficiency, this paper deals with the impact of learning on product quality. The key data are measures of automobile reliability published in Consumer Reports. Analysis yields three findings: (1) Quality improves over the production life of a car model with the same kind of regularity as an efficiency learning curve. Thus, there is a quality learning curve. (2) Unlike in the efficiency domain, however, learning in the domain of product reliability is primarily a function of time, and not of how many cars have gone down the assembly line. Thus, quality depends not on the accumulation of production experience per se, but on the intensity of \"off-line\" quality improvement activities and on the transfer of knowledge from the general environment over time. (3) In contrast to the traditional injunction, \"do not buy a new car in its first year of production,\" the opposite advice actually seems to apply: In any given year, the newest car models have the best quality. That is, new car-model designs typically include significant quality improvements that are more than enough to outweigh any disruption created in manufacturing by the new model's introduction and that even surpass the incremental improvements made to older, existing car models.\n      </p>", "", "", "", "Purpose The present study examines second- hand smoke (SHS) exposure and the beliefs youth have about being exposed to SHS in their home and in cars and explores changes in exposure and beliefs over time. Methods Nationally representative data from the 2006 Youth Smoking Survey (YSS) were used to examine youth exposure to smoking and beliefs about smoking in the home and car among 71,003 Canadian youth in grades 5\u201312. Gender-specific logistic regression models were conducted to examine if being exposed to smoking at home or in the car were associated with the beliefs youth have about either smoking around kids at home or smoking around kids in cars. Results In 2006, 22.1% of youth in grades 5\u201312 were exposed to smoking in their home on a daily or almost daily basis and 28.1% were exposed to smoking while riding in a car at least once in the previous week. The majority of youth reported that they do not think smoking should be allowed around kids at home (88.3%) or in cars (88.4%). Youth exposed to smoking in the home or in cars reported missing substantially more days of school in the previous month because of their health. Among both male and female youth, being an ever smoker, living in a house where someone smokes inside daily, and having ridden in a car with someone who was smoking cigarettes in the past seven days were all associated with being more likely to report that smoking should not be allowed around kids at home or in cars. Compared to their male counterparts, female youth with at least one parent who smokes were more likely to report that smoking should not be allowed around kids at home or in cars. As rates of SHS exposure in the home and car decreased between 2004 and 2006, the prevalence of youth who reported that they do not think smoking should be allowed around kids at home or in cars also decreased over the same period of time. Conclusions These results highlight that Canadian youth are frequently exposed to SHS in their homes and in cars despite the fact that the vast majority of youth do not think smoking should be allowed around kids in those locations. Considering the health and social consequences associated with SHS exposure, it may be a timely opportunity to move forward with programs and policies designed to prevent individuals from smoking around youth in these locations.\n      </p>", "Better understanding of the fundamental mechanisms behind metabolic diseases requires methods to monitor lipid stores on single-cell level in vivo. We have used Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism to demonstrate the limitations of fluorescence microscopy for imaging of lipids compared with coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy, the latter allowing chemically specific and label-free imaging in living organisms. CARS microscopy was used to quantitatively monitor the impact of genetic variations in metabolic pathways on lipid storage in 60 specimens of C. elegans. We found that the feeding-defective mutant pha-3 contained a lipid volume fraction one-third of that found in control worms. In contrast, mutants (daf-2, daf-4 dauer) with deficiencies in the insulin and transforming growth factors (IGF and TGF-\u03b2) signaling pathways had lipid volume fractions that were 1.4 and 2 times larger than controls, respectively. This was observed as an accumulation of small-sized lipid droplets in the hypodermal cells, hosting as much as 40% of the total lipid volume in contrast to the 9% for the wild-type larvae. Spectral CARS microscopy measurements indicated that this is accompanied by a shift in the ordering of the lipids from gel to liquid phase. We conclude that the degree of hypodermal lipid storage and the lipid phase can be used as a marker of lipid metabolism shift. This study shows that CARS microscopy has the potential to become a sensitive and important tool for studies of lipid storage mechanisms, improving our understanding of phenomena underlying metabolic disorders.\n      </p>", "1. This study investigated the effect of car traffic on the breeding density of birds in deciduous and coniferous woodland, and the importance of noise and visibility of cars as possible factors affecting density. 2. Of the 43 species analysed in both woodland types, 26 species (60%) showed evidence of reduced density adjacent to roads (based on analysis with Wilcoxon signed-ranks test and regression). 3. Regression models with noise load as the only independent variable gave the best overall results. Calculated `effect distances' (the distance from the road up to where a reduced density was present) based on these regressions varied between species from 40-1500 m for a road with 10 000 cars per day to 70-2800 m for a road with 60 000 cars per day (120 km h-1 and 70% amount of woodland along the road). For a zone of 250 m from the road the reduction of the density varied from 20 to 98%. 4. When visibility of cars was controlled for, the number of species showing density reductions was much higher on plots with a high noise load than on ones with a low noise load. When noise conditions were held constant, however, there was no difference in bird densities between plots with high and low visibility of cars. 5. It is argued that noise load is probably the most important cause of the reduced densities. Visibility of cars, direct mortality and pollution are considered unimportant. 6. The results of this study stress the importance of considering the effect of car traffic on the breeding density of birds in planning and constructing main roads.\n      </p>", "The flow of vehicles down one lane of a straight, signalized urban street with fixed cycle traffic lights at 500 ft intervals was simulated by means of a Fortran IV computer program. A car-following model and a simple model of lead-driver behavior were used to model driver responses. Flow and speed measurements were made for 'levels of congestion' in which, on average, 5, 10, 15, and 20 cars were queued at each traffic light; 10 ft cars, 20 ft cars, and mixtures of these two lengths were simulated. With 15 cars queued at each light a 70 per cent increase in flow can be obtained by the substitution of 10 ft cars for 20 ft cars. Average speed increases by about 57 per cent, from 3.5 ft/sec to 5.5 ft/sec. That the number of vehicles queued per light remains constant has been assumed. Complete results of our simulation are presented in Table III and Figs. 2, 3, and 4. Validation of the simulation model was provided by traffic flow counts and speed measurements on Walnut Street in downtown Philadelphia; correspondence between model and reality was close.\n      </p>", "Time headways between vehicles being discharged from a queue at a signalized urban intersection is a measure of the intersection's capacity. An event recorder actuated by tape switches on the road surface is used to measure headways at various signalized intersections in Toronto. The headways during saturation flow are related to the size of the vehicles and it is found that vehicles follow a small car with a closer headway than a full-sized car and a small car follows a vehicle closer than a full-sized car. The combined effect when both the lead and following vehicles are small cars is found to yield the smallest headways. This combined effect is most significant for the vehicles at the beginning of the queue. As a result, it is estimated that the capacity of a signalized intersection is increased by up to 15% for a stream of small cars over a stream of full-sized cars.\n      </p>", "Railroad companies face a difficult problem in assigning empty freight cars based on customer demand because these assignments depend on a variety of factors; these include the location of available empty cars, the urgency of the demand, and the possibilities of car substitution. In this paper, we present an optimization model implemented at Union Pacific Railroad (UP) to assign empty freight cars based on demand. The model seeks to reduce transportation costs, and improve delivery time and customer satisfaction. UP currently uses the model to make real-time assignments in a total car-management system. The model has helped UP to achieve significant reductions in its transportation costs, similar to the savings that our simulation study predicted. In addition, UP reduced the staff required for its demand fulfillment process, resulting in an ROI of 35 percent.\n      </p>", "We reveal here the visual ecological reasons for the phenomenon that aquatic insects often land on red, black and dark-coloured cars. Monitoring the numbers of aquatic beetles and bugs attracted to shiny black, white, red and yellow horizontal plastic sheets, we found that red and black reflectors are equally highly attractive to water insects, while yellow and white reflectors are unattractive. The reflection-polarization patterns of black, white, red and yellow cars were measured in the red, green and blue parts of the spectrum. In the blue and green, the degree of linear polarization p of light reflected from red and black cars is high and the direction of polarization of light reflected from red and black car roofs, bonnets and boots is nearly horizontal. Thus, the horizontal surfaces of red and black cars are highly attractive to red-blind polarotactic water insects. The p of light reflected from the horizontal surfaces of yellow and white cars is low and its direction of polarization is usually not horizontal. Consequently, yellow and white cars are unattractive to polarotactic water insects. The visual deception of aquatic insects by cars can be explained solely by the reflection-polarizational characteristics of the car paintwork.\n      </p>", "Aim: Little is known about what youth think about restricting smoking in their homes or in cars. The present study characterises the frequency of youth being exposed to smoking in their homes and cars, and the beliefs that youth have about restricting people from smoking around youth in those locations. Methods: Data from the 2004 Youth Smoking Survey (YSS) were used to examine youth exposure to smoking and beliefs about smoking in the home and car among 29 243 Canadian youth in grades 5-9. Logistic regression models were conducted to examine if being exposed to smoking at home or in the car were associated with the beliefs youth have about either smoking around children at home or smoking around children in cars. Results: In 2004, 23.1% of youth in grades 5-9 were exposed to smoking in their home on a daily or almost daily basis, 26.3% were exposed to smoking while travelling in a car at least once in the previous week. The majority of youth reported that they do not think smoking should be allowed around children at home (90.6%) or in cars (90.2%). Males were more likely than females to report that smoking should not be allowed around children at home (OR 1.38) or in cars (OR 1.39). Youth living in a house where someone smokes inside daily were more likely to report that smoking should not be allowed around children at home (OR 1.20) or in cars (OR 1.21). Youth living in a house where the rules do not prevent people from smoking inside were also more likely to report that smoking should not be allowed around children at home (OR 2.07) or in cars (OR 1.76). Youth who have ridden in a car with someone who was smoking cigarettes in the past 7 days were more likely to report that smoking should not be allowed around children in cars (OR 1.73). Conclusions: It is common for Canadian youth to be exposed to SHS in their homes or while in cars on a frequent basis even though the vast majority of youth do not think smoking should be allowed around children in those locations. This new evidence suggests that programs and policies designed to prevent individuals from smoking around youth in these locations should be a public health priority.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The growth of freeways, funneling traffic to and through congested city streets, has conspicuously adversely affected the capacity of cities to plan. Federal housing policy has stimulated suburban growth, in turn generating increased auto highway traffic, while attracting away affluent city residents and some firms as well. The belated tentative efforts of the federal government to bolster rapid transit system development has not significantly reduced dependence on cars. The power of the auto-related lobby, led by car manufacturers and petroleum producers, suppresses constraints upon car utilization. Prospects appear bleak for careful co-ordination between those responsible for planning for cities and those concerned with direct or indirect planning for automobile use.\n      </p>", "This paper examines the public health consequences of the regulatory subsidy given to light trucks. The empirical challenge is to disentangle the causal effects of light trucks from the selection bias that may occur due to drivers sorting into different vehicle types depending on their unobservable characteristics. I address this by using state variation of snow depth as an instrumental variable for vehicle miles traveled of light trucks and cars. This instrument has strong first-stage explanatory power. Since snow depth is likely a direct determinant of crashes, I meet the exclusion criteria by restricting the dependent variable to those crashes that occurred in the summer. My findings suggest that, given a crash, light trucks are more dangerous to others but less dangerous for those driving them. However, I also find that light trucks are more likely to crash than cars, which neutralizes the safety advantage to those who drive them. My estimates for aggregate fatalities suggest that a world of light trucks leads to substantially more fatalities than a world of cars.\n      </p>", "Recently, the question of small vs large cars has assumed increasing importance because of their differential fuel economy and impact on energy consumption. This paper estimates disaggregated demand functions for cars by size and age class with particular attention to the effects of gasoline prices on the composition of demand. The data consisted of a cross-section of five-year time series from eight Canadian provinces. Evidence was found of a substantial response of the demand composition to changes in the relative care prices; the evidence on the effect of gas prices was less conclusive. /// Petites voitures, grosses voitures et prix de l'essence.

Expression studies in human embryonic kidney cells reveal that shark kidney senses combinations of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions at concentrations present in seawater and kidney tubules. Shark kidney is expressed in multiple shark osmoregulatory organs, including specific tubules of the kidney, rectal gland, stomach, intestine, olfactory lamellae, gill, and brain. Reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification using specific primers in two teleost fish, winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), reveals a similar pattern of CaR tissue expression. Exposure of the lumen of winter flounder urinary bladder to the CaR agonists, Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and neomycin, reversibly inhibit volume transport, which is important for euryhaline teleost survival in seawater. Within 24-72 hr after transfer of freshwater-adapted Atlantic salmon to seawater, there are increases in their plasma Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; that likely serve as a signal for internal CaRs, i.e., brain, to sense alterations in salinity in the surrounding water. We conclude that CaRs act as salinity sensors in both teleost and elasmobranch fish. Their tissue expression patterns in fish provide insights into CaR functions in terrestrial animals including humans.\n      </p>", "Mud from a car driving more than 15 000 km in the growing season of 1986 in the area surrounding G\u00f6ttingen (FRG) was sampled systematically to assess the size and nature of the car-borne flora. The sludge from front and back mudguards, wheels and other lower parts of the car was set out for germination in a greenhouse. Until the end of 1987, 124 plant species with a total of 3926 seedlings were identified and counted. Germination success was significantly related to the sampling date, the front or back position of the car and the influence of low temperature during exposure. The nature of this potentially car-dispersed flora was compared with the local flora as a whole as well as the flora and plant communities of road verges in the studied area. It can be supposed that almost all plant species growing in plant communities along roadsides can be carried by cars and therefore belong to the car-dispersed flora.\n      </p>", "Coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) uses vibrational resonances to study nuclear wavepacket motions and is widely used in cell imaging and other applications. The resonances usually lie on top of a parametric component that involves no change in the molecular state and creates an undesirable background which reduces the sensitivity of the technique. Here, by examining the process from the perspective of the molecule, rather than the field, we are able to separate the two components and recast each resonance as a modulus square of a transition amplitude which contains an interference between two Stokes pathways, each involving a different pair of field modes. We further propose that dissipative signals obtained by measuring the total absorption of all field modes in a convenient collinear pulse geometry can eliminate the parametric component and retain the purely resonant contributions. Specific vibrational resonances may then be readily detected using pulse shapers through derivatives with respect to pulse parameters.\n      </p>", "Use of seatbelts in late model cars with automatic or manual belt systems was observed in suburban Washington, DC, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia. In cars with automatic two-point belt systems, the use of shoulder belts by drivers was substantially higher than in the same model cars with manual three-point belts. This finding was true in varying degrees whatever the type of automatic belt, including cars with detachable nonmotorized belts, cars with detachable motorized belts, and especially cars with nondetachable motorized belts. Most of these automatic shoulder belts systems include manual lap belts. Use of lap belts was lower in cars with automatic two-point belt systems than in the same model cars with manual three-point belts; precisely how much lower could not be reliably estimated in this survey. Use of shoulder and lap belts was slightly higher in General Motors cars with detachable automatic three-point belts compared with the same model cars with manual three-point belts; in Hondas there was no difference in the rates of use of manual three-point belts and the rates of use of automatic three-point belts.\n      </p>", "Cars entering and leaving a parking place in a forest are registered automatically in connection with an investigation of forest recreational use.

Two grade-point averages were collected: the first before the students were legally able to drive, and the second after they had been legally able to drive for about one and one-half to two years. An IQ score was also collected. The subjects were divided into boys and girls. Car accessibility was divided into three categories: (1) no driver's license; (2) moderate accessibility; and (3) a group having maximum accessibility. It was concluded that the students' access to cars has no effect on the grade-point average over this period. This is true even when their IQ is taken into account. It was determined that there is a differential pattern of access to cars by intellectual ability levels. Questions regarding the interpretations of previous work seem justified.\n      </p>", "Airborne contaminants, e.g., bacterial spores, are usually analyzed by time-consuming microscopic, chemical, and biological assays. Current research into real-time laser spectroscopic detectors of such contaminants is based on e.g., resonance fluorescence. The present approach derives from recent experiments in which atoms and molecules are prepared by one (or more) coherent laser(s) and probed by another set of lasers. However, generating and using maximally coherent oscillation in macromolecules having an enormous number of degrees of freedom is challenging. In particular, the short dephasing times and rapid internal conversion rates are major obstacles. However, adiabatic fast passage techniques and the ability to generate combs of phase-coherent femtosecond pulses provide tools for the generation and utilization of maximal quantum coherence in large molecules and biopolymers. We call this technique FAST CARS (femtosecond adaptive spectroscopic techniques for coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy), and the present article proposes and analyses ways in which it could be used to rapidly identify preselected molecules in real time.\n      </p>", "Travel in passenger cars is a ubiquitous aspect of the daily activities of many people. During the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic a case of probable transmission during car travel was reported in Australia, to which spread via the airborne route may have contributed. However, there are no data to indicate the likely risks of such events, and how they may vary and be mitigated. To address this knowledge gap, we estimated the risk of airborne influenza transmission in two cars (1989 model and 2005 model) by employing ventilation measurements and a variation of the Wells-Riley model. Results suggested that infection risk can be reduced by not recirculating air; however, estimated risk ranged from 59% to 99.9% for a 90-min trip when air was recirculated in the newer vehicle. These results have implications for interrupting in-car transmission of other illnesses spread by the airborne route.\n      </p>", "The trade in used commodities has received limited geographical attention. The global production network (GPN) approach offers a theoretical frame through which to explore how second-hand goods, such as used cars, are traded internationally. The structure of a trade network and the tensions within it are researched through an inductive empirical GPN method and the embeddedness of powerful actors is related to context specific discourse. This article contributes to the analysis of the links between production and consumption through investigating informal and corrupt economic networks and exploring how a trade flow is embedded in a patrimonial state. The empirical case study demonstrates how used commodities are re-produced through political and cultural processes. In Japan a strict inspection regime excludes many used cars from the domestic market, some of which are exported via South Africa for sale in Mozambique. Embedded actors, including Pakistani trading families, play key roles in the governance of this international trade network. Corrupt individuals within the Mozambican customs service exert power at the import node to extract rent from this trade network, but the official neoliberal narrative of ' development success' in Mozambique constrains space for critique of their actions. Discussing the example of used car imports demonstrates how there are political structures which enable actors to have agency in trade networks and this shows how studies of international commodity flows have to stretch beyond the immediate manifestation of trade networks and chains to capture the dynamics of power relations.\n      </p>", "National survey data on the amount of information seeking by buyers of new cars and major household appliances are analyzed by AID and MCA. The findings lend support to the hypothesis that purchase and use of a product result in learning which later influences buying behavior.\n      </p>", "To help build theory on the factors contributing to \"environmentally significant consumption,\" I analyze cross-national variation in the size of passenger car fleets. I take into consideration multiple factors--demographic, economic, and socio-political--that potentially influence motorization. The results indicate that all types of factors have a significant influence on national motorization, although economic factors are the most influential. I conclude that in order to properly understand consumption practices we need to consider multiple perspectives and recognize that there are global structural conditions that form the context in which causal processes unfold.\n      </p>", "In any city the arrival rate of calls for police patrol-car service varies considerably through the day. Using queuing theory and integer linear programming, we present a method for scheduling patrol cars so that specified service standards are met at each hour of the day. Two models are used. The first is an M/M/n queuing model with time-dependent parameters that is solved numerically. The second is an integer linear program in which the decision variables are the number of patrol cars working each tour and the times at which they go out of service for meals. The program's constraints are determined by the output of the queuing model. Use of the method with data from the New York City Police Department indicates that it can lead to substantial improvements in police service.\n      </p>", "In DARPA's Urban Challenge, cars that drive themselves face off in a strange, soulless rush hour. Are human drivers about to go the way of the buggy whip?\n      </p>", "Radio-monitored patrol (RMP) cars in the New York City Police Department patrol and respond to calls for service (CFS) throughout the city. The initial phase of an on-going attempt to improve productivity in the department consisted of a comprehensive quantitatively based study of RMP car practices. One aspect focused on the effect on travel times to CFS of alternative RMP patrol and response strategies. The hypercube queueing model, a public domain patrol car allocation model, was used to predict the consequences of these new strategies for particular neighborhoods in Eastern Queens and Lower Manhattan. A somewhat surprising finding from the analysis is that increasing the potential service areas of RMP cars need not result in an increase in travel times.\n      </p>", "Interview data were obtained from 394 drivers whose safety belt use or non-use had been observed in 1974 cars equipped with a starter-interlock system linked to belts and seat sensors. Belt use was not related to education, race, comfort-convenience ratings of belts, or having had a friend injured but not killed in a crash\u2013factors that had been found related to belt use in previous research on earlier model cars not equipped with starter-interlock systems. Drivers in 1974 cars were more likely to be seen using belts if they used their cars on their jobs or were in and out of them frequently, on average, each day. Despite favorable ratings of the efficacy of belt use, over 40 percent of drivers in 1974 cars were not using belts and 29 percent claimed that the interlock was among the least liked features of their new car.\n      </p>", "The existing tax policies toward gasoline and diesel cars in European countries provide a unique opportunity to analyze quality-based price discrimination and the implied tax incidence. In my econometric framework, consumers choose the type of engine based on their annual mileage; prices are set by the manufacturers. The relative pricing of gasoline and diesel cars appears to be consistent with monopolistic price discrimination, effectively segmenting low-mileage from highmileage consumers. On average, about 75% to 90% of the price differentials between gasoline and diesel cars can be explained by markup differences. I draw implications for the effectiveness and the revenue effects of tax policy.\n      </p>", "Seeing the automobile as analogous to an animal, the author describes his process of hunting and capturing it, then displaying its flattened body as a 'pelt'.

For its identification and estimation without imposing a priori restrictions we apply single- and multi-market approaches of the Box-Cox flexible functional form estimating technique in a modified version of Rosen's hedonic price model. On the empirical plane, the results show that (a) the quality adjusted prices of cars imported from Germany, France, Italy and Japan declined from 1965 to 1970 and increased continuously thereafter; (b) the quality of cars from France and Italy, and to a lesser extent from Japan, responded favourably following the two oil shocks, and (c) low priced cars offer more quality for the money.\n      </p>", "The worldwide increase in antibiotic resistance is a concern for public health. The fact that the choice of dose and treatment duration can affect the selection of antibiotic-resistant mutants is becoming more evident, and an increased number of studies have used pharmacodynamic models to describe the drug exposure and pharmacodynamic breakpoints needed to minimize and predict the development of resistance. However, there remains a lack of sufficient data, and future work is needed to fully characterize these target drug concentrations. More knowledge is also needed of drug pharmacodynamics versus bacteria with different resistance mutations and susceptibility levels. The dosing regimens should exhibit high efficacy not only against susceptible wild-type bacteria but, preferably, also against mutated bacteria that may exist in low numbers in \"susceptible\" populations. Thus, to prolong the life span of existing and new antibiotics, it is important that dosing regimens be carefully selected on the basis of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that prevent emergence of preexisting and newly formed mutants.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Rutted and pot-holed roads exacerbated the deficiencies in steering, springing and stability. In 1758 the young Dr Erasmus Darwin (1731-1802; F.R.S. 1761) was travelling about 10 000 miles a year in visits to patients from his house at Lichfield. To alleviate the danger and discomfort of his journey, he developed a design for improved carriage steering and stability, which he road-tested over 20 000 miles on two carriages. In 1765 Richard Lovell Edgeworth (1744-1817; F.R.S. 1781) heard about Darwin's design, urged the Society of Arts to enquire about it, and then visited Darwin himself. With the aid of manuscripts from the Archive of the Royal Society of Arts and elsewhere, I offer a reconstruction of Darwin's improved method of steering, which relies on four jointed rods, initially in the form of an isosceles trapezium. The mechanism was reinvented more than 50 years later, and came to be used widely in early modern cars.\n      </p>", "Hedonic price indexes are estimated for U.S. used passenger cars for 1970-1983.

Our indexes also are compared with the Consumer Price Index.\n      </p>", "An increasing number of researchers have hypothesized that regulatory attempts to improve automotive safety through product design would be at least partially offset by driver behavioral changes. This article analyzes two independent data sets to test whether differences in driver behavior exist between cars equipped with air bags and those not so equipped. An analysis of an insurance industry generated data set reveals that relative injury claims increase following adoption of an air bag system. Since there is no indication that the increase diminishes over time, the results appear to be attributable to offsetting behavior as opposed to a sorting of auto buyers. Analyses of 1993 Virginia State Police accident reports indicate that air-bag-equipped cars tend to be driven more aggressively and that aggressiveness appears to offset the effect of the air bag for the driver and increases the risk of death to others.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

For cars representing each of five model years (1975-1979), bivariate and multivariate correlational techniques were used to analyze the data of six annual surveys. The data report owner problems experienced in 15 to 17 individual categories as well as an overall category. The study findings indicate that each year's reported frequencies of problems are highly predictive of next year's, both for the overall and individual categories. Predictability was found to differ significantly by individual problem category and by the recency of the survey data. Policy implications of the findings are discussed for consumer magazines, such as Consumer Reports, and for consumer educators and consumer researchers.\n      </p>", "Ion chromatography studies were performed to assess various models proposed for the structure of M$_8$C$_{12}$ species, the met-cars. A laser desorption source was used to make a sequence of titanium-carbon clusters centered around Ti$_8$C$_{12}^+$. The Ti$_8$C$_{12}^+$ was determined to be a hollow cage cluster, with the dodecahedron structure originally proposed giving the best fit to experiment; cubic structures could be excluded. Collisional breakup of Ti$_8$C$_{12}^+$ yielded only Ti$_7$C$_{12}^+$ under the experimental conditions described herein, and modeling indicated that the cage structure was retained. Both Ti$_8$C$_{11}^+$ and Ti$_8$C$_{13}^+$ were made by the cluster source, and again, dodecahedral-type cage structures were consistent with experiment. The extra carbon atom in Ti$_8$C$_{13}^+$ was attached exohedrally to a single titanium atom. No evidence for an endohedral species was found.\n      </p>", "The welfare costs of price controls can vary enormously, depending on the method of allocating the good in shortage and the possible rent-seeking costs that may result. With full rent dissipation, the welfare loss from price controls on Polish color televisions in 1989 was about ten times the standard estimates of distortion costs, which ignore rent-seeking, and was more than 100 percent of the value of domestic producers' sales. The methods of allocating cars, however, did not result in rent-seeking costs. The domestic price controls were an unintended implicit subsidy to imports. Subsidies for cars were estimated at 43 percent and for color televisions at 22 percent.\n      </p>", "Courses on courtship, marriage, and the family are popular on most college campuses. In teaching these courses, instructors are faced with the tension between student interest in the functional, everyday mechanics of relationships, marriage, and family and faculty desire to present sociological knowledge and understanding of the area. In this paper we describe a set of simulated exercises that help students synthesize formal and practical knowledge. These exercises take students through the life of a relationship, from dating and courtship, to marriage, and through marital and family life. They are organized around six themes, three micro and three macro. The micro themes emphasize communication skills, methods for joint decision-making, and means for achieving awareness of self. The macro themes challenge students to look critically at sex roles and sex role socialization, social and cultural influences on the dynamic process of relationships, and the function of rites of passage and events in the process of courtship, marriage, and family life. We also present issues related to application of the exercises to the classroom, analyze student response to these exercises, and discuss how CARS can be integrated into courses on courtship, marriage, and the family.\n      </p>", "The Obama Administration wants to end the hydrogen fuel cell vehicles program, which proponents see as the ultimate clean-car technology.\n      </p>", "The author analyses the fuel efficiency of private cars in relation to both the technical characteristics of the cars and the socio-economic characteristics of the drivers. Economic theory predicts a relationship between fuel prices and fuel efficiency. This relationship, as well as others suggested by the literature about driver behaviour, is investigated for a sample of Dutch drivers. The study finds that the age and profession of the driver, and fuel prices, have more significant effects than the gender and income of the driver, or the annual or commuting mileage. /// Der Autor setzt die Verbrauchseffizienz privater PKW in Beziehung zu den technischen Charakteristika der Fahrzeuge und den sozio-\u00f6konomischen Eigenschaften der Fahrer.

In Britain, where emission controls have not been introduced, the rate of these suicides, initially much lower than in the United States, has greatly increased since the beginning of the 1970s and is now about double that of the United States. This rise cannot be explained simply on the basis of an increase in the opportunities for suicide as represented by an increase in the number of cars but may be due to increased knowledge of the method. While these results are interpreted as generally supporting the potential for opportunity-reducing preventive measures, they also demonstrate that much more research is needed into the complex nature of the opportunity structure for suicide.\n      </p>"], "words": {"limited": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "aquatic": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "stores":
