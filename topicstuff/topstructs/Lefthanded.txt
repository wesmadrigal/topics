In the lyticdeficient strain FJ7, twist varies as a function of growth temperature above or below 39 degrees C, where there is zero twist. The relationship between the temperature (below 39 degrees C) at which right-hand structures are produced to the time it takes for them to begin the inversion process in which they become lefthanded following transfer to 48 degrees C reveals that structures with less twist are more rapidly converted to left-handedness than are those with higher values of twist. The initial response of live macrofibers to digestion by lysozyme consists of ``relaxation'' motions in which the twist of both left- and right-handed structures changes towards the right-hand end of the spectrum. The rate of relaxation is \u2248 5-fold higher at the left-hand end than at the right-hand end. These findings suggest that cell wall polymers can assume a range of structural states during helical growth and that these determine the quantitative aspects of macrofiber shape as well as the sensitivity of walls to attack by lysozyme.\n      </p>", "The sequence (dC-dG)&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;, inserted into the polylinker of plasmid pUC8, adopts a lefthanded Z-DNA conformation at ``natural'' supercoil density. The radioactively labeled monoclonal antibody Z-D11, which has a very high affinity for this DNA conformation, provides a convenient sensitive tool to measure selectively the amount of Z-DNA. Chloroquine reversibly changes the supercoil density of plasmid DNA and thereby the equilibrium between right- and left-handed double-helical DNA. The time-dependent formation or disappearance of Z-DNA was measured by using the antibody either as a fast indicator of Z-DNA or as an additional effector of the B-to-Z equilibrium. In the middle of the transition, a relaxation time of about 1 hr is observed in 0.1 M NaCl at 22 degrees C. The kinetic data are compatible with an all-or-none transition between the two conformations. The overall rate constant for Z-DNA formation, k&lt;sub&gt;BZ&lt;/sub&gt;, decreases with the square of the chloroquine concentration, while the reverse one, k&lt;sub&gt;ZB&lt;/sub&gt;, increases with about the fourth power.\n      </p>", "We have investigated the structure of the crossbridges in muscles rapidly frozen while relaxed, in rigor, and at various times after activation from rigor by flash photolysis of caged ATP. We used Fourier analysis of images of cross sections to obtain an average view of the muscle structure, and correspondence analysis to extract information about individual crossbridge shapes. The crossbridge structure changes dramatically between relaxed, rigor, and with time after ATP release. In relaxed muscle, most crossbridges are detached. In rigor, all are attached and have a characteristic asymmetric shape that shows strong lefthanded curvature when viewed from the M-line towards the Z-line. Immediately after ATP release, before significant force has developed (20 ms) the homogeneous rigor population is replaced by a much more diverse collection of crossbridge shapes. Over the next few hundred milliseconds, the proportion of attached crossbridges changes little, but the distribution of the crossbridges among different structural classes continues to evolve. Some forms of attached crossbridge (presumably weakly attached) increase at early times when tension is low. The proportion of several other attached non-rigor crossbridge shapes increases in parallel with the development of active tension. The results lend strong support to models of muscle contraction that have attributed force generation to structural changes in attached crossbridges.\n      </p>", "Glyphosate-resistant (GR) crops have been rapidly adopted in the United States and the evolution of GR weeds throughout the world has also been on the rise. With experience, weed scientists and crop advisers develop \"intuition\" on the basis of field history and current in-field conditions for predicting whether escaped weed biotypes may be herbicide resistant. However, there are no previous reports on the association of in-field crop management factors with the prediction of herbicide resistance. By using in-field survey data, we tested the accuracy of predicting glyphosate resistance in lateseason horseweed escapes. We hypothesized that glyphosate resistance in late-season horseweed populations found in soybean fields could be predicted using in-field knowledge of crop residues and the appearance and distribution of weeds in the field. Field survey data were collected to determine the distribution and frequency of GR horseweed populations in Indiana soybean fields during September and October of 2003, 2004, and 2005. After the in-field survey, soil properties for sampled field locations were also collected from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service Web Soil Survey. GR horseweed predictions used in-field presence of crop residues and the appearance, abundance, and distribution of weeds in the field. The significance of independent data factors were determined by chi-square statistics.The interactions and relative significance of multiple factors were modeled using classification and regression tree analysis.Our results indicated that the most important factor for predicting GR populations was the identification of an altered plant phenotype after injury from POST glyphosate. This was followed by crop rotation, field distribution, and the presence of other escaped weed species in the field in a model with a classification rate of 0.68.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The brain contains many body maps that systematically differ between right- and lefthanded people. In general, the cortical representations of the right arm and right hand tend to be of greater area in the left hemisphere than in the right hemisphere for righthanded people, whereas these cortical representations tend to be symmetrical across hemispheres for left-handers.We took advantage of these naturally occurring differences and examined perceived arm length in rightand left-handed people. When looking at each arm and hand individually, right-handed participants perceived their right arms and right hands to be longer than their left arms and left hands, whereas left-handed participants perceived both arms accurately. These experiments reveal a possible relationship between implicit body maps in the brain and conscious perception of the body.\n      </p>", "The flowers of Cassia didymobotrya and C auriculata have three types of fertile anthers that differ in orientation, size, shape, and pollen production. Flowers with fight-handed or lefthanded style deflections, i.e., enantiostylous flowers, occur in the same raceme. In Israel, both species are pollinated by pollen collecting buzzing females of Xylocopa pubescens. Vibrations of the carpenter bee are necessary for release of pollen from poricidal anthers and, in C. didymobotrya, also for absorption of pollen through the stigmatic opening into a cavity of the style tip. The largest anthers supply pollen for pollination. Pollen for consumption by the bee, on the other hand, appears to be supplied by all fertile anthers. This is in contrast to the accepted view of a complete separation of functions in the heteromorphic anthers in Cassia. The pollen/ ovule ratio in C. didymobotrya was 55,200, and that in C. auriculata 32,000. Only 0.01% of the pollen produced by a flower was found in the stigmatic pollen load, and this fraction allows for high seed sets. From a comparison of the pollen production and utilization in the Cassia species and in certain distylous plants, it is concluded that heteranthery in Cassia does not confer an advantage in pollen economy. The high pollen/ovule ratios are explained by lack of nectar as well as by the large area on which pollen is deposited on the bee's body relative to the small size of the stigma. Enantiostyly in Cassia is considered as part of a pollination syndrome whose characteristics are outlined. The function of enantiostyly as an outbreeding strategy is discussed. In the two Cassia species, opportunities for self- and geitonogamous pollinations and self-compatibility minimize an effect of enantiostyly in promotion of outcrossing. Instead, it is proposed that style deflections may clear access of the pollinator to the anthers and protect female parts from injury by a vibrating heavy-bodied visitor.\n      </p>", "Anti-Z-DNA polyclonal and monoclonal immunoglobulins raised against lefthanded polynucleotides show various degrees of specificity for base sequence and substitution. Class 1 IgGs recognize all Z-DNA with equal affinity; class 2 IgGs show a preference for d(G-C)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; sequences and class 3 IgGs for d(G-C)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; sequences with substitutions at the C5 position of the pyrimidine. These antibodies served as probes for the localization of Z-DNA in polytene and metaphase chromosomes and in interphase chromatin by indirect immunofluorescence. A quantitative assessment of the binding of anti-Z-DNA IgGs to polytene chromosomes of Chironomus and Drosophila was made by scanning microphotometry and by computer-assisted image analysis of double immunofluorescence and DNA-specific dye fluorescence images. The three classes of antibodies bind to most of the bands in acid fixed polytene chromosomes of C. thummi; however, preferential binding of one class of antibody over another can be observed in certain regions. These differences can be quantitated by arithmetic division or subtraction of the normalized digital images. If a class 2 antibody is first bound at saturating concentrations the binding of class 1 antibody is reduced throughout most bands by 40-50%. However, the telomeres of the three large chromosomes bind &gt;10 times as much class 1 antibody as class 2 antibody, indicating that the Z-DNA tracts in these regions are comprised largely of alternating sequences containing the A\u00b7T basepair, e.g., A-C. High-resolution image analysis of class 1 and class 2 immunofluorescence patterns and the total DNA distribution from polytene chromosomes of D. melanogaster show that the two antibody distributions are very similar in a large majority of the bands, but they often deviate from the mean DNA distribution profile. Z-DNA sequences of both G-C and A-C type are detectable at all levels of ploidy from 2n to 2&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;n and in species as diverse as insects and man. We conclude that the vast majority of polytene chromosome bands (genes) contain one or a few DNA sequences with potential for undergoing the B\u2192Z transition and contain both alternating purine-pyrimidine G-C and A-C tracts or mixed sequences. Highly heterochromatic bands and telomeres have more Z potential sequences than do other bands.\n      </p>", "Gyrosigma spenceri (Quekett) Griffith &amp; Henfrey is a synonym of G. acuminatum (K\u00fctzing) Rabenhorst. Type specimens do not show any morphological discontinuities. In particular, they do not differ in the longitudinal/transverse stria density ratio, which has previously been claimed as a decisive criterion. The marine-brackish ecology claimed for \"Gyrosigma spenceri\" is excluded by its type material. This synonymy of two of the most commonly identified Gyrosigma taxa makes verification of a mass of published data on distribution and ecology necessary. The numerous \"varieties\" of \"G. spenceri\" all bear invalid names. The organisms called \"Gyrosigma spenceri\" sensu Hustedt (1930), sensu Van der Werff &amp; Huls (1957-1976) or sensu Krammer &amp; Lange-Bertalot (1986) are incompatible with the type and as yet undefinable. Gyrosigma rautenbachiae Cholnoky resembles G. acuminatum but shows specific differences from that organism. A practical definition of the section Acuminati sensu Peragallo (1891) would include organisms with a longitudinal/transverse stria density ratio from ca. 1.00 to 0.85.\n      </p>", "Charles Darwin studied floral biology for over 40 years and wrote three major books on plant reproduction. These works have provided the conceptual foundation for understanding floral adaptations that promote cross-fertilization and the mechanisms responsible for evolutionary transitions in reproductive systems. Many of Darwin's insights, gained from careful observations and experiments on diverse angiosperm species, remain remarkably durable today and have stimulated much current research on floral function and the evolution of mating systems. Here I review Darwin's seminal contributions to reproductive biology and provide an overview of the current status of research on several of the main topics to which he devoted considerable effort, including the consequences to fitness of cross-versus self-fertilization, the evolution and function of stylar polymorphisms, the adaptive significance of heteranthery, the origins of dioecy and related gender polymorphisms, and the transition from animal pollination to wind pollination. Post-Darwinian perspectives on floral function now recognize the importance of pollen dispersal and male outcrossed siring success in shaping floral adaptation. This has helped to link work on pollination biology and mating systems, two subfields of reproductive biology that remained largely isolated during much of the twentieth century despite Darwin's efforts towards integration.\n      </p>", "Because the individual strands of DNA are intertwined, formation of heteroduplex structures between duplexes-as in presumed recombination intermediates-presents a topological puzzle, known as the winding problem. Previous approaches to this problem have assumed that single-strand breaks are required to permit formation of fully coiled heteroduplexes. This paper describes a simple, nick-free solution to the winding problem that satisfies all topological constraints. Homologous duplexes associated by their minor-groove surfaces can switch strand pairing to form reciprocal heteroduplexes that coil together into a compact, four-stranded helix throughout the region of pairing. Model building shows that this fused heteroduplex structure is plausible, being composed entirely of right-handed primary helices with Watson-Crick base pairing throughout. Its simplicity of formation, structural symmetry, and high degree of specificity are suggestive of a natural mechanism for alignment by base pairing between intact homologous duplexes. Implications for genetic recombination are discussed.\n      </p>", "In an auditory or musical memory task, subjects made pitch recognition judgments when the tones to be compared were separated by a sequence of interpolated tones. The left-handed subjects performed significantly better than the righthanded and also had a significantly higher variance.

It was also noted that the conformations of the right- and left-handed D-DNA models are very similar to those of the right- and left-handed B-DNA models. This observation was consistent with the D \u2192 B transition in the solid phase. As a continuation of our earlier studies, we have carried out similar experiments with poly[d(I-C)]. We could obtain a crystalline D-form pattern (n = 8, h = 3.13 angstrom) of the fiber at 75% relative humidity (r.h.); the hydrated (r.h. \u2248 95%) form of the same fiber gave the classical B-form pattern (n = 10, h = 3.40 angstrom). In the present report, we show that both right- and left-handed double-helical models are consistent with the fiber diffraction data of poly[d(I-C)] in the D-form. Theoretical energy calculations also suggest that the right- and left-handed B- and D-DNA models are almost equally stable. Hence, we conclude that the right- and left-handed double-helical models of poly[d(I-C)] in a given form (B or D) are equally likely and that the fiber diffraction data do not permit discrimination.\n      </p>", "It is shown that left-handed duplexes are possible for A, B, and D forms of DNA. These duplexes are stereochemically satisfactory and are consistent with the observed x-ray intensity data. On scrutiny the refined right-handed models of B and D DNA by Arnott and coworkers are found to be stereochemically unacceptable. It was possible to formulate a stereochemical guideline for molecular model building based on theory and analysis of single-crystal structure data of dinucleoside monophosphate and higher oligomers. This led to both right- and left-handed DNA duplexes. The right-handed B and D DNA duplexes so obtained are stereochemically superior to earlier models and agree well with the observed x-ray intensity data. The observation that DNA can exist in either handedness for all the polymorphous forms of DNA at once explained A $\\rightleftharpoons $ B and B $\\rightleftharpoons $ D transitions. Hence it is confirmed that polymorphism of DNA is a reflection on the conformational flexibility inherent in DNA, the same cause that ultimately allows DNA in either handedness. The possibility of various types of right- and left-handed duplexes generated by using dinucleoside monophosphate and trinucleoside diphosphate as repeating units resulted in a variety of models, called RL models. All these models have alternating right and left helical segments and inverted stacking at the bend region as suggested by us earlier. It turns out that the B-Z DNA model of Wang et al. is only an example of RL models.\n      </p>", "Breast cancer risk may be influenced by intrauterine exposure to steroid hormones. We evaluated left-handedness, a marker of intrauterine hormone exposure, in relation to breast cancer risk in our population-based, case-control study. Case women 50-79 years of age with a first diagnosis of invasive breast cancer were ascertained through statewide cancer registries in Wisconsin, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. Control women were identified in each state through lists of licensed drivers (for ages 50-64) and Medicare beneficiaries (for ages 65-79), and selected at random to correspond with the age distribution of case women. Exposure information, including handedness, was obtained through a telephone interview. Our results indicated a modest association between left-handedness and breast cancer risk (OR = 1.42; 95% CI = 1.10-1.83). The effect of left-handedness was modified by age; we observed the greatest risk ratio in the oldest age group. Left-handedness was not associated with breast tumor laterality. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that intrauterine hormone exposures play a role in the development of breast cancer.\n      </p>"], "words": {"pollen": {"number": 1, "prob":
