Assuming a priori knowledge of secondary structure, our method can design a funnel-shaped surface for folding of \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b1\u03b2 structures individually. We design energy surfaces that fold up to five unrelated sequences with the same energy parameters. We develop a measure of the foldability of an energy landscape in silico and present an alternative way to view energy landscapes.\n      </p>", "The mechanisms controlling the formation and maintenance of neuronal trees are poorly understood. We examined the dynamic development of two arborized mechanoreceptor neurons (PVDs) required for reception of strong mechanical stimuli in Caenorhabditis elegans. The PVDs elaborated dendritic trees comprising structural units we call \"menorahs.\" We studied how the number, structure, and function of menorahs were maintained. EFF-1, an essential protein mediating cell fusion, acted autonomously in the PVDs to trim developing menorahs. eff-1 mutants displayed hyperbranched, disorganized menorahs. Overexpression of EFF-1 in the PVD reduced branching. Neuronal pruning appeared to involve EFF-1-dependent branch retraction and neurite-neurite autofusion. Thus, EFF-1 activities may act as a quality control mechanism during the sculpting of dendritic trees.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "The author investigates an imaginary world between art and science, looking back on 20 years of his exploration of \"material light\" in sculptures created using plasma ionized by electric current.\n      </p>", "Honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa Torr.) is a problem plant in much of the southwestern USA because it reduces forage production for livestock, interferes with livestock handling and reduces off-site water yield. Aerial spraying a 1:1 mixture of clopyralid (3,6-dichloro-2-pyridinecarboxylic acid, monoethanolamine salt) and triclopyr (3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinyloxyacetic acid, butyoxyethyl ester) at $0.28\\ {\\rm kg}\\ {\\rm ae}\\ {\\rm ha}^{-1}+0.28\\ {\\rm kg}\\ {\\rm ae}\\ {\\rm ha}^{-1}$ usually achieves high above-ground (top-kill) and whole plant (root-kill) mortality, but limits multiple-use options of livestock and wildlife production because little mesquite foliage is left to provide screening cover for wildlife. In addition, most surviving plants resprout from basal meristems and will become multistemmed plants. Some managers treat mesquite in strips or blocks, leaving untreated areas for screening cover, but these areas become increasingly non-productive for livestock and wildlife forage. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of aerial sprays of clopyralid alone at 0.28 kg ha-1 to convert thickets of mature, multi-stemmed mesquite to savannas by reducing mesquite foliage amount to an intermediate level (by 50-70%), yet preserving apical dominance and limiting basal sprouting. The clopyralid treatment was compared to an untreated control and aerial sprays of 0.28 kg ha-1 clopyralid + 0.28 kg ha-1 triclopyr on 2 sites. The clopyralid treatment reduced foliage amount $\\text{tree}^{-1}$ , canopy area $\\text{tree}^{-1}$ , and stand-level mesquite cover by &gt; 57% when compared untreated areas, and 73% of surviving trees maintained apical dominance. Apical dominance was maintained in &gt; 70% of trees not totally top-killed if at least 20% of the original canopy survived and produced foliage following the spray year. Percent root-kill in the clopyralid-only treatment differed between sites (34 and 10%). The lower root-kill on one site was attributed to rainfall that occurred 2 days before and one day after spraying. The clopyralid+triclopyr treatment reduced foliage on original canopies by &gt; 96% and mesquite cover by 82% on both sites. Root-kill was &gt; 52% on both sites but only 37% of surviving plants maintained apical dominance. Results suggest that clopyralid at 0.28 kg ha-1 may be effective for converting mesquite thickets to savanna and may aid in multiple-use management. /// El \"Mezquite\" (Prosopis glandulosa Torr.) es una planta problema en gran parte del sudoeste de Estados Unidos porque reduce la producci\u00f3n de forraje para el ganado, interfiere con el manejo del mismo y reduce los rendimientos de agua del sitio.

Adem\u00e1s, la mayor\u00eda de las plantas sobreviventes rebrotan de meristemos basales creando plantas multi-tallos. Algunos manejadores tratan el mezquite en franjas o bloques, dejando \u00e1reas sin tratar para tener una cubierta de protecci\u00f3n, pero estas \u00e1reas poco a poco llegan a ser improductivas de forraje tanto para el ganado como para la fauna.

El tratamiento de clopiralid se compar\u00f3 con un control sin tratar y con aspersiones a\u00e9reas de 0.28 kg ha-1 clopiralid + 0.28 kg ha-1 triclopir, la comparaci\u00f3n se efectu\u00f3 en 2 sitios.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Its evolution is technologically important because it allows the open-ended development of tools. New Caledonian crows manufacture an impressive range of stick and leaf tools. We previously reported that their toolkit included hooked implements made from leafy twigs, although their manufacture had never been closely observed. We describe the manufacture of 10 hooked-twig tools by an adult crow and its dependent juvenile. To make all 10 tools, the crows carried out a relatively invariant three-step sequence of complex manipulations that involved (i) the selection of raw material, (ii) trimming and (iii) a lengthy sculpting of the hook. Hooked-twig manufacture contrasts with the lack of sculpting in the making of wooden tools by other non-humans such as chimpanzees and woodpecker finches.

Monuments entered the area of public, secular space in Ireland mainly during the nineteenth century. It was not until the latter decades of that century that nationalist statuary, which sought to elaborate Ireland's quest for political independence, emerged. The significance of these monuments rests, I argue, in their popular appeal and the debates that surrounded their construction and unveiling. Although an alliance of nationalist interests was achieved during the centenary celebrations, this paper emphasizes the tentative nature of that alliance and the gendered iconography and discourse surrounding the statues themselves.\n      </p>", "This article begins with an examination of two spectacles from the end of the nineteenth century which represent the emancipated 'Negro': the Tennessee Centennial Exposition and Saint-Gaudens's \"Show Memorial\" in Boston. There are important differences, not least in the significance of their locations. In the North, the black is a free citizen, while the Jim Crow South denies the status granted by the Fourteenth Amendment. This model of good North versus bad South is not to be taken at face value, however, for underpinning both spectacles are shared beliefs. In both, the black citizen is constructed according to a white ideal of black labour; in both, this coalescence of class and race is founded on the same concern for \"laissez-faire\" economics and its role in bringing about white unity; and in both, nostalgia works to reify the past and limit black emancipation by confirming antebellum social relations between black and white Americans. The article ends by introducing a third spectacle: the lynching. This points to a further common feature of these visual events: all circumscribe the recognition of the black as subject, and thus mark the limits of black citizenship. In spite of the very different idioms of racism, all share a belief that the abstract freedom granted by the Constitution is necessarily limited by concrete social and natural formations. The free black in the North and the unfree black in the Jim Crow South are, in Adorno's famous phrase, 'torn halves of an integral freedom to which they do not add up'.

The figurines emerged from the ground into a colonial intellectual and socio-political context nearly obsessed with matters of race. This early racial interpretive frame would only be replaced in the mid 20th century, when prehistorians turned to questions such as fertility and womanhood. The first figurines were discovered in 1892 under rather tortured circumstances in which their very ownership was the subject of a heated dispute between Edouard Piette and Emile Cartailhac. Their toxic relationship would lead Piette, in his subsequent excavations, to be extremely precise about issues of stratigraphic and spatial provenience. Piette's publications and archives enabled Henri Delporte to confirm the Gravettian attribution of the figurines and have allowed the present author to create a map of their spatial distribution within the site.

Instead, the average mitochondrial DNA sequence divergence for 35 such songbird species pairs is 5.1 percent, which exceeds the predicted value by a factor of 10.

An early archival source documenting this practice is a sculpted bust of Black Spirit, who, along with five other members of the Osage tribe, toured Paris in 1827, where a local artisan skillfully crafted this marble likeness of an exotic visitor from America's frontier. When viewed in profile this bust clearly depicts a tabular occiput. Comparative study of 124 Osages measured by Franz Boas and colleagues at the close of the 19th century reveals that the majority of mixed-bloods did not possess altered crania, while full-bloods did. It will be demonstrated that Indian-white marriages created a domestic environment where parents chose not to utilize a cradleboard as part of infant care. Their probable motives for this decision will also be explored. The craniometric data analyzed in this report document an important form of culture change among admixed Osage Indians at the close of the 19th century.\n      </p>", "This paper describes an approach to computer-based sculpting concerned with the creation and modification of digital models based on physical abstract sculptures. The authors begin by presenting a survey of current methods for the creation of computer-based sculpted artifacts. They proceed to present some original methods and tools based on the Function Representation of geometric models. They introduce a specialized computer language, called HyperFun, that facilitates the modeling of complex objects. In addition to presenting computer-generated textured and animated models of pre-existing sculptures, they also show how novel shapes can be generated using the HyperFun system. Finally they outline two advanced projects concerned with creating a sculpture-based augmented reality that allows for the interactive participation of the observer.\n      </p>", "Upper Paleolithic Venus figurines are traditionally explained as symbols glorifying female fertility. This study suggests the hypothesis that Venuses represent women throughout their entire adult life, not just when they are pregnant; therefore, it is womanhood rather than motherhood that is symbolically recognized or honored. First an estimate is made of the age group (pre-childbearing, reproductive, post-childbearing) of each of the 188 extant Venuses. Contemporary hunter-gatherers are then used to estimate the age structure of Upper Paleolithic groups. A comparison of the proportions of both Venuses and contemporary hunter-gatherer women estimated to be in the three reproduction-related age groups results in statistically significant support for the womanhood hypothesis. Motivations for sculpting the figurines, and their functions, are suggested by considering the probable economic, social, and reproductive roles of Paleolithic women.\n      </p>", "Engineers, computer programmers, and surgeons have begun to develop virtual reality simulators designed to teach the physical aspects of surgical skills, especially the skills needed to perform minimally invasive procedures. The technologies incorporated in these simulations, including graphic modeling, haptic (tactile and kinesthetic) interface design, and haptic cognitive studies, reconstruct surgical knowledge that traditionally remains tacit, such as knowledge of surgeons' movements and forces used on tissues. A surgeon's physical experience becomes mathematized when programmers reconstruct it for computers. This paper describes how researchers construct 'body objects', representations of bodies and body parts that are engineered to inhabit computer programs. This paper argues that surgical learning occurs at the interface of bodies and instruments, through simultaneous sculpting of the surgical site and training of the surgeon's body, a process I call mutual articulation.\n      </p>", "Recent research has shown that neuromodulators play important roles in shaping simple behaviors. They act at many different sites within the animal in a coordinated fashion, modulating the motor circuits in the central nervous system, altering motoneuron excitability, and modulating muscle response to motoneuron input. Within the central circuits that co-ordinate simple movements, neuromodulators play a dramatic sculpting role, changing the cells that participate in the circuit, altering their intrinsic properties, and affecting the strength of synaptic interactions that form the \"wiring diagram\" of the circuit. As a result, they are able to shape a family of related circuits out of a single anatomically identified network, each driving a unique variant on the basic motor theme. Examples of these actions from the Crustacea are described in this paper, focussing on the modulation of posture in the lobster, and on modulation of rhythmic motor programs for stomach movements in the stomatogastric ganglion of lobsters and crabs.\n      </p>", "While tactile models have been used to describe molecular structures for over a century, the sculpting of structural models is a recent phenomenon.

Once formed, those planets dispersed most of the remaining small bodies. Outside of Neptune, this process has left our Kuiper belt and built the Oort cloud, as well as emplacing comets into several other identifiable structures. The orbits in these structures indicate that our outer solar system's comet disk was shaped by a variety of different physical processes, which teach us about how the giant planets formed. Recent work has shown that the scattered disk is the most likely source of short-period comets. Moreover, a growing body of evidence indicates that the sculpting of the Kuiper belt region may have involved large-scale planetary migration, the presence of other rogue planetary objects in the disk, and/or the close passage of other stars in the Sun's birth cluster.\n      </p>", "At the Wave, a photogenic landform on the Utah\u2013Arizona border, modern, southwesterly, sand\u2010carrying winds abrade the Navajo Sandstone.

Comparisons of genetic-distance trends across the vertebrate classes reveal the following: (i) speciation durations normally entail at least two million years on average; (ii) for mammals and birds, Pleistocene conditions played an important role in initiating phylogeographic differentiation among now-extant conspecific populations as well as in further sculpting pre-existing phylogeographic variety into many of today's sister species; and (iii) for herpetofauna and fishes, inferred Pleistocene biogeographic influences on present-day taxa differ depending on alternative but currently plausible mtDNA rate calibrations.\n      </p>", "           ", "Thomas Eakins\u2019s obsession with the body is well known and much studied.

However, this paradigm has recently come under challenge from a review of interspecific mtDNA genetic distances in birds: most sister-species separations dated to the Pliocene. Here we summarize the literature on intraspecific mtDNA phylogeographic patterns in birds and reinterpret the molecular evidence bearing on Pleistocene influences. At least 37 of the 63 avian species surveyed (59%) are sundered into recognizable phylogeographic units, and 28 of these separations (76%) trace to the Pleistocene. Furthermore, use of phylogroup separation times within species as minimum estimates of 'speciation durations' also indicates that many protracted speciations, considered individually, probably extended through time from Pliocene origins to Pleistocene completions. When avian speciation is viewed properly as an extended temporal process rather than as a point event, Pleistocene conditions appear to have played an active role both in initiating major phylogeographic separations within species, and in completing speciations that had been inaugurated earlier.

Direct administration at the target site is a logical alternative, particularly in the central nervous system, but the limits of direct administration have not been defined clearly. Nerve growth factor (NGF) enhances survival of cholinergic neurons and, therefore, has generated considerable interest for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. We tested the effectiveness of local delivery by implanting small polymer pellets that slowly released NGF into the central nervous system of adult rats at controlled distances from a target site containing transplanted fetal cholinergic cells. NGF-releasing implants placed within 1-2 mm of the treatment site enhanced the biological function of cellular targets, whereas identical implants placed \u2248 3 mm from the target site of treatment produced no beneficial effect. Effective NGF therapy required millimeter-scale positioning of the NGF source, and efficacy correlated with the spatial distribution of NGF concentration in the tissue; this result suggests that NGF must be delivered within several millimeters of the target to be effective in treating Alzheimer's disease. Because the human brain is divided into functional regions that are typically several centimeters in diameter and often irregular in shape, new methods for sculpting larger-scale drug fields are needed. We illustrate a concept, called pharmacotectonics, in which drug-delivery systems are arranged spatially in tissues to shape concentration fields for potent agents.\n      </p>", "Fan-shaped pediments up to almost 2 km2 in area occur along the west and south piedmont slopes of Roan Mountain, North Carolina. Sediment mantles average less than 18.5 m in depth, and generally appear to be underlain by saprolite. Three ages of fan terraces were mapped, based on morphology and weathering characteristics. Results show that most terraces are unpaired and that the cross-fan sequence of terraces is either irregular or that younger terraces tend to abut valley walls. The terraces thus appear to be the result not of cyclic erosion and deposition produced by Quaternary climatic change, but of recurring stream capture and lateral erosion on the mountain piedmont. Climatic change may affect the fans, however, as relative-age dating (based on percent clay, Munsell hue, and weathering-rind thickness) at 80 sites provides some evidence for episodic deposition, but this effect probably play 5 only a minor role in sculpting the piedmont landscape. No absolute-age dates were obtained on deposits, but several lines of evidence based on weathering criteria suggest that the oldest fan terraces are at least several hundred thousand years old. The regression equation of fan area on drainage-basin area, Af=c Ad n, yields values of c (0.38) and n (0.76) comparable to those reported for aridregion alluvial fans, suggesting that the size of the drainage basin can determine the amount of lateral erosion as well as the amount of deposition taking place on the piedmont.\n      </p>", "Despite a lasting ambivalence regarding the title of his 1968 orchestral work, Livre pour orchestre, Lutoslawski ultimately consented to publication of the work under the name with which it was premiered.

This reversal of values has a major geographical dimension. Primitivism manifests the contradiction-rife colonial ideology, but can also challenge colonization. Tourism, which is, in the case of Tahiti, directly linked to Gauguin and to his myth, inherited a lot from primitivism, in terms of hopes and ambiguities.

Only the art of the goldsmith successfully continued the high standards of the D\u00fcrer epoch. It reached its acme during the second part of the century and exercised a lasting influence on the other arts - particularly the graphic and plastic arts. This upswing is closely linked with the work of the Jamnitzer family, whose members decisively shaped the artistic life of Nuremberg throughout three generations. This epoch, during which the art of the goldsmith pushed painting and sculpting to the background, has been rather neglected by historians of art. We know the names of many famous masters of the past, and much of their work has been preserved. And yet, even in the case of some of the most highly reputed goldsmiths, we are still in the dark about their actual significance, their influence on others and their real artistic achievements. This also applies to Wenzel Jamnitzer, who was celebrated among his contemporaries whereas present critical opinions are rather divided. Inspite of the very comprehensive literature which has appeared during the last decades and made us familiar with many new works of this artist, many questions concerning him still remained open. The present publication presents two large, and hitherto largely unknown works by Wenzel Jamnitzer which significantly add to our knowledge of this the greatest German goldsmith of the second half of the 16th century. The as yet unpublished Sketch Book (Kunstbibliothek of Berlin) with its numerous designs especially from the years 1545 and 1546 clearly evidences that in the case of Wenzel Jamnitzer the creative work of the goldsmith still formed an integral process. He did not use the designs of others but creates his own and even produces models for ornamental engravers. The 34 pages of the sketch book contain designs and decorative studies which reveal the rich ornamental imagination of Wenzel Jamnitzer. A number of plastic works - models for goldsmiths - now can be traced back to these designs. The last four pages of the book contain sketches by Christoph Jamnitzer, the grandson of our artist. - The second work, the magnificent casket in Madrid, has until now only been published in a Spanish magazine and has remained practically unknown in Germany. However, it deserves to be called a representative, late master-piece by Wenzel Jamnitzer: it bears his full signature and the date 1570. We know that this reliquary was commissioned by Emperor Maximilian II as a part of the wedding gifts for his daughter Anna who married King Philip II of Spain. Queen Anne presented this casket with the reliques of St. Victor to the convent of the Descalzas Reales in Madrid where it has been kept until today. Next to the numerous lead models in the Historische Museum of Basel (Switzerland) and the Kunstgewerbemuseum in Berlin, which now can safely be attributed to Jamnitzer on the strength of the Sketch Book and the Madrid casket, it is above all the embossed original model for a figure of the Madrid casket (Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin) which deserves our interest. For it proves that Jamnitzer was a goldsmith who not only designed the small figural elements of this major works but also actually executed them.\n      </p>", "Fomalhaut, a bright star 7.7 parsecs (25 light-years) from Earth, harbors a belt of cold dust with a structure consistent with gravitational sculpting by an orbiting planet.

Fomalhaut b lies about 119 astronomical units (AU) from the star and 18 AU of the dust belt, matching predictions of its location. Hubble Space Telescope observations separated by 1.73 years reveal counterclockwise orbital motion. Dynamical models of the interaction between the planet and the belt indicate that the planet's mass is at most three times that of Jupiter; a higher mass would lead to gravitational disruption of the belt, matching predictions of its location. The flux detected at 0.8 ?m is also consistent with that of a planet with mass no greater than a few times that of Jupiter. The brightness at 0.6 ?m and the lack of detection at longer wavelengths suggest that the detected flux may include starlight reflected off a circumplanetary disk, with dimension comparable to the orbits of the Galilean satellites.

Particular attention is given to the postructuralist 'aesthetic return': the resurgence of interest in aesthetics as an ontological foundation for human beingin-the-world. The disordered individual-as-emergentartist-and-artifact, who is at the centre of this ' aesthetic return', is then translated into the 'dis'-organization that is the firm. The firm is thus defined in terms of its primal sensory impact on the world. It invokes a myriad of aesthetic relations between its disorganized self and others: its essence resides within these relations; its power of being is determined by its ability to project a unified aesthetic ideal -a 'mirror fantasy'. The firm thus emerges as a style: where style is defined as an organizing - a sculpting - of aesthetic chaos. In order to achieve a grand style, the firm projects itself through time as a unified aesthetic ideal; as an ongoing work of art. The article concludes with a discussion of how this aesthetic theory of the firm relates to other accepted theories of the nature and purpose of business organizations.\n      </p>", "Overproduction and pruning during development is a phenomenon that can be observed in the number of organisms in a population, the number of cells in many tissue types, and even the number of synapses on individual neurons. The sculpting of synaptic connections in the brain of a developing organism is guided by its personal experience, which on a neural level translates to specific patterns of activity. Activity-dependent plasticity at glutamatergic synapses is an integral part of neuronal network formation and maturation in developing vertebrate and invertebrate brains. As development of the rodent forebrain transitions away from an over-proliferative state, synaptic plasticity undergoes modification. Late developmental changes in synaptic plasticity signal the establishment of a more stable network and relate to pronounced perceptual and cognitive abilities. In large part, activation of glutamate-sensitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors regulates synaptic stabilization during development and is a necessary step in memory formation processes that occur in the forebrain. A developmental change in the subunits that compose NMDA receptors coincides with developmental modifications in synaptic plasticity and cognition, and thus much research in this area focuses on NMDA receptor composition. We propose that there are additional, equally important developmental processes that influence synaptic plasticity, including mechanisms that are upstream (factors that influence NMDA receptors) and downstream (intracellular processes regulated by NMDA receptors) from NMDA receptor activation. The goal of this review is to summarize what is known and what is not well understood about developmental changes in functional plasticity at glutamatergic synapses, and in the end, attempt to relate these changes to maturation of neural networks.\n      </p>", "Le mat\u00e9riau min\u00e9ral utilis\u00e9 par les sculpteurs de statues protohistoriques a rarement fait l'objet d'une \u00e9tude approfondie.

The new research orientations highlight the incoherence of present designations of standing stones. An appropriate vocabulary based on techniques could perhaps translate the result of the work carried out on the stone by the sculptor, the creator of the megalithic work of art. This paper is thus intended as a reflection on a systematic approach to insular statuary based on a systematic and conceptual anthropological vision of techniques, cha\u00eenes op\u00e9ratoires, and also a contribution to the necessary renewal of the designations of these works of art.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Pseudouridine (\u03c8), the most abundant of the modified bases, features an additional imino group, NH1, as compared with uridine. When \u03c8 forms a Watson-Crick base pair with adenine in an RNA helix, NH1 is positioned within the major groove. The presence of \u03c8 often increases thermal stability of the helix or loop in which it is found [Hall, K. B. &amp; McLaughlin, L. (1992) Nucleic Acids Res. 20, 1883-1889]. X-ray crystal structures of transfer RNAs [e.g., Arnez, J. &amp; Steitz, T. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 7560-7567] have depicted water molecules bridging \u03c8NH1 groups and nearby phosphate oxygen atoms, but direct evidence for this interaction in solution has not been acquired. Toward this end, we have used a rotating-frame Overhauser effect spectroscopy-type NMR pulse sequence with a CLEAN chemical-exchange spectroscopy spin-lock pulse train [Hwang, T.-L., Mori, S., Shaka, A. J. &amp; van Zijl, P. C. M. (1997) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 119, 6203-6204] to test for \u03c8NH1-water cross-relaxation effects within two RNA helices: (i) a complementary duplex, in which \u03c8 is not associated with structural change, and (ii) an RNA duplex representing the eukaryotic pre-mRNA branch-site helix from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which a conserved \u03c8 extrudes the branch-site adenosine from the helix. Our data implicate a water-\u03c8NH1 hydrogen bond both in stabilizing the complementary helix and in favoring formation of the unique structure of the branch-site helix.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
