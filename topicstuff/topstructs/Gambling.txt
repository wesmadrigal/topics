Dans cette \u00e9tude, nous avons eu recours \u00e0 des m\u00e9thodes plus perfectionn\u00e9es pour \u00e9valuer les d\u00e9penses reli\u00e9es au jeu \u00e0 probl\u00e8mes et la pr\u00e9cision des d\u00e9penses reli\u00e9es au jeu d\u00e9clar\u00e9es par les joueurs. Nous concluons que, en 2003, 36 pour cent des revenus provenant du jeu, en Ontario, \u00e9taient g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9s par les joueurs \u00e0 probl\u00e8mes, alors que ceux-ci ne repr\u00e9sentaient que 4,8 pour cent de l'ensemble des joueurs.

Figures obtained from prior research are tentative due to methodological problems and the mismatch between reported expenditures and actual gambling revenue. Using improved methods for assessing the prevalence of problem gambling and the accuracy of self-reported gambling expenditures, the present study estimates that the 4.8 percent of problem gamblers in Ontario in 2003 accounted for approximately 36 percent of Ontario gambling revenue. This proportion varied as a function of game type, with a lower proportion for lotteries, instant win tickets, bingo, and raffles, and a higher proportion for horse racing and slot machines.\n      </p>", "Past research on gambling behavior has focused largely on cognitive and affective explanations, but has not explored the influence of past gambling behavior or habit. In this study, it was hypothesized that gambling behavior followed predictable patterns based on past behavior. We found that these patterns could be described by the negative binomial distribution (NBD) and NBD\u2013Dirichlet models at game and category levels, respectively. An empirical study using the 1999 Australia Productivity Commission survey dataset provided some support for the usefulness of these models in describing gambling consumption. The paper explores the implications for identifying problem gambling and influencing gamblers' behavior.\n      </p>", "Pathological gambling is a psychiatric disorder that has considerable public-health implications. Promising treatments for pathological gambling have been identified. However, most treatment research is limited by methodological problems that preclude drawing conclusions about treatment efficacy. We explore the empirical evidence for some currently practiced treatments for pathological gambling. We also discuss some of the challenges and future directions for research on how to treat the disorder.\n      </p>", "Suppose measurability structures are imposed upon a Dubins and Savage gambling problem. A long-standing question asks whether strategies which are measurable with respect to these structures enable the gambler to maximize his return. Measurable strategies have the advantage over arbitrary strategies in that they induce countably additive probability measures. In this work, we show that measurable strategies are adequate in order to maximize return if and only if the optimal return function is measurable. Using this result, several examples of gambling problems for which measurable strategies are adequate are given.\n      </p>", "In the Dubins and Savage theory of gambling, backward induction provides an algorithm for calculating the optimal return when the gambling problem is leavable. A relatively new algorithm works for nonleavable problems. We show that these algorithms converge geometrically fast for finite gambling problems. Our argument also provides a much simpler proof of convergence for the nonleavable case.\n      </p>", "This paper presents a context-dependent theory of decision under risk. The relevant contextual factor is the presence of a riskless lottery in a preference comparison. The theory only deviates from expected utility if the set of options contains both riskless and risky lotteries. The main motivation for the theory is to explain the gambling effect. Contrary to previous theories of the gambling effect, the present theory is consistent with stochastic dominance. It can, however, violate transitivity. The theory allows for a decomposition of the interaction between risk aversion and gambling aversion and thereby extends the classical Arrow-Pratt measure of risk aversion.\n      </p>", "Dynamic programming is used to solve some simple gambling models. In particular we consider the situation where an individual may bet any integral amount not greater than his fortune and he will win this amount with probability p or lose it with probability 1-p. It is shown that if p\u2265 1/2 then the timid strategy (always bet one dollar) both maximizes the probability of ever reaching any preassigned fortune, and also stochastically maximizes the time until the bettor becomes broke. Also, if $p&lt;{\\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}}$ then the timid strategy while not stochastically maximizing the playing time does maximize the expected playing time. We also consider the same model but with the additional structure that the bettor need not gamble but may instead elect to work for some period of time. His goal is to minimize the expected time until his fortune reaches some preassigned goal. We show that if $p&lt;{\\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}}$ then (i) always working is optimal, and (ii) among those strategies that only allow working when the bettor is broke it is the bold strategy that is optimal\n      </p>", "Dans cet article, nous analysons l'\u00e9tat actuel et l'avenir possible du jeu sur Internet au Canada.

This article investigates the current condition and possible future of Internet gambling in Canada. We apply Howlet's (1998) refinement of Kingdon's \"policy windows\" theory to examine four windows of opportunity through which Internet gambling might be placed on the Canadian policy agenda. We conclude that Internet gambling is unlikely to reach the agenda through a routine means; instead, the issue might be recognized by policy-makers through alternative routes such as connection to another Internet-related issue or to a crisis that would intensify the political or economic problems related to the current murky status of online gambling.\n      </p>", "\"Oscar's system\" is a gambling system in which the aim is to win one betting unit, at least with high probability, and then start over again. The system can be modeled by an irreducible Markov chain in a subset of the two-dimensional integer lattice. We show that the Markov chain, which depends on a parameter p representing the single-trial win probability, is transient if $p &lt; \\frac{1}{2}$ and positive recurrent if p \u2265 1/2.\n      </p>", "There exists a leavable, Borel gambling problem with a goal, where at most three gambles are available at each fortune, where each gamble has at most two points in its support, but for which stationary plans are not uniformly adequate.\n      </p>", "In the gambling theory of Dubins and Savage, the payoff from a sequence of states is the limit superior of their utilities. Here the limit inferior is used instead. For example, if the utility function is the indicator of a set G, then the Dubins and Savage payoff is 1 when infinitely many states are in G, while the payoff here is 1 when all but finitely many states are in G. There are some resulting changes in the theory, but it remains true that optimal stationary plans exist for finite problems.\n      </p>", "Associated with any Borel gambling model G or dynamic programming model D is a corresponding class of stochastic processes M(G) or M(D). Say that G(D) is regular if there is a D(G) with M(D) = M(G). Necessary and sufficient conditions for regularity are given, and it is shown how to modify any model slightly to achieve regularity.\n      </p>", "This paper documents a quantitative study into socially responsible principles and practices adopted in registered clubs in New South Wales Australia to manage one of their social impacts - problem gambling. The survey utilised an adapted version of Aupperle's (1982) corporate social responsibility instrument to measure the priority given to economic, legal, ethical and discretionary principles in club machine gambling operations. The survey also assessed support for certain management practices in responsible gambling. The results indicate that the participating club managers prioritise economic, legal, ethical and discretionary principles respectively, and that these are statistically related to practices they have implemented and support in responsible gambling. The managers most favoured secondary harm minimisation practices, followed by reactive primary intervention. Less favoured were proactive primary intervention and discretionary practices. These principles and practices contrast markedly with those advocated by key stakeholder groups, as expressed in semi-structured interviews and submissions to the NSW Gaming Inquiry. Non-industry stakeholders favoured a more balanced set of principles and a more holistic set of management practices in responsible gambling. The results also provide validation of Aupperle's (1982) instrument when applied to corporate management of a single social impact and for Carroll's (1979, 1991) construct of corporate social responsibility.\n      </p>", "We describe the balayage order defined by an analytic gambling house on a Borel subset of a Polish space in terms of our construction of the saturation of the gambling house.\n      </p>", "The optimal return function $U$ of a Borel measurable gambling problem with a positive utility function is known to be universally measurable. With a negative utility function, however, $U$ may not be so measurable. As shown here, the measurability of $U$ for all Borel gambling problems with negative utility functions is equivalent to the measurability of all PCA sets, a property of such sets known to be independent of the usual axioms of set theory. If the utility function is further required to satisfy certain uniform integrability conditions, or if the gambling problem corresponds to an optimal stopping problem, the optimal return function is measurable. Another return function $W$ is introduced as an alternative to $U$. It is shown that $W$ is always measurable and coincides with $U$ when the utility function is positive.\n      </p>", "We consider finite state gambling problems with the Dubins and Savage payoff and with the $\\lim\\inf$ payoff. For these models we show that the optimal return function with respect to all stationary strategies can be characterized similarly to the optimal return function. This enables us then to characterize those stationary strategies which are optimal within the set of all stationary strategies in the same way as it was done for optimal strategies by Dubins and Savage.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "Drawing on ethnographic research conducted in Las Vegas among game developers and machine gamblers, I correlate a set of digitally enhanced game features with phenomenological aspects of gamblers' experience, demonstrating the intimate connection between extreme states of subjective absorption in play and design elements that manipulate space and time to accelerate the extraction of money from players.

Design: A Geographical Information Systems (GIS) measure of neighbourhood access to gambling venues. Two-level logistic regression models were fitted to examine the effects of neighbourhood access on individual gambling behaviour after controlling for potential individual- and neighbourhood-level confounding factors. Setting: 38 350 neighbourhoods across New Zealand. Participants: 12 529 respondents of the 2002/03 New Zealand Health Survey. Results: Compared with those living in the quartile of neighbourhoods with the furthest access to a gambling venue, residents living in the quartile of neighbourhoods with the closest access were more likely (adjusted for age, sex, socio-economic status at the individual-level and deprivation, urban/rural status at the neighbourhood-level) to be a gambler (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.15) or problem gambler (OR 2.70, 95% CI 1.03 to 7.05). When examined independently, neighbourhood access to venues with non-casino gaming machines (gambling: OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.18; problem gambling: OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.45 to 5.07) and sports betting venues (gambling: OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.18; problem gambling: OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.45 to 5.07) were similarly related. Conclusions: Neighbourhood access to opportunities for gambling is related to gambling and problem gambling behaviour, and contributes substantially to neighbourhood inequalities in gambling over and above-individual level characteristics.\n      </p>", "A player in a measurable gambling house \u0393 defined on a Polish state space X has available, for each x \u2208 X, the collection \u03a3(x) of possible distributions \u03c3 for the stochastic process x1, x2, ... of future states. If the object is to control the process so that it will lie in an analytic subset A of H = X \u00d7 X \u00d7 \u22ef, then the player's optimal reward is $M(A)(x) = \\sup\\{\\sigma(A): \\sigma \\in \\Sigma(x)\\}.$ The operator M(\u00b7)(x) is shown to be regular in the sense that $M(A)(x) = \\inf M(\\{\\tau &lt; \\infty\\})(x),$ where the infimum is over Borel stopping times \u03c4 such that $A \\subseteq \\{\\tau &lt; \\infty\\}$ . A consequence of this regularity property is that the value of M(A)(x) is unchanged if, as in the gambling theory of Dubins and Savage, the player is allowed to use nonmeasurable strategies. This last result is seen to hold for bounded, Borel measurable payoff functions including that of Dubins and Savage.\n      </p>", "We discuss universal schemes for portfolio selection. When such a scheme is used for investment in a stationary ergodic market with unknown distribution, the compounded capital will grow with the same limiting rate as could be achieved if the infinite past and hence of the distribution of the market were known to begin with. By specializing the market to a Kelly horse race, we obtain a universal scheme for gambling on a stationary ergodic process with values in a finite set. We point out the connection between universal gambling schemes and universal modeling schemes that are used in noiseless data compression. We also discuss a universal prediction scheme to learn, from past experience, the conditional distribution given the infinite past of the next outcome of a stationary ergodic process with values in a Polish space. This generalizes Ornstein's scheme for finite-valued processes. Although universal prediction schemes can be used to obtain universal gambling and portfolio schemes, they are not necessary.\n      </p>", "Although archaeologists have had success in documenting the movement and distribution of \"trade goods,\" they often fail to specify the actual social mechanisms by which such goods are shunted across archaeological landscapes. A thesis is developed that in Native North America gambling was one common mechanism for intergroup exchange. Particular attention is paid to dice games that, according to ethnographic accounts, were often played primarily by women. Building upon the pioneering compilation by Stewart Culin, game paraphernalia, playing rules, as well as odds and payoffs associated with wagering are described and mapped. The social and mythological contexts of dice games are also reviewed. Results indicate that making hitherto neglected links among exchange, gender, and gambling promises novel and more culturally informed ways of approaching the archaeological record.\n      </p>", "In the classic Dubins\u2014Savage subfair primitive casino gambling problem, the gambler can stake any amount in his possession, winning (1 \u2014 r)/r times the stake with probability w and losing the stake with probability 1 \u2014 w, 0 \u2264 w \u2264 r \u2264 1. The gambler seeks to maximize the probability of reaching a fixed fortune (the goal) by gambling repeatedly with suitably chosen stakes. This problem has recently been extended in a unifying framework to account for limited playing time as well as future discounting, under which bold play is known to be optimal provided that w \u2264 \u00bd \u2264 r. This paper is concerned with a further extension of the Dubins\u2014Savage gambling problem involving time-dependent parameters, and shows that bold play not only maximizes the probability of reaching the goal, but also stochastically minimizes the number of plays needed to reach the goal. As a result, bold play also maximizes the expected utility, where the utility at the goal is only required to be monotone decreasing with respect to the number of plays needed to reach the goal. It is further noted that bold play remains optimal even when the time-dependent parameters are random.\n      </p>", "We investigate the ability of expected utility theory to account for simultaneous gambling and insurance. Contrary to a previous claim that borrowing and lending in perfect capital markets removes the demand for gambles, we show expected utility theory with nonconcave utility functions can explain gambling. When the rates of interest and time preference are equal, agents seek to gamble unless income falls in a finite set of values. When they differ, there is a range of incomes where gambles are desired. Different borrowing and lending rates can account for persistent gambling provided the rates span the rate of time preference.\n      </p>", "Gambling is a prevalent recreational behaviour. Approximately 5% of adults have been estimated to experience problems with gambling. The most severe form of gambling, pathological gambling (PG), is recognized as a mental health condition. Two alternate non-mutually exclusive conceptualizations of PG have considered it as an obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder and a 'behavioural' addiction. The most appropriate conceptualization of PG has important theoretical and practical implications. Data suggest a closer relationship between PG and substance use disorders than exists between PG and obsessive-compulsive disorder. This paper will review data on the neurobiology of PG, consider its conceptualization as a behavioural addiction, discuss impulsivity as an underlying construct, and present new brain imaging findings investigating the neural correlates of craving states in PG as compared to those in cocaine dependence.

Gambling markets are among the most restricted and politicized markets in the American economy, yet economists interested in the economics of regulation have paid them little attention. Applying the economic theory of regulation to gambling markets can lead to greater understanding of current public policy. In addition, this application may shed light on the discipline itself, as to its ability to explain recurrent fluctuations in the extent of regulatory intervention over long periods of time. Broadly speaking, the interest group model is consistent with changes in the extent of regulation, including the recent period of liberalization and consequent growth in gambling.\n      </p>", "In the classic Dubins\u2014Savage subfair primitive casino gambling problem, the gambler can stake any amount in his possession, winning (1 \u2014 r)/r times the stake with probability w and losing the stake with probability 1 \u2014 w, 0 \u2264 w \u2264 r \u2264 1. The gambler seeks to maximize the probability of reaching a fixed fortune by gambling repeatedly with suitably chosen stakes. This problem has been extended in several directions to account for limited playing time or future discounting. We propose a unifying framework that covers these extensions, and prove that bold play is optimal provided that w \u2264 \u00bd \u2264 r.

However, a critical concern in calculating such estimates is the accuracy of self-reported expenditure data. In this paper, we review an emerging literature on estimating the proportion of expenditures from problem gamblers for different types of gambling, with a focus on the relationship between self-reported estimates and known spending. We then examine recent national survey data pertaining to this matter. After detailing several of the challenges in the effort to assess self-reported expenditures on different types of gambling, we recommend some methodological improvements that can be made in response to these problems.\n      </p>", "Two principal types of basketry were produced on the Plains in historic times, the twill plaited burden baskets used by horticultural tribes and coiled gambling baskets that saw a wider distribution. Coiled baskets were used in a gambling game, played primarily by women, in which dice were tossed into a basket. Little information on these baskets has been published and collection information for museum specimens is typically very poor. Building on Weltfish's (1930a) initial study, this paper presents additional data on over 80 Plains gambling baskets presently housed in U.S. museums and private collections. Archaeological, ethnohistorical, and technical information, including data from this analysis, supports a southern origin for historic Plains coiled and perhaps plaited basketry. Diffusion of technological features of basketry construction out of areas in northern Mexico and Trans-Pecos Texas likely began as much as 3,000 years ago and progressed more rapidly during the last 400 years. It is suggested that the spread of historic Plains basketry is related to a northward spread of agriculture with Caddoan and Siouan language speakers. Eastern Shoshone gambling baskets are viewed as resulting from a separate local basketry tradition with origins in the eastern Great Basin.\n      </p>", "In a well-publicized analysis of visitor suicides in three casino areas (Atlantic City, Las Vegas, and Reno), elevated suicide risk among interstate visitors was attributed to the presence of legalized gambling. A fundamental limitation of the analysis, however, was the absence of estimates for at-risk populations. In the present paper, an analysis of 1995 visitor-suicide rates (incorporating estimates for at-risk population) for 310 large US counties, including places both with and without gambling casinos, yields no evidence to support a gambling-suicide relationship.\n      </p>", "Gambling is a widespread form of entertainment that may afford unique insights into the interaction between cognition and emotion in human decision-making. It is also a behaviour that can become harmful, and potentially addictive, in a minority of individuals. This article considers the status of two dominant approaches to gambling behaviour. The cognitive approach has identified a number of erroneous beliefs held by gamblers, which cause them to over-estimate their chances of winning. The psychobiological approach has examined case-control differences between groups of pathological gamblers and healthy controls, and has identified dysregulation of brain areas linked to reward and emotion, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and striatum, as well as alterations in dopamine neurotransmission. In integrating these two approaches, recent data are discussed that reveal anomalous recruitment of the brain reward system (including the vmPFC and ventral striatum) during two common cognitive distortions in gambling games: the near-miss effect and the effect of personal control. In games of chance, near-misses and the presence of control have no objective influence on the likelihood of winning. These manipulations appear to harness a reward system that evolved to learn skill-oriented behaviours, and by modulating activity in this system, these cognitive distortions may promote continued, and potentially excessive, gambling.\n      </p>", "An abstract gambler's problem is formulated in a continuous-time setting and analogues are proved for some of the discrete-time results of Dubins and Savage in their book \"How to Gamble if You Must.\" Applications are made to problems of controlling a Brownian motion process.\n      </p>", "An analysis of the gambling process, a review of gambling research, and a survey of philosophical, phenomenological, and theoretical interpretations of gambling suggest that the motives for gambling are highly complex. However, many similarities were found between anecdotal accounts of gamblers' experiences and the philosophical, phenomenological, and theoretical interpretations of the gambling process. Many of the research studies corroborated both the anecdotal accounts and the interpretations. The most fruitful and veridical findings seem to come from studies that recognized gambling as adult play. The significance of studying gambling as play readily revealed itself, and it is hoped that future research expands on the existential and transpersonal nature of this aspect of gambling. We have come a long way in increasing our knowledge of gambling since Bergler's original interpretation of gambling as psychic masochism. Gambling may be psychic masochism for some, but it is without doubt psychic play pleasure for the vast majority of persons who gamble.\n      </p>", "To identify independent correlates of reported gambling problems amongst the Indigenous population of Australia. A cross-sectional design was applied to a nationally representative sample of the Indigenous population. Estimates of reported gambling problems are presented by remoteness and jurisdiction. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent correlates of reported gambling problems amongst individuals and their social and family networks. The analysis was stratified by remoteness. Indigenous people living in remote locations reported significantly more gambling problems than those living in non-remote locations. In non-remote areas, being female, having high personal income, being more socially connected (i.e. involved in an Indigenous organisation or living in a household where all members were Indigenous) and reporting community problems were associated with higher levels of reported gambling problems. In remote areas, multifamily households, participation in sports and cultural events, and reporting of community problems were associated with higher reported gambling problems, while having a relative removed from their natural family was associated with lower reported problems. Problematic gambling is clearly related to the social and environmental contexts in which it occurs. Harm minimisation policies that focus on a reduction in crowding (especially in remote locations), increased public awareness of the negative consequences of gambling, improving access to support services, and lifting the socioeconomic status of Indigenous people may reduce gambling related harm in the medium to long term.\n      </p>", "With the rapid expansion of gambling have also come concerns about underage gambling and youth problem gambling. Most studies of youth gambling have found that the majority of youths have gambled but do so infrequently and do not suffer any adverse consequences. A minority of youths, however, appear to be over-involved in gambling and are experiencing problems associated with their gambling. This is the first generation of youths to be exposed to such widespread access to gambling venues, ubiquitous gambling advertising, and general social approval of gambling. Gambling is the only so-called vice endorsed and promoted in many locales by both the church and state. On the one hand, youths are instructed by their teachers (and ostensibly their state department of education) that the way to get ahead in life is to study and work hard; on the other hand, their state lottery tells them that they need only to be lucky. Youths are adept at recognizing these apparent discrepancies and may be confused by this mixed message. Future research will need to address a number of gaps in our knowledge about youth gambling.\n      </p>", "The study of gambling behavior or of the impact of gambling on social institutions does not have a significant tradition in sociology. There have been a few attempts to test propositions associated with functionalism, alienation, anomie, and decision making; however, the results of these studies have proven inconclusive. Despite the fact that a large proportion of any society participates in gambling and that gambling is continuing to affect public policy in many jurisdictions, sociologists have not treated gambling as behavior worthy of serious investigation. This article reviews (1) the application of various sociological theories to gambling behavior; and (2) the results of the limited number of research efforts prompted by these perspectives.\n      </p>", "We show that prospect theory offers a rich theory of casino gambling, one that captures several features of actual gambling behavior. First, we demonstrate that for a wide range of preference parameter values, a prospect theory agent would be willing to gamble in a casino even if the casino offers only bets with no skewness and with zero or negative expected value. Second, we show that the probability weighting embedded in prospect theory leads to a plausible time inconsistency: at the moment he enters a casino, the agent plans to follow one particular gambling strategy; but after he starts playing, he wants to switch to a different strategy. The model therefore predicts heterogeneity in gambling behavior: how a gambler behaves depends on whether he is aware of the time inconsistency; and, if he is aware of it, on whether he can commit in advance to his initial plan of action.\n      </p>", "Opportunities for legal gambling of various types have expanded rapidly in the United States in recent years. Our study develops a series of theoretical arguments linking multiple dimensions of religious involvement\u2014 traditions, beliefs, practices, and networks \u2014 with the frequency of gambling activity. Relevant hypotheses are then tested using data from the Panel Study of American Religion and Ethnicity (PS-ARE), a recent nationwide probability sample of U. S. adults. Findings underscore the importance of co-religionist networks in deterring gambling. In addition, biblical inerrantists and members of conservative Protestant and sectarian groups are relatively disinclined to gamble. Religious attendance is also inversely associated with gambling frequency. Differences in gambling by religious tradition are amplified among persons with strong co-religionist networks. Several study limitations are noted, and promising future research directions on the dynamics and functioning of church-based networks are identified.\n      </p>", "The objective of this study is to evaluate the informational efficiency of the market for betting on horse races. Whereas the price data used in previous studies have been drawn largely from totalizator (parimutuel) odds, the data used in this study are derived from bookmaker odds. The availability of a series of prices throughout betting facilitates the use of filter tests to evaluate market efficiency. We conclude that this gambling market is efficient in the use of information supplied via both the movements in odds during the course of betting and the selections of newspaper tipsters. However, there is evidence to suggest that those with access to private information can earn positive returns from gambling.\n      </p>", "Some form of commercial gambling is legal in almost every state of the Union, reflecting substantial consumer demand for these activities. Yet gambling is regarded by policymakers, the media, and the public as an industry that is different and not subject to the economic laws that govern other industries. However, by examining gambling through standard measures such as consumer spending expressed as percentages of personal income, job creation, and gambling privilege tax receipts, it can be determined that gambling industries are not operating independently of the larger economic context. One of the fastest-growing sectors of the general economy, gambling accounts for about 10 percent of leisure expenditures.\n      </p>", "In all the criticisms that have shadowed the financial industry in recent years, the burden seems to be, that the reckless (as opposed to malicious) bankers too often took money of which they were the appointed stewards, and used it for speculation, especially in junk bonds. As Shaheen Borna and James Lowry argue in their \"Gambling and Speculation\" (the only article on gambling that I was able to raise on my computer) business speculation is probably wrong, since it is very like gambling, which everyone knows is wrong. But why is gambling wrong? If we, as the ethicists of business, are to adopt an uncharacteristically judgmental posture toward the most venerable American institutions, occupying the tallest and closest of American buildings, by calling their residents \"gamblers,\" then surely we ought to be able to provide an account of the blameworthiness of gambling itself. That, at any rate, is the challenge I set myself for this paper.\n      </p>", "We introduce Parrondo's paradox that involves games of chance. We consider two fair gambling games, A and B, both of which can be made to have a losing expectation by changing a biasing parameter \u03b5. When the two games are played in any alternating order, a winning expectation is produced, even though A and B are now losing games when played individually. This strikingly counter-intuitive result is a consequence of discrete-time Markov chains and we develop a heuristic explanation of the phenomenon in terms of a Brownian ratchet model. As well as having possible applications in electronic signal processing, we suggest important applications in a wide range of physical processes, biological models, genetic models and sociological models. Its impact on stock market models is also an interesting open question.\n      </p>", "Widespread resentment against gambling may be explained by the failure of gamblers to perform normally expected productive functions. The degree of antipathy differs according to clas. The chance element in human life is particularly exploited in those societies where status is largely competitive and dependent upon pecuniary standards. The stabilizing and routinized mechanisms of social living are antithetical to gambling, which resists arbitrary social control.\n      </p>", "Although legalized gambling, and in particular casino gambling, has become an increasingly important American leisure activity, it has not escaped extensive controversy.

More regions and countries are establishing casinos, regarded as attractions. How are gambling and tourism related? Why and how do casinos attract tourists? The characteristics of gambling games can be compared with the gambles of normal life, to help explain why such games are popular. Aligning that analysis with two types of tourism, wanderlust and sunlust, leads to a conclusion that the former type is not prone to gambling games. Evidence from several countries also suggests that the proximity to a political border with a neighbouring country or province that outlaws casinos can be a factor behind the success of tourist destinations offering gambling facilities for sunlust tourists. To overcome objections by local residents to proposals for establishing gambling facilities, pro-casino lobbies appear to use \"tourism\" as a kind of Trojan Horse, disguising the point that the major gambler market is in the local population. New Zealand is a recent case where this appears to be happening.\n      </p>", "The Foxwoods Casino Resort owned by the Mashantucket Pequots of Connecticut is the largest gambling casino in the Western world. The Pequots' Connecticut location enabled the tribe to open a casino, with accessibility to a large market and limited competition.

As attitudes and laws change, however, there is little chance that another Indian Foxwoods will be created here or elsewhere in the United States.\n      </p>", "A tiny utility of gambling is appended to an expected utility model for a risk-averse individual. It is shown that the model can explain small payoff gambles, large prize lotteries, and patterns of risk-seeking in the experimental evidence that are puzzling from the viewpoint of standard theory. At the same time, the model maintains expected utility theory's ability to explain insurance purchase, portfolio diversification, and other risk-averting behavior. The tiny utility of gambling could equally well be appended to models of risky choice other than the expected utility model.\n      </p>", "Individuals are socialized into a culture by means of various myths and rituals characteristic of that culture. Among the rituals that reflect, articulate, and transmit cultural myths are play and games. Materialism and competition are two distinguishing traits of the American character that are reflected in the games children and adolescents play; and in a world that encourages great expectations while offering diminishing opportunities for fulfillment, the playing of gambling games provides a form of recreation that is a product of and a contributor to prevailing cultural myths. The cultural context of childhood and adolescent socialization is discussed. Within this context, selected games combining chance and skill illustrate ways in which individuals learn to bet. As teacher and mirror of cultural values, such games may actually predispose Americans to gambling behavior, and it is not surprising that commercial gambling among adults has become such a significant social, economic, and cultural issue in contemporary American civilization.\n      </p>", "Le jeu parrain\u00e9 par l'\u00c9tat est maintenant chose commune au Canada et aux \u00c9tats-Unis.

This paper demonstrates that any utility of gambling almost unavoidably implies a violation of fundamental rationality properties, such as transitivity or stochastic dominance, for static choices between gambles. This result may explain why the utility of gambling, a phenomenon so widely discussed, has never been formalized in the economics literature. The model of this paper accommodates well-known deviations from expected utility, such as the Allais paradox and the coexistence of gambling and insurance, while minimally deviating from expected utility.\n      </p>", "We present an empirical test for the addictiveness of lottery gambling that exploits an exogenous shock to local market consumption of lottery gambling. It uses the sale of a winning jackpot ticket in a zip code as an instrument for present consumption and tests for a causal relationship between present and future consumption. This test estimates the time path of persistence nonparametrically. Data from the Texas State Lottery suggests that after 6 months, roughly half of the initial increase in lottery consumption is maintained. After 18 months, roughly 40 percent of the initial shock persists, though estimates become less precise.\n      </p>", "The paper reviews the case for special taxes on gambling services from a traditional public-finance perspective. Evidence suggests that high taxes are likely to hurt recreational consumers badly while not necessarily mitigating problem play. Taxes on gambling are also shown to be regressive, particularly when considered in combination with alcohol and tobacco duties. Finally the paper discusses the feasibility of taxing gambling when there is ready access to extraterritorial supply.\n      </p>", "In this article, we trace the evolution of Canadian gambling legislation and outline the various approaches to gambling regulation and control that are currently used in Canadian jurisdictions. The nature and scope of gambling in Canada are analyzed with a primary focus on the wagering formats, gambling clientele, and revenues generated from the activity. Canadian problem gambling prevalence rates are discussed along with the programs that have been instituted to mitigate the incidence and effects of problem gambling. Several features of Canadian gambling that differ from what is offered in the United States are highlighted, the growing citizen backlash against certain forms of gambling is examined, and we conclude with a brief critique of Canadian gambling policies.\n      </p>", "Experiments on high-pressure glow discharges in hydrogen (Gambling &amp; Edels 1956) have shown that by either increasing the current or gas pressure of the discharge, a sudden marked column constriction can be produced which results in the formation of an arc column. It was also found that this columnar glow to arc transition could be induced or reversed by control of the thermal conditions of the discharge, indicating that the transition depends upon the discharge temperature values. Relatively few temperature determinations have been made on hydrogen arc discharges, and no values are available for the glow discharge. We have measured therefore the relative intensities of the \u03b1 , \u03b2 and \u03b3 Balmer lines emitted by the discharge column section and derived the variation of the excitation temperatures T\u03b1 \u03b2 and T\u03b2 \u03b3 through the discharge transition region. The radiation measurements were made using a photomultiplier technique and yielded derived temperature values accurate to \u00b1 3%. Temperatures have been obtained for currents between 0\u00b7 25 and 10 A and for pressures from 0\u00b7 33 to 2 atm. In all cases, except at 2 atm, the current range included the transition condition. The results show that with current variation the excitation temperature curves always exhibit minima at the transition current, even though the latter is changed by the change in pressure conditions. Further, the values of the minima are constant at 3900 \u00b1 100 \u00b0 K for T\u03b1 \u03b2 and 2800 \u00b1 100 \u00b0 K for T\u03b2 \u03b3. The results indicate a thermally dependent mechanism of arc column formation in hydrogen. The results also show that when the column is in the glow state T\u03b1 \u03b2 &gt; T\u03b2 \u03b3. We conclude that in the glow state the distribution of excited state concentrations is non-thermal, being mainly governed by electron collisions. Above the transition current value the results show that the excitation temperatures rapidly converge, so that for the arc a thermal distribution of concentrations exists in the quantum states n = 3, 4 and 5. However, from considerations of the derived values of electron concentration and electron drift velocity and from calculations of the excess of the electron temperature over the gas temperature, we conclude that despite the equality of T\u03b1 \u03b2 and T\u03b2 \u03b3, true thermal equilibrium does not exist in the newly formed low-current arc column in hydrogen. The transition in the column from glow to arc is explained in terms of the change in effective thermal conductivity produced by the variations of dissociation with temperature.\n      </p>", "Using data from the large, 30-year prospective Dunedin cohort study, we examined whether preexisting individual differences in childhood temperament predicted adulthood disordered gambling (a diagnosis covering the full continuum of gamblingrelated problems). A 90-min observational assessment at age 3 was used to categorize children into five temperament groups, including one primarily characterized by behavioral and emotional undercontrol. The children with undercontrolled temperament at 3 years of age were more than twice as likely to evidence disordered gambling at ages 21 and 32 than were children who were well-adjusted at age 3. These associations could not be explained by differences in childhood IQ or family socioeconomic status. Cleanly demonstrating the temporal relation between behavioral undercontrol and adult disordered gambling is an important step toward building more developmentally sensitive theories of disordered gambling and may put researchers in a better position to begin considering potential routes to disordered-gambling prevention through enhancing self-control and emotional regulation.\n      </p>", "Behavioral axioms about preference orderings among gambles and their joint receipt lead to numerical representations consisting of a subjective utility term plus a term depending upon the events and the subjective weights.

Design: Cross sectional survey of households from private dwellings, conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), using a stratified multistage area sample design. Setting: Australia, 1998-99. Participants: Nationally representative sample of households (n = 6892). Main outcome measures: Expenditure on meals at restaurants, alcohol, alcoholic beverages at licensed premises, gambling, and insurance. Results: The odds of reporting expenditure on restaurant food and health insurance were 20% and 40% smaller for smoking than non-smoking households, respectively. The odds of reporting expenditure on alcohol (not including expenditure at licensed premises), drinking at licensed premises, and gambling were 100%, 50%, and 40% greater for smoking than for non-smoking households, respectively. Conclusions: The study suggests that smokers are more likely to engage in risky behaviour. Implementing smoking bans in licensed premises and gambling venues can provide an opportunity to reduce smoking prevalence. Quitting or cutting down smoking can provide opportunities for expenditure on other products or services, and enhance standards of living.\n      </p>", "On 3 August 1996, the National Gambling Impact Study Commission Act became law and established the nine-member National Gambling Impact Study Commission. Passed by unanimous voice vote in both the U. S. Senate and House of Representatives, the gambling commission was the congressional response to a gambling industry whose influence threatened to overwhelm not only state and local governmental decision making but also the objectivity of the court system via test cases to expand gambling.

We determine conditions upon the gambler's utility function under which stationary strategies allow the gambler to maximize his return. The class of utility functions which satisfies these conditions, termed nearly leavable shift invariant functions, is large and contains many of the common gambling utility functions. Moreover, this class is closed under uniform limits. These results are obtained with the setting of an analytic gambling house.\n      </p>", "Despite voluminous research examining religion as an integrative force and a mechanism of social control, relatively few studies have examined the association between religion and proscribed or morally ambiguous behaviors beyond crime and drug use. The present exploratory study examines the role of religion, at both the individual and county levels, in predicting self-reported gambling problems. Hierarchical linear models are employed to examine religion and self-reported gambling problems using the restricted use data of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. A negative association between religious attendance and problem gambling (at the individual level) is strongest when church adherents per capita is relatively high (measured at the county level). However, when the number of conservative Protestants per capita is relatively high, religious attendance (measured at the individual level) is associated with an increased risk of gambling problems. These countervailing findings are interpreted as supportive of the bonding and bridging capital thesis.\n      </p>", "We define a leavable stochastic game which is a possible two-person generalization of the classical red-and-black gambling problem. We show that there are three basic possibilities for a two-person red-and-black game which, by analogy with gambling theory, we call the subfair, the fair and the superfair cases. A suitable generalization of what in gambling theory is called bold play is proved to be a uniformly \u03b5-optimal stationary strategy for player I in the fair and the subfair cases whereas a generalization of timid play is shown to be \u03b5-optimal for player I in the superfair possibility.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Different treatment approaches and their effectiveness are reviewed, including Gamblers Anonymous and Gam-Anon, psychodynamic treatment, behavioral and cognitive approaches, and treatment based on an addiction model.

Using clinical data, advocates of a compulsion model indicate that a big win stimulates an unrealistic optimism that eventually leads to destructive gambling. However, drawing upon ethnographic data from a natural gambling group, I demonstrate that a bad beat (a significant monetary loss resulting from a seemingly inexplicable turn of events) often is the catalyst for the development of problem gambling. The attempt to cope with bad beats can disorient perceptions and lead to a continuing pattern of financial loss. Attribution theory provides a useful framework for understanding this process.\n      </p>", "We specialize our results on entropy-modified representations of event-based gambles to representations of probability-based gambles by assuming an implicit event structure underlying the probabilities, and adding assumptions linking the qualitative properties of the former and the latter. Under segregation and under duplex decomposition, we obtain numerical representations consisting of a linear weighted utility term plus a term corresponding to information-theoretical entropies.

Modern electronic and virtual gambling activities like video lottery terminals (VLTs) may have particular appeal to youth who have been raised in social environments that are increasingly dependent on information and communication technologies. The main objective of the study was to explore why youth gamble and what makes gambling activities like VLTs popular to youth in the places where youth live, study and play. The research is framed within a population health perspective that recognizes the role of social and physical environments in influencing health-related behaviours. Group discussions were conducted with youth to explore the popularity and appeal of gambling and VLTs, and how gambling fits into the daily routines of youth and the spaces they occupy. Methodologically, this research was conscious of responding to calls in the literature to analyze focus groups as an interactive group process rather a collection of individual responses, and to exercise analytic rigour by explicitly making the research team's positionality and the data collection process transparent. Group discussions revealed gender differences in the appeal of particular gambling activities with young males being more likely to discuss poker, dice, sports-betting and online gambling as exciting social activities, while females described lottery and scratch (instant win) tickets as fun solitary activities. Substantive results point to the need for interventions to address social aspects of gambling that appeal, in particular, to young males potentially through increased provision of healthier alternatives to social engagement and greater attention to young people's use of space.\n      </p>", "The demand for gambling, 155.--Elasticity of demand, 156.--Demand for bookmakingin Nevada, 157.--Parimutuel betting, 158.--Price, tax, and state revenue, 160.\n      </p>", "           ", "The English literature on gambling is examined from the early sixteenth to the mid-eighteenth centuries to try to discover the relationship between gambling and the development of the probability calculus. Throughout this entire time period, there is an overwhelming preoccupation in the literature with cheating at games of chance. The acts of cheating remain constant through time. However, the methods of cheating take various forms: for example false dice, legerdemain at cards and dice, perfect shuffles and card counting. Some probability calculations begin to creep into this literature near the end of the seventeenth century. What is demonstrated in this paper is that, contrary to the accepted folklore and even though there is some evidence that gamblers did have a concept of probability, gambling itself provided very little stimulus to the development of probability theory. In the other direction, the development of the probability calculus had a profound effect on gambling, namely in the formulation of a strategy of play. These strategies, first devised by Edmond Hoyle in the mid-eighteenth century and applied initially to the card game of whist, used very simple results in probability. As a result of this historical analysis, it is necessary to reanalyze the events surrounding the emergence of probability in the seventeenth century.\n      </p>", "Whether stationary families of strategies are uniformly adequate for a leavable, analytically measurable, nonnegative gambling problem whose optimal return function is everywhere finite is a question which remains open.

The new image is replacing the previous one of sinner or criminal. This article traces the roots, causes, and phases of pathological gambling. The sociocultural roots of pathological gambling are seen as distinct from gambling itself. The work of sociologists, psychologists, psychiatrists, and others is summarized herein, and different types of pathological gamblers are examined. Three phases of the career of the pathological gambler are outlined: the adventurous, or winning phase; the losing phase; and the desperation phase. The gambler's career progresses with increasing problems in all spheres of life, including relations with family members and friends, gambling associates, employment, and finances. Eventually the gambler has reduced life options, which include suicide, imprisonment, running away, and seeking help. Two major sources of help, Gamblers Anonymous and professional counseling, are examined, and their prospects and difficulties are revealed. Projections are made for future developments in the area of pathological gambling.\n      </p>", "Mainstream financial institutions have never been able to provide generally prevailing service levels in poor communities. In the resulting partial-service vacuum, blacks invented numbers gambling. Numbers-gambling banks became sources of capital and a major savings device of urban black communities. In conjunction with the usury industry, numbers banks framed an alternative institutional system for the savings-investment cycle in the slum. Numbers banking illustrates the conjoint contribution of institutional and cultural causes in analysis of poverty.\n      </p>", "Prior to 1950, gambling activity was generally prohibited at the federal and state levels. Since that time, a movement has developed to legalize various forms of gambling, first lotteries and more recently casino operations. Federal policies against gambling, supported by Congress's power over interstate commerce, have been principally motivated by a desire to control organized crime. They have been more successful at curtailing certain forms of gambling, chiefly illegal casinos, than they have been at cutting down organized crime itself. State policies toward lotteries have shifted from prohibition to state authorization as a means of raising revenue. Controversial, they appear to be a fixed feature of modern fiscal policy. Long limited to Nevada, casino operations are now found in New Jersey, and they are widely under examination for adoption elsewhere. Organized crime influence in allied services and unions, if not the casinos themselves, remains a serious problem. Reconsideration of fundamental policies toward gambling should take into account their economic, political, social, and moral as well as legal implications.\n      </p>", "This paper describes the process whereby excessive gambling is being defined as both a disease and a serious social problem. Gamblers whose repeated losses lead to serious financial and psychological difficulties are increasingly being labeled \"compulsive\" or \"pathological.\" I use a model advanced by Conrad and Schneider (1980) to delineate this process. Clinicians developed the prevailing illness model from accounts of those seeking treatment to stop gambling. Although researchers working in natural gambling settings have found little empirical evidence of compulsive behavior, various clinicians and non-medical help groups staunchly advocate a medical model. The latter groups, aided by an increased middle-class awareness, have gained public support and currently control the maintenance of therapeutic programs. Since this control is based more on political dominance than on scientific achievement, the efficacy of prevailing treatment programs can be questioned.\n      </p>", "Aging is associated with atrophy of the frontal lobes of the brain, which are the seat of executive functions. Because successful social functioning often requires executive control, aging can lead to unintended social changes via deficits in executive control. In this article I review evidence that, due to losses in executive control, aging leads to increased prejudice and social inappropriateness and, under certain circumstances, increased depression and problem gambling. I then discuss theory and research suggesting possible interventions that might ameliorate unwanted social changes brought about by executive decline.\n      </p>", "The Vardi casino with parameter 0 &lt; c &lt; 1 consists of infinitely many tables indexed by their odds, each of which returns the same (negative) expected winnings \u2014c per dollar. A gambler seeks to maximize the probability of reaching a fixed fortune by gambling repeatedly with suitably chosen stakes and tables (odds). The optimal strategy is derived explicitly subject to the constraint that the gambler is allowed to play only a given finite number of times. Some properties of the optimal strategy are also discussed.\n      </p>", "The Kelly strategy, risking a fixed fraction of one's gambling capital each time when faced with a series of comparable favourable bets, is known to be optimal under several criteria. We review this work, interpret it in the context of spread betting and describe its operation with a performance index. Interlocking spread bets on the same sporting event are frequently offered. We suggest ways of investigating which of these bets may be most favourable, and how a gambler might make an overall comparison of the bets from different firms. Examples illustrate these notions.\n      </p>", "In an examination of the verbal explanations ordinary gamblers provide for their conduct, it was found that the motive of \"play, leisure, and recreation\" was most often given to explain their behavior, with the related motive of \"relieving boredom and generating excitement\" ranking a distant second. Significant variations in these responses were found according to sex and social class. Explanations of why other people gamble differed markedly from explanations of one's own gambling behavior. Regarding this finding, we suggest that respondents were providing socially acceptable vocabularies of motives to defend self by neutralizing the social stigma attached to gambling and/or by justifying one's monetary gains and losses.\n      </p>", "As small communities throughout the country felt the loss of federal programs and funding, four gold-mining towns in South Dakota and Colorado turned to the legalization of limited-stakes gambling as a means of economic revitalization. All four used the preservation of their historic Old West images to legitimate gaming, but differences in state legislation resulted in different patterns of development. In Deadwood, South Dakota, many small casinos were established, with most gaming tax revenues going toward the town's historic preservation. In Colorado, fewer but much larger casinos emerged, with the returns for historic preservation available to projects across the state, with the gambling communities of Cripple Creek, Central City, and Black Hawk benefiting little. Retail businesses were cannibalized as gambling became the dominant industry in all four towns. Resident populations and schools experienced little change; most of the change occurred in vehicular traffic, law enforcement, and the utilization of infrastructure.\n      </p>", "There has been a tendency in past literature to treat all forms of gambling alike. Studies about one form have been generalized to all forms. Such an approach fails to see the possibility that different factors may be influencing different types of gambling. In this paper it is shown that the need for chances to get ahead (for males) and exposure to other bingo players (for females) influence the frequency of bingo playing. The major factor contributing to lottery ticket buying is job stability. Finally, age of the numbers bettor and the need for excitement are the significant factors in explaining the frequency of numbers betting.\n      </p>", "This article examines problems presented to the police by their gambling enforcement responsibilities during the four decades following Prohibition's repeal. In this period repeated gambling corruption scandals put the police in disrepute. These scandals accurately reflected the underlying corruption of an effort that was essentially symbolic and not supported by a significant element of the otherwise law-abiding population. The fundamental source of the corruption was the vulnerability of all illegal gambling organizations to police harassment. This corruption also contributed to organized crime's dominance in illegal gambling. The federal government mounted a major campaign against illegal gambling between 1962 and 1972. That effort failed to reduce the availability of gambling services but may have helped reduce the dominance of organized crime by depriving local police of their ability to franchise monopolies. Together with changing attitudes toward gambling, the entry of the state into many gambling markets, and changes in the nature of the games themselves, the federal enforcement effort helped end the era in which gambling enforcement was a major responsibility for the police.\n      </p>", "Operation of large-scale gambling by crime syndicates requires both a popular desire to consume illegal services and at least tacit acceptance by local officials. In \"Wincanton,\" a middle-sized industrial city, city officials were paid to overlook gambling, and also engaged in other corrupt activities. A survey of city residents indicated general tolerance or approval of gambling, but hostility toward all forms of official corruption. When corruption was exposed by federal investigators, Wincanton voters elected reform candidates for local offices. Analysis of voting patterns indicates that voting in reform elections parallels normal party voting patterns; a constant proportion of voters in each precinct in the city will deviate from their normal party allegiance following exposures of corruption.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "About $10 billion a year is spent by consumers worldwide on online gambling, and that number continues to grow.

Should other states follow their example? States seem to express slight moral concern about legalizing gambling, as witness the proliferation of lotteries and legal betting on horse races. Casino gambling is scarcely less moral than lotteries and horse racing, but it does have distinctive problems, notably a history of organized crime involvement and general shadiness. Neither Nevada nor Atlantic City offers a desirable model for other states considering legalization. Nevada's economy is thoroughly dependent upon the casino gambling industry, which dominates politics at every level. Atlantic City has enjoyed considerable prosperity as a result of casino legalization, but it has also experienced major problems, such as increased crime, higher housing costs, few jobs to local residents, and displacement of the elderly and poor. States considering legalization should not adopt Nevada's, New Jersey's, or England's qualification models. Instead, states should consider a resort-merit approach limiting number and location of casinos. Casino applicants would be selected on merit, after submitting proposals that include substantial information on corporate background and social and economic impact.\n      </p>", "This study examines the underlying economic and political dynamics that have led to the rapid proliferation of permitted gambling in the United States and other countries over the past decade. It notes that much of the justification for gambling has come from an attempt to exploit the economic rents and spillover benefits that accompany the legalization of gambling, and little is accorded the value that accrues to consumers of the commodity. A framework is developed to evaluate the impact of such considerations on the community and the region where gambling is permitted. Different types of casino-style gambling-destination resort casinos, urban casinos, and widely dispersed gaming devices-are evaluated in light of their relative impacts.\n      </p>", "The growth of legal gambling in the United States over the past 10-15 years has been phenomenal. This growth has directed increased attention to the potential problems of gambling behavior. For example, many religious organizations have spoken out in opposition to legalized gambling and discouraged members from gambling. However, little research has addressed the impact of religious practices or beliefs on gambling behavior or problems. This study uses a nationally representative sample of adults in the U.S. (n=2,406) to test the proposition that attendance at religious services and importance of faith in God attenuate the likelihood of problem gambling. The results of a Poisson GEE model indicate that frequent attenders are less likely than others to report gambling problems, but that importance of faith in God has no effect on problem gambling. This suggests that the social integration afforded by religious attendance is more important than intrapersonal religious salience in affecting problem forms of gambling.\n      </p>", "A proof is given for a gambling theorem which was stated by Dubins and Savage.
