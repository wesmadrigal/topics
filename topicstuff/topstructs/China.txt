It is divided into six major parts. The introduction points out the particular features of China's minority nationalities, such as widely ranging population sizes and geographical distributions, highly varied in cultural and physical traits, etc. The second part discusses the CCP's ideological origins from which the nationalities policy is formed. The Marxist-Lemmst-Maoist concepts related to the formation of nations, national equality, national self-determination, and withering of national forms are examined. The third part reviews briefly the CCP's nationalities policy prior to 1982, the year of proclamation of a new constitution, and suggests three historical stages, namely, the pioneer stage (1921-1935), the formation stage (1936-1949), and the stage of institutionalization (1949-1982). The fourth part analyzes China's present nationalities policy as viewed in connection with its 1982 Constitution, which the author regards as a compromise between the CCP's ideology and the nationalities' reality. The main points include the stress on national regional autonomy, \"Two Antis\" (antigreat Hanm'sm and anti-local nationalism), religious freedom, etc. The fifth part is an evaluation of the practicability of the present policy as well as the existing problems concerning the nationalities, such as the problem of national equality in form but inequality in practice. In the final part, from an anthropological point of view, the author concludes that the situation in the future is uncertain because of the fragility of the CCP's theoretical framework.\n      </p>", "Two species of Femsjonia are reported, including the new species F. rubra occurring on two members of Abies from southwestern China.

In China today approximately 700 million people-over half the population-consume drinking water contaminated with levels of animal and human excreta that exceed maximum permissible levels by as much as 86% in rural areas and 28% in urban areas. By the year 2000, the volume of wastewater produced could double from 1990 levels to almost 78 billion tons. These are alarming trends with potentially serious consequences for human health. This paper reviews and analyzes recent Chinese reports on public health and water resources to shed light on what recent trends imply for China's environmental risk transition. This paper has two major conclusions. First, the critical deficits in basic water supply and sewage treatment infrastructure have increased the risk of exposure to infectious and parasitic disease and to a growing volume of industrial chemicals, heavy metals, and algal toxins. Second, the lack of coordination between environmental and public health objectives, a complex and fragmented system to manage water resources, and the general treatment of water as a common property resource mean that the water quality and quantity problems observed as well as the health threats identified are likely to become more acute.\n      </p>", "With rapid economic development, energy consumption in China has tripled in the past 20 yr, exceeding 2.4 billion tons of standard coal in 2006. The search for new green energy as substitutes for the nonrenewable energy resources has become an urgent task. China has a variety of climates and is rich in potential biofuel plant species. Corn and cassava are used as the main raw materials for bioethanol production in China. At the end of 2005, bioethanol productivity had increased to 1.02 million tons produced by four companies, and bioethanol-blended petrol accounted for 20% of the total petrol consumption in China. According to the Mid- and Long-term Development Plan for Renewable Energy, the consumption of biodiesel in China will reach 0.2 million tons in 2010 and 2.0 million tons in 2020. This review is intended to provide an introduction to the distribution and development of biofuel crops and biofuel industry in China.\n      </p>", "We use disaggregate county-level production data to study the effects of economic reform on China's grain production between 1980 and 1990. China's grain production area is divided into five regions based on geographic, agronomic, and meteorological criteria. Regional grain production functions are estimated, and weather is explicitly modeled. The institutional impact of economic reform was found to explain about 38% of the production growth from 1980 to 1985. This is lower than the estimates reported in many previous studies. Regional differences in efficiency gains from economic reform and in the effects of weather on grain production are found to be significant.\n      </p>", "Grasslands are the dominant landscape in China, accounting for 40% of the national land area. Research concerning China's grassland ecosystems can be chronologically summarized into four periods: (i) pre-1950s, preliminary research and survey of grassland vegetation and plant species by Russians, Japanese and Western Europeans, (ii) 1950-1975, exploration and survey of vegetation, soils and topography as part of natural resource inventory programmes by regional and national institutions mainly led by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, (iii) 1976-1995, establishment of field stations for long-term ecological monitoring and studies of ecosystem processes, (iv) 1996-present, comprehensive studies of community dynamics and ecosystem function integrating multi-scale and multidisciplinary approaches and experimental manipulations. Major findings of scientific significance in China's grassland ecosystem research include: (i) improved knowledge on succession and biogeochemistry of the semi-arid and temperate grassland ecosystems, (ii) elucidation of life-history strategies and diapause characteristics of the native grasshopper species as one of the key grassland pests, and (iii) development of effective management strategies for controlling rodent pests in grassland ecosystems. Opportunities exist for using the natural grasslands in northern China as a model system to test ecosystem theories that so far have proven a challenge to ecologists worldwide.\n      </p>", "The waters off the tropical coast of South China host a wide variety of reef corals. From 1932 to 1978,325 species in 62 genera and subgenera of reef coral (Scleractinia) as well as eleven species of Hydrocorallinian were identified as having a wide distribution in China. Although Heliporina and Tubiporina are widely distributed in the Indo-pacific region, particularly the two species Tubipora music a and Helipora caerulea (Pallas), they are not abundant in Chinese reefs. One species of Stylaster (Stylaster elegans Verrill) is found around the Xisha Islands.\n      </p>", "Bulbophyllum wuzhishanensis, a new species from Hainan, China, is described and illustrated.

Three major results were found. First, MNCs that entered China in an earlier year had a higher level of profit than those that entered in a later year. Second, equity joint ventures (EJVs) had a higher profit level than cooperative operations or wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries. Third, MNCs that utilized well the location advantages in China had a higher profit. We also found that EJVs were more likely to survive compared to cooperative operations, while wholly owned subsidiaries did not differ from EJVs. The findings are based on a 2-year study of about 1000 MNC operations in China.\n      </p>", "In this paper, the effect of China's imports on importing countries' inflation is examined. Using data from 1994 to 2003, it is argued that China's export surge is an important contributor to lowering inflation in importing countries. Using fixed and random effect models, we identify a statistically significant negative correlation between the share of a country's imports from China and its rate of inflation.\n      </p>", "This paper is concerned with the consequences of population growth and rapid urbanization in China since the beginning of economic reforms.

In the China watershed, the anthropogenic reactive N has far exceeded the terrestrial bio-fixed N in nature, and human activities have significantly altered the N cycling in this region. In 1995, the total amount of anthropogenic reactive N in China reached 31.2 Tg with 22.2 Tg coming from synthetic fertilizers and 4.18 Tg from NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; emission from fossil fuel combustion, and the input of recycling N amounted to 30.5 Tg, consisting mainly of human and animal excrement N, reflecting the intensity of the human activity. The sink of N includes N in the harvested crop, denitrification and storage in agricultural soils, transportation into waterbodies and volatilization of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. N output and storage in soil reached up to 48-53 Tg. Of this amount, 14 Tg was in the harvested crops, 12 Tg stored in agricultural soils, 11 Tg transported into waterbodies, 5 - 10 Tg denitrified in the soils and a limited amount exported through food/feed. In this paper - besides the N budget in the China watershed - the N budgets and especially N transports into waterbodies in the Changjiang, Huanghe and Zhujiang river valleys are estimated.\n      </p>", "Aqu\u00ed se abordan las relaciones entre M\u00e9xico y China en el sexenio 2000-2006 desde diversas perspectivas.

Cornejo includes in his analysis each country's self-representation and the other's perception as a starting point for explaining their relationship. Additionally, he takes into account the emergence in Mexico of a prevailing belief that makes China responsible for the failures of the Mexican economic project and has revived some extreme expressions of anti-Chinese racism.\n      </p>", "Internal migration has become an increasingly significant element in the redistribution of population and in the planning of socio-economic development in China. Based on the 1987 survey, the 1990 census, and additional data from the 1995 survey, this paper investigates the regional concentration of China's interprovincial migration flows and the gender differential in such concentration. The analysis was undertaken using the coefficient of variation (CV) indices of out- and in-migration flows for each province. The CV indices confirm that each province has its own migration flow field, and the differences lie mainly in the degree of the regional concentration. The asymmetry between out- and in-migration flow fields suggests that China's interprovincial migration has resulted from an interplay of several factors, such as the uneven distribution of the economy, inflow of trans-national capital into pockets of its provinces, and relaxed control over rural-to-urban migration. Findings also illustrate that a select number of provinces play an important role in redistributing migrants in China, specifically, in provinces such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan and Hunan. Investigation of the gender differential in the CV indices reveals that female migration flows are more regionally concentrated than male migration flows. This finding is significant in understanding migration constraints for Chinese women.\n      </p>", "Arcofaciella verrucosa Fennah, 1956 (Hemiptera: Fulgoroidea: Delphacidae) is here reported from Fujian in southeastern China and Tibet in southwestern China for the first time. This represents the first record of the genus Arcofaciella Fennah, 1956 in mainland China. These new species records extend the range of Arcofaciella westward considerably, the genus having been previously known only from Hong Kong and Taiwan.

The trends of the human development in the period of market transition in several provinces of China were discussed in terms of the impact on public health as well as economic development. The association of the main principal component obtained from our study and the human development index reported by the United Nations Development Programme was estimated by the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.\n      </p>", "North China faces severe water scarcity--more than 40% of the annual renewable water resources are abstracted for human use. Nevertheless, nearly 10% of the water used in agriculture is employed in producing food exported to south China. To compensate for this 'virtual water flow' and to reduce water scarcity in the north, the huge south--north Water Transfer Project is currently being implemented. This paradox--the transfer of huge volumes of water from the water-rich south to the water-poor north versus transfer of substantial volumes of food from the food-sufficient north to the food-deficit south--is receiving increased attention, but the research in this field has not yet reached further than rough estimation and qualitative description. The aim of this paper is to review and quantify the volumes of virtual water flows between the regions in China and to put them in the context of water availability per region. The analysis shows that north China annually exports about 52 billion m\u00b3 of water in virtual form to south China, which is more than the maximum proposed water transfer volume along the three routes of the Water Transfer Project from south to north.\n      </p>", "The evolution of foreign entry in the form of joint ventures and wholly owned manufacturing operations is examined as a staged process shaped by experience and imitation dynamics at the firm, group, and industry levels of analysis. The expansion of South Korean firms into China between 1987 and 1995 lends support to the staged view of foreign entry. Over time, technology-intensive firms are more likely to abandon joint-venture entry modes, owing to contractual hazards. Firms in the same business group are found to imitate each other's choice of joint ventures and wholly owned plants. Firms in the same industry mimic each other's choice of wholly owned plants, though not of joint ventures.\n      </p>", "We analyze the impact of China's growth on the exports of other Asian countries, distinguishing China's demand for imports from its penetration of export markets. We account for the endogeneity of Chinese exports by applying instrumental variables in a gravity model with country-pair fixed-effects. We find that China's crowding-out effect is felt mainly in markets for consumer goods and hence by less-developed Asian countries, not in markets for capital goods or by the more advanced Asian economies. Meanwhile, China has been sucking in imports from its Asian neighbors, but this effect is mainly felt in markets for capital goods. Hence, more and less developed Asian countries are being affected very differently by China's rise.\n      </p>", "Studies of temporary migration in developing countries often focus on rural outmigration and are preoccupied with problems it may bring to cities. Using a unique data set from two surveys conducted in Zhejiang province, China, this paper examines the other side of the coin -temporary migration from urban places -and thereby provides an important complement to studies focusing on rural-urban migration. The analysis identifies three types of temporary migrations: on-business, economic, and family-related. Using multinomial logit model, the analysis suggests that the three types of temporary migration differ significantly from each other in both their causes and migrants' socioeconomic characteristics; so does urban-urban migration from urban-rural migration. The considerable urban-rural temporary migration attests to the fact that temporary migration is not a one-way process; its positive selectivity further indicates that a considerable human capital flows from urban to rural areas through urban-rural temporary migration, which provides rural areas much needed science and technology and becomes an important facilitating factor of rural socioeconomic development.\n      </p>", "Using daily data from May 2000 to January 2004, this study examines the risk, return, securities selection, and market timing performance of China's securities investment funds (SIFs), in comparison with the performance of the SIFs in the United States. Our results indicate that China investment funds show superior market timing performance, while U.S. fund managers display stronger securities selection ability. These results imply that the potential synergy for Sino\u2013U.S. joint venture investment funds could be tremendous. Additional analysis of the trading volume of closed-end funds in China illustrates that investors' interests in SIFs are strongly and positively related to fund performance. Results also indicate that Chinese investors favor professionally managed funds more than direct investment in stocks during negative market conditions.\n      </p>", "Regional rural inequalities in China since the reform are examined based on Theil's regional inequality index. By using data from the three zones (east, central and west) and provinces in the period 1980-2002, I find that China's rural regional inequality has an overall increasing trend with a short period of decrease during the entire reform period. However, the trends vary in different indicators and different geographical scales. The trend of income inequality does not always match that of rural economic inequality. The decomposition of Theil's regional inequality further reveals that, since 1987, interregional inequalities between the eastern, central and western regions have been more serious than provincial inequality within the regions themselves. For example, when rural non-agriculture inequality decreased substantially within the east, it increased greatly within the west. Similarly, the income inequality increased within the west and the east but decreased within the central region. China's regional rural inequality remained at a high level and the coastal/interior income differential continued to increase.\n      </p>", "This paper reports on recoveries of waders (Charadrii) banded in Australia and recovered in China.

Formed in a relatively unindustrialized province and promoted by local authorities as their primary revenue base, Yunnan's tobacco economy gained a headstart through concentrated resource support and ad hoc regulatory flexibility. Its further growth has drawn greatly on intraregional spillovers of knowledge of locally based institutional innovation, which foster and enhance conventional forms of external economies. Implications for the study of regional economies are discussed.\n      </p>", "The rate of sea-level rise during the past hundred years has been 2-3 mm/year along China's coasts; sea level will probably continue to rise in the future. The process has decreased wave winnowing of submerged coastal sediment but enhanced erosion by waves breaking on the upper beaches. Following the rise of sea level, river-channel slopes have been reduced, decreasing fluvial sediment discharges to the ocean. Human impacts through diverting river discharge and constructing dams in the lower reaches of rivers for fresh water supplies have also upset coastal processes. Paucity of coastal sediment supply is a world-wide phenomenon which, when combined with the frequency of storm surges and El Nino events to strengthen hydrodynamics, invariably results in beach erosion and the landward retreat of sand barriers along the coastal zone. Overpumping of groundwater and overloading by constructions on the delta plain and lowland coast have had serious effects: the average rate of relative sea-level rise is 24.5-50.0 mm/year in TianJing, the old Yellow River delta area along the Bohai Sea, 4.5-5.5 mm/year in the modern Yellow River delta, and 6.5-11.0 mm/year in the Shanghai area of the Changjiang River mouth. These rates are much higher than the mean annual rate of 1.4 mm/year. Under the circumstances saltwater intrusion has been changing river water salinity and fresh water quality. Storm surges often cause the lowland coast to be inundated and flooded. All such effects are ultimately the result of human activities.\n      </p>", "China's postwar commitment to economic self-sufficiency required a rapid expansion of heavy and chemical industry (HCI). Such a strategy is especially risky for low-income countries since it conflicts strongly with their comparative advantage in labour-intensive activity. It makes heavy demands on scarce capital resources and yields low returns, implying sizeable costs in terms of consumption foregone. For China the risks are compounded by a relatively poor natural resource base and the weak allocative efficiency of the command economy system. HCI is also difficult to downgrade. The Dengist reforms seek to shift resources from investment to consumption and from HCI to light industry and agriculture. They pose dilemmas over whether to discard existing HCI plant, upgrade it, or build new plant - and where. Reform is hampered by the rigidity of Chinese institutions which prepetuated HCI dominance through an unintended investment surge 1984-88.\n      </p>", "Study of Otidea shows that temperate China is especially rich in species of this genus.

Almost the entire body of empirical research on OCB is based on studies conducted in the United States, using U.S. employee populations as samples. Taking an inductive approach, we examined forms of OCB in the People's Republic of China (China). From a diverse sample of 158 employees and managers in 72 state-owned, collective, town and village, foreign-invested, and private enterprises in China, we collected 726 OCB incidents or items that were commonly observed in the workplace. We then subjected these to a content analysis to identify major forms of OCB. Results of our analysis revealed 10 dimensions of OCB, with at least one dimension not evident at all in the Western literature, and four that do not figure importantly in established OCB measures. The type of organizations influenced the reporting of several forms of OCB. Results suggested that Chinese formulation of OCB differs from that in the West, and is embedded in its unique social and cultural context. We discuss these results in terms of their implications for future research in OCB.\n      </p>", "Since 1949, when the People's Republic of China was founded, a great deal of researches on the exploitation of shoaly land, which is considered as an important kind of land reserves in China, have been done in China. With reference to the published papers and some conference presentations, almost 52 years' history of shoaly land research in China will be elaborated in the paper. Firstly, an outline of the distribution and exploitation situation on shoaly land is presented. Secondly, based on the analysis of the research progress we have achieved in the past, a systematic research framework in the future for shoaly land is developed from multi-disciplinary point of view. In our opinion, the study of shoaly land in China can be divided into two stages with the separation point of the late 1980's. The earlier period centered on the general investigation of the basic conditions of shoaly land. The latter is a period with many multi-disciplinary researches, during which there has been specialization on theoretical research and technological break-throughs, initiating the public participation in the management of shoaly land development. As to the further research, we propose a two-level research framework on shoaly land in China, namely, basic research and applied research. Basic research includes the research on basic conception, dynamic evolution, and developing theories. Applied research is divided into three categories, social research, economic research, and ecological research. Finally, some priorities of the researches are pointed out which should be given special attention, such as statistical caliber, dynamic monitoring, legislation, administration system, public participation, industrial development policy, resource grading and evaluation, and environmental impact assessment.\n      </p>", "This paper discusses variation in the organization of ceramic production among family specialists who use a fast wheel technology in south-central Guizhou, China. There is considerable variation in intensity, output, and scale among potting house-holds in two communities. The paper evaluates the utility of two kinds of potential material indicators for this variation: 1) spatial organization for different steps in production (forming vessels, preparing clay, drying vessels, firing), and 2) degree of vessel uniformity. Although degree of uniformity of vessels does vary with intensity for some dimensions, other factors such as experience of the potter and consumer demand need to be considered. Material features of production areas are more obvious indicators of variation in intensity and output.\n      </p>", "A new species of the genus Coladenia, C. neomaeniata is described and illustrated from Weixi County, Yunnan Province, China.

Based on current trends, in the foreseeable future China is likely to become the largest economy in the world. China's dramatic growth may be envied by other developing economies, but for management scholars it presents an exciting intellectual puzzle. In this paper we describe the empirical context of China today, review contemporary research on Chinese management and organizations, and describe the nine papers in this special issue of Organization Science. The papers provide a close examination of how massive corporate transformation in China has influenced interfirm relationships, affected opportunity structures and social processes, and modified individual behaviors within firms. We identify the many paradoxes in this intellectual terrain and present a guide to the challenging research agenda ahead. We recommend that scholars of organizations think deeply about China as a context and consider China as an empirical setting where the boundaries of existing knowledge on organizations can be extended.\n      </p>", "Many systematic relationships among Chinese white-toothed shrews of genus Crocidura are presently unresolved. In this paper, a taxonomic revision of Crocidura from Southern China is presented. We studied 338 specimens from Burma, China, Korea, Pakistan, Turkey, Middle and Central Asia, and Russia (Appendix I), 285 of which had complete skulls that were analyzed with principal component and discriminant analyses. Results indicated that 6 species of Crocidura can be recognized in South China. C. fuliginosa occurs in Southwestern and Eastern China, C. attenuata is broadly distributed throughout Southern China, and C. horsfieldii is restricted to the southern part of China. C. vorax and C. rapax, usually placed as synonyms of the European C. russula, are recognized as 2 valid species whose ranges overlap in Southwestern China. C. shantungensis of Eastern Asia extends to the northern part of Southern China and is distinct from C. suaveolens and C. gmelini of Middle and Central Asia, respectively.\n      </p>", "This paper assesses productivity spillovers from R&amp;D, exports and the very presence of foreign direct investment (FDI) in China's manufacturing sector, based on a panel of more than 10,000 indigenous and foreign-invested firms for 1998-2001. There are positive inter-industry productivity spillovers from R&amp;D and exports, and positive intra- and inter-industry productivity spillovers from foreign presence to indigenous Chinese firms within regions. OECD-invested firms seem to play a much greater role in inter-industry spillovers than overseas Chinese firms from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan within regions.

Thus, in order to understand life and gain insights into disease pathogenesis, genetic information embedded in the sequence of DNA base pairs comprising chromosomes should be deciphered. The stories of investigating the association between phenotype and genotype in China and other countries further demonstrate that genomics can serve as a probe for disease biology. We now know that in Mendelian disorders, one gene is not only a dictator of one phenotype but also a dictator of two or more distinct disorders. Dissecting genetic abnormalities of complex diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, mental diseases, coronary heart disease and cancer, may unravel the complicated networks and crosstalks, and help to simplify the complexity of the disease. The transcriptome and proteomic analysis for medicine not only deepen our understanding of disease pathogenesis, but also provide novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Taken together, genomic research offers a new opportunity for determining how diseases occur, by taking advantage of experiments of nature and a growing array of sophisticated research tools to identify the molecular abnormalities underlying disease processes. We should be ready for the advent of genomic medicine, and put the genome into the doctors' bag, so that we can help patients to conquer diseases.\n      </p>", "The Euphorbiaceae is an extensive family of plants that includes about 300 genera and 5000 species and is mainly distributed in tropical areas. For a long time this family has been recognized and reported for its anti-cancer components, anti-hepatitis B components and carcinogenic factors. In the literature of ancient traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), 33 species of plants from 17 genera of Euphorbiaceae have been mentioned as medicines. We report here the results of our recent investigation. The locations under investigation were in Guangdong Province, Guangxi Zhuang Nationality Autonomous Region and Hainan Province in southeastern China. There were 111 species within 35 genera of medicinal Euphorbiaceous plants reported, along with their folk usages. Among them, 17 species are used to treat snakebites. It was observed that most of the species within the Euphorbiaceae family contained toxic components. In fact, only a few species are employed as widespread medicines throughout China-most species are recognized only as local minority tribe medicines.\n      </p>", "Oral historians have written little about the challenges of interviewing people whose native language is different from their own.

After analysis on regional variations of the dynamic environment along the modern coast of South China and comprehensive comparisons among on-the-spot observational data in different seasons from different foreshore profiles of the sandy coast situated on different geographic coastal sections, the morphodynamic characteristics of the sandy beaches along the coast of South China were explored. The tectonic movements and sea level changes occurring during the regional geologic historical processes lay down a basis for the development of large-scale sandy coastal geomorphology. After the postglacial, sea level was relatively stable. Under recent coastal dynamic conditions, the scouring-silting adjustment made by the actions of supply, migration, and accumulation of the sandy beach sediments made decisive effects on the state of the beach face. Among them, the wave-tide index (K value) is an important indicator that reflects these changes. The K values of sandy beaches along the coasts of South China are generally more than 1. Most of the sandy beaches are predominated by wave-dominated geomorphology, with a rather great beach face gradient. There correlation between the K value and seasonal deformation degree of the sandy beach is positive. The grain size of the beach face sediment is closely related to the K value and also is affected to a smaller extent by the seasonal changes of wind wave and the geographic distribution of the various shorelines.\n      </p>", "This article examines the effects of dyadic ties and interpersonal trust on referrals and investment decisions of venture capitalists in the Chinese and Russian contexts. The study uses the postulate of transitivity of social network theory as a conceptual framework. The findings reveal that referee-venture capitalist tie, referee-entrepreneur tie, and interpersonal trust between referee and venture capitalist have positive effects on referrals and investment decisions of venture capitalists. The institutional, social and cultural differences between China and Russia have minimal effects on referrals. Interpersonal trust has positive effects on investment decisions in Russia.\n      </p>", "In 2000, 2002, and 2006 we captured small mammals in the Liangshan Mountains, Mabian Dafengding National Nature Reserve and Meigu Dafengding National Nature Reserve, Sichuan Province, China. Among the collected specimens we identified a new species of the genus Proedromys. Its identifying characteristics are its relatively long tail, broad upper incisors without grooves, comparatively short lower incisors, and features of the molar teeth. The glans penis of the new species also is distinctive, the proximal and distal bacula are bony, whereas the lateral bacula are only slightly ossified. The proximal baculum is flask-shaped, the distal baculum is cap-shaped, and the lateral bacula are stick-shaped. This species is associated with high-elevation spruce-fir forest habitat, an unusual setting for Proedromys across its geographic range.\n      </p>", "The sable (Martes zibellina) shows close phylogenetic ties to the Eurasian pine marten (M. martes) and American marten (M. americana), but ecological comparisons among these species are uncommon. To test for hypothesized similarities among these sibling species of martens, we studied diets of, and prey selection by, sables in northeastern China for three winters. We inferred diets from feces of sables, and availability of small mammals from snap trapping. Remains of mammals occurred in 89% of feces of sables, followed in frequency by soft and hard mast, and birds. Sables were highly selective from among small mammals, preying upon Clethrionomys rufocanus more than expected based on captures of small mammals, shrews (Sorex caecutiens) less than expected, and Clethrionomys rutilus in proportion to its availability. This pattern closely parallels that of the American marten, providing evidence for functional similarities among martens inhabiting boreal forests.\n      </p>", "The present article examines the causes of deforestation in southwest China on the basis of listening to peasants' own descriptions of their role in illegal timber cutting. It finds that a sense of \"relative deprivation\" amongst China's rural poor has encouraged poor environmental management. Peasants justify illegal tree cutting by pointing to China's rapidly increasing inequalities, their lack of economic opportunity, and the absence of economic support from the (corrupt) government. These issues, combined with continuing institutional problems with forest management after decollectivization, convince peasants that ignoring environmental conservation edicts and cashing in on their trees is a good choice. This study identifies relative poverty and social discontent as major factors driving deforestation.\n      </p>", "A survey of ardeid nesting colonies in Hainan Province, China, was made between May and August 2004 and recorded 5,287 nests of four species (Little Egret Egretta garzetta, Cattle Egret Bubulcus ibis, Chinese Pond Heron Ardeola bacchus and Black-crowned Night Heron Nycticorax nycticorax), in 18 colonies in the northern area. Chinese Pond Heron was the dominant nesting species (62% of the total nests), while the Black-crowned Night Heron was the least abundant (4%). Numbers of the Chinese Pond Heron in Hainan is probably related to the presence of extensive ricefields in this area. Fewer numbers of nests of all species in the field were recorded compared with expected obtained from nest densities over a ricefield-dominated landscape in a previous study of ardeid nest abundance in central China. This suggests that nest density in central China could not be applied in Hainan and the assumption of 5 million nests in China requires further study. Based on available information for south China, numbers of nesting Cattle Egret and Chinese Pond Heron in Hainan (75% of total nests of each species), Black-crowned Night Heron in Guangdong and Guangxi, and Great Egret in Hong Kong (80%) are of regional importance. Using media to invite readers to report nesting colonies is recommended for similar surveys in a large area as it provides a cost effective approach to minimize sampling effort.\n      </p>", "Results of surveys in the last ten years have produced more information on the wintering of the Scalysided Merganser (Mergus squamatus), showing that the species is dispersed widely in mainland China, with the majority of the wintering flocks of birds along the lower branch of the Yangtze River.\n      </p>", "A new species of Collembola, Ptenothrix huangshanensis, is described from China. /// Una nueva especie de Collembola, Ptenothrix huangshanensis es dedscrita de China.\n      </p>", "Recent economic data reveal that, at the infant stage, China's outward foreign direct investment (FDI) is biased towards tax havens and Southeast Asian countries and are mostly conducted by state-controlled enterprises with government sanctioned monopoly status. Further examination of China's savings rate, corporate ownership structures, and bank-dominated capital allocation suggests that, although a surge in China's outward FDI might be economically sensible, the most active players have incentives to conduct excessive outward FDI while capital constraints limit players that most likely have value-creating FDI opportunities.

The two major dynamics behind these processes are discussed in detail: (1) institutional reform, which has resulted in a mixed regulation mechanism composed of both market competition and legacies of the past command economy, and which has also allowed more freedom in the decisionmaking of indigenous auto firms, and (2) globalization of production in terms of a huge inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI), mainly in the form of joint ventures. As a result, a new geography of the industry has emerged, with clear features of decentralization of production and a shift of production toward the coastal region. The paper concludes that the gradual institutional reform in China has led to a \"path-dependent\" development of its auto industry and that auto-producing FDI has been deeply embedded in the Chinese institutional environment. This involvement in China's auto production can be aptly described as \"embedded globalization.\"\n      </p>", "The project on Introducing New Contraceptives in Rural China (INCRC) was carried out between 1991 and 1996 in four counties of rural north China. The experimental component involved the random assignment of a multipronged treatment to four townships in each county. Two townships per county served as controls. The scale of the project made it nearly impossible to maintain the integrity of the experimental model that was at the core of the project's design. In spite of the massive numbers of people in the catchment areas of the study (&gt;100,000), the experimental design was of low power, with but eight controls on sixteen treatments; when random assignment is at higher levels of analysis, masses of individual observations only create greater precision in the estimation of higher-order observations.

High-resolution palaeo-temperature reconstructions and the complete record of warfare incidence in eastern China were compared. Results show that warfare frequency in eastern China (its southern portion in particular) significantly correlated with the Northern Hemisphere temperature oscillations. Almost all peaks of warfare frequency and dynastic changes occurred in cooling phases. We suggest that in historic China, the reduction of thermal energy during cooling phases significantly shrank agricultural production. Such ecological stress interacted with population pressure and China's unique historic and geographic setting to bring about the high frequencies of warfare over the last millennium.

The aim of this study was to investigate abortion decisions and reported sex ratios at birth in the context of successive family planning policies in Huaning County, Yunnan Province, in China. Abortion patterns and reported sex ratios at birth of a random sample of 1,336 women aged 15-64 were analysed for the period 1980-2000, in relation to parity and sex of previous children. There was a male bias in the abortion pattern during the 1980s, but by the end of the 1990s most pregnancies of women with two children were being terminated. Sex ratio at birth rose from 107 in 1984-87 to 110 between 1988-2000 in Huaning. While women's reproductive decisions were influenced by son preference over the whole period, the means used to ensure a son differed with changing family planning policies. We conclude that rising sex ratios in the context of falling fertility and modernisation is an alarming socio-demographic issue, which defies historical experience.

Wuhan has been called an \"oven\" city because of its hot summers. Approximately 4.5 million permanent residents live in the 201-km\u00b2 core area of the city. Method: We used a generalized additive model to analyze pollution, mortality, and covariate data. The estimates of the interaction between high temperature and air pollution were obtained from the main effects and pollutant-temperature interaction models. Results: We observed effects of consistently and statistically significant interactions between particulate matter \u2264 10 \u03bcm (PM\u2081\u2080) and temperature on daily nonaccidental (p = 0.014), cardiovascular (p = 0.007), and cardiopulmonary (p = 0.014) mortality. The PM\u2081\u2080 effects were strongest on extremely high-temperature days (daily average temperature, 33.1\u00b0C), less strong on extremely low-temperature days (2.2\u00b0C), and weakest on normal-temperature days (18.0\u00b0C). The estimates of the mean percentage of change in daily mortality per 10-\u03bcg/m\u00b3 increase in PM\u2081\u2080 concentrations at the average of lags 0 and 1 day during hot temperature were 2.20% (95% confidence interval), 0.74-3.68) for nonaccidental, 3.28% (1.24-5.37) for cardiovascular, 2.35% (-0.03 to 4.78) for stroke, 3.31% (-0.22 to 6.97) for cardiac, 1.15% (-3.54% to 6.07) for respiratory, and 3.02% (1.03-5.04) for cardiopulmonary mortality.

Their sipunculan identity is evidenced by the general morphology of the animals (sausage-shaped body with a slender retractable introvert and a wider trunk) and by other features, both external (e.g. perioral crown of tentacles, and hooks, papillae and wrinkle rings on the body surface) and internal (U-shaped gut, and the anus opening near the introvert-trunk junction). The three fossil forms (Archaeogolfingia caudata gen. et sp. nov., Cambrosipunculus tentaculatus gen. et sp. nov. and Cambrosipunculus sp.) have striking similarities to modern sipunculans, especially the Golfingiidae to which their evolutionary relationships are discussed.

We achieved quality assurance of analysis of at least 10% of the wells containing &gt; 50 \u00b5g/L As using hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry and silver dithiodicarbomate spectrometry. Our best estimate of the population exposed to &gt; 50 \u00b5g/L As in drinking water was 582,769. This is probably an underestimate for China because of the limited area surveyed. In a survey of 135,492 individuals in eight provinces, we used the National Diagnosis Standard for Endemic Arsenicosis and identified 10,096 cases of arsenicosis with various degrees of skin lesions. The arsenicosis occurrence rate of 7.5% is likely an overestimate, because the survey focused more on known and suspected endemic areas of arsenicosis. The occurrence of arsenicosis correlates positively with the percentage of wells containing &gt; 50 \u00b5g/L As, or at a ratio of 1 to 5%. Based on both the amount of As in well water and the rate of occurrence of arsenicosis, Shanxi province, Inner Mongolia autonomous region, and Jilin province are the top three areas in China as of 2005 for exposure to endemic As from drinking water. Our survey also identified exposure to high levels of As from wells in several provinces and from the indoor burning of coal containing high levels of As in Shaanxi province. These areas, however, have not had any reports of previous arsenicosis endemics. In the endemic areas, the average rate of occurrence of arsenicosis at advanced stages was 1.2%, possibly because of a long exposure time of &gt; 20 years; the rate of occurrence increased to 2.7% when we included a high dose of As exposure from the indoor burning of coal. Mitigation to reduce As exposure remains a challenge in rural China.\n      </p>", "Silt loading is a critical problem in the use of the Yellow River for irrigation, domestic, and industrial water supplies.

Still, the level of the river bed continues to rise higher above the surrounding North China Plain. Millions of rural and urban lives are threatened by the possibility that an embankment will break and unleash a horrendous flood, as had happened numerous times prior to 1949. Earthquakes could cause similar castrophes. Increased populations in cities, expansion of irrigated land, and rapid industrialization have brought about locally severe water shortages. This, in turn, has led to surface and groundwater pollution by salt and heavy metals, lowering of groundwater levels, land subsidence, and salt water intrusion from the Bo Sea. Interbasin water transfers from the Yangtze River in the south to relieve water shortages in the north have been proposed for decades but remain controversial. The high cost of dams, canals, tunnels, pumping, and water control systems needed for the transfer has been a major objection. Other factors have been the adverse environmental impact in both the Yellow and Yangtze river watersheds of transfers and, importantly, the questionable need of the transfers if water conservation practices were used widely and effectively.\n      </p>", "This paper provides information on the fauna of Mantodea in China. Based on literature records of Beier (1933) and Tinkham (1937) and material identified by the authors, 110 species and 2 subspecies of mantids - belonging to 8 families, 19 subfamilies and 48 genera - are reported from China. Nine genera and 7 species were recorded for the first time from China. About 88% of the Chinese mantid fauna is Oriental in origin, while 7% is Palaearctic and about 5% widespread. China is rich with endemic species, amounting to 65 species.\n      </p>", "A new species from China, Thrixspermum tsii (Orchidaceae), is described and illustrated and its relationships to T. centipeda and T. subulatum are discussed.\n      </p>", "As upland farmers in Southeast Asia change from shifting cultivation to permanent agriculture and lose access to swidden-fallow forests and their resources, they are introducing economically important forest and fallow plants into their house gardens. We describe this process in Daka, a village of Hani ethnicity in Yunnan Province, China. Daka smallholders collect both seeds and seedlings from fallow forests and transfer the plants to house gardens, initiating the transformation of wild species to a cultivated or semi-domesticated one. Two kinds of species are commonly transferred from swidden fallows to house gardens. Some are particularly rare, others are plants in great demand. Between 1998 and 2000 Daka households earned an average of US$68.20 annually from the products of fallow forests. We also found that villagers harvest and use 76 plant species from fallow forests and 126 species from house gardens. Twenty-two species found in house gardens that had been transferred from fallow forests. Households vary widely in the frequency with which they engage in this pattern. We believe that local knowledge of these practices is a potentially important resource in the development of other areas of smallholder farming.\n      </p>", "China and Russia represent major economies in transition from command economies, yet their paths to the market have differed greatly. Their divergent approaches have helped create distinct institutional environments. This study focuses on a particularly important strategic decision firms face-alliance partner selection. The study's results suggest that China's more stable and supportive institutional environment has helped Chinese firms take a longer-term view of alliance partner selection, focusing more on the potential partner's intangible assets along with technological and managerial capabilities. In contrast, the less stable Russian institutional environment has influenced Russian managers to focus more on the short term, selecting partners that provide access to financial capital and complementary capabilities so as to enhance their firms' ability to weather that nation's turbulent environment. This study contributes to knowledge about the influence of the institutional environment on alliance partner selection decisions for firms domiciled in transition (and emerging) economies.\n      </p>", "One new subspecies and one new variety of Pedicularis L. from the Hengduan Mountains region in southwestern China are described.

These limestone forests were characterized by phanerophytes making up ca. 78% of the total species and those with mesophyllous leaves comprising 75%. Ecological species groups based on their habitat preferences were discerned from field observations: the species exclusive to the limestone habitats make up 10% and the preferents make up ca. 12% of the total limestone flora. From these limestone forests, 1394 vascular plant species belonging to 640 genera and 153 families were recorded. Based on their distributions, 12 biogeographic elements at the generic level and nine at the specific level were recognized. About 90% of the seed plant genera (over 90% of the species) were tropical; furthermore, 35% of the seed plant genera (65% of the species) have tropical Asian affinities. In a comparison with other regional floras from southern China and tropical Asia, the limestone flora of southern Yunnan revealed closer affinity to tropical floras than to temperate elements of eastern Asian floras. This limestone flora is thus tropical and part of the tropical Asian flora at its northern margin.\n      </p>", "The Shimentai Nature Reserve in Yingde County, Guangdong Province, China, established recently in a subtropical upland forest area, has served for ages as an essential and customary source of livelihood for local people. Assessment of forest usage indicates heavy reliance by villagers on its diversified biotic resources. This forest dependence, associated with socioeconomic factors such as distance from village, ethnic origin, out-migration of rural youngsters, and a local tradition of conservation, is unlikely to decline in the near future. The reserve management recognizes the need to address the livelihood issues of local people and to win local support. A pragmatic adherence to provincial and higher-level policies that exclude forest-tapping activities could lead to more people-versus-park conflicts, which would dilute fundamental conservation objectives. A more enlightened and localized approach that nurtures a synergy between limited forest use and conservation while helping to develop new income sources could furnish workable alternatives.\n      </p>", "From 1929 to 1937, Chinese reformers in the Mass Education Movement attempted to transform pigs and pig breeding in Dingxian, Hebei, through the importation of an American breed of pig and its hybridization with local pigs. This episode provides a case study for the investigation of the roles played in scientific work by local Chinese materials and practices on one hand and Western scientific principles and methods on the other. Reformers were conscious that the wholesale importation and implementation of Western science had failed China in the past and suspected that it would fail again. Their chief concern was that the new pig should raise production levels but still \"suit local conditions.\" But \"conditions\" and \"methods\" do not play equal roles in science, and reformers did not require the scientific methods of pig breeding to negotiate with local methods. Despite their attention to local conditions, the reformers thus assumed that modern, Western science was universal in nature and that it could and should be applied universally, replacing local knowledge and practices.\n      </p>", "A new species of Arrhopalites is described from China.

Two isolates from Cucumis sativa in Beijing and C. melo in Xinjiang were also identified as P. drechsleri, the first report of this species in the mainland of China.\n      </p>", "The share of wheat in China's overall grain production and consumption has increased since economic reform. China is also a large wheat importer, but imports are erratic. In the literature, there is disagreement over future prospects for per capita wheat consumption in China and imports. Most of the wheat is consumed in rural areas where the majority of the population resides and where consumers have shifted from coarse grains and potatoes to wheat. We analyze rural wheat consumption using household data from two provinces. We find there is evidence to support a contention that China's per capita wheat consumption may not grow very fast in the future and could actually fall.\n      </p>", "The coastline of China stretches for about 18,000 km. China's coastal areas concentrate 70% of big cities and 41% of the total population of the nation. Fifty-five percent of the gross national product and 65% of the national industrial output are made in these areas. Although the areas occupy less than 1/7 of the total territory of China, they create more than half of the national wealth. China's coastal areas can be acclaimed as China's \"wealth-belt\", \"lifeblood-belt\". However, most of the areas are low- lying lands with relatively gentle topography. The possible harmful impact caused by the relative sea level rise on the area is studied. This study includes the increase in occurrence frequency of storm surge and flood; the extension of inundation of low-lying land; the acceleration of paralyzation of the existing drainage system; the intensification of erosion and retreat of sea shore; and the increase of the submergence of coastal areas, salt intrusion and the pollution of fresh water resources. Several factors concerning the disaster hazard evaluation for coastal areas resulting from sea level rise are discussed. They include: adopting under-estimated value of sea level rise rate; taking the economic and social developments of a coastal area as a threshold of the hazard evaluation for the area; combining sea level rise with crustal vertical movement; taking account of the capability and adequacy of the protection facilities. The index for these factors and a method of integrative hazard evaluation are presented. Finally, the data for the Chinese regional sea level rise in recent years are also summarized in the paper. The estimated value of future relative sea level rise rate in some main coastal areas of China is 5-8 mm/a. This means that the relative sea level rise in the areas may reach 30-45 cm by 2050 in general, and in a few areas, such as the Old Yellow River Delta, may be 70- 80 cm.\n      </p>", "China now manufactures or assembles over 50% of the world's products. However, the world has been reeling from daily accounts of defective \"Made in China\" products. China has been at the forefront of growing concern, not only about its products and enterprises, but also about its business ethics. This article analyzes recent events connected with the Made in China label from the perspective of evolving Chinese business ethics. Part 1 analyzes three of these events. Part 2 details and analyzes the state of business ethics in China today. Part 3 concludes by exploring the future of business ethics in China. The main conclusion is that business ethics in China faces two kinds of ethical challenges: how to restrict the lawless in as short a period of time as possible and how to protect and advance the interests of employees, investors, and the public through corporate management and public administration.\n      </p>", "This article examines the changes in behavioral norms in modern China and argues that the promotion of good manners and civilities constituted an important part of China's nation-building project. By focusing on the reform of movie theater etiquette in the first half of the twentieth century and situating it in the context of China's struggle to combat colonialist and racist discourse about the country, the article sheds new light on the New Life Movement and other state-sponsored national campaigns that were aimed at disciplining the Chinese people to conduct themselves in ways compatible with Western norms.\n      </p>", "China, as one of the ancient centers for diversity of domesticated plants, has a rich germplasm resource in vegetable and fruit crops. The Cucurbitaceae is one of the three most important families in that country as sources of vegetables. In a continuing effort to inform the West on Chinese uses of the Cucurbitaceae, we update a 1989 description of cucurbits in China with the inclusion of information from untranslated Chinese literature and further field observations. Included are 63 species valued as fruits, vegetables, and/or medicinal herbs. Each of these species is discussed in the context of its usages in China. We summarize the economic role of cultivated cucurbits in present day China. Finally, the infraspecific variation within the economically important domesticated cucurbits (Citrullus lanatus, Cucumis melo, Cucumis sativus, Cucurbita spp., Lagenaria siceraria, Luffa spp., and Momordica charantia) is discussed. / [Abstract in Chinese]\n      </p>", "A new species in Rubiaceae (Gardenieae), Rothmannia daweishanensis Y. M. Shui &amp; W. H. Chen, is described from Yunnan, China. Its diagnostic characters and close relationship with Rothmannia vietnamensis Tirvengadum are discussed.\n      </p>", "We use data from the nationally representative 1997 Demographic and Reproductive Health Survey to examine use of maternity services in rural China. The data indicate that roughly 60 per cent of women had at least one prenatal visit, while 40 per cent had a professionally assisted birth over the period 1988-97. Despite China's shift from a more socialist to a more privatized health care system, use of maternity services increased over this period. These increases are consistent with the push toward integration of reproductive health into family planning that emerged after the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development and the 1995 Fourth World Women's Conference held in Beijing. At the same time, we find indirect evidence that the target-based population policy may well have exerted downward pressure on use of maternity services; differences by parity are marked and multilevel models predicting use of maternity services indicate underdispersion at the individual level.\n      </p>", "The Tianmu Mountain National Nature Reserve (TMNNR) preserves the only primeval forest of China cedar (Cryptomeria fortunei) in the world. In order to assist in planning the protection of China cedar habitat and propose a scientific zoning project for TMNNR, we established a nature reserve geographic information system (NRGIS) of TMNNR using a geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS). In support of NRGIS, we produced a 3-dimensional simulation of TMNNR and obtained a predictive model through a combination of logistic regression modeling and multivariate analysis. The results demonstrate that slope direction, soil type, and annual precipitation are the main factors affecting China cedar habitat. The existence probability of China cedar increases with (converted) slope direction and annual precipitation. Yellow soil (FAO classification) is more suitable for the growth of China cedar in comparison to red soil (FAO classification). Finally, we predicted suitable habitats for China cedar using a model and function zoning for TMNNR. We suggest that it is necessary to analyze key factors affecting China cedar habitat in order to ensure appropriate conservation measures. NRGIS has been found indispensable for studying, protecting, and managing China cedar forest and TMNNR. NRGIS provides not only modeling information but also the means for monitoring this rare species, identifying suitable locations for reintroduction, and carrying out visible and dynamic management of the whole reserve.\n      </p>", "Agenda 21 is the voluminous policy document that emanated from the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. Using a brief case study of China's energy use - specifically its use of coal - this article illustrates the degree to which objectives of Agenda 21 are reflected in China's economic development policies and practices. China has started to shift its economic development toward a more environmentally sustainable trajectory, as reflected in its changing policies on energy derived from coal burning. We conclude that while China's environmental policies have been stimulated in part by Agenda 21 and other international environmental undertakings, such 'soft' international agreements are far from the only important determinants and variables. Many factors, such a bureaucratic infighting, disagreements between central and provincial governments, as well as corruption, severely delimit the extent and efficacy of energy policies and other environmental regulations. Because economic growth remains central to development goals, existing environmental policies are only a start toward environmentally sustainable development. Environmental decline still outpaces sustainable development in China, and this will continue for many years to come.\n      </p>", "A new species of Lomariopsidaceae, Teratophyllum hainanense S. Y. Dong &amp; X. C. Zhang, from Hainan Island, China, is described and illustrated. It is related to T. koordersii, but differs in having 10 to 12 pairs of pinnae in mature bathyphylls and the scales of sterile pinnae on both midribs and veinlets as substellate, appressed, and small, with diameters only to ca. 0.2 mm. The genus Teratophyllum itself is reported from China for the first time.\n      </p>", "Explaining grass richness patterns over broad geographic scales is a central issue of biogeography and macroecology. In this investigation, we document the richness patterns of grasses across China's nature reserves, and discuss their possible explanations at national and regional scales using grass richness data coupled with information from climatic and topographical variables. Our results suggest that the water-and energy-related variables and elevation range (a surrogate of topographical heterogeneity) represent the primary explanations for the variation in grass richness across China's nature reserves. Significant relationships were found between energy and all grasses, water and C\u2083 grasses, and the combination of water and energy and C\u2084 grasses at the national scale. Topographical heterogeneity is strongly associated with grass richness across China, whereas climatic constraints to grass diversity vary regionally. In regions of high rainfall, the presence of C 4 grasses is determined by annual potential evapotranspiration and sunshine hours; the climatic constraint to C\u2083 grass richness in a large and varied region is sunshine hours; whereas in regions of low soil temperature, the temperature determines the grass richness pattern. Our results also suggest that water variables alone do not represent the primary predictor of grass richness at the regional scale.\n      </p>", "In the era of state socialism under Mao, land in China was treated as a means of production and was allocated administratively by the state free of charge. To accommodate the interests of foreign investors without violating the socialist principle of public ownership, the Chinese state has, since the 1980s, separated land use rights from land ownership and opened up a new market track for the conveyance of land use rights to commercial users. The result has been a distinct dual-track land system in the new political economy, characterized by significant asymmetry for arbitrage. Discrepancy between the state's intention and actual outcome has been a consequence of the internal diversity of power relations concerning land development. Our data analysis reveals that the loss of farmland to nonagricultural developments has slowed down in recent years, that the state's intention to increase land use efficiency has been severely compromised by the socialist legacy, and that illegal activities are pervasive. The Chinese socialist state is better seen as a dynamic, complex, heterogeneous, and self-conflictual institutional ensemble in and through which the forces and interests of different levels of the state are contested, negotiated, and mediated.\n      </p>", "We the report results of a coordinated mitigation effort aimed at reducing arsenic (As) exposure in three counties of Guizhou province, China. Mitigation occurred in 2005 and encompassed 21 villages with 47,000 inhabitants, who were exposed to high levels of As in their diet through consumption of As-contaminated chili peppers and corn dried over unventilated stoves that burned coal containing high levels of As. The coal was mined by villagers from local pits. Inhalation of air that contained high levels of As contributed to approximately 25% of the daily As intake of 6-9 mg. Before mitigation, a baseline survey of 45,364 residents in 2004 identified more than 2,800 individuals with arsenicosis. The survey also found that many residents were aware of the health effects of As in general but lacked in-depth understanding of the link between coal use and arsenicosis. Consequently, an overwhelming majority (&gt; 95%) continued to use high-As coal. This survey provided the basis for a health education campaign that promoted lifestyle changes coupled with the shutting down of local coal pits and the installation of 10,000 new stoves with chimneys for ventilation. The cost of the mitigation was about 4 million Yuan RMB (US$500,000) and was financed mostly by the government. A postmitigation response survey in 2005 found that &gt; 85% of the residents now associate the use of coal with arsenicosis; &gt; 90% correctly learned to operate the new ventilated stoves; and &gt; 90% dry corn and chili peppers outdoors in the sun. Urinary As concentrations in the region decreased from 0.198 \u00b1 0.300 mg/L (n = 144) in 2004 to 0.049 \u00b1 0.009 mg/L (n = 50) in 2005 in individuals with arsenicosis (p &lt; 0.01), which is consistent with the behavior changes.\n      </p>", "We compare the age and sex structure of China's 2000 population census to an estimate of that structure derived from a projection from the 1990 census. Based on China's own official estimates of demographic change, our intercensal analysis indicates a shortfall in enumeration of more than a quarter of all children under age 5 and an eighth of those between 5 and 9, a total of nearly 37 million children missing in the 2000 census. We show that the shortfall is primarily due to underreporting of children in the census. Sex differences in child underreporting were fairly minor. Child underreporting in China is not unprecedented, but child underreporting rates in 2000 were about triple those of previous censuses. We attribute the increase primarily to policy changes beginning in the early 1990s that held officials at all jurisdictional levels personally responsible for enforcing birth quotas.\n      </p>", "The Jiaojiang River estuary, China, is very turbid with depth-averaged suspended sediment concentration commonly exceeding 10 kg m-3 at spring tides. An asymmetry of the tidal currents is caused by shallow water effects. This asymmetry generates, at spring tides, a turbidity maximum in the estuary near the salinity intrusion limit. The rates of erosion and deposition are controlled by the tidal currents and the constants in the equations for those rates were inferred from 12 days of data. A transient sediment layer forms at slack tide and is eroded at a threshold velocity of about 0.3-0.4 m s-1 which is about half the value of the erosion threshold velocity of the consolidated sediment underneath. The data were used to calibrate a sediment dynamics model which was successful at reproducing most of the observations at spring tides. The model suggests that the bulk of the sediment in the estuary is imported from coastal waters. This sediment originates from the Changjiang (Yangtze) River which is located 200 km further North. The Manning's bottom friction coefficient is found to be smaller (by 30%) than that in non-turbid estuaries and this may be due to the presence of a fluid-mud layer near the bottom.\n      </p>", "Many of the natural forested ecosystems that still remain in mainland China are being cleared with potentially detrimental effects on woody plant species diversity on both local and regional scales. The most extensive stand of subtropical broad-leaved forest remaining in China is located in Yunnan Province. In an effort to document the influence of human-induced disturbance on Yunnan's woody flora, floristic inventories were conducted in a stand of primary forest and in regrowth stands located in its interior and along its outer margin in the Xujiaba Nature Sanctuary in the Ailao Mountain Range. Of particular interest was the location of the disturbance relative to the primary forest source area. A total of 134 woody plant species representing 74 genera and 43 families were recorded. The floristics of the two regrowth stands were significantly different from each other, with &amp;lt 10% of their respective floras comprised of co-occurring species. The interior regrowth stand had a higher number of co-occurring species with the primary forest; however, &amp;gt 40% were still non-co-occurring. The principal families represented in the primary forest and the interior regrowth stand were Aquifoliaceae, Berberidaceae, Fagaceae, Lauraceae, Rosaceae, Smilacaceae, Symplocaceae, Theaceae, and Vacciniaceae. The three dominant species with relative importance values ranging from &amp;gt 5% to 18% in both the primary forest and the interior regrowth stand were Castanopsis wattii, Lithocarpus jingdongensis, and Symplocos sumuntia. The edge regrowth stands had the lowest species diversity and were dominated by the native pine Pinus yunnanensis, with a relative importance of 24%. The principal families represented in the edge regrowth stand were Betulaceae, Ericaceae, Fagaceae, Myricaceae, Pinaceae, and Theaceae. Only the Fagaceae and Theaceae were well-represented in all three stands. The results of the study document the low species diversity in post-cutting regrowth on the margins of the primary forest as compared with post-cutting regrowth in the forest interior.\n      </p>", "In this paper, a new subspecies of Hippophae (Elaeagnaceae), H. rhamnoides subsp. wolongensis Y.
