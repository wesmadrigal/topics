This article explores systematically the contrasting effects of these strategic determinants on rent generation and rent appropriation using the entire population of French biotech firms (1994-2002). Findings indicate that science and money do not unconditionally go together-the direct relationship between rent-accruing resources (e.g., patents or articles) and rent appropriation varies depending on the type of resources and the strategic orientation. Moreover, the effects of strategic determinants differ for rent generation vs. rent appropriation: 1) technological application diversity undermines a firm's capacity to appropriate rents-in particular for research-oriented firms; 2) exploitation alliances favor rent generation but hinder rent appropriation; 3) service-oriented firms exhibit significantly better performance than research-oriented firms. Such evidence challenges the emergence in the biotechnology industry of a 'one-best' strategic trajectory, as represented by research-intensive start-ups funded by private money engaged in publishing and patenting races.\n      </p>", "The article examines the localisation effects within biotechnology, concentrating in particular on the French case. The paper has two strands of analysis. The first presents a detailed statistical survey of the French biotechnology sector. Among other things, the survey shows that a) localisation effects within France are strong, b) in terms of dependence on local cluster infrastructures (especially universities and related public research institutes), most firms progress from an entry stage in which they are very dependent on local cluster infrastructures, to a mature phase in which their networks become more national/international in focus and c) French firms can be grouped into four general types of firms, ranging from \"type 1\" growth oriented product firms, to \"type 2\" niche market players, \"type 3\" subsidiaries of larger firms, and \"type 4\" firms that have been acquired. Localisation effects differ across these firms, esp. across type 1 (international) and type 2 (very localised) firms. The second strand of analysis consists of a review of the localisation and related cluster literature, with implications drawn out for localisation and knowledge spillovers within biotech clusters. It examines the relative effects of scientific centres proximity and compares them to the public policy of start-up creation.\n      </p>", "The dynamic growth of biotechnology in Germany in recent years has an obviously spatial pattern. Some regions show a substantial potential for start-ups and young firms of this new industry whereas others lag behind. The paper is discussing this unequal spatial development elaborating perspectives which derive from recent debates about regional innovation systems. The biotech regions Munich and Rhineland, both winner regions of the BioRegio Competition are described and compared with the situation in Hamburg where biotechnology is much less important. We analyze the degree and relevance of locally integrated inputoutput relations of innovation systems based on typologies of the wide range of firms within the biotechnological value chain and the forms of co-operation. Moreover, a qualitative estimate is given with respect to the significance of untraded relationships and regional knowledge spillovers. Factors favoring local integration are compared with those favoring input-output systems on a transatlantic scale. The paper discusses the question whether the biotech industries in the regions of Munich, Rhineland and Hamburg represent identifiable regional systems of innovation. Our findings show that the spatial concentration does not necessarily imply a close network of input-output relations within a cluster. Knowledge and technology transfer often happens on a international, mostly on the North Atlantic scale. The exchange of tacit knowledge, however, is facilitated by spatial proximity. This underlines the importance of untraded relations and \"relational assets\" in a region. Political and institutional support for building a \"business community\" can reduce barriers to launch risky commercialization processes.\n      </p>", "This paper presents an account of the progress of the integration between the Danish and Swedish parts of the Oresund Region within the world of science, with emphasis on biotech. The paper is based on data from the database Science Citation Index Expanded. The amount of co-authorships produced by agents from each side of the region is analysed for a 12-year period (1994-2005) and used as an indicator to show how the integration is proceeding. Each of the co-authorships is examined to shed light on the nature of the interactions, thereby identifying the agents most involved in collaboration. Furthermore, the development in co-authorships within the region is compared to the development in co-authorships between the Oresund Region and four selected reference areas. Our findings indicate that there has been a substantial increase in both the number of co-authorships overall and within biotech solely. The rise in co-authorships between the two parts is proceeding at a faster pace than the rise in coauthorships between the Oresund Region and the reference areas. The overall results of this paper indicate a growing integration of the biotech sector in the Oresund Region.\n      </p>", "Under the pressure of increased global competition and processes of concentration, the pharmaceutical giants are reorganizing their innovative capacities. Technology and research and development (R&amp;D) play a key role in the competitive strategies of multinational pharmaceutical companies. This article analyzes the interrelation of the far-reaching but spatially selective international expansion of R&amp;D and technology of a major Swiss pharmaceutical company and its anchoring in regional arenas of innovation. It combines this international technological expansion with a perspective on integrating spatial and social proximities. Multinational corporations (MNCs) tend to locate their R&amp;D activities in regions that are characterized by a richness of knowledge. The structure of inter- and intrafirm networks is shaped by the geography of talent. The Swiss pharmaceutical giants made substantial efforts to anchor themselves in regional arenas of innovation, such as the San Francisco Bay Area, Boston, and San Diego. A case study of a pharmaceutical giant's embedding in the biotech arena of San Diego reveals how oligopolistic rivals fight over privileged access to spatially concentrated bases of technology. MNCs attempt to create, complement, and substitute spatial proximity with other types of social proximities, internal as well as external to their own organizations. These efforts contribute to the generation of specific global-local interfaces in the processes of global scanning, transferring, and generating new pharmaceutical compounds and technologies.\n      </p>", "Policy makes great claims about the future possibilities of the biotech industry in Karnataka. This paper tries to dissect the hype from reality to understand whether biotech can really be a key answer to broader development challenges through a systematic examination of the range of different biotech science enterprises in Bangalore and what is being produced now.\n      </p>", "Using the \"event study\" method, we measure the impact on agricultural biotechnology firm equity values of new regulations and other limitations placed on the marketing of biotech crops. Unanticipated declines to biotech firm stock prices indicate that newly imposed regulatory restrictions appear most likely to diminish profit expectations for these firms. The stock price reaction to decisions by crop handlers, processors, or retailers to segregate or limit the use of biotech crops and to reports questioning their safety are less pronounced. Incentives to engage in new biotech crop research and development may be diminished by these developments.\n      </p>", "The paper examines the determinants of the creation of high tech SMEs at a regional level. Relations between the scientific and technical profile of a region, the size of the local market for biotech products and services, and economic development are explored in the French biotech industry during the 1990' s. Empirical analysis shows that a high level of scientific activity within a region is necessary to sustain a continuous flow of new business creation. The likelihood of firm creation depends on scientific and technological organizational factors like cooperation between academic and private organizations. Regional policies can have positive impact on firm creation, especially by promoting diversity and excellence in science. However, contrasting with the U.S. results, the size of the local market for biotech products and services matters in the industry development.\n      </p>", "Using a unique data set collected in France among biotech entrepreneurs and their venture capital investors (VCs), we measure the added value of personal relationships at the interorganizational level. Our analyses show that when two entrepreneurs share a personal collaboration tie or a personal friendship tie with a VC investor, the probability of having an advice tie and thus exchange tacit knowledge increases significantly. We confirm the importance of this kind of social embeddedness in the biotech industry where personalized ties\u2014as opposed to institutional and contractual relationships\u2014at the interorganizational level had not yet been examined systematically. Our results suggest that strategies of personalization of exchanges are vital for interorganizational learning. These strategies help entrepreneurs to access resources, participate in knowledge building, and co-orientate activities in this sector.\n      </p>", "This study empirically examines the impact of various competitive cost proxies on the extent of product-related information disclosed by biotech initial public offerings (IPOs) in their prospectuses. The choice of biotech companies, which operate in a fiercely competitive environment, crystalizes the importance of competitive disclosure costs. The focus on product-related information is aimed at a disclosure set for which potential competitive harm is a priori substantial. Our empirical analyses establish three disclosure determinants: the stage of product development, availability of patent protection, and venture capital backing. Additionally, we find the relative size of ownership retained by pre-IPO owners to be negatively related to the extent of disclosure, as predicted by signaling models. We also document the expected inverse relation between the extent of information conveyed by the biotech IPOs and widely used measures of information asymmetry: the bid-ask spread and quoted depth, as well as stock return volatility.\n      </p>", "This work exploits information on U.S. patents to identify trends in university ag-biotech patenting and citation performance. It sets forth some key issues concerning patterns of university ag-biotech patenting and then provides an empirical analysis of the evolving trends. Land grant universities account for most U.S. ag-biotech patents. The data show a path-dependent innovation pattern, in which there also seems to be a culture of patenting that develops at certain universities. Evidence shows that ag-biotech patents are more cited than the average university patent. Inequalities across land grant universities are also evident in the production of ag-biotech patents, although perhaps not to a much greater degree than underlying inequalities in funding and research qualities. The paper closes by considering how the evidence offered might be used to advance the public discussion regarding trends in agricultural biotechnology research in the United States.\n      </p>", "This article will review a decade's worth of voluntary liability prevention (\"stewardship\") in food biotechnology. Consumer confidence in the biotechnology industry has prevailed in the U.S., despite concerted efforts by anti-biotech activists to exaggerate the risks of biotech crops and some unfortunate lapses in biotech industry stewardship. However, there is a need for continuing scrutiny of stewardship standards that will help the biotechnology industry to protect U.S. leadership in grain exports and biotech innovation, given the recall and ensuing litigation over unapproved-for-food Starlink\u2122 corn and the proliferation of \"precautionary\" regulatory approaches to biotech crops worldwide. Improved stewardship will help build global consumer confidence in biotech's ability to manage long-term, uncertain risks before they are manifest on a broad scale. One of the most significant threats driving improved stewardship of biotech crops in the post-Starlink\u2122 era will be the threat of litigation from the plaintiffs' class action bar, now that courts may award damages to parties suffering economic injury from lost exports. Consumer confidence in biotech crops could be undermined by high-profile class action litigation. Moreover, the crucial linchpin in global markets, the U.S. challenge to European Union policy at the World Trade Organization, could turn upon a showing of improved biotech industry stewardship, which keeps biotech crops separate where particular crops are not approved for export to Europe or other markets.\n      </p>", "Biotechnology has become a major issue in international affairs. This paper follows the scientific and public debates on genetic testing for breast cancer predispositions and genetically modified organisms, which surfaced in France and in the United States during the 1990s. It focuses on the contrasting ways in which intellectual property rights and issues of risks were addressed in both countries. The two case studies suggest that transatlantic tensions about biotechnology are rooted in different forms of regulation. While civic regulation has emerged on both sides of the Atlantic, France remains a privileged terrain for professional regulation under the umbrella of the state, whereas the United States has increasingly relied on industrial regulation.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "In this paper we examine the cross-sectional determinants of idiosyncratic volatility of biotech IPO firms. We extend current research in two directions. First, we test whether CEO stock options impact idiosyncratic volatility. Second, we test new hypotheses that relate some easily identifiable managerial characteristics to idiosyncratic volatility. We find that the CEO stock options, resource dependence capabilities, and the age of board members help predict idiosyncratic volatility. Our results are robust for the various measures of idiosyncratic volatility and model specifications.\n      </p>", "This paper takes a critical look at the struggle between the European Commission and European consumer markets over the future of agricultural biotechnology. While the Commission is keen to normalize the commercialization of biotech foods and crops, European consumers refuse to eat/buy products containing genetically modified organisms (GMO) and have effectively closed the market to GMO. Is this a rare example of European citizens prevailing over the elitist technical decision making procedures in Brussels and the pro-GMO coalition of agro-chemical companies, biotech research institutes, big farming, and selected member states? We show that peculiar circumstances enabled consumer-protection and environmental NGOs to mobilize consumers and to deflect the Commission's goal of introducing biotech foods for a time, a rare achievement in the annals of EU policymaking. However, shifts in global agricultural markets will render this more difficult in the future, in part by awakening dormant tensions within the European anti-biotech movement.\n      </p>", "Technological advancements in the biotech industry have led to an explosion of scientific discoveries. Certain biotech discoveries, such as naturally occurring DNA sequences, however, are typically devoid of legal protection. Without legal protection, scientists may cease to create or may prevent others from accessing their creations or discoveries. While many intellectual property theorists and commentators have argued for and against the patentability of various DNA sequences, some theorists have suggested that copyright law provides an opportunity to protect naturally occurring DNA sequences. This Article explores the viability of acquiring copyright protection for DNA sequences by converting them into digital music files.\n      </p>", "In the past 25 years, a major revolution in agricultural practice and crop production has occurred. Genetically engineered crops with improved agronomic traits have made the transition from laboratory benches and greenhouses to fields all over the world, where they are being grown commercially. Genetic engineering technologies have evolved as a science and continue to provide the tools for making the crops of tomorrow. Armed with genomic information and nanotechnology, plant molecular biologists are redesigning molecular tool kits to engineer plants with more precision. This article describes the current major transformation methods, discusses their strengths and limitations, and focuses on a number of research areas that are likely to be used for producing the new generation of transgenic crops.\n      </p>", "The costs of developing the types of new drugs that have been pursued by traditional pharmaceutical firms have been estimated in a number of studies. However, similar analyses have not been published on the costs of developing the types of molecules on which biotech firms have focused. This study represents a first attempt to get a sense for the magnitude of the R&amp;D costs associated with the discovery and development of new therapeutic biopharmaceuticals (specifically, recombinant proteins and monoclonal antibodies [mAbs]). We utilize drug-specific data on cash outlays, development times, and success in obtaining regulatory marketing approval to estimate the average pre-tax R&amp;D resource cost for biopharmaceuticals up to the point of initial US marketing approval (in year 2005 dollars). We found average out-of-pocket (cash outlay) cost estimates per approved biopharmaceutical of $198 million, $361 million, and $559 million for the preclinical period, the clinical period, and in total, respectively. Including the time costs associated with biopharmaceutical R&amp;D, we found average capitalized cost estimates per approved biopharmaceutical of $615 million, $626 million, and $1241 million for the preclinical period, the clinical period, and in total, respectively. Adjusting previously published estimates of R&amp;D costs for traditional pharmaceutical firms by using past growth rates for pharmaceutical company costs to correspond to the more recent period to which our biopharmaceutical data apply, we found that total out-of-pocket cost per approved biopharmaceutical was somewhat lower than for the pharmaceutical company data ($559 million vs $672 million). However, estimated total capitalized cost per approved new molecule was nearly the same for biopharmaceuticals as for the adjusted pharmaceutical company data ($1241 million versus $1318 million). The results should be viewed with some caution for now given a limited number of biopharmaceutical molecules with data on cash outlays, different therapeutic class distributions for biopharmaceuticals and for pharmaceutical company drugs, and uncertainty about whether recent growth rates in pharmaceutical company costs are different from immediate past growth rates.\n      </p>", "This paper examines the American legal system's reliance upon the unity of science through a close study of the testimony presented in a biotech patent trial, explicated through the context of the legal practice of patent drafting and the history of the American biotechnology industry. In order to decide whether a key patent related to the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was invalid, the court needed to decide whether the inventing scientists had made intentional misrepresentations in the process of drafting and prosecuting the patent. I analyze the various images of science presented to the court by scientists testifying about how scientists report their experimental results in scientific publications. By setting this testimony about scientific authorship in the context of the legal understanding of patent authorship, I explain why the court was prepared to accept a universal notion of science and of the scientist that rendered unimportant any distinctions between papers and patents, or between professors and biotech scientists. This image of universal science was opposed at trial by local and specific images of sciences which have been institutionalized in industrial science throughout the 20th century, and which I argue were adopted and adapted by the American biotech industry of the 1970s to the 1990s in ways that contributed both to the trial court's finding against the patent, and to the instability of that ruling.\n      </p>", "Many countries of the world, including India, have achieved self-sufficiency in knowledge intensive sectors by allowing for a loosely defined intellectual property rights (IPR) regime. The implementation of TRIPS worldwide represents a step in the opposite direction and its impact on the production and innovative capacity of developing countries in knowledge intensive sectors is not at all clear. Taking India as representative of a technologically advanced developing country, and the biotech based segment of the pharmaceutical industry as an example of an emerging knowledge intensive sector, we examine the possible impact of TRIPS on the incentives and ability to innovate. The conclusion is that TRIPS is not likely to have a significant impact on incentives for innovation creation in the biotech segment.\n      </p>", "StarLink corn, a variety not approved for human use, disrupted the marketing system in 2000 because of inadvertent commingling. This paper provides an overview of the economics of testing grain for biotech content. What are the risks facing buyers and sellers, and how are these influenced by testing protocols? How do market premiums and discounts, testing costs, and prior beliefs affect the incentives to test? A conceptual model is developed in which sellers choose whether to pre-test grain prior to shipment. Through simulation analysis, we illustrate the impact of market premiums and other variables on testing incentives and buyer risk.\n      </p>", "In 2007, farmers grew more than 114 million hectares of GM crops--mainly soy, maize, cotton, and canola.

Innovation is important to biotech firms because it provides the competitive edge necessary for survival, yet it is very risky because of the uncertainty about the commercial viability and regulatory approval of new products and technologies. Biotech firms are so small that they cannot diversify this risk internally across projects, and conventional internal financing of innovation is generally not possible because biotech firms tend to be lacking in both profitability and cash resources. Since a SWORD is offered to the investment public, the innovation risk can be diversified across many investors and their portfolios. The SWORD technique may lead to a more efficient allocation of the risk of innovation over the financial markets. The primary objective of this paper is to show how a SWORD can promote innovation in a manner not possible when more conventional financial management techniques are used because a SWORD structures the innovation as a real option. While conventional capital budgeting is like an ex ante commitment to the untested technology, a SWORD's license option agreement, which is the real option, permits the commitment to be made ex post. A SWORD provides a biotech firm with greater control over the developed technology and its own future survival. It has a niche as a special, all-equity form of project financing for R&amp;D that is nearing the implementation stage. Since 1988, several biotech firms have used a SWORD to set up a new, separate R&amp;D organization whose financing comes from a public units offering, consisting of one share of the new venture common stock that can be called by the parent, and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock of the parent firm. The cost of a SWORD's flexibility is the dilution that occurs when the warrant is exercised. The warrants are intended to align the incentives of the investors and managers and to signal that the new venture has value because the current shareholders are willing to share the value of assets in place. Rather than being an indication of adverse selection, the warrants simply entail a cost that current shareholders must bear if they want the R&amp;D to proceed. The SWORDs for ALZA, Centocor, Immunex, and Genzyme are examined in this paper. The stock market reaction generally is positive for each SWORD, allaying fears that the potential for adverse selection renders the SWORD valueless. Two-day abnormal returns around the SEC registration and trading dates are typically between 3.85% and 5.84% for ALZA, Centocor, and Immunex. For Genzyme, the registration date results produce the largest (positive) one- and two-day abnormal returns. However, the Genzyme trading date abnormal returns are the most negative of the four, but this is recovered over the next two days. The market's positive response suggests that the SWORD R&amp;D is perceived to be valuable. ALZA and Genzyme experience a significant decrease (at the 0.01 level) in variance both around and after the SWORD announcement. Centocor also exhibits a similar decline in variability, but the decrease is significant only during the announcement period. The variance increases for Immunex, and significantly so in the post-announcement period. At best, these results moderately support the contention that these SWORDs enhance their parents' survival value. Non-SWORD events affecting Centocor and Immunex underscore the large impact of the unsystematic risks found in the biotech industry and the importance of property rights and regulatory approval. While the analysis indicates that the four SWORDs examined here are expected to produce valuable R&amp;D, each future SWORD should be judged on its own merit because the possibility that SWORD investors face potential adverse selection cannot be eliminated a priori. Yet, the sagas of Centocor and Immunex turn more on riskiness than asymmetric information. The benefits and usefulness of the SWORD arrangement can only be obtained through proper recognition of biotech risk. This paper focuses on biotech firms, but SWORD financing is likely to be successful in other situations, such as when product development is technical in nature or obtaining financing is difficult because of the large risk of the product development or because of firm size. The contractual relations imbedded in a SWORD are likely to be most important when control over manufacturing and marketing rights is central to the firm's future performance.\n      </p>", "R and D capabilities in modern biology have become a necessary prerequisite for enterprises that venture to exploit Biotechnology (BT) commercially. In this paper an attempt is made to study the capabilities in R and D in the Indian pharmaceutical industry in terms of magnitude and direction.

While the social movements literature has long recognized the importance of external context for the success of social movements, it has paid little attention to the institutional logic and features of targets other than the state. Here I argue that an undertheorized aspect of external context, namely, industry structures, is a primary factor explaining why the anti-biotech movement in Western Europe was so effective.

The concept of using a transgenic approach was realized in the mid-1990s with the commercial introduction of genetically modified (GM) crops. By 2010, the global value of the seed alone was US $ 11.2 billion, with commercial biotech maize, soya bean grain and cotton valued at approximately US SI50 billion. In recent years, it has become evident that insect-resistant crops expressing 6-endotoxin genes from Bacillus thuringiensis have made a significant beneficial impact on global agriculture, not least in terms of pest reduction and improved quality. However, because of the potential for pest populations to evolve resistance, and owing to lack of effective control of homopteran pests, alternative strategies are being developed. Some of these are based on Bacillus spp. or other insect pathogens, while others are based on the use of plant-and animal-derived genes. However, if such approaches are to play a useful role in crop protection, it is desirable that they do not have a negative impact on beneficial organisms at higher trophic levels thus affecting the functioning of the agroecosystem. This widely held concern over the ecological impacts of GM crops has led to the extensive examination of the potential effects of a range of transgene proteins on non-target and beneficial insects. The findings to date with respect to both commercial and experimental GM crops expressing anti-insect genes are discussed here, with particular emphasis on insect predators and parasitoids.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The cycle of equity participation in alliances resembles what we observe in venture capital contracts: they involve convertible equity and sometimes contain antidilution provisions, warrants, and board seats. Contracts rights vary explicitly with the size of the equity stake. Contracts contain explicit provisions linking equity participation to subsequent initial public offerings and contain clauses designed to insulate both parties from multitasking problems.

We explore whether relatively small spatial units (metropolitan statistical areas) in close geographic proximity to firms that recently have been acquired or experienced an IPO exhibit high new venture creation rates and whether the magnitudes of these effects depend on regional differences in statutes governing the freedom of employees to move between employers. Count models of biotechnology firm foundings establish three findings: (1) IPOs of organizations located contiguous to or within an MSA accelerate the founding rate within that MSA, (2) acquisitions of biotech firms situated near to or within an MSA accelerate the founding rate within the MSA, but only when the acquirer enters from outside of the biotech industry, and (3) the enforceability of post-employment non-compete covenants, which is determined at the state level, strongly moderates these effects.\n      </p>", "During the twentieth century, the pharmaceutical industry experienced a series of dramatic changes as developments in science and technology generated new opportunities for innovation.

Small biotech startups played an important role in this transition, and the large pharmaceutical firms that began to enter the field had to develop new strategies for innovation. Two major strategies were adopted by the early movers, all of which created various kinds of alliances with the small biotech businesses. By the mid-1990s, the leading pharmaceutical manufacturers had established significant capabilities in the new field, but they were continuing to work with specialized biotechs in order to innovate across a broad range of therapeutic categories.\n      </p>", "This study examines the value relevance of financial statement data and nonfinancial statement information within and across the pre-IPO venture capital and post-IPO public equity markets.

I also find that the value relevance of financial statements generally increases as firms mature, consistent with financial statements capturing the increasing intensity of assets-in-place relative to future investment options. In contrast, the value relevance of nonfinancial statement information decreases as firms mature, indicating that, in a dynamic sense, financial statements and nonfinancial statement information of venture-backed pre-IPO biotech companies are information substitutes in valuation, not complements.\n      </p>", "           ", "If the long-term economic impacts of biotechnology are as great as historical analogy suggests they may be, the locational behaviour of this now fledgling industry will have major consequences for the future of urban and regional development.\n      </p>", "\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n         For individual subscriptions, please contact the <a href=\"https://aibs.site-ym.com/?page=IndMem\">AIBS</a>\r\n         .\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p />    \r\n         To buy individual copies, please contact <a\thref=\"http://www.ucpressjournals.com/journalBuy.asp?j=bio\">University of California Press</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n         .\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n         For individual subscriptions, please contact the <a href=\"https://aibs.site-ym.com/?page=IndMem\">AIBS</a>\r\n         .\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p />    \r\n         To buy individual copies, please contact <a\thref=\"http://www.ucpressjournals.com/journalBuy.asp?j=bio\">University of California Press</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n         .\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

For small firms, mergers are primarily an exit strategy in response to financial trouble (low Tobin's q, few marketed products, low cash-sales ratios). In estimating effects of mergers, we use a propensity score to control for selection based on observed characteristics. Controlling for merger propensity, large firms that merged experienced a similar change in enterprise value, sales, employees, and R&amp;D, and had slower growth in operating profit, compared with similar firms that did not merge.

Analyzing longitudinal event history data for the complete German biotech population for 1995 till the end of 2006 our findings show that the prior international alliance history matters for the status within a firms network. Alliances with international partners as well as alliances with partners from a variety of countries enhance the subsequent movement towards a more central position in the research network. However, multi-partner alliances inhibit the subsequent movement towards a central position, pointing to challenges in managing a portfolio of simultaneous alliances.
