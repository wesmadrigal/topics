This paper surveys some of these developments and discusses the aspects of Java that make it attractive for developing such simulations.

The limitations and advantages of using Java in this way are discussed.\n      </p>", "This paper describes and analyzes social stratification in Colonial Java (approx. 1830-1930). As conceptual and theoretical background, various dimensions and ensuing forms of social inequality and social stratification are discussed. Basically the concepts of 'caste' and 'class' are distinguished with the concept of 'estate' mediating between the more closed, rigid and honor-based forms of stratification on the one hand and the more open, less rigid and primarilly economically defined ones on the other hand. Network analysis is proposed as a theoretical framework which captures the internal relations among members of a social stratum, the connections between strata and their position in society. Suggestions from symbolic anthropology are taken up asking how social inequality is being legitimized. In the case study, firstly, the Javanese insiders' (ernie) view of social stratification is presented. Javanese conceptions of kingship, power, and the state are shown to underlie the classification of social strata into \"big people'' and \"littlepeople.\" Secondly, the outsiders' (etic, scientific observers') view of social stratification is outlined. Several social strata are described in turn according to their economic and social position, their access to power, their internal and external connections, and the style of life of their members. In conclusion Colonial Java is characterized as a caste society based on the color line. Internally, the European caste at the top, the Chinese middle caste, and the Javanese at the bottom of the stratification system are further subdivided. Income, education, and occupation lead to a slight differentiation of the small European community. The Chinese minority is divided according to ethnic origin and the degree of assimilation to the Javanese culture. The Javanese segment is presented as an (encapsulated) estate society, manual labor and command of courtly eticette being the main factors of differentiation. Finally, it is suggested that social anthropological analysis of social structure and social relations should move beyond kinship studies in order to capture all important social phenomena in contemporary complex societies.\n      </p>", "This paper describes recent geomorphic change on reef islands of Ontong Java atoll, Solomon Islands and discusses the nature of the 'steady state' equilibrium that has been proposed for cays and motus. The effects of a hurricane in 1967 are analysed through detailed field mapping in 1971, 1972 and 1986, and with reference to evidence from earlier charts and air photographs. It is concluded that the hurricane represents a high-magnitude low-frequency event necessary for the long-term replenishment of sediment on shorelines, but that in the short term such storms will seem to have mainly destructive effects. Since 1967 rubble ramparts thrown up by the hurricane have been largely reworked into stable landforms, mainly through the agency of more frequent, lower-magnitude storms. In parts of the atoll where coarse sediment was not deposited in 1967 there is a widespread retreat of seaward beaches. Such coastal erosion does not necessarily imply that islands have been destabilized by vegetation removal, climatic change or a rising sea level. It is only by considering the long-term sediment budget and the relaxation time of landforms in relation to major hurricanes that decisions can be reached about whether particular reef islands are in equilibrium with process.\n      </p>", "A tendency for fertility to be higher among middle-class women than among lower-class women has been found in all the recent sources of data on fertility levels and patterns in Indonesia. After briefly reviewing these findings, this article presents the results of a community study in rural Java which systematically investigates the positive relation between fertility and socioeconomic status, focusing on the so-called intermediate variables (first inventoried by Davis and Blake in 1956) which directly determine fertility. Differential patterns of marital stability, secondary sterility, and the practice of postpartum abstinence in particular were found to contribute to the contrasts in fertility levels observed. The use of modern contraceptives, a recent innovation at the time of the study, was found to a greater extent among middle-class women, and may prove to be an important determinant of future patterns of fertility and fertility differentials.\n      </p>", "The organization and functioning of several sites of shrimp production along the northern Java and Sumatra coasts have been studied through the following parameters: usual hydrological parameters, total suspended matter, suspended organic matter, suspended mineral matter, planktonic chlorophyll a and phaeophytin contents. Additionally, the structure and composition of phytoplanctonic populations was analysed by flow cytometry. From obtained data on the site of Jepara (which is representative of all sites south of Java Sea), it appears that all coastal environments including open marine environments undergo a high confinement level. This is depicted by the drastic simplification of the natural as well as aquacultural ecosystems; the natural benthic macrofauna is almost completely absent and the other organisms are only procaryotes which grow in such ecosystems at the continental edge of the paralic realm. Studied systems are rather stable through time and display gradients from offshore towards the most restricted parts of the aqua-cultural structures, i.e., the semi-intensive and intensive ponds. These gradients move following the tidal cycles. A studied site in Sumatra along the Malacca straits displays similar gradients but a lesser confinement which is indicated by the presence of more diversified phytoplanctonic populations. In all studied sites, the intensive aquacultural practices tend to increase the confinement level not only for the aquacultural installations themselves but also for the offshore environments. /// L'organisation et le fonctionnement de plusieurs sites de production de crevettes le long des c\u00f4tes nord de Java et Sumatra ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tudi\u00e9s \u00e0 partir des param\u00e8tres suivanta : parametres hydrologiques classiques, mati\u00e8res en suspension, biomasses pigmentaires du phytoplancton.

Javanese Muslim women's rights activists focus on the historical contextualization of religious doctrine to argue against what they see as misguided interpretations of Islam that threaten to control women. This paper examines these efforts through a close reading of the discursive shifts and arguments that take place in the context of programs designed to promote women's rights in Islamic education in Java. It argues that the challenge for women's rights activists and intellectuals is to locate the ways that moderate or normative social and religious values can combine during times of change or crisis to reinforce a moral hierarchy of gender relations and an \"idea of woman\" in an attempt to control such change. The paper demonstrates that in Java, a moral hierarchy of gender relations, mimetically extended from family to nation, dovetails with religious interpretations to resolve anxieties about social change and security through the control of women.\n      </p>", "This study reports the natural hybridization of two species of Impatiens in the mountain forests of Gunung Gede-Pangrango, in central Java, Indonesia. Impatiens radicans, which inhabits the highest altitude zone in the mountains of this park, and I. javensis, which inhabits a zone of lower altitude, can be easily distinguished by their morphological features. However, some populations that inhabit regions between the two zones have characteristics that appear to be combinations of traits of I. radicans and I. javensis. Sequence analysis of the 800-bp nuclear ITS region and 449-bp plastid trnL-F locus demonstrated that hybridization between the two species has occurred, and suggests gene flow between the species.\n      </p>", "The present paper examines beliefs about tigers in East Java, Indonesia. There, as elsewhere in Southeast Asia, the tiger serves as a symbol, functioning especially as a complement to shamans and ancestral spirits. The tiger also acts as a symbol of nature, though not of uncontrolled nature-the animal guards the order of both the jungle and the village, and serves as an agent of the supernatural beings that own the forest. The Javan tiger's numbers have declined drastically in the face of ecological change, to the point where it is doubtful that any still remain. The tiger is very much alive as a symbol, however; this aspect of the creature has adapted to its new situation far better than the animal itself. At present the role of tiger-as-symbol has changed, so that now it guards not only nature but the Islamic faith as well. With the disappearance of the actual tiger, the panther has come to take over many of the roles once held by the larger cat. This shift has been facilitated by the fact that both animals occupy the same linguistic category.\n      </p>", "Schefflera aromatica (B1.) Harms forma scandens Hochr. from western Java (Indonesia) is elevated to species rank as S. reiniana and redescribed. The two known localities of the species, not recollected since 1922, occur in an altitudinal range sometimes neglected by botanists. S. reiniana is most closely related to S. sessilis (Miq.) Harms in Sumatra, a capituliferous species, and has no connection with the Agalma group of sect. Schefflera [Harms] which includes S. aromatica.\n      </p>", "There is a prohibition on the use of modern external inputs, such as chemical fertilizers, in Baduy swidden farming. Ordinarily, the consequence of this in a situation of acute forest pressure would be a decrease in fallow times, and an inevitable depletion of soil fertility. The Baduy (particularly Outer Baduy) have several ways of alleviating this problem, one of which is the introduction of Paraserianthes (Albizia) falcataria. By alternating this commercially valuable perennial leguminous tree with rice, soil fertility is maintained and the socio-economic position of the Baduy improved. As a result, swidden farming, which is considered by the Baduy to be central to their cultural identity, continues to be viable, despite increasing population density and the continuing depletion of mature forest.\n      </p>", "The kacapi zither is a significant instrument of West Java (Sunda). I elaborate on the relationship between player and instrument, described as a 'marriage', by looking at the way the instrument is described and played by Sundanese informants, and its associations as reflected in myth, ritual and poetry. The marriage metaphor emphasises the correct and harmonious relationship between the sexes--lawful union instead of incest--and between a ruler and his realm. I also expand on earlier formulated ideas that the Sundanese arts represent female aspects of human communication. I argue that gender issues cannot be reduced to fixed male-female dichotomies. This becomes clear if we look at gender-reversal issues like male performers performing female roles and vice versa, a common phenomenon in Indonesia. Similarly, musical instruments are not just 'male' or 'female', but may be classified as such by their relationship with players. Structuralists say that the element of structure is not a thing, but a relation. Studying these systems of relations may supply information on the issue of gender that is still not abundant in ethnomusicological works.\n      </p>", "Ideally, social forestry programmes and philosophies are intended to involve local people in the management and distribution of forest resources. In practice, the structures of social forestry programmes are influenced by political, economic and cultural factors at national and local levels. When social forestry programmes entail the reallocation of access to forest resources on state lands, power relations are particularly influential. As the case of the Java Social Forestry Program illustrates, powerful social forces that have shaped historically the national forest management agency and the social structures of forest-based villages have distorted social forestry ideals. When their traditional management tools are unable to curb deforestation and the social processes causing deforestation, forestry agencies may be persuaded to implement social forestry policies. Changes in forestry programmes and the orientation of social forestry are inevitably subject to local negotiation and renegotiation. The outcomes of negotiation, however, are dependent on the structures of power relations both before and after implementation of new policies.\n      </p>", "Neopanorpa flavoferruginea Byers, new species, from western Java, is described and illustrated.

West Java's divorce rate was among the highest in the world in the 1950s and 1960s; by the mid-1980s, it was about one fifth as high as that in the United States. Regional differentials were, and still are, quite pronounced. The differentials appear to be related more to cultural than to socio-economic differences. The sharp declines have been related to social and economic changes, prominent among which were rising levels of income, expanded education and work opportunities for girls, and a breaking down of traditional attitudes through improved transport and communications. Concurrent with, and largely consequent on these changes has been a rising age at marriage of females and decline in arranged marriage, thus reducing the prevalence of those marriages traditionally most prone to divorce. Ideology and legal changes also played a part in the decline in divorce though the legal changes followed, rather than led, changed community attitudes. Ce document souligne les tendances de taux de divorce en Java Occidental pendant les 40 derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es. Dans les ann\u00e9es 50/60, le taux de divorce en Java Occidental \u00e9tait parmi les plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s du monde; dans le milieu des ann\u00e9es 80, il repr\u00e9sentait jusqu'\u00e0 un cinqui\u00e8me de celui des Etats-Unis.

Las diferencias regionales fueron, y a\u00fan son, bastante pronunciadas y parecen estar m\u00e1s relacionadas a cambios sociales que socio-econ\u00f3micos.

This event precipitated a spontanous revitalization of old myths and mystical beliefs, and it gave impulse to the government's efforts to have inhabitants migrate away. Neither villagers living on the slopes of Mount Merapi nor the inhabitants of Yogyakarta regard the eruption primarily as a disaster. Rather it is understood as an admonition from the supernatural world. By describing the diversity of mystical explanations given to the eruption I want to demonstrate the process of creating new meaning that is connected to the revival of traditional Javanese patterns of interpretating a natural event. This paper is based on fieldwork done in the time immediately after the eruption.\n      </p>", "In this article, I have chosen to focus upon two particular representations of the god \u015aiwa from both Central and East Java-\u015aiwa the Majestic Great God and \u015aiwa the Teacher.

These two specific representations of the god \u015aiwa in the art of classical Java are connected with Javanese religious thought as articulated in indigenous textual material, embracing the present and present-day perceptions of the Indonesian past.

These santri exhibit an archaic devotion to their \"saint\" which represents a testimony to the strong historic consciousness specific to this region (the Pasisir) where the islamization of Java began in the 15th century. It is from this group that the first manufacturers of kr\u00e8t\u00e8k (cigarettes with cloves) originated, who made Kudus into a bastion of the \"indigenous\" economy at the time of Dutch colonization. Little by little, entrepreneurs of Chinese extraction were able to usurp the control over this production because the santri were not sufficiently well organized, nor did they possess \u2014 beyond a common religious ideal \u2014 an effective class consciousness. The case of Kudus provides us with a view of Islam which is somewhat different from that to which we are accustomed i.e., one which makes global judgments for all Javanese regions as viewed from the principal centers of the island in which the model is excessively \"Javanized\".

It explores the extent to which teenagers in three communities are familiar with myths about the Goddess of the Southern Ocean, Nyai Roro Kidul, and her supposed daughter, Nyi Blorong.

Although the mythological figures may be less immediately relevant locally, people still retain practical knowledge about them, such as the taboos associated with the queen and how to create amulets and other safeguards against her or her daughter's anger. The article finally also examines how in the non-local space of motion pictures, different mythologies may come to be merged, unchallenged by the truth constraints that being anchored in a locality usually places upon such tales.

We obtained transects from 33 sites on 14 reefs in three regions of Indonesia: Ambon (Moluccas), South Sulawesi and the Java Sea. We determined the within-site species richness by using species-sampling curves. Cluster analysis and multi-dimensional scaling showed that land-based pollution was the primary determinant of coral species diversity and species occurrence on reefs. Relatively unaffected reference sites in eastern Indonesia were approximately 20% more diverse than Java Sea reference sites. Rare species formed a higher proportion of the coral fauna on eastern Indonesian sites, and eastern Indonesian apparent endemic species contributed approximately 25% of the total species pool sampled. Between-site variation in species occurrence was lower on Java Sea reefs than on eastern Indonesian reefs. A larger species pool in eastern Indonesia than in the Java Sea probably accounted for most of the difference in within-site species diversity between eastern Indonesian and Java Sea reference sites. High fishing intensity in the Java Sea, including destructive fishing practices, may have also contributed to reduced within-site species diversity on Java Sea reference reefs. Despite the fact that the Java Sea was exposed during Pleistocene lowstands, and was recolonized by marine organisms only within the last 10 000 years, coral species diversity and assemblage composition on the Java Sea reefs was largely similar to open ocean reefs in eastern Indonesia.\n      </p>", "Late colonial sugar cane production in Java was characterised by the heavy use of (chemical) fertiliser in tandem with labour-intensive techniques and industrial work processes in the field.

Close reading, however, reveals that it is anything but reliable. Seitmann's book merely presents the negative Javanese imagery of the Kalang, whereas the Kalang themselves remain in the dark. In the article three important sections of Seitmann's work are discussed: (1) the history of the Kalang, (2) the Kalang death ritual, and (3) the Kalang myth of origin. It is argued that the reason that the Kalang became a low-status group in Javanese society probably had to do with their association with the forest. Initially, the so-called myth of origin of the Kalang, in which they are presented as descendants of a woman and a (were-) dog, was a Javanese explanation for the inferior position of the Kalang as wandering woodsmen. In a later period, when the Kalang emerged as (wealthy) businessmen, this myth of origin could make it plain to the Javanese what the reason of the Kalang's economical success was.\n      </p>", "The institutional entrepreneurship implicit in a firm's sponsorship of its technology as a common standard is beset by several challenges.

In this survey, all species of rats had antibodies against SFGR, indicating that the 4 species of tested rats (R. norvegicus, R. rattus, R. exulans, R. tiomanicus) were infected with SFGR and that SFGR may infest the whole of Java Island. Most of the rats that were antibody-positive against murine typhus were captured in Jakarta. Therefore, R. norvegicus and R. rattus are likely to be important hosts of murine typhus in Jakarta. The antibody-positive rates against SFGR and murine typhus in rats captured in the dry season were significantly higher than those in rats captured in the rainy season. This may coincide with the active periods of ticks and fleas in Indonesia.\n      </p>", "       \n                \n                        \n                            <div class=\"wall\">Moving Wall: 3 years&nbsp;<a class=\"popUp\" href=\"/page/info/help/popUps/movingwall.jsp\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"vrtM\"  src=\"/templates/jsp/_jstor/images/info.gif\" alt=\"What is the moving wall?\" /></a>", "       \n                \n                        \n                            <div class=\"wall\">Moving Wall: 3 years&nbsp;<a class=\"popUp\" href=\"/page/info/help/popUps/movingwall.jsp\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"vrtM\"  src=\"/templates/jsp/_jstor/images/info.gif\" alt=\"What is the moving wall?\" /></a>", "", "$^{40}$Ar/$^{39}$Ar laser-incremental heating of hornblende separated from pumice recovered at two hominid sites in Java, Indonesia, has yielded well-defined plateaus with weighted mean ages of 1.81 \u00b1 0.04 and 1.66 \u00b1 0.04 million years ago (Ma).

These ages lend further credence to the view that Homo erectus may have evolved outside of Africa. If the ancestor of Homo erectus ventured out of Africa before 1.8 Ma, the dispersal would have predated the advent of the Acheulean culture at 1.4 Ma, possibly explaining the absence of these characteristic stone cleavers and hand axes in East Asia.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Particular attention was paid to the altitudinal zoning of the vegetation, to succession and to the applicability of the phytosociological approach in forests of the humid tropics. The altitudinal zoning provides a clear example of the telescope effect: low, isolated mountain complexes surrounded by sea reflect the vegetation zoning of higher mountains in a condensed, 'telescoped' way. The pattern of primary forests, secondary forests and rattan-dominated shrublands can be explained by the former shifting cultivation practice and the impact of ash rains following the notorious eruption of the nearby volcano Krakatau in 1883. The arguments against the phytosociological approach in the humid tropics are found to be invalid.

Descriptive studies focus on population mobility in a predominantly static manner, whereas structural research which considers the broad political and socio-economic forces affecting population mobility oversimplifies the socio-economic conditions of Indonesian society and tends to neglect local conditions which are none the less important. What is needed is an understanding of the ways in which broad contextual forces shape population mobility and, in turn, the extent to which that movement affects such forces. In this light, this paper attempts to construct a framework of analysis that can identify the interaction between macro socioeconomic processes and population mobility in Java.

However, the possibilities and challenges introduced by recent technological developments and the general ways we use computing conflict with the computational model of these systems. This article explores some of these challenges and identifies the need to support easy integration of functionality from other domains, and to export statistical methodology to other audiences and applications, both statically and dynamically. Existing systems can be improved in these domains with some already implemented extensions (see Section 5). However, the development of a new environment and computational model that exploits modern tools designed to handle many general aspects of these challenges appears more promising as a long-term approach. We present the architecture for such a new model named Omegahat. It lends itself to entirely new statistical computing paradigms. It is highly extensible at both the user and programmer level, and also encourages the development of new environments for different user groups. The Omegahat interactive language offers a continuity between the different programming tasks and levels via optional type checking and seamless access between the interpreted user language and the implementation language, Java. Parallel and distributed computing, network and database access, interactive graphics, and many other aspects of statistical computing are directly accessible to the user as a consequence of this seamless access. We describe the benefits of using Java as the implementation language for the environment and several innovative features of the user-level language which promise to assist development of software that can be used in many contexts. We also outline how this architecture can be integrated with existing environments such as R and S. The ideas are drawn from work within the Omega Project for Statistical Computing. The project provides open-source software for researching and developing next generation statistical computing tools.\n      </p>", "Les mythes des personnes incompl\u00e8tes \u00e0 Java d\u00e9crivent leur naissance, la nourriture sp\u00e9ciale qui leur est donn\u00e9e et la fa\u00e7on dont ils se sont rassembl\u00e9s.

It begins by reviewing some problems associated with defining the household in Javanese Society. On this foundation, it records the following features of the households surveyed: ethnicity, size, membership (number of core members, servants, etc.), composition type (nuclear, stem, etc.), the prevalence of various types of domestic unit (\" multiplefamily households,\" \"household groups,\" \"household clusters,\" etc.), and the kinship ties occurring within these units. Our findings, together with those of other researchers, support an earlier suggestion that nuclear households are less prevalent in urban than in rural areas of Java. The evidence to date also suggests 4 that about one-third of urban households may belong to \"household clusters,\" in contras to about twothirds of rural households. Analysis of the kinship ties responsible for structuring the households, household groups, and household clusters in the study area revealed a slight degree of uxorilocality between married children and intact parental couples, but none between married children and their widowed parents. The lower prevalence of nuclear households and the larger average household size in urban, as compared with rural, Java, and the lower prevalence of nuclear households and larger average core household size among the Javanese people, as compared with the generally more prosperous Chinese, in urban Surakarta all suggests that housing in urban Java is particularly hard to come by and therefore highly overpriced and congested.The few relevant economic statistics which are available support this conclusion. Both of these trends run counter to ones which have been found to prevail in a wide variety of historical and cross-cultural comparisons.\n      </p>", "Fundamental changes are taking place in the world's financial markets that will challenge stock exchanges. As the twenty-first century approaches, more and more exchanges are adopting automated floorless trading mechanisms. This article outlines an attempt to develop an automated financial cybermarket with a bundle-matching and -execution mechanism. The market matches orders in bundles and provides a price-discovery mechanism. In many real-world situations, value is derived from a combination of assets or resources. The value will be significantly reduced when even one asset or resource is excluded from the bundle. The mechanism can be used to trade financial portfolios as well as a combination of commodities. When used for simple asset trading, the bundle mechanism is, in effect, a generalization of the k-double auction. From a computing point of view, the electronic market is a large-scale distributed computing system. Emerging technologies like Java and distributed objects can be used to create electronic markets that can be accessed universally. The technologies support interactive and dynamic information exchanges between traders and market.

Geertz and others. During a visit to this small town a guru kebatinan (mystical teacher) showed us the ancient remains of the once famous Javanese empire Majapahit (14th cent.). This key informant considered the archaeological value of this site in the vicinity of Pare and Kediri as less important. In his beliefs the graveyards and ancient palaces of Majapahit are embedded with mystical power, and the site has to be viewed primarily as a collection of holy places (tempat keramat) par excellence. Our leader showed us some of these holy places and explained their meaning to us. The interchange of questions and answers -modelled according to the discourse between mystic-teacher and pupil -led to an authentic albeit selective account of the point of view of a true believer in Javanese mysticism. I start this paper with a description of the trip to mystical places and the data generated during this visit. Then a cognitive anthropological analysis of the belief system contained in the key informant's statements is presented. It is centred on the concept of a (mystic) script. The paper concludes with the suggestion to apply scripts and other schemata from cognitive psychology to anthropological data on meaning systems.

These ages are 20,000 to 400,000 years younger than previous age estimates for these hominids and indicate that H. erectus may have survived on Java at least 250,000 years longer than on the Asian mainland, and perhaps 1 million years longer than in Africa.

Comparisons with similar species-pairs in South-East Asia suggest that these species may be competitors both in habitat and diet. The limited area and less-diverse resources of islands should make competition between similar species more acute and should lead to marked niche segregation, with a larger niche breath for the endemic species. Spizaetus bartelsi was recorded significantly more frequently in forest habitats from sea level to 2500 m asl and S. cirrhatus more in open habitats up to 1600 m asl. Contrary to the prediction, the endemic hawk-eagle occurred in a smaller range of habitats (four out of seven) compared with S. cirrhatus that was found in all seven habitat types. Although significant, habitat segregation was not as well marked as in some similar co-occurring Spizaetus species. The relative overlap between the two species may in part result from human influences with the dense continuous rain forest being replaced by more open forest types.\n      </p>", "When Thomas Stamford Raffles published his seminal text The History of Java in 1817, ruins were a favourite leitmotif in British art, forming an important element within the visual vocabulary of the picturesque. Given the fascination in this period for the ruin, fuelled by a tradition of antiquarian enquiry, the newly developing science of archaeology, and the increased possibilities for travel in the wake of imperial expansion, it is not surprising that Raffles chose to devote a whole a chapter of his publication to Java's ruined candis. The plates and vignettes which illustrate the chapter, created according to pictorial conventions that were ordinarily applied to the crumbling remains of Europe's classical past, are amongst the most beautiful portrayals of South-East Asia's architectural remains. This paper examines how these images elicited set emotional responses associated with the idea of ruins and ruination and confirmed key stereotypes associated with the region, linking the candis, and by implication the Javanese themselves, with a vanished past rather than with a dynamic and forward-looking present.\n      </p>", "We describe a system, called the Graphics Production Library (GPL), that implements a language for quantitative graphics.

The author attemps to study this phenomenon in the volcanic mountains of Java for which the incidence of frost has not yet been investigated systematically. Through the analysis of temperature records of Mount Pangerango (3023 m) and of various tea estates in the Pengalengan Highlands (1500-2300 m), Western Java, as well as the phenological study frost of damage to tea bushes, it became clear that light nocturnal ground frosts may occur during the Southern winter from July up to September. Frosts occur at an elevation above 1500 m in drepessions only, whereas slopes\u2014even at much higher elevation\u2014are frost-free. Frosts in the mountains of Java represent a typical local climatological phenomenon, favoured by the volcanic small-scale topography.

Both islands were governed partly or entirely by European powers during the last century and have well-known botanical gardens. The floras are related, though many genera are lacking in Ceylon. This is due to the cul-de-sac location of Ceylon in contrast to Java which constitutes a bridge between Asia and Australia. The zonation of vegetation is somewhat different: montane rainforest with high trees extends to 2,000 m in Java, while in Ceylon the lower montane forest (hill-dipterocarps) ends at 1,500 m a.s.l. Above 2,000 m and 1,500 m, respectively, mossy forest covers the slopes. The fauna of both mountains has many similarities; big herbivores were once represented by the elephant in Ceylon and rhinoceros in Java.

A mechanism of weaning is identified whereby an initial stage of breast-feeding is protected by sexual abstinence, while weaning itself is ultimately precipitated by another pregnancy.

Much of OJP formed rapidly in less than 3 million years during the early Aptian, at the beginning of the Cretaceous Normal Polarity Superchron. Crustal emplacement rates are inferred to have been several times those of the Deccan Traps. These estimates are consistent with an origin of the OJP by impingement at the base of the oceanic lithosphere by the head of a large mantle plume. Formation of the OJP may have led to a rise in sea level that induced global oceanic anoxia. Carbon dioxide emissions likely contributed to the mid-Cretaceous greenhouse climate but did not provoke major biologic extinctions.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "Two stone tools (a chopper and a retouched flake) were found in mid-Pleistocene channel fills at Sambungmachan (Java), which earlier yielded a hominid skull cap with characteristics of Solo man and a Trinil-like fauna.

Regular field patterns are predominant in the fertile irrigated central plains. The fields belonging to the agricultural communities are divided into two or three cultivation complexes, called \"bloks\". The single plots of individual tenure are mostly short and narrow \"sawah\"-strips. Their size is on the average about 0.13 to 0.24 ha. In each of these two or three cultivation complexes, the landowners own only one single plot. Therefore, one smallholding consists of two or three individual plots in a scattered location with a total size of about 0.30 to 0.45 ha. This field pattern has its origin in a Dutch field reorganization after 1912/18. Outside the central plains in the mountainous areas, where the irrigation depends entirely on rainfall, there is no such division of the land into several cultivation complexes. Most of the landowners own only one single plot. Small regular blocks vary with short strips of either regular or irregular shape. The average size of these individual \"tegalan\"- plots is 0,30 to 0,60 ha. To eliminate the actual socio-economic and socio-political problems in Central Java a considerable increase of agricultural production and rural income is necessary. At the present time sudden modernization creates many obstacles for a promotion of such an increase. Nevertheless there are certain limitations to the application of technical improvements as mechanization etc., in order to generate a more effective use of rural production potentials: The extremely small size of cultivated plots and individual holdings, excessive fragmentation, deficiencies in the road and field path patterns, the presence of terraces, feudal elements in the agrarian system etc. Priority should be given to the development of practicable forms of cooperation, utilizing p. e. the field pattern of the irrigated central plains with their subdivision into cultivation complexes or \"bloks\". These complexes represent units of exploitation, where collective technical improvements could be applied without changing the present structure of ownership.\n      </p>", "Dinochloa matmat is a new species from Central and East Java, Indonesia.

Hefner looks at the distinction between orthodox, or santri, Muslims and less orthodox, or abangan, Javanese. Recent ethnographic research from rural East Java indicates that changes in religious administration and political economy have resulted in a shift in the balance of cultural power in at least some former bastions of Javanese tradition, in favor of greater Islamic orthodoxy. Hefner proposes that the example is symptomatic of broader political and cultural changes, which suggest that the New Order government may indirectly contribute to the advance of Islamic orthodoxy in areas of rural Java.\n      </p>"], "words": {"monte": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "chain": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "dance": {"number": 1, "prob":
