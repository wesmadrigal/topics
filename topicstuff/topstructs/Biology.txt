To employ this concept, modern social-sciences theorists have made simplifying assumptions about human nature and have then built elaborately upon their more incisive simplifications. Advances in biology, including advances in evolutionary theory, notably inclusive-fitness theory, have for decades now encouraged the reconsideration of such assumptions and, more ambitiously, the reconciliation of the social and life sciences. I ask if this reconciliation is feasible and test a path to the unification of politics and biology, called here \"political biology.\" Two new notions, \"fitness extraction\" and \"fitness exchange,\" are defined, then differentiated from each other, and lastly contrasted to cooperative gaming, the putative essential element of economics.\n      </p>", "Ideological language is widespread in theoretical biology. Evolutionary game theory has been defended as a worldview and a leap of faith, and sexual selection theory has been criticized for what it posits as basic to biological nature. Views such as these encourage the impression of ideological rifts in the field. I advocate an alternative interpretation, whereby many disagreements between different camps of biologists merely reflect methodological differences. This interpretation provides a more accurate and more optimistic account of the state of play in the field of biology. It also helps account for biologists\u2019 tendency to embrace ideological positions.\n      </p>", "Systematics and reproductive biology have been closely intertwined through botanical history because both rely on reproductive characters. We consider interconnections between systematics and reproductive biology from notable papers and reviews. In addition, a review of over 6,000 journals and millions of articles using the ISI Web of Science\u00ae demonstrates a steady growth in publication of papers on reproductive biology from 1975 to 2001. Furthermore, the rate of publications that link systematics with reproductive biology shows a steep increase from 1991 to the present. This increase is evident even when the overall increased rate of publica-tion is considered. We identify several current research themes, including the increasing use of phylogenetic data for interpreting the evolution of reproductive systems. Though studies of reproductive biology and of systematics have the potential for \"reciprocal illumination\", few have used reproductive biological data for understanding the functinoal significance of morphology. Other fundamental areas where the combination of reproductive biology and systematics has proven valuable include studies of the nature of species, adaptation, speciation and hybridization. These elements of reproductive biology, especially in the context of systematic studies, will benefit from more comprehensive analyses within genera, and of taxa within communities through time and space.\n      </p>", "Lichenometry is used to date late-Holocene terminal moraines that record glacier fluctuations. Traditionally, it relies upon dating curves that relate diameters of the largest lichens in a population to surface ages. Although widely used, the technique remains controversial, in part because lichen biology is poorly understood. We use size-frequency distributions of lichens growing on well-dated surfaces to fit demographic models for Rhizocarpon geographicum and Pseudophebe pubescens, two species commonly used for lichenometry. We show that both species suffer from substantial mortality of 2-3% per year, and grow slowest when young-trends that explain a long-standing contradiction between the literatures of lichenometry and lichen biology. Lichenometrists interpret the shape of typical dating curves to indicate a period of rapid juvenile \"great growth,\" contrary to the growth patterns expected by biologists. With a simulation, we show how the \"great growth\" pattern can be explained by mortality alone, which ensures that early colonists are rarely found on the oldest surfaces. The consistency of our model predictions with biological theory and observations, and with dozens of lichenometric calibration curves from around the world, suggests opportunities to assess quantitatively the accuracy and utility of this common dating technique.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

To succeed in addressing the challenges of 21st century biology, scientists need to generate, have access to, interpret, and archive more information than ever before. But for many important questions in biology, progress is stymied by a lack of essential tools. Discovering and developing necessary tools requires new technologies, applications of existing technologies, software, model organisms, and social structures. Such new social structures will promote tool building, tool sharing, research collaboration, and interdisciplinary training.

Strongly oriented toward agriculture, this was closely associated with the growth of a number of disciplines, notably, entomology and mycology. This period also saw a marked expansion of the English University system, and biology departments in the newly inaugurated civic universities took an early and leading role in the development of applied biology through their support of Economic Biology. This sought explicitly to promote the application of biological knowledge to economically important problems and especially to agriculture. The impact of Economic Biology was felt most strongly within Zoology, where it became synonymous with entomology. The transience of Economic Biology belies its significance, for example, in providing a means for the expansion of biology at the civic universities. More broadly, it opened up new research and employment opportunities within the life sciences. In late Edwardian Britain, newly available state funds for agriculturally relevant biological disciplines transformed the life sciences. This paper examines the impact of these funds -- mobilized either under the 1909 Development Act, or under the auspices of colonial interests -- on Economic Biology and the institutionalization of applied biology. The rise and fall of Economic Biology casts new light on the way in which institutional and political alignments profoundly shaped the development of British biology.\n      </p>", "\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n         For individual subscriptions, please contact the <a href=\"https://aibs.site-ym.com/?page=IndMem\">AIBS</a>\r\n         .\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p />    \r\n         To buy individual copies, please contact <a\thref=\"http://www.ucpressjournals.com/journalBuy.asp?j=bio\">University of California Press</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n         .\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n         For individual subscriptions, please contact the <a href=\"https://aibs.site-ym.com/?page=IndMem\">AIBS</a>\r\n         .\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p />    \r\n         To buy individual copies, please contact <a\thref=\"http://www.ucpressjournals.com/journalBuy.asp?j=bio\">University of California Press</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n         .\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n         For individual subscriptions, please contact the <a href=\"https://aibs.site-ym.com/?page=IndMem\">AIBS</a>\r\n         .\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p />    \r\n         To buy individual copies, please contact <a\thref=\"http://www.ucpressjournals.com/journalBuy.asp?j=bio\">University of California Press</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n         .\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "We describe a successful interdepartmental program at a major research-oriented university that melds freshman writing with freshman biology to the significant benefit of both disciplines.

Although there has been considerable study of the relationships of Lactoris, as a rare species and as a putative primitive paleoherb, little is known of its reproductive biology. Knowledge of the latter is essential for effective conservation programs. The species is gynomonoecious. The overall proportion of flowers is \u223c1 female:1 hermaphrodite. The inconspicuous semipendulous green flowers, usually in mixed-gender inflorescences, do not produce rewards. Hermaphrodite flowers are herkogamous and protogynous. Pollen grains are shed from the extrorse anthers in permanent dry tetrads. There is a mean of 12879 tetrads per hermaphrodite flower. Both flower types bear an average of \u223c18 ovules. The P/O (pollen/ovule) ratios imply facultative or obligate xenogamy, but hand pollinations show that Lactoris is self-compatible. No floral visitors were ever observed, but stigmata of open-pollinated flowers bore tetrads, and 64% of such styles had pollen tubes. Flowers enclosed in large mesh (1 mm) bags bore similar numbers of tetrads and pollen tubes. Thus, we conclude that Lactoris is anemophilous, a syndrome perhaps reflected by the P/O ratio. Low genetic diversity (isozymes and DNA) supports selfing and implies limited distance wind pollen dispersal. The small size of the island, the \u00b1 1000 extant Lactoris plants, coupled with anemophily, self-compatibility, and pendant flower position, have yielded a geitonogamous system with high seed set and low genetic diversity. If inbreeding depression is expressed, it is in seed germination and seedling vigor, for Lactoris is very difficult to cultivate. For this species, effective conservation practices need to focus on habitat preservation and promotion of outcrossing.\n      </p>", "Faculty from numerous science disciplines have used concept inventories to focus their efforts on a few core concepts and ways of thinking in introductory courses. These inventories also help faculty recognize students' misconceptions and faulty reasoning from the onset of a course and track gains in understanding as the course progresses. The biology concept inventories that several groups of biologists and educators are now working on will add significantly to the few that have already been published. This article introduces biology faculty to concept inventories, including what they are and how they are developed and used. In addition, I propose next steps, which would lead to faculty development workshops based on the use of concept inventories, student-active teaching, and scientific teaching in introductory biology courses. These workshops could be offered through professional biological societies and coordinated by societies' educators working together on common goals and strategies.\n      </p>", "Biologists in the 1960s witnessed a period of intense intra-disciplinary negotiations, especially the positioning of organismic biologists relative to molecular biologists. The perceived valorization of the physical sciences by \"molecular\" biologists became a catalyst creating a unified front of \"organismic\" biology that incorporated not just evolutionary biologists, but also students of animal behavior, ecology, systematics, botany\u2014in short, almost any biological community that predominantly conducted their research in the field or museum and whose practitioners felt the pinch of the prestige and funding accruing to molecular biologists and biochemists. Ernst Mayr, Theodosius Dobzhansky, and George Gaylord Simpson took leading roles in defending alternatives to what they categorized as the mechanistic approach of chemistry and physics applied to living systems\u2014the \"equally wonderful field of organismic biology.\" Thus, it was through increasingly tense relations with molecular biology that organismic biologists cohered into a distinct community, with their own philosophical grounding, institutional security, and historical identity. Because this identity was based in large part on a fundamental rejection of the physical sciences as a desirable model within biology, organismic biologists succeeded in protecting the future of their field by emphasizing the deep divisions that ran through the biological sciences as a whole.\n      </p>", "Sophora fernandeziana is the only legume endemic to Isla Robinson Crusoe (Archipelago Juan Fern\u00e1ndez, Chile); it is uncommon and becoming rare. Although its preservation status is listed as \"vulnerable,\" as with many species, little is known of its reproductive biology. Flowering phenology, floral morphology, nectar features, breeding system, and visitors were analyzed in two populations. Flowering is from late winter to early spring. Flowers last 6 d and have a number of ornithophilous features. A floral nectary begins to secrete highly concentrated nectar 48 h after flowers open. Nectar secretion increases as the flower ages but culminates in active nectar reabsorption as the flower senesces. Nectar production is negatively affected by nectar removal. Self-pollen germinates and tubes grow down the style. However, pollen tubes were only observed to enter the ovaries in open pollinated styles, suggesting the possibility of an ovarian self-incompatibility mechanism. Both sexes of the two hummingbird species that inhabit the island are regular visitors. Low fruit and seed set, low genetic diversity, and a shrinking number of populations all contribute to increased concern about the future of this species-and perhaps the hummingbirds that depend on it.\n      </p>", "Biology and mathematics are inextricably linked.
