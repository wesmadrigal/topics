{"total_words": 548, "documents": ["In most species of social insects, the nest is enlarged gradually as the colony grows. Here we call attention to some striking exceptions to this general rule of continuous nest construction. A common pattern among the swarm-founding, eusocial wasp species is explosive nest construction, in which the nest is built rapidly to a large size in the first one to three weeks after colony initiation. Nest size then remains static for weeks or months. We document this pattern of nest growth for the swarm-founding wasp, Polybia occidentalis. Data showing a high percentage of empty cells in pre-emergence-stage nests suggest that a similar pattern holds for some other swarm-founding polistine genera. In contrast, certain other genera seem to follow the continuous construction pattern of the independent founders. We propose five potential factors that could favor a strategy of explosive nest construction: maximization of colony productivity, work-group efficiency, protection of the brood, protection of the swarm adults, and enhancement of reproductive competition. We discuss evidence from both groups of swarm founders that provides circumstantial support for some of these, but not for others.\n      </p>", "Relationships are developed between the unit construction cost of an ocean outfall in dollars per metre of length and the inside diameter of the outfall. These relationships are based on cost data for 47 outfalls; the dimensions, characteristics, costs, and dates of these outfalls are presented in tables. The two major factors affecting unit construction costs seem to be the diameter of the outfall and construction conditions, although local circumstances also have a large influence. The units costs presented in the paper can be used to develop an approximate estimate of the cost of constructing an outfall.\n      </p>", "Ecological responses to dam construction are poorly understood, especially for downstream benthic algal communities. We examined the responses of benthic algal communities in downstream reaches of a tributary of the Xiangxi River, China, to the construction of a small run-of-river dam. From February 2003 to August 2006, benthic algae, chemical factors, and habitat characteristics were monitored upstream and downstream of the dam site. This period spanned 6 mo before dam construction and 37 mo after dam construction. Benthic algal sampling yielded 199 taxa in 59 genera that belonged to Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta, and Cyanophyta. Some physical factors (flow velocity, water depth, and channel width) and 3 algal metrics (diatom species richness, Margalef diversity, and % erect individuals) were significantly affected by the dam construction, whereas chemical factors (e.g., NH\u2084-N, total N, SiO\u2082) were not. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordinations showed that overall algal assemblage structure downstream of the dam sites was similar to that of upstream control sites before dam construction and for 1 year after dam construction (p &amp;gt; 0.05). However, sites belonging to upstream and downstream reaches were well separated on NMS axis 1 during the 2nd and 3rd years after dam construction. Our results suggest that impacts of dam construction on benthic algal communities took 2 to 3 y to emerge. Further development of a complete set of indicators is needed to address the impact of small-dam construction. Our observations underscore the need for additional studies that quantify ecological responses to dam construction over longer time spans.\n      </p>", "Canoe construction was studied in a Maijuna community to better understand the role and significance of canoes in the life and subsistence strategies of an Amazonian group. In this community the types of canoes constructed and used by the Maijuna have changed considerably over the past 20 years. Twenty-seven species were identified as being specifically employed by the Maijuna to construct the type of dugout canoe currently being made in the community. The scarcity of preferred species used for canoe hulls directly affects the trees chosen for construction and may have been a contributing factor behind the complete switch from making the traditional type of dugout canoe. /// Se estudi\u00f3 la construcci\u00f3n de canoas en una comunidad Maijuna para comprender mejor el papel e importancia de las canoas en las estrategias de vida y subsistencia de un grupo amaz\u00f3nico. En esta comunidad los tipos de canoas construidos y usados por los Maijuna han cambiado considerablemente durante los \u00faltimos 20 a\u00f1os. Fueron identificadas veintisiete especies empleadas espec\u00edficamente por los Maijuna para construir el tipo de piragua que est\u00e1 siendo hecha actualmente en la comunidad. La escasez de las especies usadas preferentemente para hacer los cascos de las canoas, afecta directamente a los \u00e1rboles elegidos para su construcci\u00f3n, y puede haber sido un factor contributivo detr\u00e1s del completo cambio en la producci\u00f3n del tipo tradicional de piragua.\n      </p>", "An explicit formula for a canonical splitting s: QB(E.) \u2192 B(E.) of the projection B(E.) \u2192 QB(E.) of the bar construction on a commutative d.g. algebra E. onto its indecomposables is given.

In the February 1983 issue of Interfaces Perry and Iliff described a pilot study using the transportation model to decide on these earth movements during the construction of a major international airport. The out-of-kilter algorithm was used to find precise sand rehandling contract packages. Cost savings approached a million dollars for about three man-weeks of consulting time.\n      </p>", "A risk management model for prevention of occupational injuries at large construction projects is presented. The model combines the engineering CDIO-phase model (conceive, design, implement or construct, operate) with a socio-cultural approach to safety management. The risk management model is targeting clients/owners of the projects. In this study the model is used for categorization of existing injury prevention measures (personal, structural or cultural change) at large construction projects in Denmark, and for evaluation of the effect. The majority of the injury prevention measures were implemented during the construction phase and belonged to the category structural change (for example, safety walk-rounds and safety audits). The study showed that injury prevention may be improved at future projects by implementing more measures influencing norms and culture at the construction site (for example, the pioneer client concept), and thus increase the diversity of injury prevention measures. Many injury incidents originate from the design phase. Future safety research should focus more on developing injury prevention measures for this phase.\n      </p>", "The web construction behavior of Achaearanea tesselata (Keyserling 1884) was observed in the field and in captivity using suspended wire frames that allowed detailed observations. Construction included three stages: preliminary exploration during which lines were broken, reeled up, and replaced; construction of anchor lines and the upper tangle; and construction and then filling in of the sheet below the tangle. Repeated visits to the mouth of the retreat during tangle construction resulted in the apparent reinforcement of the few lines radiating from this area, a possible adaptation to sense the location of prey in the web, and to facilitate orientation of the spider to prey in the web. Filling in the sheet, which alternated with additions to the tangle, included two previously undescribed behavioral patterns: irregular wandering on the sheet and apparent attachments of the dragline using only the two legs IV to hold previous lines against the spinnerets. The spider needed 1-2 nights, working several hours each night, to make a complete tangle and sheet and added lines and extended both the tangle and the sheet on subsequent nights. Spiders adapted the shapes of their webs to their surroundings.\n      </p>", "This paper describes several examples of trunk sewer construction using the shield method in Yokohama, Japan, and details the history and topography of the city. A report is given on the sewer system plan and the sewer construction progress of Yokohama; in addition, the following construction methods are described: the blind method, mud slurry pressure shield method, controlled soil pressure method, shield method in sandy layers with confined water, and shield for a rapid curved line. Construction methods projected for the future, tail void filling, shield construction method in peat and gravel layers, and small diameter shield method are also described.\n      </p>", "Doing business in Ghana could not have come at a better time. In the name of globalization, the government of President Kufuor has liberalized trade so that foreign construction companies easily compete with Ghana's own construction firms for big-ticket contracts. A major consequence of the bidding policy, however, is that globalization has negatively affected the nation's indigenous construction contractors in competing with large, international, private corporations for public contracts in Ghana. The situation has rendered indigenous entrepreneurs not only virtually helpless but also continually lacking vital resources. This article examines the current predicament of Ghana's indigenous construction businesses in terms of their inability to effectively compete with foreign construction firms. The author proposes meaningful ways in which the government should formulate a much-needed framework for developing, nurturing, and sustaining their operational infrastructure with the view to preparing them to compete effectively with foreign businesses, particularly for lucrative public-construction contracts in Ghana.\n      </p>", "The Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County, Calif., recently completed construction of their fourth ocean outfall, a 120-in. (3.1-m) diam pipeline terminating over 2 miles (3.2 km) offshore in 195-ft (58.5-m) depth of water. The conventional \"Y\" structure used to change direction from the main outfall pipeline to the diffuser legs was eliminated. A single-leg diffuser was aligned parallel to shore by simply beveling 28 lengths of pipe 2 1/2 deg each to provide a smooth gradual 70-deg curve. Reaction forces are distributed around the curve; special anchorage is not required. The use of small diam diffuser ports, ranging from 2 to a maximum of 3 1/2 in. (5.1 to 8.9 cm) located at depths between 165 and 195 ft (49.5 and 58.5 m), provide diffusion efficiencies equal to, or greater than other diffusers with larger ports operating in 210 ft (63 m) of depth or greater. Specifications allowed the contractor to use any previously developed method of construction which had proved satisfactory or to use new methods. Consideration of construction methods during design produced innovations resulting in savings without sacrifice of operating efficiency.\n      </p>", "Seedlings of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) were grown under varying conditions of soil nitrogen and atmospheric carbon dioxide availability to investigate the interactive effects of these resources on the energetic requirements for leaf growth. Increasing the ambient CO\u2082 partial pressure from 35 to 65 Pa increased seedling growth only when soil nitrogen was high. Biomass increased by 55% and photosynthesis increased by 13% after 100 days of CO\u2082 enrichment. Leaves from seedlings grown in high soil nitrogen were 7.0% more expensive on a g glucose g-1 dry mass basis to produce than those grown in low nitrogen, while elevated CO\u2082 decreased leaf cost by 3.5%. Nitrogen and CO\u2082 availability had an interactive effect on leaf construction cost expressed on an area basis, reflecting source-sink interactions. When both resources were abundant, leaf construction cost on an area basis was relatively high (81.8 \u00b1 3.0 g glucose m-2) compared to leaves from high nitrogen, low CO\u2082 seedlings (56.3 \u00b1 3.0 g glucose m-2) and low nitrogen, low CO\u2082 seedlings (67.1 \u00b1 2.7 g glucose m-2). Leaf construction cost appears to respond to alterations in the utilization of photoassimilates mediated by resource availability.\n      </p>", "Honeybee colonies, like organisms, should exhibit optimal design in their temporal pattern of resource allocation to somatic structures. A vital colony structure is the comb which stores honey for overwinter survival. However, the timing of comb construction poses a dilemma to a colony attempting to maximize its honey reserves. On the one hand, plenty of empty comb is needed for efficient exploitation of temporally unpredictable flower blooms. On the other hand, because comb is made from energetically expensive wax, its construction too early or in excessive amounts will reduce the amount of honey available for winter thermoregulation and brood-rearing. A dynamic optimization model concludes that colonies should add new comb only when they have filled their old comb with food and brood above a threshold level. The threshold increases with time until, at the end of the season, building is never an optimal behavior. The temporal pattern of construction predicted by the model - pulses of building coincident with periods of nectar intake and comb fullness - matches that seen in an actual colony observed over the course of an entire foraging season. When nectar sources are rich but temporally clumped, the model also predicts that bees should be sensitive to nectar intake, employing much higher thresholds on days when nectar is not available than on days when it is. Even under poorer and more dispersed nectar regimes, little fitness cost is paid by colonies replacing the optimal strategy with a simpler rule of thumb calling for new construction only when two conditions are met: (1) a fullness threshold has been exceeded, and (2) nectar is currently being collected. Experiments demonstrate that colonies do in fact use such a rule of thumb to control the onset of construction. However, once they have begun building, the bees continue as long as nectar collection persists, regardless of changes in comb fullness. Thus the onset and duration of comb-building bouts appear to be under partially independent control.\n      </p>", "Why is the accident frequency rate of the sewer construction and maintenance industry eight times higher than rates for the gas or electric utilities? The answer lies in the type of safety program employed by each industry. Serious accidents occur regularly during sewer work because the safety programs are not what they should be. Responsibility for a more effective program lies with the engineer, contractor, educator, laborer, manufacturer, sewerowner, and utility management. Implementation of good safety habits, plus enforcement of existing laws will lower this inexcusable accident rate.\n      </p>", "Lythrum salicaria (purple loosestrife) is a nonindigenous invasive species characterized by prolific growth and abundance in marshy and riparian habitats across North America. Given its invasive success, we hypothesized this species may require less energy and/or use energy more efficiently for biomass construction than co-occurring noninvasive plant species. We measured leaf construction cost (CC), leaf mass per unit area (LMA), and leaf organic nitrogen and carbon content of L. salicaria and the five most abundant co-occurring species, Parthenocissus quinquefolia, Erigeron philadelphicus, Asclepias syriaca, Spiraea latifolia, and Solidago graminifolia, along dammed ponds in the Black Rock Forest, Cornwall, New York, USA. Lythrum salicaria, which was highly abundant (2.52 individuals/m2), exhibited significantly lower area-based leaf CC (44.47 \u00b1 4.24 g glucose/m2 leaf) than relatively less abundant species, suggesting energetics may influence its invasive success. Conversely, least abundant Solidago graminifolia (0.67 individuals/m2) exhibited the significantly highest leaf CC per unit leaf area (141.87 \u00b1 39.21 g glucose/m2 leaf). Overall, a negative correlation between species abundance and area-based leaf CC (r2 = 0.73) indicated low energy requirements and/or high energy efficiency may influence relative abundance in the plant species studied. As it correlates with species abundance in this study, CC may be a useful tool for evaluating invasive potential.\n      </p>", "The overarching goal of this article is to account for why the Internally-Headed Relative Clause, the direct perception, and the factive constructions in Korean have an identical form involving the pronominal kes and the relativizer -un, despite the fact that one construction instantiates relativization and the other two instantiate complementation. I solve this puzzle by recasting Kim's (2007) analysis of Internally-Headed relatives in a Kratzerian situation semantic framework (e. g., Kratzer 1989, 1998, 2002). The central claim is that the three kes-constructions have an identical form because they all instantiate situation subordination that is facilitated by an Etype pronoun and a relativization strategy. The proposed analysis shows that E-type pronouns and relativizers can have more flexible semantics than widely assumed. It also sheds new light on the connection between modification and complementation across languages. Furthermore, it provides an argument for Kratzerian situation semantic theory in dealing with the interpretations of complex clauses.\n      </p>", "In bridge construction, basic structural elements are used repeatedly. Usually, designs are developed using standard guidelines and according to the preferences of the designer, but they are not necessarily the best from the viewpoint of cost. However, cost-effective designs can be produced using mathematical programming techniques. Here two typical bridge design problems are solved using GPALL (a geometric programming theory based optimization procedure). The cost for one bridge is compared with the cost of a commonly used design.\n      </p>", "Driven by economic and environmental considerations, a consortium of companies sponsored the development of a knowledge-based decision support system, called MODEX (Modularization Expert) to help professionals in the construction industry to make decisions about the feasibility of using modularization technology for construction projects. MODEX also provides a detailed analysis of the impact of modularization on the cost and schedule of the constructed facility. To acquire knowledge, we interviewed experts from 22 organizations including facility owners, contractors, and fabricators. Over 50 member companies of the consortium have evaluated and validated the system, and about 80 companies and universities in the US and other countries are now using it. By encouraging companies to use modules in building industrial plants, MODEX can help reduce the damage to the natural environment that results from heavy on-site construction activities.\n      </p>", "This study describes the smoking patterns of 3528 construction workers as reported at occupational health examinations, in four occupational health centres located in the South of Germany, conducted between August 1986 and December 1988. Subjects were aged 20 to 59 years and were working as plumbers, carpenters, painters or varnishers, plasterers, bricklayers, unskilled workers or white collar employees. Overall smoking prevalence was 53.5%. It was considerably higher than in a representative population sample of the same age groups. Active follow up was carried out to ascertain vital status between October 1992 and July 1994. The effect of smoking on all cause mortality was assessed using the cox proportional hazard model. The relative risk of current smoking was 2.5 (95% CI 1.4-4.4) after adjustment for age, profession, self reported alcohol consumption, body mass index, nationality, and company size. 60% of the deaths among smokers and 34% of deaths in the whole cohort were attributable to smoking. These findings underline the need for comprehensive efforts to reduce smoking and its negative consequences in this occupational group.\n      </p>", "The definition of 'definition' cannot be taken for granted. The problem has been treated from various angles in different journals. Among other questions raised on the subject we find: the notions of concept definition and concept image, conceptions of mathematical definitions, redefinitions, and from a more axiomatic point of view, how to construct definitions. This paper will deal with 'definition construction processes' and aims more specifically at proposing a new approach to the study of the formation of mathematical concepts. I shall demonstrate that the study of the defining and concept formation processes demands the setting up of a general theoretical framework. I shall propose such a tool characterizing classical points of view of mathematical definitions as well as analyzing the dialectic involving definition construction and concept formation. In that perspective, a didactical exemplification will also be presented.\n      </p>", "A network-flow model is formulated for constructing parallel tests based on classical test theory using test reliability for the criterion. The model enables practitioners to specify a test difficulty distribution for the values of the item difficulties as well as test composition requirements.

The results of an empirical study show that the generated tests have acceptably high test reliability.\n      </p>", "Fully embracing previous achievements in the research of Taoist philosophy, this paper attempts to create a sound analysis and investigation of the value concern of Taoism and reconstruct a new set of Taoist philosophy conforming to the requirement of modern science from the perspective of modern philosophy.

The first period started in 1954 and lasted for about a decade; the second period started in 1965 and ended in 1972. I argue in this paper that the publication of a dozen more books on how to construct scientific theories in the seven years after 1965 marked the beginning of the end of, rather than the end of the beginning of, the theory construction movement in sociology. Although the formal mode of theory construction is dead now, efforts toward theory construction will never end. I conclude by delineating the major features of a new approach to theory construction that has been emerging in sociology.\n      </p>", "By techniques of recombination in vitro, we have constructed a plasmid bearing the repressor gene (cI) of bacteriophage \u03bb fused to the promoter of the lac operon. Strains carrying this plasmid overproduce \u03bb repressor. This functional cI gene was reconstituted by joining DNA fragments bearing different parts of that gene. Flush end fusion techniques, involving no sequence overlap, were necessary for the construction; in certain cases, the abutting of the DNA molecules bearing ends generated by different restriction endonucleases creates a sequence at the junction which is recognized by one of the restriction endonucleases.\n      </p>", "Antibiotic treatment by humans generates strong viability selection for antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. The frequency of host antibiotic use often determines the strength of this selection, and changing patterns of antibiotic use can generate many types of behaviors in the population dynamics of resistant and sensitive bacterial populations. In this paper, we present a simple model of hosts dimorphic for their tendency to use/avoid antibiotics and bacterial pathogens dimorphic in their resistance/sensitivity to antibiotic treatment. When a constant fraction of hosts uses antibiotics, the two bacterial strain populations can coexist unless host use-frequency is above a critical value; this critical value is derived as the ratio of the fitness cost of resistance to the fitness cost of undergoing treatment. When strain frequencies can affect host behavior, the dynamics may be analyzed in the light of niche construction. We consider three models underlying changing host behavior: conformism, the avoidance of long infections, and adherence to the advice of public health officials. In the latter two, we find that the pathogen can have quite a strong effect on host behavior. In particular, if antibiotic use is discouraged when resistance levels are high, we observe a classic niche-construction phenomenon of maintaining strain polymorphism even in parameter regions where it would not be expected.\n      </p>", "There has recently been a reappraisal of value in UK construction and calls from a wide range of influential individuals, professional institutions and government bodies for the industry to exceed stakeholders' expectations and develop integrated teams that can deliver world class products and services. As such value is certainly topical, but the importance of values as a separate but related concept is less well understood. Most construction firms have well-defined and well-articulated values, expressed in annual reports and on websites; however, the lack of rigorous and structured approaches published within construction management research and the practical, unsupported advice on construction institution websites may indicates a shortfall in the approaches used. This article reviews and compares the content and structure of some of the most widely used values approaches, and discusses their application within the construction sector. One of the most advanced and empirically tested theories of human values is appraised, and subsequently adopted as a suitable approach to eliciting and defining shared organisational values. Three studies within six construction organisations demonstrate the potential application of this individually grounded approach to reveal and align the relative values priorities of individuals and organisations to understand the strength of their similarity and difference. The results of these case studies show that this new universal values structure can be used along with more qualitative elicitation techniques to understand organisational cultures.\n      </p>", "Nearly all of sociology's top graduate training programs require their students to complete one or two courses on sociological theory. The instructors for these courses have an extraordinary opportunity to affect the perspectives and practices of future generations of scholars. This study assesses the backgrounds, attitudes, beliefs, and practices of those instructors regarding different approaches to theorizing, with particular attention paid to topics related to science and to theory construction. Sociologists who teach required theory courses in the discipline's top fifty graduate training programs were asked a series of questions pertaining to their own training and to the courses they were teaching: attitudes toward different kinds of theorizing, perceptions of the role that theory plays in sociology and in science, and views on the nature of science. Results indicate a strong consensus on the most important classical theorists (Marx, Weber, and Durkheim). However, attitudes and practices varied widely in regard to other classical theorists, contemporary sociological theory, and the role of scientific standards in the development of sociological knowledge. The author explores some of the implications of these attitudes and practices.\n      </p>", "Although spider webs may be effective in trapping prey, they require energy for construction. The design of webs varies in complexity from species to species. I assume that the energetic cost of web construction is significantly different among web types or species. This cost may constrain foraging tactics, particularly web relocation, because web relocation also requires energy to make a new web. To clarify the effect of the cost of web construction on web relocation, the energy cost of web construction and the rate of web relocation were estimated for the spider Agelena limbata. This spider constructs a sheet-funnel web consisting of a tight mesh of silk threads. This web was costly in terms of the energy needed for construction, which ranged from 9 to 19 times the daily maintenance energy. The daily rate of web relocation was below 1%, indicating high web-site tenacity. Relocation rates of species which built different types of web were compared in relation to cost of web construction. Orbweavers, which produce less costly webs than sheet-funnel weavers, relocate webs more frequently. Sheetweavers, which make webs of intermediate cost, appear to relocate webs more frequently than sheet-funnel weavers but less frequently than orbweavers. These results suggest that the energy cost of web construction is important in determining the frequency of web relocation.\n      </p>", "Objective\u2014To establish a detailed pattern of the nature and extent of illnesses and injuries among construction workers in Ireland which cause temporary absence from work, and to identify diseases and disabilities which lead to premature retirement from the industry on health grounds. Methods\u2014The population base for the study consisted of construction workers who were members of the Construction Federation operatives pension and sick pay scheme. Records of sickness absence since 1981, stored on computer disks, and records of early retirement on health grounds since 1972, stored on microfiche film, were examined. Pertinent data were extracted and transferred to a database; after cleaning and the exclusion of unvalidated data, records of 28 792 absences and 3098 records of early retirement were available for analysis. Data were analysed with Access 97 and Epi Info. Results\u2014Over period of the study the mean annual absences were 7.8/100 workers. Three quarters of absences were among younger workers; however, the rate of absence increased with age, as did the mean duration of absence. Injury was the most frequent reason for absence, followed by infectious disease, then musculoskeletal disorders. The mean annual rate of early retirement on health grounds was 5.3/1000 workers. The median age at retirement was 58 years. Cardiovascular disease and musculoskeletal disorders each accounted for nearly one third of the conditions leading to permanent disability on the grounds of which early retirement was granted. During the period of the study, over 677 000 working days were lost due to sickness absence, and over 24 000 potential years of working lives were lost due to early retirement on health grounds. Conclusions\u2014The study has shown paterns of sickness absence and early retirement on health grounds in the Irish construction industry which will contribute to the further development of health promotion strategies for construction workers.\n      </p>", "Objectives\u2014To identify work related risk factors of future low back pain (LBP) in a cohort of construction workers free of LBP at the start of follow up. Methods\u2014The Hamburg construction worker study comprises 571 male construction workers who have undergone two comprehensive interview and physical examination surveys. A cohort of 285 subjects without LBP at baseline was identified. After a follow up of 3 years, the 1 year prevalence of self reported LBP was determined in the 230 men followed up (80.7%). Prevalence ratios (PRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of LBP at follow up according to self reported work tasks of construction workers measured at baseline were estimated from Cox's regression models which were adjusted for age, and anthropometric measures. Results\u2014At follow up 71 out of 230 workers (30.9%) reported LBP during the preceding 12 months. Four work tasks (scaffolding, erecting roof structures, sawing wood, laying large sandstones) with an increased risk of 1 year prevalence of LBP at follow up were further evaluated. After further adjustment for occupation the relative risk was increased for workers who had reported \u22652 hour/shifts laying large sandstones (PR=2.6; 95% CI 1.1 to 6.5). Work load of bricklayers was additionally estimated by an index on stone load (high exposure: PR=4.0; 95% CI 0.8 to 19.8), and an index for laying huge bricks/blocks (yes/no: PR=1.7; 95% CI 0.5 to 5.7). Conclusions\u2014The results suggest that self reported differences in brick characteristics (size and type of stone) and temporal aspects of the work of bricklayers (average hours per shift laying specified stones) can predict the future prevalence of LBP. The data have to be interpreted with caution because multiple risk factors were tested.\n      </p>", "A multivariate approach to contract bidding strategies in the construction industry is presented. This represents a radical departure from previous work in the field by using all available data on competing bidders. `Optimal', `no loss' and `break even' mark-up strategies are derived and methods of parameter estimation proposed. A case study shows how the three strategic mark-up values are calculated against known competitors.\n      </p>", "Objective\u2014To describe the health status of older construction workers and the occurrence of early retirement due to disability or of mortality within a five year follow up. Methods\u2014Firstly, a cross sectional study was performed among 4958 employees in the German construction industry, aged 40\u201364 years, who underwent standardised routine occupational health examinations in 1986\u20138. The study population included plumbers, carpenters, painters/varnishers, plasterers, unskilled workers, and white collar workers (control group). Job specific prevalence and age adjusted relative prevalence were calculated for hearing loss, abnormal findings at lung auscultation, reduced forced expiratory volume, increased diastolic blood pressure, abnormalities in the electrocardiogram, increased body mass index, hypercholesterolaemia, increased liver enzymes, abnormal findings in an examination of the musculoskeletal system, and abnormalities of the skin. Secondly, follow up for disability and all cause mortality was ascertained between 1992 and 1994 (mean follow up period = 4\u00b75 y). Job specific crude rates were calculated for the occurrence of early retirement due to disability and for all cause mortality. With Cox's proportional hazards model, job specific relative risks, adjusted for age, nationality, and smoking were obtained. Results\u2014Compared with the white collar workers, a higher prevalence of hearing deficiencies, signs of obstructive lung diseases, increased body mass index, and musculoskeletal abnormalities were found among the construction workers at the baseline exam. During the follow up period, 141 men died and 341 men left the labour market due to disability. Compared with white collar workers, the construction workers showed a 3\u00b75 to 8\u00b74-fold increased rate of disability (P &lt; 0\u00b705 for all occupational groups) and a 1\u00b72 to 2\u00b71-fold increased all cause mortality (NS). Conclusions\u2014This study shows the need and possibilities for further health promotion in workers employed in the construction industry, targeting both work related conditions and prtdonsl lifestyle factors. Rehabilitation measures should be enforced to limit the rate of disability among construction workers.\n      </p>", "The niche-construction perspective within evolutionary biology places emphasis on the changes that organisms bring about in their selective environments. Advocates of this viewpoint argue that there is both accuracy and utility in treating niche construction as an evolutionary process in its own right, rather than merely as a product of evolution. Here we discuss and assess seven putative weaknesses of the niche-construction perspective. Niche construction has been neglected or rejected on the grounds that (1) it is not prevalent, (2) its study is not tractable, (3) it is not a process, (4) it is caused by natural selection, (5) it does not change our understanding of evolution in any fundamental way, (6) it does not bring about adaptation, and (7) it is not a single phenomenon. In each case, we critically evaluate the theoretical standing of these arguments and consider the empirical evidence that can be brought to bear on the debate. We conclude that none of these are strong criticisms of the niche-construction perspective and maintain that there are compelling reasons for treating niche construction as a major evolutionary process.\n      </p>", "Recently, linear programming models for test construction were developed. These models were based on the information function from item response theory. In this paper another approach is followed. Two 0-1 linear programming models for the construction of tests using classical item and test parameters are given. These models are useful, for instance, when classical test theory has to serve as an interface between an IRT-based item banking system and a test constructor not familiar with the underlying theory.\n      </p>", "The behavior of organisms can contribute to the transformation of their environments. When organismal impacts on the environment feed back to influence organismal density, viability, fertility, or persistence, the environment can be construed as an extension of the organism. This process of fitness\u2010enhancing environmental transformation has been called niche construction. We focus on the relationship of niche construction with species or strain diversity and on the variability of investment in niche construction versus reproduction. We demonstrate a fundamental dilemma of niche construction, whereby the construction of a shared resource leads to a tragedy of the commons, with competition tending to eliminate niche construction strategies. The ability to monopolize a niche, either through spatial proximity or through preferential exploitation, can stabilize niche construction and promote ecological coexistence among polymorphic constructors. We consider both sympatric and allopatric origins of niche construction. Under a variety of different construction mechanisms, variability in the investment in niche construction versus reproduction suggests reproductive altruism but is fully consistent with selfish behavior. We discuss the implications of niche\u2010construction theory on the evolution of life cycles and development, behavioral plasticity, the division of labor, and long\u2010term macroevolutionary trends.\n      </p>", "This paper explores how ideas and ideals are constructed. More specifically, it follows how ideas and ideals of 'childhood' are constructed. Still more specifically, it attends to the ways in which idea(l)s of childhood are literally and materially constructed, in, through and as part of practices such as the building and maintenance of architectural forms. I argue that most studies of childhood largely ignore the importance of local, banal, ephemeral, mundane, material practices - often involved in the very constitution and performance of spaces - which are hugely significant to the construction of idea(l)s like childhood. By adopting a 'critical geographical' approach to the daily life of an alternative school in Pembrokeshire, in the United Kingdom, I demonstrate how particular arrays of usually un-noticed practices are involved in the construction, constitution and evocation of idea(l)s like childhood.\n      </p>", "The 1981 Construction Grant Amendments to the Clean Water Act established a renewed emphasis on water quality management and project cost effectiveness. Specifically, the amendments attempt to direct limited grant dollars toward facilities with the potential for the greatest water quality and public health improvements. As part of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 1982 Needs Survey, the Water Use Impairment Improvement Screen (WUIS) was developed as a planning tool to evaluate the accomplishments of the construction grants program and aid states in water quality management. WUIS is designed for use at the screening level and for areawide application, and models both dissolved oxygen concentrations and ammonia toxicity for evaluation of stream use impairment or improvements.\n      </p>", "Given a polytope and an arbitrary subset of its vertices, we show how to construct a differentiable concave function that assumes any arbitrary value (within a specified \u03b5 -tolerance) at each vertex of the subset, with each vertex in the subset a strong local constrained minimum. We also show how this construction method can be used to generate test problems for linearly constrained concave minimization algorithms.\n      </p>", "Research has an important role in the production of knowledge and in shaping dominant social attitudes towards adolescent motherhood. Although adolescent motherhood has been framed as a social problem in social scientific research, recent researchers have attempted to go beyond the focus on disadvantage to suggest that outcomes for adolescent mothers depend upon individual differences and contextual factors related to successful mothering. Social structures have also been considered, and adolescent motherhood has been investigated from the perspective of the mothers themselves. Each of these approaches to researching adolescent motherhood provides a subject position for adolescent mothers with associated potential for both positive and negative impact on their social lives. These implications and the alternatives to individualizing success and discounting social constraint require consideration. Useful strategies could include valuing motherhood regardless of the social and economic position of the mother, and addressing structures which contribute to the exclusion of adolescent mothers from education and economic participation. /// La recherche joue un r\u00f4le important dans la production des connaissances et dans la construction des attitudes sociales dominantes vis-\u00e0-vis de la maternit\u00e9 chez les adolescentes. Bien que cette derni\u00e8re soit abord\u00e9e comme un handicap par la recherche en sciences sociales, des chercheurs ont r\u00e9cemment tent\u00e9 d'aller au-del\u00e0 de cette focalisation sur le handicap social pour sugg\u00e9rer que les r\u00e9sultats pour les m\u00e8res adolescentes d\u00e9pendent de leurs caract\u00e9ristiques individuelles et des facteurs contextuels relatifs aux soins maternels r\u00e9ussis.

Aunque en las investigaciones cient\u00edfico sociales se ha encasillado la maternidad adolescente como un problema social, en investigaciones recientes se ha intentado ir m\u00e1s all\u00e1 y no centrarse solamente en las desventajas sino que se ha sugerido que los resultados de las madres adolescentes dependen de las diferencias individuales y los factores contextuales relacionados con el \u00e9xito de la maternidad. Tambi\u00e9n se han tenido en cuenta las estructuras sociales y se ha investigado la maternidad adolescente a partir de la perspectiva de las propias madres. Cada uno de estos planteamientos hacia la investigaci\u00f3n de la maternidad adolescente ofrece a las madres adolescentes una posici\u00f3n de sujeto relacionada potencialmente en sus vidas sociales tanto con un impacto positivo como uno negativo. Hay que analizar mejor estas implicaciones y las alternativas al \u00e9xito de individualidad e ignorar las limitaciones sociales. Algunas estrategias \u00fatiles podr\u00edan ser, por un lado, valorar la maternidad independientemente de la posici\u00f3n social y econ\u00f3mica de la madre y, por otro, considerar las estructuras que contribuyen a la exclusi\u00f3n de las madres adolescentes de la educaci\u00f3n y la participaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica.\n      </p>", "The intersubjective dialogic exercise through which identities and knowledge are constructed exists in a dialectic relation with the 'place' of the interview. The in situ nature of interviewing should not be overlooked. Two case studies of interviews conducted with older people in Britain about their social network and support are used to illuminate two aspects of the socio-spatial construction of interview data. First, interview sites can yield important information about the way participants construct their individual and social identities. Second, such identities can influence interviewer-interviewee dynamics.\n      </p>", "There are obvious reasons why residential construction should depend on the population's age structure. We estimate this relation on Swedish time series data and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development panel data. Large groups of young adults are associated with higher rates of residential construction, but there is also a significant negative effect from those above 75. Age effects on residential investment are robust and forecast well out-of-sample in contrast to the corresponding house price results. This may explain why the debate around house prices and demography has been rather inconclusive. Rapidly aging populations in the industrialized world makes the future look bleak for the construction industry.\n      </p>", "Recent years have seen the growth in popularity of neural networks for business decision support because of their capabilities for modeling, estimating, and classifying. Compared to other AI methods for problem solving such as expert systems, neural network approaches are especially useful for their ability to learn adaptively from observations. However, neural network learning performed by algorithms such as back-propagation (BP) are known to be slow due to the size of the search space involved and also the iterative manner in which the algorithm works. In this paper, we show that the degree of difficulty in neural network learning is inherent in the given set of training examples. We propose a technique for measuring such learning difficulty, and then develop a feature construction methodology that helps transform the training data so that both the learning speed and classification accuracy of neural network algorithms are improved. We show the efficacy of the proposed method for financial risk classification, a domain characterized by frequent data noise, lack of functional structure, and high attribute interactions. Moreover, the empirical studies also provide insights into the structural characteristics of neural networks with respect to the input data used as well as possible mechanisms to improve the learning performance.\n      </p>", "This paper proposes science-based organization design that uses construction principles and design rules to guide practitioner-academic projects. Organization science implies construction principles for creating and implementing designs. These principles serve to construct design rules that are instrumental in developing organization designs. Testing and implementing designs require pragmatic experimentation in complex, dynamic settings. The authors explore a circular design process as an example of science-based organization design. Tests of this circular process in over 30 organizations suggest that construction principles are important for creating new design rules as well as for a deeper understanding of the systems and practices created from these rules. In addition, explicit principles and rules for organization design appear to facilitate the transfer of learning between different projects. As such, they can help reconnect organization research to ongoing design work.\n      </p>"], "words": {"all": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "selection": {"number": 1, "prob":
