After 7 months of participant observation and non-structured interviews, I found that theoretical capital and technological capital are both used in the isotope lab. While both are associated with scientific authority, it was theoretical capital that determined lab members' social authority. Dominant and subordinate members of the lab applied different strategies to advance their interests. Conflicts of interest induced competition between the holders of theoretical and technological capital, which in turn caused interpersonal conflict. The specificity of the field of geoscience determines the relative power of technological and theoretical capital, and the low autonomy of the scientific field in China strengthens that hierarchy. I find that this hierarchy of scientific capital in the broader field can have a considerable impact on the social construction of experimental results in the local settings.\n      </p>", "While consideration of natural environment factors increased in the late eighties, from the very beginning geoscience was outside the planning process. It was a consequence of the state of applied geology in Lithuania. During this time the development of certain industrial projects was stopped; urgent environment protection measures came into use; it was recognised that nonrational utilization depleted resources.\n      </p>", "The numerical modelling of particulate processes in environmental science increasingly requires an ability to represent the properties of individual natural particles. Considerable advances have been made in discontinuum modelling using spheres to represent particles. In this paper, we discuss recent developments that illustrate a way forward for tackling the complexity of realistically shaped bodies such as those exhibited by rock fragments. To address the validation of such approaches, we present a comparison of cube-packing experiments and their equivalent numerical simulation. Sensitivity to initial conditions, highlighted for non-spherical bodies, enters the discussion of problems with validation of numerical simulation. The algorithmic details behind these advances in modelling large systems of realistically shaped particles are summarized in our companion paper in this volume.\n      </p>", "At the request of the IGU Study Group on Rapid Geomorphologic Hazards, the author has dealt with a lot of information on China's hazards in the course of compiling geomorphic hazard inventories. While analyzing those hazards throughout history, especially in the past two decades, the author found that quite many hazards used to be either interrelated or associated with each other. On the basis of a large number of eventful catastrophic cases both in China and its adjacent areas, this paper analyzes and sums up the following seven major sequences with respect to the occurrences and transformations in geo-hazards: 1) Dry-cold wind-drift sand (dust) storm type, 2) Warm-wet water-soil hazards type, 3) Wet-hot typhoon hazards type, 4) Alpine freezing-gravity hazards type, 5) Earthquake-rainstorm and mud-rock flow type, 6) Earthquake-forest fire hazards type and 7) Earthquaketsunami hazards type.\n      </p>", "Much progress has been made in the UK in characterizing the internal structures of major physiographic features in the oceans and in developing understanding of the geological processes that have created or shaped them. UK researchers have authored articles of high impact in all areas described here. In contrast to terrestrial geoscience, however, there have been few instrumented observations made of active processes by UK scientists. This is an area that could be developed over the next decades in the UK. Research on active processes has the potential ability to engage the wider public: Some active processes present significant geo-hazards to populations and offshore infrastructure that require monitoring and there could be commercial applications of technological developments needed for science. Some of the suggestions could involve studies in shallow coastal waters where ship costs are much reduced, addressing tighter funding constraints over the near term. The possibilities of measuring aspects of volcanic eruptions, flowing lava, turbidity currents and mass movements (landslides) are discussed. A further area of potential development is in greater collaboration between the ocean sciences. For example, it is well known in terrestrial geomorphology that biological agents are important in modulating erosion and the transport of sediments, ultimately affecting the shape of the Earth's surface in various ways. The analogous effect of biology on large-scale geomorphology in the oceans is also known but remains poorly quantified. Physical oceanographie models are becoming increasingly accurate and could be used to study further the patterns of erosion, particle transport and deposition in the oceans. Marine geological and geophysical data could in turn be useful for further verification of such models. Adapting them to conditions of past oceans could address the shorter-period movements, such as due to internal waves and tides, which have been barely addressed in palaeoceanography.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "           ", "Contemporary observations of marine foraging in a variety of settings suggest that some mollusks tend to be over-represented in middens because of differential preservation relative to other mollusk species as well as other organisms. Ethnoarchaeologists have often relied on the 'typical' pattern of shell-midden disposal for interpreting variation in assemblage composition in the past. This stems from describing and explaining the material consequences of behavior rather than understanding behavior itself. Behavioral ecology with its concern for the variable costs and benefits in decisions about culling activities and transport of prey types promises to improve the quality of behavioral inferences. This paper examines the relationship between two foraging models, prey choice and central-place, among intertidal/shallow subtidal mollusk gatherers in Western Kiribati, Micronesia, and a comparison is made with similar work previously carried out in the Torres Strait, Australia. Results show that decisions about mollusk culling and transport can be predicted by prey attributes within a cost/benefit framework. The research also highlights unanticipated variability and may contribute to the debate on indigenous conservation of resources.\n      </p>", "In the present work we show a study carried out in a coastal sandy environment in NW Spain with the main aim of imaging the shallow subsoil structure. The goals of the study included the detection of the water table and bedrock, but also a description of the aeolian dunes and progradating sand layers. With these objectives two independent but complementary geophysical techniques were jointly used: ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and electrical resistivity imaging (ERI). Regarding GPR, shielded antennas of 200 &amp; 250 MHz from two different manufacturers were used in the study; it also allowed us to make a comparative study between them. To obtain a more detailed image of the sand layers structure it was also used a shielded 500 MHz antenna. 100 &amp; 200 MHz unshielded antennas were also used to apply the CMP method in order to obtain a precise estimation of the velocity of the electromagnetic waves into the subsoil. ERI was carried out in order to obtain independent estimations of both water table and bedrock depths, as well as the resistivity values of the groundwater water that are useful to determine the occurrence -or not- of fresh water on marine water. Although the resolution of ERI is low comparing with GPR, the penetration depth is greater. The results show that the bedrock is clearly identified in ERI profiles at about 8-9 m depth, whereas the water table is located at 5-6 m depth in good agreement with the GPR profiles. Resistivity values in the most external ERI profiles show that the water table is constituted by fresh water. In addition to this, the high resolution of both 200-250 and 500 Mhz antennae has allowed to obtain a clear image of the internal structure of the sand deposits. This information has been used to infer the dynamic of progradation of the coastal system.\n      </p>", "Axius serratus, a crustacean thought to be extremely rare, was discovered in large numbers in polluted regions of the Strait of Canso. The shrimp may live deeper than 3 meters in the sediment; burrows are kept open to at least 2.5 meters. Sediment contained in old filled burrows is anomalous in its distribution of particle size and its content of water, organic carbon, and trace elements. These anomalous qualitites affect the geotechnical properties of sediments on the sea floor.\n      </p>", "Twelve months of archaeological excavation and survey were conducted on the Blane Peninsula in Blue Mud Bay over three field seasons between 2000 and 2002. During this time, 141 sites were recorded, and 16 sites were excavated. Though archaeological work in the region prior to this study has not been extensive, some general patterns have been identified that are similar to those reported by other researchers across the tropical North of Australia. These patterns include the type of sites present, the use of similar resources; the distribution of sites across similar landscapes, and the timing and extent of occupation through the late-Holocene. The preliminary analysis of the archaeological evidence demonstrates Aboriginal occupation and marine resource exploitation on the Blane Peninsula from 3000 years ago to the present day. This evidence includes relative continuity in the range of shellfish species gathered, in the site locations used during this time, and in the patterns of shellfish discarded in midden deposits.\n      </p>", "Of all the various infections that afflicted Aboriginal people in Australia during the years of first contact with Europeans, smallpox was the most disastrous. The physical and social impacts of the disease are well known. This article considers another effect of the contagion. It is argued that a nativist movement in the form of a waganna (dance ritual) associated with the Wiradjuri spirit Baiame and his adversary Tharrawiirgal was linked to the aftermath of the disease as it was experienced at the settlement site of the Wellington Valley of New South Wales (NSW). The discovery of this movement is of considerable significance for an understanding of Aboriginal responses to colonization in southeastern Australia. It is the earliest well-attested nativist movement in Australian ethnohistory.\n      </p>", "Fifty conventional core samples from the Ragley Lumber # 1 well located in Allen Parish Louisiana (Sec 29, T5S, R7W) were analyzed for palynomorphs. Dinoflagellate cysts, not considered to be recycled, were present in all samples along with abundant to very abundant pollen, spores and fungal spores. Dinoflagellate cyst abundances varied considerably from sparse (&lt;20 cysts per sample) to abundant (&gt; 100 cysts per sample). Preservation also displayed considerable range, even within the same sample. Biostratigraphically useful taxa include: Adnatosphaeridium multispinosum, Apectodinium homomorphum, Areosphaeridium dictyoplokus, Deflandrea phosphoritica, Spinidinium sagittula, Lingulodinium machaerophorum, Muratodinium fimbratum, Palaeocystodinium golzowense, and Hafniasphaera septata. Other taxa described include: Achomosphaera alcicornu, Cleistosphaeridium diversispinosum, Cordosphaeridium inodes, Diphyes colligerum, Operculodinium centrocarpum, Polysphaeridium subtile, Trichodinium hirsuitum, and Senegalinium sp. 1. In addition to the indigenous flora, a recycled flora was also encountered. These specimens were assignable to the following genera: Muderongia, Dinogymnium and Odontochitina. Based on abundances of Spiniferites and Cleistosphaeridium types and general scarcity of peridiniacean dinoflagellate cysts and Impagidinium species an outer neritic water depth is postulated. Benthic foraminiferal data from a section of the core generally support this interpretation.\n      </p>", "Crystal growth mechanisms are crucial to understanding the complexity of crystal morphologies in nature and advanced technological materials, such as the faceting and dendrites found in snowflakes and the microstructure and associated strength properties of structural and icy planetary materials. In this article, we present observations of pressure-induced ice VI crystal growth, which have been predicted theoretically, but had never been observed experimentally to our knowledge. Under modulated pressure conditions in a dynamic-diamond anvil cell, rough single ice VI crystal initially grows into well defined octahedral crystal facets. However, as the compression rate increases, the crystal surface dramatically changes from rough to facet, and from convex to concave because of a surface instability, and thereby the growth rate suddenly increases by an order of magnitude. Depending on the compression rate, this discontinuous jump in crystal growth rate or \"shock crystal growth\" eventually produces 2D carpet-type fractal morphology, and moreover dendrites form under sinusoidal compression, whose crystal morphologies are remarkably similar to those predicted in theoretical simulations under a temperature gradient field. The observed strong dependence of the growth mechanism on compression rate, therefore, suggests a different approach to developing a comprehensive understanding of crystal growth dynamics.\n      </p>", "Silicon micromachined calorimeters (\"calorimeter on a chip\") are used to measure heat capacities and phase transition enthalpies for thin film, single crystal, and powder samples (5-500 \u03bcg). The technology is thus compatible with the small samples produced in multianvil and large diamond anvil cells. Techniques for handling small samples and attaching them to the calorimetric devices have been developed. Initial data illustrate application to CoO and to Fe\u2082SiO\u2084 olivine and spinel, a quenched high pressure phase metastable at ambient conditions. The calorimetric entropy of the olivine - spinel transition in Fe\u2082SiO\u2084 (-16 \u00b1 5 J/mol\u00b7K) is in good agreement with that calculated from phase equilibrium data (-14 \u00b1 3 J/mol\u00b7K). A magnetic transition in iron silicate spinel, detected previously by Mossbauer spectroscopy, is seen in the calorimetric signal.\n      </p>", "The postperovskite (ppv) phase transition occurs in the deep mantle close to the core-mantle boundary (CMB). For this reason, we must include in the dynamical considerations both the Clapeyron slope and the temperature intercept, $T_{{\\rm int}}$, which is the temperature of the phase transition at the CMB pressure. For a CMB temperature greater than $T_{{\\rm int}}$, there is a double crossing of the phase boundary by the geotherms associated with the descending flow. We have found a great sensitivity of the shape of the ppv surface due to the CMB from variations of various parameters such as the amount of internal heating, the Clapeyron slope, and the temperature intercept. Three-dimensional spherical models of mantle convection that can satisfy the seismological constraints depend on the Clapeyron slope. At moderate value, 8 MPa/K, the best fit is found with a core heat flow amounting for 40% of the total heat budget (\u224815 TW), whereas for 10 MPa/K the agreement is for a lower core heat flow (20%, \u22487.5 TW). In all cases, these solutions correspond to a temperature intercept 200 K lower than the CMB temperature. These models have holes of perovskite adjacent to ppv in regions of hot upwellings.\n      </p>", "Pressure (P) derivatives of thermal conductivity (k) and thermal diffusivity (D) are important to geophysics but are difficult to measure accurately because minerals, being hard and partially transparent, likely incur systematic errors through thermal losses at interfaces and spurious radiative transfer. To evaluate accuracy, repeat experiments for olivine $[({\\rm Mg}_{0.9}{\\rm Fe}_{0.1})_{2}{\\rm SiO}_{4}]$, quartz (SiO\u2082), and NaCl are examined in detail: these and other data on electrical insulators are compared with theory. At ambient conditions, D is underestimated in proportion to the number of contacts. As temperature (T) increases, spurious radiative transfer more than offsets contact loss. Compression of pore space and contact losses affect pressure derivatives, but these seem independent of T. Accurate (\u00b12%) values of D(T) at 1 atm are obtained with the contact-free, laser-flash method. Other optical techniques do not pinpoint D but provide useful pressure derivatives. Published data on \u2202(lnk)/\u2202P at ambient conditions agree roughly with all available models, the simplest of which predicts $\\partial ({\\rm ln}k)/\\partial P\\sim \\partial ({\\rm ln}K_{{\\rm T}})/\\partial P$, where $K_{{\\rm T}}$ is the bulk modulus. However, derivatives verified by multiple measurements are reproduced accurately only by the damped harmonic oscillator model. An improved database is needed to refine this model and to confidently extrapolate these difficult measurements to geophysically relevant conditions.\n      </p>", "Mantle-derived garnet peridotites are a minor component in many very high-pressure metamorphic terranes that formed during continental subduction and collision. Some of these mantle rocks contain trace amounts of zircon and micrometer-sized inclusions. The constituent minerals exhibit pre- and postsubduction microstructures, including polymorphic transformation and mineral exsolution. Experimental, mineralogical, petrochemical, and geochronological characterizations using novel techniques with high spatial, temporal, and energy resolutions are resulting in unexpected discoveries of new phases, providing better constraints on deep mantle processes.\n      </p>", "Analysis of data on micro- and nano-inclusions in mantle-derived and metamorphic diamonds shows that, to a first approximation, diamond-forming medium can be considered as a specific ultrapotassic, carbonate/chloride/silicate/water fluid. In the present work, the processes and mechanisms of diamond crystallization were experimentally studied at 7.5 GPa, within the temperature range of 1,400-1,800\u00b0C, with different compositions of melts and fluids in the KCl/K\u2082C0\u2083/H\u2082O/C system. It has been established that, at constant pressure, temperature, and run duration, the mechanisms of diamond nucleation, degree of graphite-to-diamond transformation, and formation of metastable graphite are governed chiefly by the composition of the fluids and melts. The experimental data suggest that the evolution of the composition of deep-seated ultrapotassic fluids/melts is a crucial factor of diamond formation in mantle and ultrahigh-pressure metamorphic processes.\n      </p>", "Geologists have \"known\" for many years that continental crust is buoyant and cannot be subducted very deep. Microdiamonds 10-80 \u03bcm in size discovered in the 1980s within metamorphic rocks related to continental collisions clearly refute this statement, suggesting that material of continental crust has been subducted to a minimum depth of &amp;gt; 150 km and incorporated into mountain chains during tectonic exhumation. Over the past decade, the rapidly moving technological advancement has made it possible to examine these diamonds in detail, and to learn that they contain nanometric multiphase inclusions of crystalline and fluid phases and are characterized by a \"crustal\" signature of carbon stable isotopes. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy, focused ion beam techniques, synchrotron infrared spectroscopy, and nano-secondary ion mass spectrometry studies of these diamonds provide evidence that they were crystallized from a supercritical carbon-oxygen-hydrogen fluid. These microdiamonds preserve evidence of the pathway by which carbon and water can be subducted to mantle depths and returned back to the earth's surface.\n      </p>", "Our ability to interpret seismic observations including the seismic discontinuities and the density and velocity profiles in the earth's interior is critically dependent on the accuracy of pressure measurements up to 364 GPa at high temperature. Pressure scales based on the reduced shock-wave equations of state alone may predict pressure variations up to 7% in the megabar pressure range at room temperature and even higher percentage at high temperature, leading to large uncertainties in understanding the nature of the seismic discontinuities and chemical composition of the earth's interior. Here, we report compression data of gold (Au), platinum (Pt), the NaCl-B2 phase, and solid neon (Ne) at 300 K and high temperatures up to megabar pressures. Combined with existing experimental data, the compression data were used to establish internally consistent thermal equations of state of Au, Pt, NaCl-B2, and solid Ne. The internally consistent pressure scales provide a tractable, accurate baseline for comparing high pressure-temperature experimental data with theoretical calculations and the seismic observations, thereby advancing our understanding fundamental high-pressure phenomena and the chemistry and physics of the earth's interior.\n      </p>", "Materials can be experimentally characterized to terapascal pressures by sending a laser-induced shock wave through a sample that is precompressed inside a diamond-anvil cell. This combination of static and dynamic compression methods has been experimentally demonstrated and ultimately provides access to the 10- to 100-TPa (0.1-1 Gbar) pressure range that is relevant to planetary science, testing first-principles theories of condensed matter, and experimentally studying a new regime of chemical bonding.\n      </p>", "The core extends from the depth of 2,900 km to the center of the Earth and is composed mainly of an iron-rich alloy with nickel, with 10% of the mass comprised of lighter elements like hydrogen, but the exact composition is uncertain. We present a quantum mechanical first-principles study of the dynamical stability of FeH phases and their phonon densities of states at high pressure. Our free-energy calculations reveal a phonon-driven stabilization of dhcp FeH at low pressures, thus resolving the present contradiction between experimental observations and theoretical predictions. Calculations reveal a complex phase diagram for FeH under pressure with a dhcp \u2192 hcp \u2192 fcc sequence of structural transitions.\n      </p>", "Understanding the thermal-chemical state of the Earth's core requires knowledge of the thermal expansion of iron-rich alloys at megabar pressures and high temperatures. Our survey of literature revealed a significant lack of such data. We have determined the unit-cell parameters of the iron-sulfur compound Fe\u2083S by using synchrotron x-ray diffraction techniques and externally heated diamond-anvil cells at pressures up to 42.5 GPa and temperatures up to 900 K. The zero-pressure thermal expansivity of Fe\u2083S is determined in the form \u03b1 = a\u2081 + a\u2082T, where a\u2081 = 3.0 \u00b1 1.3 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2075 K\u207b\u00b9 and a\u2082 = 2.8 \u00b1 1.5 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2078 K\u207b\u00b2.

Our data at 42.5 GPa and 900 K suggest that \u22482.1 at. % (1.2 wt. %) sulfur produces 1% density deficit in iron. We have also carried out energy-dispersive x-ray diffraction measurements on pure iron and ${\\rm Fe}_{0.864}{\\rm Si}_{0.136}$ alloy samples that were placed symmetrically in the same multianvil cell assemblies, using the SPring-8 synchrotron facility in Japan. Based on direct comparison of unit cell volumes under presumably identical pressures and temperatures, our data suggest that at most 3.2 at. % (1.6 wt. %) silicon is needed to produce 1% density deficit with respect to pure iron.\n      </p>", "Deep earthquakes have been a paradox since their discovery in the 1920s. The combined increase of pressure and temperature with depth precludes brittle failure or frictional sliding beyond a few tens of kilometers, yet earthquakes occur continually in subduction zones to \u2248700 km. The expected healing effects of pressure and temperature and growing amounts of seismic and experimental data suggest that earthquakes at depth probably represent self-organized failure analogous to, but different from, brittle failure. The only high-pressure shearing instabilities identified by experiment require generation in situ of a small fraction of very weak material differing significantly in density from the parent material. This \"fluid\" spontaneously forms mode I microcracks or microanticracks that self-organize via the elastic strain fields at their tips, leading to shear failure. Growing evidence suggests that the great majority of subduction zone earthquakes shallower than 400 km are initiated by breakdown of hydrous phases and that deeper ones probably initiate as a shearing instability associated with breakdown of metastable olivine to its higher-pressure polymorphs. In either case, fault propagation could be enhanced by shear heating, just as is sometimes the case with frictional sliding in the crust. Extensive seismological interrogation of the region of the Tonga subduction zone in the southwest Pacific Ocean provides evidence suggesting significant metastable olivine, with implication for its presence in other regions of deep seismicity. If metastable olivine is confirmed, either current thermal models of subducting slabs are too warm or published kinetics of olivine breakdown reactions are too fast.\n      </p>", "The Just-in-Time Teaching (JiTT) technique allows students to be engaged in course material outside of the classroom by answering web-based questions.

Data show that students are able to reflect on their prior knowledge and construct new knowledge with weekly graded JiTT exercises.

Its bulk tabular shape remains relatively stable while its interior undergoes significant stirring with low-velocity conduits along its edges and down-welling near the middle. Here, we perform a mapping of chemistry and temperature into P and S velocity variations and replace a seismically derived structure with this hybrid model. Synthetic seismogram sections generated for this 2D model are then compared directly with corresponding seismic observations of P (P, ${\\rm P}_{{\\rm C}}{\\rm P}$, and PKP) and S (S, ${\\rm S}_{{\\rm C}}{\\rm S}$, and SKS) phases. These results explain the anticorrelation between the bulk velocity and shear velocity and the sharpness and level of SKS travel time delays. In addition, we present evidence for the existence of a D\" triplication (a putative phase change) beneath the down-welling structure.\n      </p>", "Imposing a thermal and compositional significance to the outcome of the inversion of seismic data facilitates their interpretation. Using long-period seismic waveforms and an inversion approach that includes constraints from mineral physics, we find that lateral variations of temperature can explain a large part of the data in the upper mantle. The additional compositional signature of cratons emerges in the global model as well. Above 300 km, we obtain seismic geotherms that span the range of expected temperatures in various tectonic regions. Absolute velocities and gradients with depth are well constrained by the seismic data throughout the upper mantle, except near discontinuities. The seismic data are consistent with a slower transition zone and an overall faster shallow upper mantle, which is not compatible with a homogenous dry pyrolite composition. A gradual enrichment with depth in a garnet-rich component helps to reduce the observed discrepancies. A hydrated transition zone would help to lower the velocities in the transition zone, but it does not explain the seismic structure above it.\n      </p>", "The adiabatic bulk $(K_{S})$ and shear (G) moduli of mantle materials at high pressure and temperature can be obtained directly by measuring compressional and shear wave velocities in the laboratory with experimental techniques based on physical acoustics. We present the application of the current state-of-the-art experimental techniques by using ultrasonic interferometry in conjunction with synchrotron x radiation to study the elasticity of olivine and pyroxenes and their high-pressure phases. By using these updated thermoelasticity data for these phases, velocity and density profiles for a pyrolite model are constructed and compared with radial seismic models. We conclude that pyrolite provides an adequate explanation of the major seismic discontinuities at 410- and 660-km depths, the gradient in the transition zone, as well as the velocities in the lower mantle, if the uncertainties in the modeling and the variations in different seismic models are considered. The characteristics of the seismic scaling factors in response to thermal anomalies suggest that anticorrelations between bulk sound and shear wave velocities, as well as the large positive density anomalies observed in the lower mantle, cannot be explained fully without invoking chemical variations.\n      </p>", "This paper describes some aspects of fieldwork undertaken from December 1990 until April 1991 on the wreck of the Dutch East India Company ship the \"Oosterland\" (1697).

It is envisaged that underwater excavations will continue in future. Detailed analyses of recovered materials and archival research are ongoing and preliminary results will be published shortly. Parallel to this, some inter-disciplinary projects are currently being undertaken. One project focuses on the use of a Geographical Information System (GIS) to develop a framework for the reconstruction of spatial relationships of artefacts and features. Other joint research projects concentrate on aspects of oceanography and beach morphology related to the wreck site and the chemical analyses of recovered artefacts.\n      </p>", "The Middle-Upper Ordovician represents a significant period in the early evolution of fishes. During this time, many of the major lineages, including javvless and putative jawed taxa, made their first appearance in the fossil record, marking a series of diversification events. As a number of studies have focused on the habitat of Laurentian fish during this interval, work has been undertaken at a number of known Gondwanan vertebrate localities in order to provide new perspectives on the ecological preferences of early fish from the Southern Hemisphere. Ichnological and sedimentological data collated from these localities enable reconstructions of the habitats of a number of Ordovician fish, most notably those of the arandaspid-bearing successions of the Anzaldo Formation of Bolivia, the Stairway Sandstone of central Australia, and the Amdeh Formation of Oman, from which articulated or macroscopic fragmentary fossil remains are recorded. These data indicate that the arandaspids were constrained to very shallow marine habitats and prone to seasonal influxes of freshwater and terrigenous sediment.

The species is closely related to Gonyaulacysta jurassica (Deflandre 1939) Norris &amp; Sarjeant 1965. It has a relatively large epicyst, an apparently similar tabulation pattern to Gonyaulacysta jurassica and exhibits neutral torsion.

A number of science and technology badges exist for the Girl Scouts, yet not many of these badges have been completed because of a lack of confidence the troop leaders have in teaching science and a paucity of scheduled science events for the leaders to take their girls. Junior Girl Scout troops were invited to the Pennsylvania State University Delaware County campus to complete a series of hands-on dinosaur science activities that allowed them to earn the \"Science in Everyday Life\" badge. At the conclusion of the badge event, the girls reported a greater interest in science, a desire to learn more science, and a desire to complete additional science-related Girl Scout badges.\n      </p>", "We develop a new estimation technique for recovering depth-of-field from multiple stereo images. Depth-of-field is estimated by determining the shift in image location resulting from different camera viewpoints. When this shift is not divisible by pixel width, the multiple stereo images can be combined to form a super-resolution image. By modeling this super-resolution image as a realization of a random field, one can view the recovery of depth as a likelihood estimation problem. We apply these modeling techniques to the recovery of cloud height from multiple viewing angles provided by the MISR instrument on the Terra Satellite. Our efforts are focused on a two layer cloud ensemble where both layers are relatively planar, the bottom layer is optically thick and textured, and the top layer is optically thin. Our results demonstrate that with relative ease, we get comparable estimates to the M2 stereo matcher which is the same algorithm used in the current MISR standard product (details can be found in [IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing 40 (2002) 1547-1559]). Moreover, our techniques provide the possibility of modeling all of the MISR data in a unified way for cloud height estimation. Research is underway to extend this framework for fast, quality global estimates of cloud height.\n      </p>", "Aim To determine whether the pronounced ecological importance of pebble mounds to pebble-mound mice (Pseudomys) is manifest in their continental biogeography. Location Northern Australia. Methods A GIS-based comparison was made between the habitats contained within the potential climatic distributions of mice, representing a null hypothesis of no habitat selection, and their actual distributions based on all known location records. Results All species had a clear preference for hilly, rocky landscapes with a surficial cover dominated by bedrock. Simple vegetation communities with relatively open eucalypt overstorey and grassy understorey were preferred. Highly degraded rocks and aggradational surfaces and plains were avoided. The extent of the summer monsoon may be important in determining the southern limits of the group's distribution. Major disjunctions between species were attributable to the presence of clay plains and sand sheets. The behavioural requirement of pebble-mound mice for mounds determines their population distribution pattern and the distribution of the different species within the genus. Main conclusions The behavioural need for pebble mounds drives the distributional pattern of populations and species of pebble-mound mice. The initial spread of pebble-mound mice probably occurred during the late Pliocene or earliest Pleistocene. There has predominantly been degradation of the potential distribution of the group since that time due to the stability of Australian landscapes and Pleistocene planation and sand sheet development over large areas of northern Australia. This process is ongoing, and past regions of rocky contact between current distributions have disappeared, while the distributional limits of several species are steadily being reduced by erosion of hills and the spread of dune fields.\n      </p>", "First the terms \"perspective of research\" and \"methodology\" are briefly considered and differentiated. Secondly some perspectives of research in modern German Physical Geography are discussed: Especially the ecological (\"geoecological\") and geomorphological approaches. Stress is laid among other things on the misinterpretations of these approaches and of their practical research. The \"separatistic\" and \"exceptionalist\" arguments are stressed as well. With these arguments geographers have wrongly claimed that Physical Geographies differ basically from the corresponding geosciences. Finally the political situation and the future of Physical Geographies in schools and universities are discussed. Among other things we propose to interpret and to focus each kind of Physical Geography in the following ways: Firstly as a more descriptive subdiscipline of the corresponding geoscience (mainly on the regional level); secondly as a subdiscipline which \u2013 on the theoretical level \u2013 deals mainly with the spatial variables; thirdly as a subdiscipline which concentrates on human interference in natural systems. Lastly a certain focussing on ecology as well as dynamic and theoretical geomorphology is proposed; as to the spatial and temporal scope we advocate the conservation of the traditional \"anthropocentric\" view, i. e. the middle of the scale of interest.\n      </p>", "Atlantic Canada has been home to native populations for at least 11,000 years. This paper traces some of the more significant human events and changing technologies as seen through the archaeological and geological record. Atlantic Canada was never a densely populated region, however it did support significant populations who were well adapted to the seasonal shifts in availability of resources from the land, its rivers and the sea. From the earliest Palaeo-Indian period, Atlantic Canada was not a region which developed in cultural isolation. Although there is regional specificity to varying degrees, whether it be stone, ceramic or bone industries, technological traditions often exhibit relationships to broader cultural traditions of Eastern North America.

The beach complex is composed of a sandy beach, coast-parallel dunes, and a dune cordon. Grain size analyses, calcium carbonate content, sand texture and composition, and radiocarbon ages were determined to understand the Holocene evolution of the Sixteen Mile Beach Complex. Changes in sand grain size and dune morphology allow the complex to be divided into three parts. The beach and the dune cordon at the southern end are composed of fine sand.The central beach has a rapid decrease in the fine sand fraction that coincides with the transition from the dune cordon to a single large coast-parallel dune ridge. The northern beach is composed of medium sand and consists of a series of prograded, vegetated coast-parallel dune ridges. The formation of these distinct regimes is a reflection of the different amounts of wave energy received by the complex from the predominant southwest swell.The radiocarbon analyses of bulk sand samples show a progressive younger age of the carbonate beach sand toward the north, which reflects an increase in grain size and recently broken shell. The mean age of the beach is 2.4 ka based on an accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) date of picked pink-colored carbonate grains. The fresh bulk carbonate beach sand has a mean age of 7.4 ka and reflects the presence of reworked Pleistocene beach and dune sand.Corrected bulk sand radiocarbon ages indicate that the dune cordon has been active since 4.5 ka with a mean dune migration rate of 5.3 m/y. However, variations in sand supply, sea level, and climate indicate a complex and erratic evolution of the dune cordon.\n      </p>", "The application of palynology to forensic investigations relies on the similarity of pollen assemblages from forensic items, such as footwear, with control samples from a crime scene. The pollen from material adhering to footwear is likely to reflect some combination of pollen from the locations where the boots/shoes have been worn most recently. This study investigated the changes in pollen assemblages on footwear that had been worn at different sites. Six rural sites in the East Midlands of England, United Kingdom were visited wearing pristine boots (i.e. no mixing), and boots that were previously worn at other localities (i.e. potential mixing). Samples of adherent soil from these items of footwear, and control samples, were analysed palynologically in order to assess the degree and significance of mixing of the pollen assemblages. With the exception of one sample, the pollen adherent to footwear or in the soil samples from each of the six sites (no mixing) had a characteristic signature. This supports the general distinctiveness of pollen from individual sites, the concept of widespread palynological heterogeneity, and the utility of palynology in forensic geoscience. The data from this study show that when mixing occurs from wearing footwear at different sites, the pollen/spore content of the boots etc. dominantly reflects that of the last site. This was evident from a visual examination of the raw data, and was confirmed using detrended correspondence analysis applied to the eleven dominant taxa. These data showed clustering of samples based on the last site visited. The more abundant the pollen/spores, the closer the samples were clustered. The clustering was less convincing at localities that yielded relatively sparse palynomorphs. However, sample material from footwear that was potentially contaminated with soil from previous localities typically exhibited some subtle differences. These were normally slight increases in diversity, and small variations in certain pollen types. The relative insignificance of these differences means that they would be difficult to discern consistently and quantify. It is thus critical that, in relevant forensic investigations, footwear belonging to suspects is seized as soon as possible after a crime is committed.\n      </p>", "Polycrystalline diamonds (framesites) from the Venetia kimberlite in South Africa contain silicate minerals whose isotopic and trace element characteristics document remobilization of older carbon and silicate components to form the framesites shortly before kimberlite eruption. Chemical variations within the garnets correlate with carbon isotopes in the diamonds, indicating contemporaneous formation. Trace element, radiogenic, and stable isotope variations can be explained by the interaction of eclogites with a carbonatitic melt, derived by remobilization of material that had been stored for a considerable time in the lithosphere. These results indicate more recent formation of diamonds from older materials within the cratonic lithosphere.\n      </p>", "Recent years have witnessed the discovery of new large stratabound deposits of base metals, tungsten and uranium, as well as intensified research efforts in the investigation of known occurrences. Three problems are of particular interest: (1) The response of stratabound metal concentrations to varying degrees of metamorphism, and the limits of 'survival' of their geometrical and compositional parameters, (2) the distribution of manganese in the ore environment of sulphide deposits, and (3) the participation of elements not traditionally associated with the sedimentary cycle, such as tungsten, in the formation of stratabound deposits. The northwestern Cape Province, S. Africa, has been selected for an initial study of these aspects because of its wealth in large and economically significant base metal concentrations. These occur in volcano-sedimentary successions of probable Kheis age (2600 Ma) which have been metamorphosed during the 1200 Ma Kibaran orogeny. Metamorphism was of amphibolite facies grade (600-700 degrees C, 3-4.5 kbar) in the east (deposits of Aggeneys and Gamsberg) and of granulite facies grade (800-1000 degrees C, 6-8 kbar) in the west (deposits of the O'okiep Copper District, including the Wolfram Schist). In amphibolite facies terrain, the stratabound nature of orebodies is generally well preserved, although complicated by several phases of folding. Electron probe analyses reveal high MnO-contents in silicates of the ore environment (garnets 20%, pyroxene 5%, stilpnomelane 11%). These findings correlate with recent data from the Broken Hill, N.S.W. deposits (Stanton 1976) and from the Red Sea (Cronan et al. 1976). Their potential value lies both in the fields of ore genesis and of exploration geochemistry. Major concentrations of copper ore in transgressive 'noritoids' are limited to the granulite facies terrain of the O'okiep Copper District. Their isotopic, geochemical and petrological parameters favour crustal rather than mantle origin. A source bed model deriving the noritoids by partial melting of Cu-bearing members of the stratigraphic sequence, is thus proposed. Small tungsten deposits have in the past been mined in the granulite facies terrains of Namaqualand: concordant quartz-ferberite veins occur in the 'Wolfram Schist' and have previously been interpreted as hydrothermal and pegmatitic. Their distinct limitation to a specific stratigraphic horizon as well as new quantitative data on the age and grade of metamorphism in the area suggested a review of this genetic concept. The recent discovery of stratabound tungsten mineralization in Austria, Norway and Rhodesia, and the recognition of the sedimentary origin of the Sundong, S. Korea, deposit further stimulated these considerations. The Namaqualand tungsten deposits are thus interpreted as the product of granulite-facies metamorphism of sedimentary scheelite concentrations. These investigations necessitate the combination of many geoscientific disciplines, including field work, structural geology, geophysics, petrology, isotopic studies, geochemistry, ore microscopy and experimental mineralogy, here termed 'the comprehensive geoscience approach'. This clearly requires team work; the author has had the privilege of closely cooperating with groups led by Professor T. N. Clifford (Witwatersrand University) and Mr J. Marais (O'okiep Copper Company Limited).\n      </p>", "           ", "A marked bend in the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain supposedly resulted from a recent major reorganization of the plate-mantle system there 50 million years ago. Although alternative mantle-driven and plate-shifting hypotheses have been proposed, no contemporaneous circum-Pacific plate events have been identified. We report reconstructions for Australia and Antarctica that reveal a major plate reorganization between 50 and 53 million years ago. Revised Pacific Ocean sea-floor reconstructions suggest that subduction of the Pacific-Izanagi spreading ridge and subsequent Marianas/Tonga-Kermadec subduction initiation may have been the ultimate causes of these events. Thus, these plate reconstructions solve long-standing continental fit problems and improve constraints on the motion between East and West Antarctica and global plate circuit closure.\n      </p>", "Since the early 1990s a number of projects have developed indexes to measure vulnerability to environmental change. This article investigates the key conceptual and methodological problems associated with such indexes. It examines in detail an index that explicitly addresses environmental change as an issue of vulnerability, the Environmental Vulnerability Index (EVI) developed by the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC). This examination offers some broader lessons for indicator-based projects, all of which require a simple model of complex and uncertain social-ecological systems, and entail difficult choices about the selection, standardization, weighting, and aggregation of indicators selected to represent important aspects of those systems. We conclude that indexes of vulnerability to environmental change cannot hope to be meaningful when applied to large-scale systems, and so should focus on smaller scales of analysis. We argue that they should not be used as the basis for disbursing funds, comparing countries, or for measuring the performance of countries in environmental management. We also argue that vulnerability is a context-specific rather than a generic condition. Finally, we suggest that because vulnerability is about values at risk, there should be more input from a broader array of people when indexes are being developed and tested. /// \u81ea\u4ece1990\u5e74\u4ee3\u521d\u671f\u4ee5\u6765, \u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u7814\u7a76\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d, \u5df2\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u591a\u4e2a\u6307\u6570\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u56e0\u73af\u5883\u6539\u53d8\u800c\u9020\u6210\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027. \u8fd9\u7bc7\u6587\u7ae0\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u4e0e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6307\u6570\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u95ee\u9898. \u5b83\u8be6\u7ec6\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e86\u7531\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\u5e94\u7528\u5730\u7403\u79d1\u5b66\u59d4\u5458 \u4f1a\u6240\u7814\u53d1\u7684, \u9488\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u7684, \u73af\u5883\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u6307\u6570. \u8fd9\u9879\u8003\u5bdf\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u6807\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u9879\u76ee\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb \u7684\u542f\u793a: \u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u6807\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u9879\u76ee\u4e0d\u6b62\u8981\u5177\u5907\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u4f53\u73b0\u51fa\u590d\u6742\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7b80\u6613\u6a21\u578b, \u4e5f \u9700\u8981\u4f5c\u51fa\u5173\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9, \u6807\u51c6\u5316, \u6240\u5360\u7684\u6bd4\u91cd\u4ee5\u53ca\u6307\u6807\u6c47\u603b\u7684\u8270\u96be\u6289\u62e9\u6765\u4ee3\u8868\u5236\u5ea6\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u65b9\u9762. \u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ed3 \u8bba\u662f, \u56e0\u73af\u5883\u6539\u53d8\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6613\u635f\u6027\u6307\u6807\u662f\u4e0d\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u5730\u8fd0\u7528\u5728\u5927\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684. \u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u8fd0\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u5e94\u4fa7 \u91cd\u4e8e\u8f83\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5206\u6790. \u6211\u4eec\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u5e94\u5f53\u88ab\u7528\u6765\u4f5c\u4e3a\u62e8\u4ed8\u6b3e\u91d1\u7684\u4f9d\u636e, \u56fd\u4e0e\u56fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u6216\u7528 \u4e8e\u8861\u91cf\u4e00\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7ba1\u7406\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4e1a\u7ee9. \u6211\u4eec\u4e5f\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6613\u635f\u6027\u662f\u56e0\u5730\u800c\u5f02, \u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u666e\u53ca\u7684\u72b6\u51b5. \u6700\u540e, \u6211 \u4eec\u5efa\u8bae, \u7531\u4e8e\u6613\u635f\u6027\u6538\u5173\u7740\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684\u51b2\u51fb\u7a0b\u5ea6, \u6307\u6807\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e94\u5305\u542b\u66f4\u5e7f\u5927\u793e\u7fa4\u7684\u5efa\u8bae. /// Desde principios de la d\u00e9cada de los 90, varios proyectos han desarrollado \u00edndices para medir la vulnerabilidad a los cambios ambientales.

Injection into deep-sea basalt formations provides unique and significant advantages over other potential geological storage options, including (i) vast reservoir capacities sufficient to accommodate centuries-long U.S. production of fossil fuel CO\u2082 at locations within pipeline distances to populated areas and CO\u2082 sources along the U.S. west coast; (ii) sufficiently closed water-rock circulation pathways for the chemical reaction of CO\u2082 with basalt to produce stable and nontoxic (Ca\u00b2\u207a, Mg\u00b2\u207a, Fe\u00b2\u207a)CO\u2083 infilling minerals, and (iii) significant risk reduction for post-injection leakage by geological, gravitational, and hydrate-trapping mechanisms. CO\u2082 sequestration in established sediment-covered basalt aquifers on the Juan de Fuca plate offer promising locations to securely accommodate more than a century of future U.S. emissions, warranting energized scientific research, technological assessment, and economic evaluation to establish a viable pilot injection program in the future.\n      </p>", "The general scarcity of geophysical data in the Arctic Ocean Basin and the lack of knowledge about the evolution of the Amerasia Basin and of the nature and origin of the Alpha Ridge led, in 1983, to the undertaking of a multidisciplinary polar expedition, code-named CESAR 83 for Canadian Expedition to Study the Alpha Ridge. The expedition was supported by the Canadian Armed Forces, first by parachuting 18 airborne engineers onto the CESAR site to build a 1.6 km long airstrip on the pack ice, and then by deploying and two months later evacuating the expedition by military Hercules aircraft. The search fora suitable site on the sea ice was facilitated by a preceding side-looking airborne radar(SLAR)reconnaissance survey of the area. One of the major CESAR accomplishments was a regional bathym\u00e9trie and gravity survey over the Ellesmere Island continental shelf and eastern part of the Alpha Ridge. Using the CESAR data as well as all publicly available data collected over the past 35 years, 100 m contour interval bathym\u00e9trie maps and 5 mGalcontour interval gravity free-air anomaly maps were compiled. These extend from the Ellesmere Island coast to the 116\u00b0W meridian. The sea floor maps depict the Alpha Ridge as avery broad mountain complex of rugged topography with ridges and valleys trending parallel to the ridge axis. A prominent east-southeast trending valley centered along 86\u00b0N latitude between 110\u00b0 and 125\u00b0W longitude was named Cesar Trough and the adjoining ridges Cesar North Ridge and Cesar South Ridge. The Alpha Ridge is separated from the Ellesmere Island continental shelf by a trough 1800-2000 m deep. Over the ridge the free-air anomalies mirror the bathymetry. Elliptically shaped positive anomalies centered over the continental shelf break suggest that the continental margin adjacent to the Alpha Ridge hasthe typical Atlantic-type structure characteristic of the rest of the North American polar margin. Preliminary interpretation of the gravity field indicates that the Alpha Ridge crust is composed of very thick rocks of laterally uniform density and composition. Itis suggested that the eastern part of the Alpha Ridge may be a massive accumulation of mafic rocks of probable oceanic origin formed by volcanic activity. This article is identified as Part II of a series on \"Maps of the Arctic Basin Sea Floor\" and is preceded by \"A History of Bathymetry and its Interpretation\" (Weber, 1983). /// La raret\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des donn\u00e9es g\u00e9ophysiques recueillies dans le bassin de l'oc\u00e9an Arctique et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'\u00e9largir les connaissances sur l'\u00e9volution du bassin de l'Am\u00e9riasie et sur la nature et l'origine de la dorsale Alpha ont amen\u00e9 les scientifiques \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser, en 1983, une exp\u00e9dition polaire pluridisciplinaire codifi\u00e9e \"CESAR 83\" \u00e0 partir de son appellation anglaise ''Canadian Expedition to Study the Alpha Ridge''(Exp\u00e9dition canadienne charg\u00e9e d'\u00e9tudier la dorsale Alpha). Les Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes ont appuy\u00e9 l'exp\u00e9dition. Elles ont d'abord parachut\u00e9 sur le site 18 membres d'une troupe de g\u00e9nie qui ont, sur la banquise, construit une piste d'atterrissage d'une longueur de 1,6 km; puis, elles y ont transport\u00e9 le personnel et l'\u00e9quipement dans des avions de type Hercules. Enfin, deux mois plus tard, elles se sont charg\u00e9es du rapatriement des personnes et du mat\u00e9riel. Un lev\u00e9 de reconnaissance effectu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment au-dessus de la mer gel\u00e9e au moyen d'un radar a\u00e9roport\u00e9 \u00e0 antenne lat\u00e9rale (SLAR) a permis la localisation de l'emplacement qui convenait \u00e0 l'exp\u00e9dition. L'exp\u00e9dition CESAR a men\u00e9 \u00e0 bien plusieurs projets importants; entre autres,elle a effectu\u00e9 un lev\u00e9 bathym\u00e9trique et gravim\u00e9trique au-dessus du plateau continental de l'\u00eele Ellesmere et de la partie orientale de la dorsale Alpha. A partir des donn\u00e9es fournies par l'exp\u00e9dition CESAR et celles de nature publique recueillies au cours des 35 derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 possible de compiler des cartes bathym\u00e9triques \u00e0 \u00e9cart de 100m entre les courbes et des cartes des anomalies gravim\u00e9triques \u00e0 l'air libre \u00e0 \u00e9cart de 5 mGal entre les courbes. Ces cartes couvrent la r\u00e9gion comprise entre la c\u00f4te de l'\u00eele Ellesmere et 116\u00b0 de longitude ouest. Sur les cartes des fonds marins, la dorsale Alpha ressemble \u00e0 un tr\u00e8s vaste ensemble montagneux \u00e0 topographie accident\u00e9e o\u00f9, de mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, dorsales et vall\u00e9es s'\u00e9tirent parall\u00e8lement \u00e0 l'axe principal. Une importante vall\u00e9e, d'orientation est sud-est, centr\u00e9e sur la latitude 86\u00b0N et entre les longitudes 110\u00b0 et 125\u00b00 a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e \"Cesar Trough\". Les cr\u00eates adjacent ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9es \"Cesar North Ridge\" et \"Cesar South Ridge\". La dorsale est s\u00e9par\u00e9e du plateau continental de l'\u00eele Ellesmere par une d\u00e9pression dont la profondeur varie de 1800 \u00e0 2000 m. Au-dessus de la dorsale Alpha, les anomalies \u00e0 l'air libre refl\u00e8tent la bathym\u00e9trie. Des anomalies positives de forme elliptique concentr\u00e9es autour de la bordure du plateau continental laissent supposer que la marge continentale adjacent \u00e0 la dorsale Alpha poss\u00e8de la structure typique de la marge de l'Atlantique, qui caract\u00e9rise le reste de la marge polaire nord-am\u00e9ricaine. Une interpr\u00e9tation pr\u00e9liminaire du champ gravim\u00e9trique r\u00e9v\u00e8le que la cro\u00fbte tr\u00e8s \u00e9paisse de la dorsale Alpha est constitu\u00e9e de roches de densit\u00e9 et de composition lat\u00e9ralement uniforme. Il semble que le c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la dorsale Alpha puisse \u00eatre un massif de roches mafigues r\u00e9sultant de l'activit\u00e9 volcanique sous-marine. /// \u0412 1983 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443,

(Weber, 1983).\n      </p>", "Sediment distribution patterns from sediment cores and grab samples on the Roberts Bank area of the Fraser River delta suggest that much of the coarsest sediment supplied to the mouth of the Fraser River bypasses the tidal flats and upper slope, and is deposited on the lower foreslope. Transport is via a number of subaqueous channels which serve not only as conduits for sediment bypassing, but also control the location and geometry of prodelta depositional lobes. Textural parameters, sedimentary structures and geometry of the deposits suggests that these lobes are formed by turbidity currents.\n      </p>", "Marine molluscs, including bivalves, gastropods and scaphopods, were recovered by dredging at depths of 3-82 m in Expedition Fiord, Axel Heiberg Island, Canada. Cluster analysis, based on presence/absence data at 27 stations, defined two mollusc associations within the fiord. A Portlandia-Thyasira association, characterized by the abundance of Portlandia arctica and Thyasira gouldi, inhabits silty clay substrates at depths of 32-82 m throughout the fiord. An Astarte association, characterized by the abundance of Astarte borealis and Astarte warhami, inhabits sandy mud substrates at depths of 3-32 m in the middle and outer fiord. The absence of this mollusc association at the fiord head suggests that the suspension-feeding molluscs that constitute this association, such as Astarte, Hiatella, Mya and Trichotropis, are intolerant of the lowered salinities and high suspendedsediment concentrations created by the discharge of Expedition River into the fiord-head environment. The Expedition Fiord molluscan fauna is compared to the molluscan fauna recorded in J0rgen Br0nlund Fjord, Greenland. In the latter fiord, shallowwater (5-19 m) molluscan faunas are characterized by the abundance of Portlandia arctica and Hiatella arctica, while deep-water (22-48 m) faunas are characterized by the abundance of Thyasira dunbari. Molluscs recovered live in both of these fiords are distributed widely in high-latitude fiord and continental shelf environments.

Des analyses typologiques, \u00e9tablies sur les donn\u00e9es de pr\u00e9sence ou d'absence \u00e0 27 stations, ont permis de d\u00e9finir deux associations de mollusques \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur du fjord. Une association Portlandia-Thyasira, caract\u00e9ris\u00e9e par l'abondance de Portlandia arctica et de Thyasira gouldi, habite les substratums d'argile limoneuse \u00e0 des profondeurs allant de 32 \u00e0 82 m dans le fjord tout entier. Une association Astarte, caract\u00e9ris\u00e9e par l'abondance de Astarte borealis et de Astarte warhami, habite les substratums de vase sableuse \u00e0 des profondeurs allant de 3 \u00e0 32 m dans le milieu ou en aval du fjord. L'absence de cette association de mollusques \u00e0 l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 amont du fjord sugg\u00e8re que les mollusques se nourrissant d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments en suspension qui forment cette association, comme Astarte, Hiatella, Mya et Trichotropis, ne tol\u00e8rent pas les faibles salinit\u00e9s et les fortes concentrations de s\u00e9diments en suspension que cr\u00e9e le d\u00e9versement de la rivi\u00e8re Expedition dans l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 amont du fjord. On compare la faune des mollusques du fjord Expedition \u00e0 celle enregistr\u00e9e dans le fjord J0rgen Br0nlund du Groenland. Dans ce fjord, les faunes de mollusques en eau peu profonde (de 5 \u00e0 19 m) sont caract\u00e9ris\u00e9es par l'abondance de Portlandia arctica et de Hiatella arctica, tandis que les faunes situ\u00e9es en eau profonde (de 22 \u00e0 48 m) sont caract\u00e9ris\u00e9es par l'abondance de Thyasira dunbari. Les mollusques recueillis vivants dans ces deux fjords sont largement r\u00e9pandus dans les fjords et les plates-formes continentales des latitudes \u00e9lev\u00e9es.\n      </p>", "           ", "The enormous hydrothermal gold ore deposit on Lihir Island, Papua Guinea, may have formed in less than 55,000 years.\n      </p>", "Geochemical analyses of specimens of Reduviasporonites suggests that it is most likely of algal, rather than fungal origin. As a probable alga, Reduviasporonites is unlikely to be integral to the process of mass extinction occurring at or near the Permian-Triassic boundary, as suggested by Visscher and other workers because it cannot have acted as a saprophytic metaboliser of dead vegetation resulting from that event. Moreover, it ranges outside the postulated time of mass extinction by at least 10 million years. Optical and electron microscopy of topotype material confirms that Reduviasporonites Wilson 1962 is the senior synonym of Chordecystia Foster 1979, and Tympanicysta Balme 1980. Moreover the type species of the last two genera, assigned in 1999 to Reduviasporonites by Elsik as R. chalastus (Foster) and R. stoschianus (Balme), are conspecific. The type species, R. catenulatus Wilson 1962, differs from R. chalastus in that its constituent cells are significantly smaller, more rounded, and have less well developed connecting areas (terminal rims) between cells. Brazilea helbyi forma gregata Foster 1979, recorded only from the type material of R. chalastus, is likely to be a junior synonym of that taxon. The stratigraphic occurrences of the species of Reduvia-sporonites suggest that R. catenulatus is most common in the Wordian (Kazanian) of Oklahoma, though specimens of the size range associated with R. catenulatus are present very rarely in the Early Triassic Mazzin Member of the Werfen Formation, Austria. R. chalastus is present in Capitanian to Griesbachian rocks spanning at least 10 million years, and outside the more narrow age span of the Permian-Triassic boundary. The size of the constituent cells present in R. chalastus appears to be related to paleolatitude with large examples occurring in the paleotemperate Permian of China, Russia, and Australia (Moura) and smaller specimens occurring in the paleotropical and paleoequatorial Permian of northern Australia, Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom and Austria.\n      </p>", "There is a need for conceptual clarification of both theoretical and empirical terms in Environment-Behavior Studies. This article does this for the case of the \"courtyard house\" by developing a number of possible criteria to characterize it as a dwelling form. Many examples from a variety of locales and periods, both of individual units and the resulting urban fabric, are shown and discussed. The study suggests that many dwellings which do not resemble the prototypical courtyard house may be classified as such on the basis of some of the criteria developed. Some implications are briefly discussed.\n      </p>"], "words": {"pollen": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "represent": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "all": {"number":
