{"total_words": 425, "documents": ["The emergence of grand op\u00e9ra around 1830 resulted in large-scale works in five acts setting libretti largely based on historical subjects that dominated much European stage music until the First World War. But these shifts in generic paradigm came at a price. The repertoire of the Paris Op\u00e9ra was based as much on ballet-pantomime as on opera, and until 1830 both genres would share the stage in a single evening. Although the aesthetic impulses behind grand op\u00e9ra made programming new opera and ballet henceforth impossible, the state required the Op\u00e9ra to maintain the balance between opera and ballet in order to reserve the institution's \u201cpompe et luxe,\u201d a situation that called forth a number of responses from its management during the period that all Parisian opera houses were controlled by license (1806/7 to 1864).\n         In the short term, the Op\u00e9ra continued using older smaller-scale works to accompany ballet as part of the same evening's entertainment, but despite the canonic pressures this exerted it was a practice that could not be sustained indefinitely. A second alternative was to shorten up-to-date grand op\u00e9ra, to bring them down to dimensions at which they could be performed with ballets; the best-known example of this procedure is the reduction of Rossini's Guillaume Tell from four acts (1829) to three (1831). A third possibility was the process of morcellement: the extraction of individual acts or pairs of acts from grand op\u00e9ra and their performance alongside ballet.\n         A longer-term strategy, and one so far entirely ignored in modern scholarship, was the development of a new type of stage music specifically to accompany ballet: petit op\u00e9ra. Emerging from two closely related works at the same time as the birth of grand op\u00e9ra, Rossini's Le Comte Ory (1828) and Auber's Le Philtre (1831), petit op\u00e9ra was the direct result of institutional pressure from the state for the Op\u00e9ra to mount productions of both opera and ballet, the preference of the institution and its audiences for evenings with both opera and ballet, and the indirect aesthetic pressure engendered by the appearance of grand op\u00e9ra. The tradition of composing petit op\u00e9ra continued up to the end of the licensing period in 1864 and encompassed, among such foreign imports as Weber, Verdi, and Donizetti, works by Hal\u00e9vy, Adam, Thomas, Auber, and Rossini; two of the best-known casualties of the complexities surrounding the genre were Berlioz's Benvenuto Cellini (1838) and Wagner's scenario for Le Hollandais volant. Petit op\u00e9ra was characterized by libretti in two acts with a limited number of musical compositions, a clear distinction between composed number and following recitative (a decisive break with grand op\u00e9ra), a limited number of characters and a comic register; it developed a set of conventions that remained consistent from its origins ca. 1830 to its latest presentations in Alary's La Voix humaine (1861) and Mass\u00e9's La Mule de Pedro (1863).\n      </p>", "Beginning with the observation that all drama involves dramatic opposition, the presentation of negative forces, the evil or Satanic, is traced through opera libretti. Changing representations of the Satanic reflect the changing social consciousness of evil, as dark forces or in the person of Satan himself. Originally, opera displayed the whole nether world of darkness and shades. Evolution of societal views has led, today, to the presentation of the Satanic in temptation by the evil in other humans.\n      </p>", "Most productions of Handel's operas today observe principles of 18th-century performance practice in the musical aspects of the performance. It is very rare, however, to see a production whose visual aspects also are historically informed: far more commonly the opera is updated, and the producer's chief concern is to present his concept of its meaning. For Handel, a true man of the theatre, an opera was what the audience saw as well as what it heard. Respecting the composer's intentions and expectations in the musical performance but ignoring them in the visual production runs the risk of creating a sense of artistic schizophrenia. Although guidance in the scores themselves is sparse, there is much evidence of a general kind about 18th-century sets, costumes and acting styles that can be used by producers who are willing to experiment. Acting in a period style can be as liberating as singing and playing in such a style; modern audiences are just as ready to accept the former as the latter. An 18th-century acting style, with its emphasis on restraint, elegance and beauty, is perfectly in tune with the style of Handel's music; within such a style the smallest deviation can achieve a powerful effect. A modern audience need not be condescended to: it can quickly become accustomed to an earlier style of acting. Still less does Handel need assistance: his music has the power to speak eloquently across the centuries.\n      </p>", "Die Opernh\u00e4user des 19. Jahrhunderts waren nicht nur musikalische, sondern soziale R\u00e4ume in denen sich allabendlich die unterschiedlichen gesellschaftlichen Gruppen beobachteten und miteinander kommunizierten. Der Aufsatz untersucht die soziale Bedeutung, kulturellen Praktiken und politischen Wirkungen des Publikumsverhalten in den f\u00fchrenden Londoner und Berliner Opernh\u00e4usern. Das Ziel ist es die sozialen und habituellen Funktionen musikalischer Auff\u00fchrungen durch eine Analyse des Publikumsverhaltens zu rekonstruieren - statt prim\u00e4r die Musik selber zu untersuchen. Gleichzeitig lenkt die Untersuchung des Publikumsverhaltens, die Art und Weise wie Musik geh\u00f6rt und angeeignet wurde, den Blick auf die Entstehung und Wandel spezifischer Geschmacksnormen und sozialer Beziehungen in einer Gesellschaft. Von besonderer Bedeutung war dabei die Entstehung eines neuen schweigenden H\u00f6rverhaltens. Mit Hilfe der Kategorien von Norbert Elias wird veranschaulicht, wie ein mehr oder weniger unaufmerksames Publikums sich zunehmend selber disziplinierte und sich allm\u00e4hlich in der zweiten H\u00e4lfte des 19. Jahrhunderts in Zuh\u00f6rer verwandelte. Der Transfer kultureller Normen und Praktiken zwischen Berlin und London illustriert zudem die Entwicklung einer gemeinsamen europ\u00e4schen Musikkultur. /// The long 19th century was not only the era of the industrial and political revolutions - it was the heyday of musical performances and musical representations as well. Operagoing was an integral part of the leisure time of the European aristocracy and the bourgeoisie in the 19th century. Opera-houses, therefore, mattered because they were not only musical but social spheres as well. Thus, in the framework of social conventions, the public appropriation and evaluation of music had a twofold function in the metropolitan societies during the 19th century: on the one hand, it confirmed social identity by a habitualized social practice; on the other hand, a taste for art practically displayed served as a means of distinction, in order to maintain and sustain borderlines and distances within society and in order to label oneself as an individual or a social group. The article concentrates on the social influence, cultural practice and political significance of opera-going in Berlin and London, and it intends to reveal the primarily social and habitual functions of musical entertainments by analysing the behaviour of audiences, rather than by looking at the music itself. Of particular importance was the development of a new behaviour of listening during the performances. The article demonstrates with the help of Norbert Elias categories, how a more or less inattentive audience increasingly disciplined itself and gradually turned into \u00bblisteners\u00ab in the second half of the 19th century as a part of a \u00bbprocess of civilisation\u00ab. Moreover, the transfer of cultural norms between the two cities - like, first and foremost, the habit of silent listening and the elevation of \u00bbabsolute music\u00ab - epitomizes the emergence of a common European culture of music. The point is to compare the development of common cultural pratices and forms of public respresentation in Europe. The communication about music, therefore, can be understood as an integral part of an emerging European elite culture, which referred to common cultural institutions, ideals, and pratices. Dugo 19. stolje\u0107e nije bilo samo razdoblje industrijskih i politi\u010dkih revolucija. Ono je bilo i doba procvata glazbenog izvo\u0111enja i glazbenih predstavljanja. Odlazak u operu u 19. stolje\u0107u bio je sastojni dio dokolice europske aristokracije i gra\u0111anstva. Operne ku\u0111e bile su stoga va\u017ene jer su 'pokrivale' ne samo glazbenu nego i dru\u0161tvenu sferu.

This article posits that the Live in HD series creates an intermedial experience for its viewers, one that forms new relationships between operatic performance and audiences through the ongoing intersections of production elements (story, text, music, mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, performers) and media-specific concerns (spectatorial gaze, hypermediacy, immediacy, reproducibility, liveness). A reading of act I from the 2009 Metropolitan Opera simulcast of Offenbach's Les Contes d'Hoffmann engages the shifting relations regarding the human and the technological as presented to the Live in HD viewer from the vantage point of on, back, beside, in front of, and yet completely discrete from the Lincoln Center stage.\n         The mediated and mediatized relationships engendered by this constant resituating of the audience create a sense of the familiar rendered strange, of being somehow out of place in one's relation to the stage. Media and performance theory are employed in concert with Freud's influential work on the uncanny to describe this as the \u201cintermedial uncanny\u201d: an important aspect of this emergent audience experience.\n      </p>", "This article is based on the key-note lecture given at the conference \u201cNon-Nationalist\u201d Russian Operas, Leeds, U.K., on 17 November 2010. It engages with the conference's distinction between the \u201cnationalist\u201d and \u201cnon-nationalist\u201d and proposes six potential situations for when an opera might be described as \u201cRussian\u201d: by composer's intention, by reception, by interpretation, by association, by blood or culture, and by emanating from the nationalist school. Given that these six categories of Russianness (some of them mystificatory) form a network of conflicting claims upon any opera, there is no straightforward method for assigning operas to Russian or non-Russian categories. Therefore an alternative approach is proposed: to revive the older concept of \u201clocal color,\u201d which figured prominently in nineteenth-century Russian discourse on opera, and to use this as a lens through which almost any nineteenth-century Russian opera can instructively be viewed.\n         After examining how the concept was understood by leading Russian critics, Serov and Cui, the author offers a selection of her own examples to elucidate the use of \u201cRussian\u201d local color. It is emphasized that there are certain limits beyond which this color cannot be applied: characters of noble birth, even when Russian, are rarely portrayed in Russian colors; scenes that take place outside Russia usually have their own, appropriate color, e.g., \u201cPolish\u201d or \u201cOriental\u201d; most importantly, themes that are considered universal, such as love or death, are usually exempt from Russian coloring. Examples from the late operas of Rimsky-Korsakov demonstrate his conscious and sometimes obsessive efforts in creating appropriate colors, Russian and otherwise. This approach allows us to set aside preconceived notions of which composers were truly national, especially when we generalize that local color denotes any distinguishing device designed to evoke a specific time and place, as well as the social identity of a character. Thus Tchaikovsky's operas, often criticized for their lack of \u201cRussianness,\u201d display a subtle understanding of appropriate coloring: Eugene Onegin, for example, uses an idiom based on the parlor song of the Russian gentry, while The Queen of Spades takes up eighteenth-century idioms\u2014in both cases lending the drama an appropriate color.\n         The article concludes that local color, a much-used device in nineteenth-century opera across Europe, was an almost obligatory requirement for Russian opera composers who adopted an aesthetic of the characteristic, along the lines proposed by Victor Hugo in his Preface to Cromwell. The concept proves to be a valuable critical tool that allows us to deal with nineteenth-century Russian opera without becoming ensnared in essentializing distinctions between \u201cnationalist\u201d and \u201cnon-nationalist.\u201d At the same time, it allows us to put Russian color in perspective, as one color among many cultivated by opera composers.\n      </p>", "In a hitherto unpublished letter to his father of 1 October 1878, Hugo Wolf scathingly reviews a performance of Wagner's Tannh\u00e4user directed by Hans Richter, concluding on the grim joke that the Vienna Court Opera, for the sake of music, should be demolished by the Austrian army. The letter also contains a metaphysically disillusioned view of consolation (\"Trost\") - Wolf compares it to intoxication (\"Rausch\") - rather significant given that idea's r\u00f4le both in his early and his mature work.\n      </p>", "Wilhelm Richard Wagner fused fantasy based on epic and lore with seamless scores, using landscapes and urban images to forge spatial order on stage. As a footloose composer-conductor, Wagner was considered a globetrotter for his time, and from trans-European tours he drew inspiration for numerous stagings. Nine of his operas have rustic pastoral settings, with actors silhouetted against geological formations, forests, vistas of undulating terrain for pilgrimages, or raging seas, all visually believable scenery. Rienzi and Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg are urban in setting, whereas Die Feen and Das Liebesverbot are set in a castle-like format.\n      </p>", "Scholars have long been aware that Henry Purcell's 1690s opera scores contain a few instrumental numbers originally composed for performance in an ode context. The implications for editors are well understood. Doubtful passages in the ode versions can be corrected with reference to operatic alternatives, and vice versa. Stylistic comparison with accurately dateable odes sometimes helps to locate other, less well-documented pieces within the overall Purcell chronology. For Purcell himself the odes had a different, more creative purpose, experimental rather than musicological. They served as test-beds allowing him and his performer collaborators to try out new ideas before transferring what they took to be the best of them to the operatic stage. This article re-evaluates Purcell's odes as sketchbooks for opera, throwing new light on his compositional methods and on the logistical and economic interconnections between the court and theatrical music worlds. The extent of overlap between ode and opera repertories strongly suggests that the same 'court' orchestra featured in both.\n      </p>", "In 1899, six years after Gounod's death, his Proven\u00e7al opera Mireille (1864) suddenly became a focal point for regionalist celebration and debate in the South of France. It also, in a paradoxical sense, came \u201chome\u201d to Arles\u2014a town that the original poem's author, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral, made clear his heroine had never visited. In this article the resulting invented tradition, which began thirty-five years after the opera's Paris premiere and rested on standard notions of authenticity and belonging, is contextualized by reference to the very different life it led in the Midi as a standard \u201cmunicipal\u201d opera sent out, after significant revision, from Paris. Joep Leerssen's theory of cultural nationalism provides a frame for analyzing how and why this opera, which set a regionalist manifesto to music but was not a manifesto itself, could be only incompletely appropriated by Mistral and his f\u00e9libres as an emblematic \u201cnational\u201d work.\n      </p>", "This study explores the relationships between culture, politics, and the decision-making process of the American opera company. It combines socio-economic data with the financial and program data of key opera companies to explore important influences in programming decisions. It tests the hypothesized relationships between risk-taking by opera companies and socio-economic variables such as wealth, government funding, and donor involvement. This study finds that local government funding encourages program conventionality, while federal support such as the NEA encourages program risk-taking. Socio-economic variables such as conservatism, wealth, and education level were also found to affect opera programming.\n      </p>", "In the construction of national opera in Czech and Croatian lands during the nineteenth century, composers Bed\u0159ich Smetana (Czech) and Ivan Zajc (Croatia) both looked to folk settings and national history in their works. The source of each composer's most famous work, however, differs. Smetana's The Bartered Bride, is rooted in a folk atmosphere, while Zajc's Nikola \u0160ubi\u0107 Zrinjski recounts a defining moment in Croatian history. In Zrinjski, Zajc includes a folk atmosphere akin to that of The Bartered Bride in Jelena's dream sequence in the opera's third act. /// Postoje brojne paralele u podru\u010djima politike i glazbe izme\u0111u hrvatskih i \u010de\u0161kih zemalja tijekom 19. stolje\u0107a. Obje su nacije bile dijelovi Habsbur\u0161kog carstva i obje su nastojale ustanoviti specifi\u010dne nacionalne identitete. U konstrukciji nacionalne opere u \u010de\u0161kim i hrvatskim zemljama tijekom 19. stolje\u0107a skladatelji Bed\u0159ich Smetana (\u010ce\u0161ka) i Ivan Zajc (Hrvatska) zagledali su za svoja djela u folklorne okvire i nacionalne povijesti. Djela temeljena na folkloru potvr\u0111ivala su posebni identitet ljudi prikazivanih na pozornici, dok su historicisti\u010dka djela bila alegorijska, heroi\u010dka ili su sadr\u0161avala elemente jednog i drugog.

While literary scholarship has come to measure verismo against the narrowly defined models provided by the theories, novels, and short stories of Luigi Capuana and Giovanni Verga, operatic scholarship has either superimposed these same theories on the dramatic genre of the libretto or it has constructed concepts of questionable historical foundation. Drawing mainly on a large corpus of neglected nineteenth- and early twentieth-century discussions of verismo, this article uncovers the original meanings of the termand outlines how we have come to adopt a view of verismo that is problematic in regard to both literature and opera. Contrary to this view, verismo was seen in the nineteenth century primarily as a reaction to the idealism and conventionality of earlier artworks; in this sense it had already been applied to opera before 1890, and it is, in fact, a perfectly appropriate designation for opera in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In comparison to Romantic Italian opera, with its conventional forms of both libretto and music, verismo opera reacts to idealism in any combination of categories ranging from plot to vocabulary, verse, harmony and melody, performance practice, and production.\n      </p>", "Adler and Sullivan's Seattle Opera House project is known from a perspective drawing and three plans that were first published in Inland Architect in 1891.

The former consists in a dramaturgical analysis of Verdi's Macbeth. The discussion is not entirely conventional insofar as its impetus was pragmatic: this section lays out some of the dramaturgical thinking that went into preparations for a new production of Verdi's work slated for San Francisco Opera in the Autumn of 2004. Alas, in the Autumn of 2003 the production was abruptly cancelled. This (non-)event led to the essay's sociological aspiration: a consideration of how and why that cancellation came about. In addition to reviewing Pamela Rosenberg's unusually ambitious, experimental and controversial regime at San Francisco Opera, the essay also speculates on the relationship between a nascent critical dramaturgy and the prospects for innovation on the operatic stage in the United States at this historical moment.\n      </p>", "Early 17th-century English lute song represents a perfect fusion of words and music, simultaneously conceived by poets and composers with a deep instinctive understanding of each other's business. This is a critical commonplace with heavy implications for performers. To avoid distracting attention away from the words, musical settings were kept as simple as possible. To facilitate simple strophic setting the poets made sure that each stanza of a multi-stanza poem followed the same metrical scheme, and they naturally assumed that composers would follow it too. The Golden Age achievement relied on collective self-restraint (not too much self-expression or 'interpretation' therefore); and when Henry Lawes and other cavalier composers of masque songs and masque-inspired opera abandoned that restraint the Golden Age was over. Henry Purcell had to start again from scratch. Little of this turns out to be true. 'A mangled chime' looks again at the relationship between words and music in 17th-century England, suggesting a more complicated system of interplay between the two. Compositional technique was a mystery to most lyricists even at the height of the Golden Age, and as the century unfolded they found words matching the formal ambitions of contemporary theatre composers harder and harder to write. By 1680\u201490 (the decade of Venus and Adonis and Dido and Aeneas) the result was a peculiarly English approach to word-setting in which musical sound, though it echoed poetical sense, frequently obliterated poetic structure; a theory of English opera thoroughly confused in its aesthetic aims; and (in consequence) an uncoordinated response to opera seria when the Italian invasion began soon afterwards. Because Golden Age reserve inhibited frank negotiation between composers and poets it masked the composers' textual needs in dramatic rather than lyrical situations and it led\u2014via hugely resourceful but non-confrontational Lawes\u2014to the overthrow of native English opera a century later.\n      </p>", "The Sydney Opera House is famous the world over for its magnificent architecture and unique Location in the port of Sydney, Australia.

Yet, what did happen? This article returns to a number of images, some of them well known in musical contexts, some better known to theatre scholars, to examine how the band was placed in performances. Such an enquiry cannot simply concentrate on opera; music played a much greater role in the theatre in the late 17th century, with plays requiring not only a large number of inset songs, but incantation scenes, dances and interact music. Music could be heard 'in the air' or 'under the stage' or 'behind the scenes' or 'in the clouds'. The last illustration in the article shows the theatre band in London's Queen's Theatre, the building in which Handel was to perform, but it argues against the notion that in this, Handel found an established 'up-to-date orchestra', suggesting that for English opera, such a move was regressive and limiting.\n      </p>", "When Musorgsky revised his opera Boris Godunov in 1871\u201372 as a condition for its eventual performance in 1874, he made many changes that went far beyond what the Imperial Theaters demanded of him. Among these changes was the composition of a crowd scene outside Moscow, in which the rebellious populace hails the Pretender, to replace a crowd scene at Red Square in which a submissive, hungry crowd begs Boris for bread. The original scene came, like the rest of the libretto, directly from Pushkin's eponymous play. The new scene reflected a new view of the historical events, and Musorgsky wrote his own text for it. The two scenes are ideologically at odds, particularly as regards their view of the Russian nation in relation to the Russian people. Moreover, the two scenes share the episode of the Holy Fool and the thieving boys, which Musorgsky transferred from the one score to the other. Obviously, Musorgsky regarded them as incompatible within a single production and thought he had made conflating them impossible. And yet, at the Bolshoy Theater, beginning in 1927, the two scenes have indeed been played that way, inconsistencies and redundancies be damned. The Bolshoy production of 1939 (which became widely known and influential through recordings and film) might be written off, the way we tend to write off the art of the Stalinist era, as a politically motivated anomaly. But many other productions and most recordings since 1948 have included both scenes without any such evident motivation, indicating that the Bolshoy production is now regarded as canonical. Is the historiographical contradiction involving the theme of the conference at which this article was first presented (\u201cOpera and Nation,\u201d Budapest 2010) to be regarded as a blemish? If not, what considerations can be seen to outweigh it? Can Musorgsky's political ideas be deduced from the work in which we assume they are embodied? And if they can be, should they be regarded as an aspect of the work that performers need respect?\n      </p>", "Studies of the popular theatre of Japan show that an understanding of it can provide insights into some of the prevailing life themes and of the conflicts of the people with the mechanisms they use to cope with them. A better knowledge of the inhabitants of the People's Republic of China is very much needed by the outside world. The authors, therefore, have analyzed examples of the classical Peking Opera, which were presented in China until about 1965, when, as a result of the Cultural Revolution, the emphasis and some of the techniques of the traditional drama were altered and some new subject matter was added. They point out, however, that in the modern revolutionary Peking Opera the essential form was changed remarkably little. The conclusions reached are the following ones. The Chinese seek to temporize conflicts and to search for nonviolent solutions. They seem to make an all-out effort to obtain reconciliation that does not cause either party to lose face. Life and death decisions are made slowly and only after time and trouble has been taken to look at many sides of an issue and then the decisions are person-centered rather than situation-centered. The possible implications of these conclusions on the relations of nations with the People's Republic of China are pointed out.\n      </p>", "This is a study of opera as a performing arts organization. The concept of market is used to explain the selection of repertoire. The box office-an expression of client-centeredness-acts to constrain repertory selections, and affects the content and style of opera production in the United States.\n      </p>", "The preponderance of gothic themes in Italian operas of the early nineteenth century is often cited as one of the few ways essentially conservative Italian composers flirted with the Romantic revolution sweeping the rest of Europe. By 1838, the very ubiquity of these tropes led the Venetian reviewer of Donizetti's gory Maria de Rudenz to plead \u201cexhaustion\u201d with the ever-present \u201cdaggers, poisons, and tombs\u201d of the contemporary stage. Based on the French melodrama La Nonne sanglante, Donizetti's sensational opera is almost a litany of gothic tropes. The most disturbing of these is the female body that refuses to die: Maria herself, who rises from the dead to murder her innocent rival. This fleshy specter is musically rendered as a body that is too receptive to emotion, particularly to (imaginary) cries of longing or grief. Significantly, Donizetti's foray into the gothic was also distinguished by a spate of self-borrowing; his 1838 revision of the earlier Gabriella di Vergy borrows material from Maria de Rudenz. Exploring the connections between the trope of gothic resurrection and Donizetti's borrowings highlights how the two works represent a characteristic approach to the gothic, one that mingles a corporeal orientation with more familiar themes of ghostly immateriality.\n      </p>", "Tan Dun's 2006 opera The First Emperor dramatically transgresses stylistic, cultural, genre, and aesthetic boundaries and prompts investigation of critical methods and categories. This opera's multiplicity and engagement with the operatic past brings into focus relationships between Chinese, European, and experimental American operatic traditions and Romantic, modernist, and postmodernist modes of Orientalist representation. Powers's study of Puccini's manipulation of multiple styles in Turandot is a model for tracing Tan's stylistic sources and exploring their interaction in The First Emperor. Tan's use of conventions from the Orientalist operatic tradition and treatment of thematic material indicates an attempt to accommodate audience expectations. Other recent operas influenced by Chinese operatic traditions and the recent reception of Chinese opera in the West likely shaped Tan's composition and offer useful contextual and comparative perspectives. The critical reception and revision of this high-profile opera raise issues central to the creation of contemporary opera.\n      </p>", "This article sheds new light onto the process of transformation of the figure of the opera patron in Rome during the mid-seventeenth century. Following the travels of Giovanni Filippo Apolloni's libretto Amor per vendetta, ovvero L'Alcasta, I trace the dissolution of the ubiquitous individual court patron of the earlier part of the century into a network of agents behind opera production in commercial contexts. In every phase of the story of L'Alcasta\u2014its commission, plans for production, staging, dedication, and subsequent revivals\u2014we can detect diverse agencies shaping the libretto and score, which accommodated different needs and tastes and conveyed multiple social and political meanings.\n         Showing how the Roman aristocracy experimented with new systems of production that would radically change the history of opera, L'Alcasta also raises broader questions concerning the presence and functions of \u201cpatronage\u201d in commercial opera theaters. The trajectory that emerges in the history of opera patronage in the papal city during the second half of the century begins with collective forms of sponsorship during the 1660s and develops further, giving rise to Rome's first commercial opera theater during the 1670s, the Teatro Tordinona. In this context, at a time in which opera in Rome did not find full institutional support, Queen Christina of Sweden represented, at least nominally, the missing patron, a highly representative figure who stood in as guarantor of the new theater on behalf of the aristocratic class that produced and conspicuously consumed opera.\n      </p>", "Employing the example of Alexander the Great in opera seria, this essay reconsiders the performance of heroic roles in the 18th century. One of its aims is to extend our current understanding of Baroque gesture by taking seriously what contemporary acting tutors and treatises say: a complete performance is possible only after careful study of gesture in painting and statuary. An examination of Alexander iconography suggests both specific tactics for the singer, director and designer; and, more importantly, a broader agenda: the representation of Alexander's essential grandeur. A second goal is to determine to what extent our performances today of Alexander and other operatic heroes can be shaped by comprehension of their significance and meanings for those who created and consumed heroic art in the 18th century. These heroes were (and are) not interchangeable, not simply emblems, but rather, individuals whose stories conjured up a host of resonances specific to each. We might portray them accordingly. Finally, the article explores some of the aesthetic and philosophical questions raised by this kind of historical approach.\n      </p>", "This study compared the effects of attendance versus non-attendance at an in-school opera performance on the attitudes of upper elementary grade students. Fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-grade students who had and had not viewed the performance (N = 738) completed a five-item questionnaire designed to elicit attitudes towards opera attendance, opera singing, and opera performers. Significant group (Opera/No Opera) by grade interactions were found for four of the items (fun, interesting, beautiful, see an/another opera). Fourth-grade students 1 responses were the most positive on these rating scales, with little difference between the two groups. The pattern of responses for fifth-and sixth-grade subjects, however, differed across groups and grade levels. Fifth-grade students in the Opera group were more positive than sixth-grade students in the Opera group, while sixth-grade students in the No Opera group were more positive than the No Opera fifth-grade students. Fifth-and sixth-grade students in the Opera group rated these four items more positively than did their counterparts in the No Opera group. In response to the fifth item, all subjects, regardless of group or grade membership, gave similar responses indicating that they thought opera singers were \"talented.\" It was concluded that attending the opera appeared to have a positive effect on the attitudes of fifth-and sixth-grade subjects. The higher ratings given consistently by the fourth-grade students may indicate that this would be a receptive age to target for including the study of opera in the elementary music curriculum.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Cole Swensen's homage to opera, Oh, opens with the word scale; this essay examines how scale figures in the thinking about art performed by the volume. The minimalism of Oh refigures the extravagant grandeur of opera, as part of Swensen's rethinking of scale. Swensen uses the lens of fractal geometry to conduct a \"respacializatiori\" of the page through which she reconceives the capabilities of lyric and the potential for a rearticulation of the feminine offered by the space of the poem's page. Building upon the examples of Anne-Marie Albiach and Susan Howe, Swensen approaches page space as a potential realm of especially female transgressive and transformative motion, andas the dimension of innovative possibility. The essay proposes and enacts a model of \"fractal reading\" that enhances understanding of the motion and the transformations of scale in Oh-a model that will illuminate other contemporary avant garde texts as well.\n      </p>", "In order to locate text paraphrase in Vivaldi's opera librettos, as a clue to the composer's reuse of his own arias in operas for which the music is lost, and in order to reconstruct a pattern of interdependency among a group of related medieval music treatises, the authors created their own relational databases using the Savvy-PC programming language. The crucial, unique feature of this language is a COMPARE command that transcends the limitations of Key Word in Context searches. This system puts the scholar in control of programming functions on all DOS microcomputers, and outputs universally transferrable ASCII data files.\n      </p>", "In 1778, Bologna's Teatro Comunale mounted a production of Christoph Willibald Gluck's Alceste, the composer's pathbreaking masterpiece of Viennese operatic reform from 1767. A hitherto unexplored exemplar of the libretto printed for the Bolognese production bears extensive manuscript annotations in the hand of Antonio Montefani, the stage director, that provide detailed evidence for the production's staging and technical components. When examined with related sources, including Montefani's notes from a rehearsal or early performance; his correspondence with Ranieri de' Calzabigi, the librettist; and exchanges involving Gluck, Padre Giambattista Martini, Giambattista Mancini, and the Bolognese impresario during the production's planning stages, a vivid image of the Bolognese production emerges. Montefani managed to preserve most of Alceste's innovative features\u2014choruses and dances integrated within the scenes as well as complex staging of diverse groups of individuals\u2014even when forced to compromise with Giuseppe Canziani, the production's choreographer. These difficult collaborations, involving interactions within networks of creative personnel both local and long-distance, demonstrate the practical and logistical problems reform opera posed for Italian theaters accustomed to conventional opera seria and the creative solutions offered by one of eighteenth-century Italy's leading cultural centers.\n      </p>", "This article is a critical response to Richard G. King's \"'How to be an emperor\": acting Alexander the Great in opera seria' (\"Early Music\", XXXVi/2 (2008), pp.181\u2014201). While accepting King's stance that characterization played a serious role in Baroque acting, this response stresses the more fundamental importance of performing the most basic gestures with precision and variety. The author contends that it is vital, when reconstructing the temporal arts of the period, that one understands and accepts the validity of 18th-century models of the passions and their enablers, the animal spirits. A passage of recitative from Handel's opera Alessandro is subjected to close affective analysis, and the appropriate muscle extension and tension for gestures designed to accompany specific lines of text is discussed. It is the author's firm belief that such a passionate and 'spirited' approach will not only thoroughly engage the attention of today's listeners, but will ultimately move their hearts through an affective contagion, just as it did the audience in Handel's day.\n      </p>", "During Purcell's lifetime the music-publishing business in England flourished, thanks mainly to John Playford. Since intellectual property rights did not yet exist, Playford and his successors were able to select music they were confident of selling, predominantly producing multicomposer anthologies of popular tunes. Composers may have benefited little from these publications so it is significant that some took the financial risk of printing their music without an established publisher's support. Analysis suggests that musical self-publication was undertaken for several quite specific purposes. Three self-published books stand out as the only operatic scores published in seventeenth-century England: Locke's The English Opera (1675), Grabu's Albion and Albanius (1687), and Purcell's The Vocal and Instrumental Musick of the Prophetess (1691). These substantial volumes had no obvious practical use and all sold poorly; put into political context, however, they reveal how printed music in England was developing from a purely practical performance tool into a medium through which statements could be made and musical works given monumental status. Yet Purcell's own management of the printing of The Vocal and Instrumental Musick of the Prophetess suggests that he was confused about the distinct and mutually exclusive functions of music printing in the period, which led him to misunderstand the nature of the market and how he might appropriate the medium for his own benefit.\n      </p>", "The intention in this lecture is to explore the means by which Bart\u00f3k's \"Duke Bluebeard's Castle\" (1911) transforms the harmonic structures of the traditional major/minor scale system into a new musical language, and how this language reflects the psycho-dramatic symbolism of B\u00e9la Bal\u00e1zs, Hungarian disciple of the Belgian dramatist, Maurice Maeterlinck. In reaction to the realism of nineteenth-century theater, many authors began to develop a new interest in psychological motivation and a level of consciousness manifested in metaphor, ambiguity, and symbol. The Bart\u00f3k-Bal\u00e1zs opera represents one of the first significant attempts to establish more profound correspondences between the symbolist dramatic conception and the new musical language. This language is based almost exclusively on interactions between pentatonic/diatonic folk modalities and their more abstract symmetrical transformation, the opposition of these two harmonic extremes serving as the basis for dramatic polarity between the characters as real-life beings and as instruments of fate. Also explored are the new musico-dramatic relations within larger historical, social, and aesthetic contexts. Distinguishing features are seen in the formulation of the new theoretical principles and how they serve to conjoin historical and cultural as well as philosophical and psychological issues within the operatic milieu.\n      </p>", "This article discusses the portraits of three virtuosos, leading figures on the 17th-century Italian opera stage, which have been discovered in collections in Madrid. They include the composer Alessandro Scarlatti, the famous castrato Matteo Sassano (known as Matteuccio) and archlute-player Petruccio (who can possibly be identified with Pietro Ugolino). The series of paintings, documented in the collections of the Tenth Count of Santisteban, don Francisco de Benavides, Viceroy of Naples between 1688 and 1696, is completed by the likeness of the engineer and theatre designer Philip Schor, whose portrait remains in an unknown location. The presence of these paintings in Spain in 1697, when the Count of Santisteban returned to Madrid, coincided with the process of Italianizaron in the artistic and musical spheres of the court in Madrid in the last years of the reign of Charles II, and they must have encouraged interest in the Sicilian composer in court circles before the accession of the Bourbons. Likewise, the discovery of these portraits contributes to our knowledge of the iconography of these renowned Italian musicians.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Adler and Sullivan's Auditorium Building in Chicago (1886-1890) is here analyzed in the context of Chicago's social history of the 1880s. Specifically, the building is seen as a capitalistic response to socialist and anarchist movements of the period. The Auditorium's principal patron, Ferdinand W. Peck, created a theater that was to give access to cultural and civic events for the city's workers, to draw them away from both politicized and nonpoliticized \"low\" urban entertainments. Adler and Sullivan's theater was to serve a mass audience, unlike opera houses of the period, which held multiple tiers of boxes for privileged patrons. This tradition was represented by the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City (1881-1883). Turning away from works like the Paris Op\u00e9ra, Peck and his architects perhaps sought to emulate ideas of other European theaters of the period, such as Bayreuth's Festspielhaus (1872-1876). Sullivan's interior had an ornamental and iconographic program that was innovative relative to traditional opera houses. His design of the building's exterior was in a Romanesque style that recalled ancient Roman monuments. It is here compared with other Chicago buildings of its era that represented high capital's reaction to workers' culture, such as Burnham and Root's First Regiment Armory (1889-1891), Peck's own house (1887), and the Chicago Athenaeum (1890-1891). The Auditorium's story invites a view of the Chicago School that emphasizes the role of patrons' ideological agenda rather than modern structural expression.\n      </p>"], "words": {"essay":
