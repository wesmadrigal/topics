Based on a recent finding of a sexual dimorphism in facial metrics that is independent of body size, we conducted three studies to examine the extent to which individual differences in the facial width-to-height ratio were associated with trait dominance (using a questionnaire) and aggression during a behavioural task and in a naturalistic setting (varsity and professional ice hockey). In study 1, men had a larger facial width-to-height ratio, higher scores of trait dominance, and were more reactively aggressive compared with women. Individual differences in the facial width-to-height ratio predicted reactive aggression in men, but not in women (predicted 15% of variance). In studies 2 (male varsity hockey players) and 3 (male professional hockey players), individual differences in the facial width-to-height ratio were positively related to aggressive behaviour as measured by the number of penalty minutes per game obtained over a season (predicted 29 and 9% of the variance, respectively).

Using a constructed panel data set, which tracks player behavior on a game-by-game basis over the course of a season, we examine how various aspects of the wider culture of illegality affect individual illegality.

Statements by a wide spectrum of hockey officials, the characteristics of the game and competitive results clearly stress the importance of defensive skills and player size as performance/selection measures/criteria. The main conclusion of the analysis is that the underrepresentation of Francophones, particularly defenders and forwards, is a systemic phenomenon attributable to the application of defensive skill and player size selection criteria, the unintended consequence of which is a disproportionate limitation on employment in the NHL of players from the mainly Francophone Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. An important corollary of this conclusion is that the NHL cannot be used as representative of overt discrimination against Francophones in the wider labour market.\n      </p>", "Social integration theory would view the Stanley Cup of Hockey series as a ceremonial occasion capable of promoting a temporary drop in the incidence of suicide. This proposition is combined with a key postulate of routine activities theory-that people who share similar backgrounds, lifestyles, and interests are inclined to get together in social activities, including in this case watching playoff hockey. It is proposed that the social context surrounding the Stanley Cup constitutes in Quebec a period of increased informal interpersonal contact among the people, and that this should ultimately serve to discourage and/or prevent some potential suicides from occurring. In situations where this type of social context breaks down during the course of the hockey series, suicide is expected to increase temporarily. The analysis reveals that the period comprising the Stanley Cup is by itself not a significant predictor of suicide, though its interactions with sex, age, and marital status are important. During the playoffs (as opposed to other times of the year) young men are in fact more likely to commit suicide, but if they are married, the chances of this happening are reduced significantly. Further analysis indicates that the increased tendency for young men to commit suicide during the hockey series is associated with the situation of when Montreal are ousted early from the competition. The causal mechanisms for this effect are explicated in terms of a premature breakdown of the informal social context associated with the playoffs experience.

The results support the violent subculture hypothesis. Individuals who professed values and attitudes supportive of violence were significantly more violent than those who did not. The data do not support the societal version of the hypothesis, described by Wolfgang and Ferracuti and other theorists in the criminological tradition; values and attitudes were poor predictors of off-ice fighting and bore no relationship to social class. What the findings do point to is an occupational subculture, composed mainly of older players in highly competitive select and junior leagues, where professional criteria regarding the use of violence prevail.

With these fixed-effects accounted for, the paper tests the degree to which the representation of French Canadians on a team is related to that team's location--either in English Canada or the United States--versus the degree to which the representation is related to the ethnic origin of that team's coach and general manager. It finds the ethnic origin variables to be unable to explain the representational patterns, leaving the team location variable as the only significant explanatory variable. These statistical findings thus support a \"customer discrimination\" explanation of the underrepresentation, as opposed to an \"employer discrimination\" explanation.

Eggs are cryptic and there are consistent differences in the patterns of pigmentation between first and second laid eggs within a clutch but between females of the same population overall clutch pattern is similar and only the intensity of pigmentation varies. Within-clutch differences in egg markings did not result in differential predation rates of first and second eggs, but increases nest complexity and hence the crypticity of the clutch. 3.

We specify three institutional process mechanisms that support organizational change-dominant logic-consistent activity, external charters, and peer emulation-and we test these claims with longitudinal data on the emerging strategies in early U.S. intercollegiate athletics. We argue that the supporting institutional mechanisms affect the incorporation patterns of intercollegiate programs in basketball, ice hockey, and lacrosse over the period from the late nineteenth century to the present. The research strategy of examining the spread of three different sports programs, each a proxy for different strategies of resources and visibility, provides evidence on the comparative pattern of effects of the three institutional mechanisms. Results indicate that all three institutional support mechanisms affect the incorporation of the intercollegiate programs. Differences in the pattern of incorporation across the three strategies provide robust evidence for alternatives to a prevailing \"iron cage\" view of institutional pressures and constraints.

One method of doing this involves estimating the size of prey items in relation to the bird's bill length, and then using an average bill length to convert this value to actual prey length in order to estimate prey mass/energy content. Although this technique is used regularly, no study has assessed under what conditions the method is reliable. Observer distance from the bird, prey type, size and orientation in the bill, bill length and shape, and light conditions may all affect the accuracy of the estimates. This study sought to establish the conditions under which the method is or is not reliable, using three different prey types (\"thin\" and \"fat\" polychaetes, and crabs) and a long- and short-billed bird. It was found that if observers were calibrated, and their results were corrected using regression analysis, errors in estimates of food intake were much reduced. The time allowed to view the prey significantly affected the error in the result, with shorter viewing time causing greater errors, and observations made into the light were less accurate than those made with the light behind the observer. Large prey types, or even larger size classes of the same species, are estimated less accurately than small prey, and accuracy decreases as prey size increases as multiples of bill length. If separate calibration regressions are generated for large and small prey, food intake estimates are more accurate than if a single regression is used incorporating the full range of prey sizes. Sexual dimorphism in bill length can also increase error in the results. /// Varios estudios han tratado de calcular las tasas de obtenci\u00f3n de energ\u00eda de los Charadriiformes.

Rates of algal production and limpet mortality were recorded at each site and both factors affected limpet reproductive fitness. Limpet growth rates and biomass at different sites were significantly correlated with rates of algal production, and limpet mortality was related to the density of African Black Oystercatchers, important predators of P. granularis. Life-time gametic output of a hypothetical cohort of limpets at each site was modelled using the measurements of growth, reproduction and mortality made at each site. Limpet cohorts at sites with rapid rates of algal production were predicted to have a larger life-time production of gametic material than cohorts at sites with slow algal production rates, except in instances of acute predatory pressure. In the light of the overriding influence of food supply on the expression of limpet life-history parameters, it is imperative that researchers consider food availability before assuming that local, population-specific differences in life-history patterns are due to genetic differences.\n      </p>", "Intraspecific kleptoparasitism among Kelp Gulls (Larus dominicanus) was studied at four sites in the southwestern Cape Province of South Africa. Sites included: (1) undisturbed foraging habitats; (2) a sandy beach and a rocky shore; and (3) areas where supplementary food was available-a fishing harbor and a refuse dump. Simple food-choice experiments were used to test hypotheses generated from field observations. Among-site variation in the rate and success of kleptoparasitism was related to prey attributes, of which prey size and handling time were the most important. In food-choice experiments, gulls selected small prey with short handling times. Prey with long handling times were the most likely to be stolen and the rate of keptoparasitism was higher when prey were dispersed than when they were clumped. There were marked age-related differences in the rate, although not the success, of kleptoparasitism among Kelp Gulls. Juvenile (first-year) gulls attempted kleptoparasitism significantly more often than expected and adults significantly less often. Subadults kleptoparasitized in proportion to their abundance in the population. If an age-related dominance hierarchy exists, it mediates kleptoparasitic behavior in Kelp Gull assemblages through older birds avoiding kleptoparasitic attacks rather than initiating them. Simple mathematical models, based on data collected during field observations, were used to investigate the conditions explaining the rate of intraspecific kleptoparasitism within Kelp Gull populations. Either few individuals can kleptoparasitize relatively frequently, or many individuals can kleptoparasitize infrequently. Apparently, both mechanisms operate within Kelp Gull populations because individuals attempt kleptoparasitism relatively frequently when they are juveniles and inefficient hunters, but infrequently once they are adult and efficient hunters. The viability of facultative intraspecific kleptoparasitism as a foraging technique relies on stolen prey being larger on average than the prey captured by hunting.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Although it is widely assumed that protected areas conserve species that would not survive elsewhere, this assumption is seldom tested. The aim of the study was to determine the respective roles of a nature reserve and commercial and subsistence rangeland in preserving terrestrial arthropods and reptiles in xeric succulent thicket in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. 2. Faunal diversity on a nature reserve (the Great Fish River Reserve Complex) was compared with a historically overgrazed commercial farm, an intensively managed, conservatively stocked commercial farm and a communal grazing area. Terrestrial arthropods and reptiles were caught in paired pitfall traps inside and outside the nature reserve, specimens being sorted into recognizable taxonomic units (RTU). The taxa occurring in each land management unit were compared using RTU diversity, a hierarchical richness index (HRI), community similarity and uniqueness. 3. The nature reserve contained more RTU and a greater HRI than adjacent land for most arthropod groups, and also supported more unique taxa than the other study localities. 4. Snakes and lizards, in contrast, were almost twice as abundant in the communal grazing area as elsewhere, although reptile species diversity was similar at all localities. 5. Each individual locality contained fewer than 62% of the total number of arthropod RTU and 55% of the total reptile RTU; the communal grazing area contained only 37% of the total number of arthropod RTU collected in the study area. 6. Nineteen (73%) of the ant, 18 (69%) of the weevil, 60 (70%) of the spider and 12 (60%) of the grasshopper RTU and 10 (66%) of the reptiles were shared by the three land uses. Six new weevil species and probably several new arachnid species were collected, but all the new weevils were confined to the nature reserve. 7. The communal grazing area differed most from the nature reserve in richness and community composition, followed by the conservatively stocked commercial farm. The historically overgrazed commercial farm was most similar to the nature reserve. 8. The communal grazing area was characterized by xeric-adapted reptiles and predatory arthropods whose ranges are centred in the semi-arid parts of South Africa. In contrast, the nature reserve and commercial farms supported more mesic-adapted reptiles and herbivorous arthropods. 9. Synthesis and applications. The data show how protected areas are key to conserving those species that decrease under heavily grazed and disturbed conditions. However, they also illustrate that diverse land-use mosaics promote gamma diversity in the xeric succulent thicket of South Africa. Conservation policies that include protected space in the wider environment and conserve habitat diversity are likely to both promote regional richness and support scarce species.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Heath-Carter somatotypes were determined on 206 male members of South Australian representative squads in 17 sports. Complete state squads were tested in the following sports: badminton, basketball, cycling, field hockey, field lacrosse, gymnastics, speed roller skating, squash, swimming and volleyball. Thirty-six percent of the subjects had either represented their country in international competition or, in the case of Australian Rules football, received All-Australian recognition. The overall somatotype of 2.3-5.3-2.8 (balanced mesomorph) was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) less endomorphic, more mesomorphic and more ectomorphic than baseline data in the literature. The sportsmen are therefore better equipped for physical activity in that they have to displace less relative fat mass yet have a greater relative muscle mass with which to initiate and sustain movement. Ten of the group means were in the ectomorphic mesomorph category, 5 were balanced mesomorphs and 2 were in the endomorphic mesomorph grouping. A one-way MANOVA, which used Wilks' lambda as the test statistic, was employed to determine whether there were any statistically significant differences between the group somatotype means. This analysis was significant beyond the 0.05 level.Subsequent pairwise comparisons by means of Hotelling's T\u00b2 with a Bonferroni adjusted alpha level of 0.00048 indicated that there were significant differences between the following: the field lacrosse players (2.9-5.4-2.5) and both the gymnasts (1.9-6.1-2.5) and Australian Rules footballers (2.1-5.7-2.5); the rugby union footballers (2.7-6.0-2.0) and swimmers (1.9-4.7-3.6); and the gymnasts (1.9-6.1-2.5) and track and field athletes (2.0-4.7-3.4).\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
