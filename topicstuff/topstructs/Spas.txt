Yet in his scientific papers, published in the early sixties, Monod defends an idea which suggests a quite different interpretation of the cellular control systems. This idea persists in his later book \"Chance and Necessity\", contradicting his own mechanistic and reductionistic inferences. In his scientific analysis Monod reveals not only the molecular mechanisms of the teleonomical performances of the cell, but also their biological specificity, which does not allow for their reduction to merely chemical processes, although they are grounded on such processes and can be explained by them. However, in his philosophical interpretation of teleonomy he remains at the level of the chemical basis of these processes and does not take into account their biological specificity. If one abstracts Monod's scientific analysis from his philosophical interpretation, one can find in the former some ideas suggesting a different, non-mechanistic interpretation of biological phenomena.\n      </p>", "Discovery of immunologically relevant antigens in prostate cancer forms the basis for developing more potent active immunotherapy. We report here a strategy using the transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) model, which allows for the functional identification of immunogenic prostate tumor antigens with relevance for human immunotherapy. Using a combination of active tumor vaccination in the presence of CTL-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) in vivo blockade, we elicited tumor-specific T cells used to expression clone the first T cell-defined TRAMP tumor antigen, called Spas-1 (stimulator of prostatic adenocarcinoma specific T cells-1). Spas-1 expression was increased in advanced primary TRAMP tumors. We show that the immunodominant SPAS-1 epitope SNC9-H\u2088 arose from a point mutation in one allele of the gene in TRAMP tumor cells, and that immunization with dendritic cells pulsed with SNC9-H\u2088 peptide resulted in protection against TRAMP-C2 tumor challenge. In humans, the Spas-1 ortholog SH3GLB2 has been reported to be overexpressed in prostate cancer metastases. Additionally, we identified a nonmutated HLA-A2-binding epitope in the human ortholog SH3GLB2, which primed T cells from healthy HLA-A2\u207a individuals in vitro. Importantly, in vitro-primed T cells also recognized naturally processed and presented SH3GLB2. Our findings demonstrate that our in vivo CTLA-4 blockade-based T cell expression cloning can identify immunogenic cancer antigens with potential relevance for human immunotherapy.\n      </p>", "Objectives. Oxidation reduction potential (ORP) is a more direct measure of water quality in swimming pools and spas than free chlorine. However, ORP is not considered in some state pool codes, including Minnesota's. This study examined whether compliance with the Minnesota Pool Code assured an ORP \u2265650 millivolts (mV), a value defined in the literature as adequate to kill viral and bacterial pathogens within seconds. We also examined predictors of ORP. Methods. Water samples from public swimming pools and spas in Hennepin County, Minnesota, were collected during routine health inspections from May through August 2004 and assessed for compliance with the state pool code. ORP values were also recorded. A Chi-square test was used to evaluate the association between code compliance and ORP. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and logistic regression models were used to determine predictors of ORP. Results. The study included 132 pools and 30 spas. Compliance with the Minnesota Pool Code did not assure an ORP\u2265650 mV (p&lt;0.01). Outdoor pools had significantly lower ORP values than indoor pools (p&lt;0.001). ANCOVA and logistic regression models showed that ORP decreased with increasing cyanuric acid, increasing pH, and decreasing free chlorine. Conclusions. Compliance with the Minnesota Pool Code did not coincide with adequate ORP values, particularly for outdoor pools and spas. Therefore, it may be appropriate for states to include a minimum ORP standard of \u2265650 mV in their swimming pool regulations. Doing so would likely benefit the health of swimmers.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

But female-authored accounts of spa visits provide a different picture. This article examines female homosociability at spas in Britain from 1640-1714. Women at the spa walked outdoors with one another, visited fairs and attended plays. They shared meals and went dancing, and they conducted their prescribed medicinal regimes of \"taking the waters\" in one another's company. Elite women socialized with members of their own station as well as with the female servants who accompanied them; and they chose to do business with the many female innkeepers, brewers and provisioners who lived and worked in spa towns. Secure in these homosocial spaces, female visitors to the spa talked with one another about child care, medicine-making and health cures. And in this process, women constructed elite identities, distinct and feminine senses of 'self.' At the spa, women were able to circulate their ideas within a culture which often was centered upon the flirtatious advances of male libertines, or around the advice and authority of male physicians. Projecting their voices from a communal female authority, women at spas created and defended female-oriented spaces.\n      </p>", "Evidence suggests that children's self-perceptions of their abilities predict their school achievement even after one accounts for their tested cognitive ability (IQ). However, the roles of nature and nurture in the association between school achievement and self-perceived abilities (SPAs), independent oflQ, is unknown. Here we reveal that there are substantial genetic influences on SPAs and that there is genetic covariance between SPAs and achievement independent of IQ. Although it has been assumed that the origins of SPAs are environmental, this first genetic analysis of SPAs yielded a heritability of 51% in a sample of 3,785 pairs of twins, whereas shared environment accounted for only 2% of the variance in SPAs. Moreover, multivariate genetic analyses indicated that SPAs predict school achievement independently oflQfor genetic rather than environmental reasons. It should therefore be possible to identify \"SPA genes\" that predict school achievement independently of \"IQ genes.\"\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "This essay examines the survival of waters therapy in twentieth-century France with a view to understanding the conditions that make a therapy convincing in one national context and not in another. Part of the explanation for this survival has to do with the size and power of the spa industry. Where this industry was strong and economically powerful-as it was in France-its survival became a national priority. Of equal importance, however, was the role of the medical elite. In twentieth-century France, a small but influential group of elite physicians served as the chief architects of the continued survival and development of water cures. The primary mechanism for this process was a massive and successful campaign to introduce hydrology into the curriculum of medical schools. Once this was achieved, a large corps of academic hydrologists were in a position to produce significant amounts of convincing hydrological science that seemed to demonstrate the varied physiological effects of mineral waters. By the 1940s mineral waters had enough scientific visibility to ensure their inclusion without controversy in the national health insurance system that was being set up.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

A spa visitor's schedule when following the routine of 'taking the waters' created the park spaces of the Swedish Spa, as can be said of almost any other spa park in Europe. In Sweden, the spa culture had its heyday from the late seventeenth century, when Medevi Spa was founded, until the mid- and late twentieth century, when many of the spas were either closed or used for other purposes. Controlled by the course of treatment, a spa visitor moved between and within places with different character and functions inside the Spa Park, which created a spatial structure of different milieus necessary for the cure. This particular account of parks and gardens in the environment of the Swedish spa starts with an examination of the spa phenomenon in Sweden as a whole, and in particular the spa in Ronneby in south-east Sweden towards the end of the nineteenth century.

The inverse proportionality between the Ni and Fe concentrations in the leaf may suggest that Ni and Fe compete for complexation to NA.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "           ", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "An enquiry into spatially related forms and processes of social life in which Japan has shaped, maintained and further developed its own and specific features, will have to consider leisure activities, recreational traffic and tourism as a significant, increasingly important factor in it. On the one hand intensive commercialisation of mass tourism engaged in a competitive struggle with large Kanko companies increasingly leads to the destruction of landscapes, the endangering of the environment and to over-development of leisure facilities; on the other hand an adaptation of life forms takes place within the rapidly expanding inland tourism. Age groups and macro-regional differentiations become more important than specific class differences in attitudes to travel and leisure. Another social leveller is the continuing dominance of short journeys, which combine experience, change and mass organisation with education and community feeling. The increase in motorisation and the opening up of new destinations for nature, high altitude and sport-based tourism promote the transition to\u2014albeit still brief\u2014family-related recreational holidays. Inspite of these tendencies specific features of traditional Japanese social attitudes remain alive in the principle of group travel and in the concentration on traditional destinations for visits to places such as spas with hot springs (Onsen), temples, shrines and famous viewpoints. Even in the modern forms of landscape and urban tourism and in the attractions of tourist pleasure life or socially obligating and value-related traditions remain alive. The openness to traditional landscape impressions, the will to be educated, and the identification and ability to be impressed continue to be determing elements, which link this modern society with its historical past.\n      </p>", "Zdravstveni turizam vu\u010de svoje korijene jo\u0161 iz anti\u010dkog doba, ali tek posljednjih tridesetak godina sve vi\u0161e dobiva na zna\u010denju. Kako su dvije osnovne karakteristike tog oblika turizma, zapo\u0161ljavanje obrazovanije radne snage i poslovanje koje ne ovisi o sezonama, upravo ovaj oblik turizma mo\u017ee Hrvatskoj pomo\u0107i rije\u0161iti neke gospodarske probleme. Hrvatska bi trebala vidjeti svoje interese u razvoju termalnog turizma (kao jednog od oblika zdravstvenog turizma), po\u0161to se termalne destinacije nalaze u kontinentalnom dijelu Hrvatske gdje turizam nije dovoljno razvijen, tim vi\u0161e \u0161to je turizam kao djelatnost involviran u mnoge gospodarske grane i na taj na\u010din mo\u017ee biti poticaj njihovu razvoju. Korisnici termalnog turizma u najve\u0107em broju su osobe tre\u0107e dobi, ali njima se sve vi\u0161e priklju\u010duju i mla\u0111e osobe. Najve\u0107i broj turista u svijetu dolazi iz gospodarski najrazvijenijih dijelova svijeta. Oni prete\u017eno \u017eive u gradovima u kojima ih suvremen na\u010din \u017eivota stavlja \u010dovjeka u uvjete nepovoljne za \u017eivot. Tako boravak u uglavnom zatvorenim prostorima, s malo kretanja pove\u0107ava rizik od obolijevanja nekih bolesti suvremenog dru\u0161tva. Takvu promjenu u strukturi turista treba pratiti i termalni turizam u kojem je uz zdravstvenu uslugu sve va\u017enija i turisti\u010dka ponuda s bogatim sadr\u017eajima zabave. Hrvatski termalni turizam ima duga\u010dku tradiciju, kvalitetne termalne resurse, ali i u najve\u0107em broju slu\u010dajeva relativnu zapu\u0161tenost kapaciteta i vrlo skromnu turisti\u010dku ponudu. The roots of health tourism go as far back as the age of antiquity, but its importance gained ground only in the last thirty years. Two main features of this type of tourism are that it requires educated workforce and that it is not seasonally influenced. Spa tourism could help solve some of the problems of Croatia's economy. Croatia should see the benefit of the development of spa tourism, as some of the spa destinations are located in continental parts of the country, where tourism has not developed. Development of tourism in these parts of Croatia could contribute to the growth of its economy. Spa tourism is popular among retired people. However and as of recently younger people are becoming attracted to spa tourism too. The majority of tourists come from the more developed parts of the world. Most of them live in the cities, where modern way of life can have adverse effects on their health. Lack of body exercise and stress are the causes of many diseases of the modern societies. Spa tourism should attract tourists, not only through offering stress relief and relaxation but also by offering other forms of entertainment. Croatian spa tourism has a long tradition and quality thermal resources, but many of these resources haven't been fully utilised and provide limited offer to potential tourist.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Ill persons had been exposed to the hotel's whirlpool spa and swimming pool. Symptoms included headache, fever, chills, myalgia, shortness of breath, and fatigue. A diagnosis of Pontiac fever was made, based on serologic evidence of acute infection with Legionella micdadei. High concentrations of heterotrophic bacteria were recovered from the spa, despite apparently high disinfectant levels. L. micdadei was isolated from the swimming pool filter and water from the spa after heat enrichment but not from pools and spas at nearby hotels. Water from hotel pools and spas was tested to determine endotoxin levels; water from the spa of the implicated hotel contained the highest concentration of endotoxin (14,400 endotoxin units/mL). Additional studies are needed to determine the role of endotoxin from legionellae or other bacteria in the pathogenesis of Pontiac fever.\n      </p>", "Rangeland utilization for livestock production in central Argentina has apparently resulted in the replacement of preferred mid-grasses (Poa ligularis and Stipa clarazii) by preferred short-grasses (Piptochaetium napostaense and Stipa tenuis) and avoided grasses (Stipa tenuissima and Stipa eriostachya). However, the botanical composition in the pristine condition is unknown due to the lack of historical data and relict areas. The objective of this study was to analyze soil phytolith assemblages from a representative site of central Argentina rangelands to test the presumed floristic changes. Soil phytolith assemblages (SPAs) were compared with three plant phytolith assemblages (PPAs), each of it made up of two species. One PPA was integrated by the preferred mid-grasses P. ligularis and S. clarazii, another by the preferred short-grasses P. napostaense and S. tenuis, and a third one by the avoided grasses S. eriostachya and S. tenuissima. For each PPA, the proportion of species representing the best fit with SPAs was estimated by considering all possible lineal combinations between the phytolith assemblage of the two integrating species, and selecting that representing the minimum distance to SPA. The highest degree of similarity between SPAs and PPAs corresponded to the PPA integrated by P. ligularis and S. clarazii. Our results support the hypothesis of the dominance of preferred mid-grasses in the pristine condition in rangelands of central Argentina, and that a shift towards the dominance of preferred short-grasses and avoided grasses has occurred in its present disturbed condition.\n      </p>", "Although the 1922-43 Special Powers Acts (SPAs) played a central role in prompting the Northern Irish civil rights movement in the late 1960s, virtually no secondary literature exists on the operation of the statutes. This article examines the manner in which the unionist government employed the acts during the tenure of the northern parliament. It suggests that the 1922-43 SPAs became a central grievance of the minority community because of the manner in which regulations introduced under their auspices were exercised: the ministry of home affairs initially used the emergency statutes to return civil order to the province; however, as violence declined the government began to utilize regulations to prevent the expression of republican ideals. Any attempt to garner support for a united Ireland was perceived as an attack on the Northern Irish constitution. Concurrent with this shift was a change in justification for the 1922-43 SPAs: from being required in order to establish law and order in the face of rising violence, they were soon heralded by unionists as necessary to maintain the constitutional structure of the North. In preventing the public exposition of republicanism, expressions of nationalism were likewise limited. This impacted upon a large portion of the minority community, giving rise to claims that the statutes were being unfairly applied.\n      </p>", "Caspar Schober, an Austrian physician of the early 16th century, wrote a treatise concerning the most famous German spas. In this treatise he describes a method to analyse the hot springs in Gastein to know their therapeutic effects. With this description he is one of the first scientific authors in Germany dealing with the modern analysis of hot springs used by the Italian balneologists; in fact he is writing in the same textual paradigm as Menghus Blanchellus in his \u201aConsilium de balneo Villae\u2018.
