{"total_words": 349, "documents": ["This paper studies systems of partial differential equations modelling laser percussion drilling. The particular phenomenon considered in detail is the ejection of the thin layer of molten material. This thin layer is modelled as an inviscid flow between the fluid surface and fluid/solid interface, both of which are unknown moving boundaries. Through a regular asymptotic expansion, the governing equations are reduced to a combination of the shallow water equations in the zero gravity limit and a two-phase Stefan problem; the key small parameter is the square of the aspect ratio. These leading-order problems exhibit shocks which represent a possible mechanism for the previously unexplained fluid clumping. Approximate formulas and a parameter grouping are derived to predict the rate of melt solidification during ejection. Finally, weak formulations of the convection-diffusion equation for energy conservation are presented. These weak formulations are novel because the fluid is moving across a solid surface. An appropriate extension to the enthalpy method is suggested as a first stage toward numerical calculations.\n      </p>", "The importance of the centre of percussion (CP) of some hand-held sporting equipment (such as tennis rackets and baseball bats) for athletic performance is well known. In order to avoid injuries it is important that powerful blows are located close to the CP. Several species of glyptodont (giant armoured mammals) had tail clubs that can be modelled as rigid beams (like baseball bats) and it is generally assumed that these were useful for agonistic behaviour. However, the variation in tail club morphology among known genera suggests that a biomechanical and functional analysis of these structures could be useful. Here, we outline a novel method to determine the CP of the glyptodont tail clubs. We find that the largest species had the CP very close to the possible location of horny spikes. This is consistent with the inference that they were adapted to delivering powerful blows at that point. Our new analysis reinforces the case for agonistic use of tail clubs in several glyptodont species.\n      </p>", "Eighty-nine consecutive patients with suspected intracranial masses were examined by auscultatory percussion in a blind study to assess the sensitivity of the procedure. Each patient underwent computed tomography (CT) of the brain as part of his medical care, and the results were compared with those of auscultatory percussion. Fifty-one of the patients had abnormal CT scans, of whom 44 (86%) had abnormal (positive) findings on auscultatory percussion; seven (13%) yielded false-negative results. Each of the patients with subdural haematomas had distinctly positive findings by auscultatory percussion. Of the 38 patients with normal CT scans, 11 had strokes with hemiparesis, and each had positive findings in the contra-lateral hemisphere by auscultatory percussion. The remaining 27 patients with normal CT scans were healthy; 25 had normal findings on auscultatory percussion, two (7%) gave false-positive results. Twenty subjects were studied with phonoscopy. Auscultatory percussion is easy to perform and is clinically useful.\n      </p>", "Firearms identification procedures continue to play a role in the archaeological study of battles and warfare. Percussion caps, if well preserved, have the potential to yield unique individual tool marks that can be microscopically examined to determine a minimum number of weapons present at a specific site. This study analyzed 110 percussion caps from an 1854 U.S. Army and Apache battle site and determined that at least 34 firearms were used in the battle. A validation study using modern percussion caps from 11 known weapons was also undertaken to demonstrate the potential for percussion cap analysis in future studies.\n      </p>", "Petroglyph manufacture probably often involved indirect percussion, especially for carefully made lines and edges of larger figures. Experimental replication shows that during indirect percussion, debitage is produced from the chisel-stone that should be recoverable in archaeological context at rock art sites. Following experiments that demonstrated how the debitage is produced, this report describes its characteristic shape and provides suggestions as to what sorts of contexts might contain this evidence.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "This study reviewed whether sex-instrumentation distributions prevalent in US and English cultures was due to a limited geographical representation of extant research. We gathered data regarding sex and instrument selection from many diverse geographical regions. Data from a sample of 8146 community and youth band participants from 25 countries (170 ensembles) supports previous research. Gender bias permeating US and England instrumentation in wind and percussion ensembles appears not to be limited to these countries, but exists elsewhere around the world. In most countries, male participants outnumbered females. The data demonstrate that females overwhelmingly populated flute and clarinet sections. Oboe and bassoon were other instruments where females considerably outnumbered males. There was a sex imbalance across the totality of all ensembles, because males predominantly populated the remaining instruments (saxophone, trumpet, horn, trombone, euphonium, tuba, and percussion). It would seem that the more traditional roles of females and males (in terms of instrument selection) are borne out in many ensembles from around the world. We recommend identifying several ensembles whose member rosters reflect these more traditional sexlinstrument matches, and those whose member rosters reflect more gender-neutral instrument matches to review possible influences for these differences.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Or, ce d\u00e9terminisme naturel simpliste ne r\u00e9siste pas \u00e0 une analyse comparative r\u00e9alis\u00e9e sur l'ensemble du Massif armoricain. On observe ainsi d'importantes variations au sein d'une m\u00eame culture, qui ne s'expliquent pas par l'abondance ou la raret\u00e9 des ressources proches. Par ailleurs, autour d'un m\u00eame lieu d'approvisionnement, les choix techniques vont diff\u00e9rer radicalement au cours du temps. Comme pour des d\u00e9bitages complexes, il convient de distinguer plusieurs param\u00e8tres: les territories d'acquisition, le niveau technique de la culture \u00e9tudi\u00e9e, l'organisation sociale ou encore les activit\u00e9s r\u00e9alis\u00e9es sur l'habitat.

On the Armorican Massif, implementation of bipolar percussion on an anvil is generally observed for the knapping of fluvial and sea pebbles, from the Epipalaeolithic to the Bronze Age. For a present-day observer, this process seems to be most evident for th exploitation of small spherical or avoid pebbles. However, this natural and simplistic determinism cannot stand up to a comparative analysis carried out on the whole of the Armorican Massif. The observation of important variations within a same culture cannot be explained by the abundance or rarity of nearby lithic resources. Moreover, around a same supply area, technical choices may radicaly vary over time. In the same way as for complex knapping modes, several parameters should be distinguished: supply areas, technical levels of the culture being considered, social organisation or settlement activities. As a general rule, this method is characteristic of Neolithic cultures and not of the Mesolithic cultures.\n      </p>", "The first movement of Bart\u00f3k's Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion (1937) has been noted for its Beethovenian use of sonata form and shares a number of features with the 'Waldstein' Sonata. This article examines the relationship between these two composers and these two works, starting with an examination of Bart\u00f3k's use of sonata form. It attempts to establish whether Bart\u00f3k borrowed gratefully from his predecessor in an attempt to 'synthesize' old and new, folk and art, or whether he misread Beethoven in the anxious process of carving a place for himself in the musical canon.\n      </p>", "Percussion plays a major role in many rituals of the Maya Indians of Zinacantan. In order to explain the symbolic meaning held by ritualistic percussive sounds, six major types of percussion are examined. While Needham's hypothesis of a universal link between percussion and transition in social life is valuable and appears to be substantiated in Zinacanteco rites, percussion has other symbolic associations as well. Percussive sounds convey numerous messages, serving as signaling devices, punctuating the passage of solar time, and also symbolizing aspects of the natural world.\n      </p>", "The total variability in archaeological material derives from at least 4 different sources: technological, functional, stylistic, and random variation. Different attributes may be needed to quantify each aspect of the total variability, and the particular attributes that the archaeologist singles out for analysis will determine, to a large extent, the utility and validity of any subsequent typology. At present, there is relatively little theory to aid in the selection of the attributes most appropriate for a particular archaeological problem. In the analysis of prehistoric flake stone tools, the technology of flake production falls largely within the realm of the natural sciences; thus, technological variability is perhaps that aspect of the total variability for which suitable theory may be most readily developed. Flake production can be divided into 2 distinct processes, percussion flaking and pressure flaking, on the basis of the duration of the applied force. The fracture processes involved in these 2 types of flake production are sufficiently different to warrant a separate treatment of each. Attention is focused specifically on percussion flaking because this process appears to have been the predominant mode of flake production throughout most of human prehistory and, at present, it remains poorly understood. It is found that a percussion flake is detached from a core largely by a process known as spalling, the fracture produced by the reflection of a stress wave at the free surface of the core adjacent to the striking platform. The thickness of a flake is a function largely of 4 impact parameters and 2 constants of the material: the shape, intensity, and wavelength of the stress wave emanating from the point of impact, the angle of incidence of the stress wave on the free face of the core, the critical impact strength of the material in tension, and an elastic property of the material. Other attributes of flake size such as the length, width, area, weight, and volume are also influenced by these parameters. Several other factors affecting the size of a flake are discussed, and areas where further research is needed are outlined. It is concluded that the various attributes of flake size are highly and predictably interrelated.\n      </p>", "Des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de perles en cornaline, \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents stades d'\u00e9laboration, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9s en surface, \u00e9pars \u00e0 Larsa, concentr\u00e9s sur une petite surface \u00e0 P.L.

Because Orff Schulwerk instruction is one of the most prevalent pedagogies in elementary music education, this study examined the rehearsal strategies of recognized Orff Schulwerk teachers as they worked to refine learned repertoire for percussion instruments. Eight instructors and their upper elementary students were videotaped in four regular rehearsals each. Systematic analyses of rehearsal frames in which teachers were working to improve student performance revealed fast teacher pacing and a predominance of instructional directives that were procedural (e.g., where to begin playing) rather than musical (e.g., how to perform more accurately or expressively). The majority of students' performance problems were related to precision, often caused by rushing the underlying pulse. Instructional targets were most often related to technique. Students successfully accomplished proximal goals in 63% of the performance trials in which the targets were verbalized by the teacher prior to performance and in 74% of the performance trials when the targets were verbalized by the teachers while students were playing. Students were most successful when teachers used clear, explicit directives and positive modeling.\n      </p>", "The prime function of the clown (chou) in jingju (Beijing \"opera\") has often been considered as light entertainment, but there is evidence that could support a different interpretation. The clown is associated with the origin of Chinese acting, and performance shows a fundamental relationship between the clown and drumming which comes from shamanism. While other martial roles share some of the tie to percussion, the improvisational freedom of the clown, the customary verse the clown uses, drumming, and parallels to Taoist ritual music may point back to shamanistic roots. If this is true, the clown's comedy may come from exorcism and not only joking.\n      </p>", "The frequency and morphology of notches produced on bovid long bones by carnivore gnawing (tooth notches) and hammerstone-on-anvil breakage (percussion notches) are quantified. Notches are semicircular- to arcuate-shaped indentations on fracture edges with corresponding negative flake scars on medullary surfaces. We restrict our analysis to notches produced under controlled conditions by either carnivores or hammerstones when diaphyses are breached to extract marrow. Percussion notches are characteristically more frequent, and, in cortical view, broader and shallower than tooth notches. The flakes removed from percussion notches are typically broader, and have a more obtuse release angle, than those removed from tooth notches. These morphological differences are statistically significant for notches on Bovid Size 1 and 2 long bones but not on Bovid Size 3 long bones. Notches should be more durable than marks produced by carcass consumers on bone surfaces because they penetrate the entire thickness of the bone. As a result, notches are not easily obscured by weathering, chemical corrosion, or adhering matrix. Given this durability, and the initial success we have had in distinguishing the actor responsible for notch production on modern bones, notches can be used, with some limitations, to identify bone consumers archaeologically.\n      </p>", "The first and third movements of B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k's Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta (1936) are subjected to a pitch-based (here strictly distinguished from pc-based) analysis, with the idea of defining ways, here called zones of impingement, in which pc-based observations may be incorporated into such an analysis without invoking the generalizing power that pitch class is usually thought to have over pitch.\n      </p>", "In an attempt to discern the quantitative parameters diagnostic of specific load applications (i.e. hard- and soft-hammer percussion and pressure flaking) used in flint knapping, approximately 1,500 experimentally produced flakes were analyzed.

Although the study indicates that hard- and soft-hammer percussion do not yield significantly different debitage weights or thicknesses, pressure flakes can be differentiated from percussion spalls on the basis of these variables.\n      </p>", "Thirty-one percussion-shaped tools from the San Dieguito complex of the southern California middens have been examined. On 30 of these tools facets apparently corresponding to several regions of the thumb and the first two fingers of the right hand have been identified, as well as clearance and rake angles at the cutting edges corresponding closely to those on modern cutting tools. One of the tools seems to have been intended for left-handed usage. The evidence indicates that these tools were shaped with great precision to fit the hand and to have efficient cutting edges. Statistics on the length of the facets and the mass and height of the tools, as well as on the angles of the working edges, are given.\n      </p>", "Apparatus is described for subjecting various initiators to accurately reproducible blows, in such a way as to permit a large number of impact trials without undue labour, and thereby to determine probability of detonation for blows of graded violence. Plots of the probability of detonation are given for various initiators, in relation to the velocity, momentum and kinetic energy of the steel drifts used for imparting the blow. It is not yet clear which of these factors is most important in determining sensitiveness to percussion.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Ball diameter, drop height, and impact angle were held constant. For a given platform angle (measured between striking platform and exterior surface of prism or flake), a decrease in the size of the prism is accompanied by a decrease in terminal flake length, terminal flake width, and terminal platform thickness, and by an increase in the minimum ball diameter required to remove a flake. For prisms of comparable size, a decrease in platform angle is accompanied by a decrease in terminal flake length and in the average values of the length/width, length/platform thickness and width/platform thickness ratios. A decrease in platform angle is also accompanied by a marked increase in the width of the zone along the edge of the prism within which flakes can be produced. Thus, the larger the platform angle, the greater the accuracy required to remove a flake. Further investigations are needed in order to determine to what extent the relationships and trends observed in the present study are applicable to the more complex core geometries generally encountered by archaeologists.\n      </p>", "Kaneka is the contemporary and highly popular music of the young Melanesians in New Caledonia. The musicians say kaneka is the sound of their ancestors; their grandfathers on the other hand say there are not enough traditional elements in kaneka. Most of the traditional music of New Caledonia has been forgotten, and there is only a limited number of musical expressions from which the young musicians can take their ideas. The most evident link between kaneka and their grandfathers' music is the use of traditional percussion instruments. However, how percussion instruments accompany traditional singing and how they accompany kaneka music can show important differences. Perhaps the typical Melanesian element in kaneka lies not in the music itself but in the way the musicians treat kaneka as a cultural and political movement.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The upper Mousterian levels of la Quina (Charente) yielded abundant well-preserved remains of butchered reindeer. These provided an opportunity to study Mousterian marrow extraction practices to determine if these were guided by purely practical or by cultural considerations. Tibias were used because it is possible to determine the exact point of percussion. The lack of regularity in their placement indicates that the morphology of the bone did not rigidly determine the way in which they were broken. Either changing cultural practices or differing individual preferences played a major role.\n      </p>", "In experimental research into percussion 'languages', an interactive computer system, the Bol Processor, has been developed by the authors to analyse the performances of expert musicians and generate its own musical items that were assessed for quality and accuracy by the informants. The problem of transferring knowledge from a human expert to a machine in this context is the focus of this paper. A prototypical grammatical inferencer named QAVAID (Question Answer Validated Analytical Inference Device, an acronym also meaning 'grammar' in Arabic/Urdu) is described and its operation in a real experimental situation is demonstrated. The paper concludes on the nature of the knowledge acquired and the scope and limitations of a cognitive-computational approach to music.\n      </p>", "Knapping experiments and examination of flaked stone objects distributed throughout portions of southwestern Imperial Valley and northern Baja California indicate that criteria other than presence or absence of percussion bulbs can be used to support the artifactual nature of certain fractured stones.\n      </p>", "Several unresolved issues of Mesoamerican prismatic blade manufacture concern the bit used in the Aztec pressure tool, the importance of indirect percussion in blade production (Clark 1982:373), and the possible use of vises in pre-Columbian times. Relying on data from recent studies of archaeological assemblages, replication experiments, and contemporary ethnographic practices, I argue that the bit of the Aztec tool was probably hard wood, that indirect percussion was not used to manufacture prismatic blades, and that vises may never have been used in pre-Hispanic Mesoamerica. I also take this opportunity to correct several misconceptions fostered in my previous presentation of Mesoamerican blade technology (Clark 1982).\n      </p>", "ith <a
