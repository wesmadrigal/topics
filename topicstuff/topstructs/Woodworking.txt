His woodbending machine, patented in 1849, was also widely used in making agricultural implements and carriages and, to some extent, wooden ships and household furniture. Records of patent assignment, extension, and litigation reveal when, where, and by whom the diffusion of Blanchard's woodworking technologies took place. Since Blanchard renewed both patents beyond their original terms, one can use these records to trace and map the geographic spread of his woodworking machines during several decades. In addition, the records reveal Blanchard as an active manager of his inventions as intellectual property.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Herbicides, chlorophenols, and other occupational exposures are suspected risk factors for soft-tissue sarcoma, but the epidemiologic evidence is inconsistent. Given that soft-tissue sarcomas represent a heterogeneous mix of cancer subtypes and that these subtypes have different disease patterns by race, sex, and age at diagnosis, studying all soft-tissue sarcomas combined may mask subtype-specific associations. Using the Selected Cancers Study, a large population-based case-control study of sarcoma conducted among U.S. men aged 30 to 60 in 1984 to 1988, we explored the occupational risk factors for soft-tissue sarcoma subtypes and skeletal sarcoma. The analysis included 251 living sarcoma cases (48 dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, 32 malignant fibrohistiocytic sarcoma, 67 leiomyosarcoma, 53 liposarcoma, and 51 skeletal sarcoma) and 1908 living controls. Exact conditional logistic regression models suggested patterns of subtype specificity for occupational exposures. Self-reported herbicide use was associated with malignant fibrohistiocytic sarcoma (OR = 2.9, 95% CI = 1.1-7.3). We found elevated risks for chlorophenol exposure and cutting oil exposure and malignant fibrohistiocytic sarcoma and leiomyosarcoma. We found no occupational risk factor for liposarcoma. Polytomous regression models identified different odds ratios across subtypes for plywood exposure and exposure to wood and saw dust. Although exploratory, this analysis suggests that occupational risk factors for sarcoma are not uniform across subtypes.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "The Pur\u00e9pecha region of Michoac\u00e1n State, in west-central Mexico, has a strong tradition of craft production, especially wooden items. Transportation improvements in the region since the mid-twentieth century have led to a higher level of integration of the regional economy, yet access to the broader Mexican market remains limited. Towns throughout the region have experienced substantial changes in the types of crafts produced, the extent of their local and external markets, and the location of craft production. Transportation improvements have, in part, led to agglomeration economies and a resultant contraction in the number of different types and an increase in the volume of the crafts produced. Market changes have led to the proliferation of craft storefronts in towns with higher levels of accessibility. Conversely, remote towns still rely heavily on distributors and have not been able to expand their markets. As a result, the region has seen the development of a two-tiered system whereby towns with increased accessibility have viable craft industries and towns with limited accessibility struggle with stagnant craft industries.\n      </p>", "A case-control study of squamous cell neoplasms of the maxillary sinus was performed in Hokkaido during 1982-86, with 169 cases and 338 controls matched for sex. age, and residence. The data were analyzed by a stepwise forward-selection method based on a conditional logistic-regression model without interaction terms, log-likelihood ratio tests, and chi-square tests for trend. Statistically significant linear trends were observed for associations between the risk of squamous-cell maxillary-sinus neoplasms and the duration of woodworking among men, the daily or lifetime amount of smoking among men, and the number of smokers in the household as an index of domestic exposure to cigarette smoke among women.\n      </p>", "Examination of 206 Neolithic and Chalcolithic bifaces from the southern Levant revealed that changes in form during the emergence of agropastoralism correlated with evolving land use practices, but new biface types also expressed altered social identities and perceptions of the environment. Nonfunctional groundstone pre-pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) bifaces seem to have served as social and status symbols, while flaked flint PPNA tranchet axes and chisels were used for carpentry rather than tree-felling. This pattern continued during the following early pre-pottery Neolithic B (EPPNB) period, but a new sharpening method, polishing, was used on a unique flint tranchet ax to strengthen its edge. By the MPPNB and LPPNB, heavier polished flint axes were used to clear forests for fields, grazing lands, wood fuel, and lumber. Sustainable forest management continued until the cumulative effects of tree-felling may have led to landscape degradation at the end of the PPNC. Adzes replace axes as heavy woodworking tools during the pottery Neolithic A (PNA) period, but by the PNB period, once again there are more carpentry tools than tree-felling bifaces. The trend is reversed again during the Chalcolithic, when the demand for fire wood, lumber, and cleared land seems to have increased during a time of emerging socioeconomic complexity.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

This case-referent study is of a pilot character and was undertaken for the further elucidation of respiratory and digestive tract cancer among Swedish woodworkers. A fourfold excess of respiratory cancer, other than nasal cancer, was found, particularly in relation to furniture workers, whereas no definite excess of digestive tract cancer was indicated.

Despite some variation in the kit assemblages, they share strong similarities in hammerstone types and related tools and contain tools that appear to have been used for activities in addition to flintknapping, such as woodworking. The demographic profile of the associated skeletons--flintknappers, presumably--indicates they were primarily older males, some appearing to have held high status, based on other funerary items associated with the burials. But the spatial distribution of flintknapper burials, combined with the overall patterning of associated mortuary goods, suggests that there was no correlation between high status and flintknapping.

In this paper a small lithic scatter in the uplands of west-central Illinois was investigated in order to assess the activities performed there and the role of the site within the proposed prehistoric subsistence-settlement system. Because lithic use-wear techniques were contemplated for providing information on the stone tools, their efficacy on material from plowzone context had to be tested and evaluated. Although use-wear techniques on plowzone-related artifacts are not recommended as everyday fare, some functional information was derived from about three-quarters of the artifacts tested.

Known as the \"tree of music,\" its wood is used in the construction of the capperstick, a percussion instrument used to accompany song. We documented the construction stages of the clapperstick by Acjachemen artisans: harvest, woodworking, and decoration.

The thorough excavation and aggregation of features into 10 discrete clusters provide an opportunity to investigate the internal use of space and the organization of labor, primarily through the stone tools from five of the feature clusters. An analysis of lithic use-wear reveals an almost universal emphasis on hide scraping throughout the site.

These are interpreted by comparison with reference surfaces prepared with hand and machine tools. In all the cases studied, handwork can be distinguished from machined surfaces, and the marks left by some, but not all, kinds of milling operations can be recognized. Examination of locks from representative arms shows that, while there was increased use of machine tools at armories in the United States throughout the 19th century, hand filing was used to bring parts to their final dimensions. The quality of handwork increased throughout the century; in working metal, it appears to have been superior in accuracy to that which could be attained in production by machine tools, but in woodworking, there is evidence that machines were able to supplant handwork by mid-century.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The two Galt waterworks campaigns (1888 and 1890) are studied in the context of other contemporaneous local events, the most important of which was a moulders' strike in 1889. Popular resistance to businessmen's wants and public support for the striking moulders prompted the formation of a local board of trade and the threat of an industrial exodus from town. The waterworks authorization of 1890 resulted from the victory by buinessmen in this overt class stuggle. The development of Galt's waterworks reflected economic and political interests far more than public health concerns. The findings refut McLaughlin, and illustrate a novel connection between urban politics, infrastructure development, labour rleations, and industrial capitalism. /// Cet article r\u00e9fute la th\u00e8se selon laquelle le syst\u00e8me d'aqueduc de la ville de Galt, Ontario, aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 construit pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 publique.

In a population-based case-control study, we examined whether participation in selected hobbies involving solvent exposure increases NHL risk. We identified NHL cases diagnosed at ages 20-74 years between 1998 and 2000 in Iowa or metropolitan Los Angeles, Detroit, and Seattle. Controls were selected using random digit dialing or Medicare files. Computer-assisted personal interviews (551 cases, 462 controls) elicited data on model building, painting/silkscreening/artwork, furniture refinishing, and woodworking/home carpentry. Hobby participation (68% of cases, 69% of controls) was not associated with NHL risk (OR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.7-1.2). Compared to people with none of the hobbies evaluated, those who built models had significantly lower risk (OR = 0.7, CI = 0.5-1.0), but risk did not vary with the number of years or lifetime hours. Risk estimates for the other hobbies were generally less than one, but the associations were not significant and there were no notable patterns with duration of exposure. Use of oil-based, acrylic, or water-based paints; paint strippers; polyurethane; or varnishes was not associated with NHL risk.

The project integrated archaeological and biological research to understand human adaptations and Holocene environments over time. Buldir was chosen for the project for several reasons: (1) it is strategically located between the Rat and Near Islands and potentially contributes information on rate of westward migration of hunters in the Aleutian chain, (2) it can provide clues to the amount and kind of communication and/or isolation that existed among the western islands, and (3) its extant faunal population was never impacted by foxes and should be an excellent analogue for the island's past biodiversity. Radiocarbon dates suggest the island was inhabited as early as 1100 years ago. This paper describes the bone, lithic, and wooden artifacts recovered from two test pits excavated on the beachfront of the midden site. Due to the unusual preservation in the island midden, fragile organics, including wood, were recovered. For the first time, western Aleut woodworking technology is discussed. Additionally, this paper explores the types and sources of lithic raw materials selected by ancient peoples on Buldir. Lithic and bone artifact analysis, coupled with radiocarbon dates, suggest that both Rat and Near Islanders used Buldir\u2014 sometimes concurrently. The first year's excavation on Buldir shows the potential for prehistoric research in the western Aleutian Islands.\n      </p>", "Recent changes in the cultural and forest landscapes of the Meseta Pur\u00e9pecha in Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico as a result of forest degradation underscore the complexity of forest change processes in the tropical highlands of Latin America. Differences in community perception and forest structure and composition between the furniture-making and lumber-producing towns of Pich\u00e1taro and Sevina, Pur\u00e9pechan indigenous communities located amidst pine forests on Michoac\u00e1n's volcanic plateau illustrate the dynamics of this process. We base our comparisons on interviews and field measures of forest structure. Our results show dramatic changes in the forests and cultural landscapes of both communities during the past decade. Following high regional timber exports during the early 1990s, Sevina shifted from a self-sufficient to a timber importation community. By comparison, communal forests and individual parcels in Pich\u00e1taro continue to provide wood for approximately 300 wood shops. Field data and forest stand maps confirm the perception of forest degradation in both communities. While Pich\u00e1taro has maintained a larger and more diverse forest base to date, stand structure data indicate selective harvesting has led to a shift in dominance toward the less economically desirable pine species and oak. Deforestation and degradation of Sevina and Pich\u00e1taro's community forests are symptomatic of both the Meseta Pur\u00e9pecha and Mexico in general. Current forest conditions in both communities justify local, regional, and national concerns regarding declining biodiversity and sustainable economies.\n      </p>", "The behavioural significance of new patterns of variablity between Middle Palaeolithic assemblages is discussed. These consist of different frequencies in regularly retouched tools of any type, correlated with named Mousterian entities. The Charentian, for example, with an abundance of racloirs in particular, possesses high implement frequencies, whereas the Denticulate Mousterian, dominated by denticulated and notched implements, possesses fewer implements. Increased racloirs manufacture, however, is the main cause of high implement frequencies. It is possible that many racloirs were fine cutting implements extensively utilised, resharpened, and frequently replaced when circumstances required economising of lithic material. Denticulates and notches were made for processing harder materials by differnt kinetic actions, such as in woodworking, and lasted longer. Industries dominated by either racloirs or by denticulates and notches were all manufactured during the conditions of Early Wurnm glacial, but the former coincide most often with severe phases whereas the latter tend to occur during milder or temperate episodes an to cluster geographically within several areas of the Mediterranean basin. A model describes the indirect effect of bioclimatic changes on seasonal variations and how these condtion mobility and concentration patterns of ancient food-collecting populations. Artefactual characteristics such as those discussed here may be diagnostic of toolmaking habits modified as a consequence of interrelated changes in the environment and social morphology.\n      </p>", "We studied the relation between occupation and oral and pharyngeal cancer with a population-based case-control study conducted in four areas of the United States. The study group included 1,114 incident male and female cases and 1,268 frequency-matched controls. After adjustment for age, race, smoking, alcohol, and study location, an analysis of lifetime occupational histories revealed a small number of noteworthy associations. Risk was increased among male carpet installers (23 cases, 4 controls), with an adjusted odds ratio of 7.7 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.4-24.9], and tended to rise with longer duration of employment. A decreased risk was found among male and female textile mill workers (odds ratio 0.48, 95% CI = 0.27-0.88). Previously reported increases in oral cancer risks among printing workers, electrical and electronics workers, and workers other than carpet installers who were possibly exposed to formaldehyde were not found in this study. For several employment groups, including male machinists, primary metal industry workers, petroleum industry workers, painters, furniture and fixture industry workers, woodworking machine operators, and workers with inferred exposure to fossil fuel combustion, odds ratios were approximately 2.0 for cancers of pharyngeal sites.\n      </p>"], "words": {"thomas": {"number": 1, "prob":
