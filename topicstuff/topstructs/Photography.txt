The aim of photography in plant tissue culture should be to illustrate clearly the developmental stages occurring in vitro. However, the photographic results presented in publications are often poor, and morphogenetic responses are often not clearly documented. Plant tissue culture is a very visual science, and the valuable tool of photography is often not used properly. If the morphogenetic responses are not well documented, an important part of the research is missed, and the report ends up having limited scientific value. Simple methods for improving the results of photography in plant tissue culture are discussed, along with photographic equipment, photomacrography, stereophotomicrography, suitable backgrounds for photography, use of a digital scanner, and the construction of photographic plates.\n      </p>", "Because of its perceived impracticality and expense, aerial photography from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) remains virtually unused as a rangeland management tool. This underuse suggested 2 objectives. The first was to develop a UAV from off-the-shelf components that could acquire low-altitude large-scale photography for rangeland documentation. The second was to assess the UAV flight characteristics. A remotely controlled UAV suitable for 35-mm photography was built in 56 hours at a cost of $1 480. In a 2-year test period, the UAV successfully completed 100+ sorties at elevations ranging from 10 m to 1 000 m above ground. The average distance required for takeoff is 18.2 m whereas landing requires an average of 22.5 m. Average UAV airspeed at takeoff is about $11.4\\ {\\rm m}\\cdot {\\rm s}^{-1}$ . Typical cruise speed during photograph acquisition is $13.8\\ {\\rm m}\\cdot {\\rm s}^{-1}$ , resulting in 6.9 mm of blur from forward-image motion. The UAV is an inexpensive tool for monitoring rangeland condition from an aerial perspective. It is currently being used to map squarrose knapweed (Centaurea virgata Lam. ssp. squarrosa Gugl.) density at several rangeland sites in Utah. /// Debido a que se percibe que la fotograf\u00eda a\u00e9rea obtenida de veh\u00edculos a\u00e9reos no tripulados (UVAs) es cara e impr\u00e1ctica, permanece virtualmente sin uso como una herramienta de manejo de los pastizales.

Hot-air and helium blimps have been developed and tested successfully in the field. Both provide stable platforms for lifting camera equipment in calm or low-wind conditions. The operating range for blimps overlaps that of kites, so a combination of a blimp and kites spans wind conditions from calm to 40 km/h. A helium blimp is smaller, substantially lower in cost, and easier to operate compared to a hot-air blimp with equivalent lifting capability. However, helium is not readily available in many regions, and in such places a hot-air blimp would be the only practical lighter-than-air platform for small-format aerial photography under low-wind conditions.\n      </p>", "Kite aerial photography (KAP) is a low-cost means to acquire large-scale, low-height, high-resolution aerial imagery. It is commonly practiced at low altitude for geological, environmental, and many other scientific applications. The method has been used much less at higher altitudes above 1000 m, however. We present examples of high-altitude KAP from the High Plains and Rocky Mountains in the United States and the Tatra Mountains in Slovakia and Poland. Based on these experiences, we find that KAP is feasible in the altitude range \u223c1000-2500 m, particularly for those places that are relatively open and have semiarid climates. Such sites include high plains, mountain forelands, and broad intermontane valleys. Mountains, in contrast, have more frequent cloud cover, experience highly variable wind, and often have poor access, which lead to more difficult KAP conditions. Above 2500 m altitude, low air density becomes a significant limitation for kite flying. High-altitude KAP is a means to portray landscape elements and details from vantage points that would be difficult or impossible to achieve by other methods of small-format aerial photography.\n      </p>", "We evaluated aerial photography (full coverage, using fixed-wing aircraft) and aerial video (transects, using helicopter) surveys to estimate the population of Laughing Gull (Larus atricilla) nests in Jamaica Bay, New York, during June 1992-1995. We counted 4,920 nests in the colony using aerial photography and estimated 5,367 nests using aerial video in 1992. In 1993-1995, we respectively counted 5,691, 5,095, and 6,126 nests in the colony using aerial photography, and estimated from ground plots that our counts differed from the actual number of nests by means of -9% to 1%. Overall (1993-1995) correction factors (by which to multiply the aerial photography nest counts) to estimate the mean and 95% lower and upper CI range of the nest population were 1.04, 0.96 and 1.13, respectively. Ninety-seven percent of nests identified using aerial photography or video had \u22651 adult Laughing Gull present or within 1 m of the nest. The aerial video survey was less expensive ($2,100 United States currency) than the aerial photography survey ($4,000). The estimated cost of a total count of nests from the ground is $6,700-$9,600. The aerial video survey provided an accurate estimate of the number of nests. Full-coverage aerial photography also provided an accurate estimate of nests in addition to habitat, nest distribution and nest density data.\n      </p>", "Cheyenne Bottoms is a Ramsar wetland site in central Kansas, where the Nature Conservancy (NC) has undertaken an effort since the mid-1990s to maintain and restore marsh and wet-meadow habitats for migrating shorebirds and waterfowl. Small-format aerial photography was conducted using kites and a helium blimp in order to document changing water and vegetation conditions during the years 2002-2005. Pictures were taken repeatedly throughout the growing seasons with various film and digital cameras from heights of 100-150 m. Invasive cattails (Typha sp.) are a major concern; the spread of cattail thickets during the 1990s reduced the open marshes on which migrating shorebirds depend for feeding. The NC adopted a strategy in which drought episodes are exploited for control of cattails. During our study, a drought cycle took place. Both color-visible and color-infrared images depict the impact of changing water level on cattails, which over the course of two years (2002 to 2004) were largely eliminated from the NC marshes. Dead cattail thickets were removed subsequently (mowing and burning), and these zones were restored into open marsh that supports beneficial emergent wetland vegetation--Scirpus, Eleocharis, Sagittaria, etc. Small-format aerial photography provided high-resolution, multi-view-angle imagery that depicts the consequences of NC management practices on marsh habitat conditions.\n      </p>", "X-ray photography permits nondestructive measurement of clutch size in gravid freshwater turtles. A primary advantage of this method over dissection is that intraindividual variation in size of subsequent clutches can be determined. The technique should be applicable to any species of egg-laying amniotic vertebrate.\n      </p>", "A simple method of aerial photography was used to investigate annual and between-year changes in surface cover of the floating-leaved plants, Nymphoides peltata, Nelumbo nucifera and Trapa natans, in natural stands in Lake Kasumigaura. Oblique photographs of vegetation were taken with a 35-mm camera with real color film from airplanes between 1983 and 1989. Vegetation maps were traced on the positions after projective transformation to vertical photography. The distribution of the stand of Nymphoides peltata seemed to be restricted to a region of less than 1.5 m water depth. A rise of 1.0 m in the water level after a typhoon in 1986 caused a subsequent decrease in vegetation area of Nelumbo nucifera. The vegetation recovered in shallower regions after one year in 1987. The expansion rate of Nymphoides peltata and Nelumbo nucifera in one direction was in the range 3.8-10.0 $\\text{m yr}^{-1}$ and 4.1-20.8 $\\text{m yr}^{-1}$ , respectively. Nelumbo nucifera, Nymphoides peltata and Trapa natans, having high leaf biomass to total biomass may therefore be more vulnerable to large flood and waves. Fluctuation in water level and spatial difference in water depth may also be important factors determining the vegetation area and survival of Nymphoides peltata, Nelumbo nucifera and Trapa natans.\n      </p>", "This paper examines the relevance of fashion photography as a source for the study of women's modernity in Germany between the wars as it focuses on the work of a fascinating and prolific professional photographer of the late 1920s and early 1930s-Else Neul\u00e4nder Simon-known by her artistic name Yva. Yva discovered her own unique visual language somewhere between the commercial clich\u00e9s and the modernist idioms of her time. As a successful professional photographer, she continuously searched for an image of the woman in fashion and advertisement photography that was not reductive and degrading. In an era when images of the woman as a sexual symbol were dominating mass media and were proven to attract customers, Yva positioned her photographed female model in a way that did not diminish her to a mere eye-catcher for the male spectator.\n      </p>", "For the only perspectival view of the Biblioth\u00e8que Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve he drew for publication in a professional magazine, Henri Labrouste traced a photograph commissioned for that purpose. Taken in 1852 by the Bisson Fr\u00e8res, the image is very likely the first commissioned photograph of a contemporary building as well as the firm\u2019s first architectural photograph. This use of photography as a template in the architectural representation of a contemporary building predates by almost twenty years what later became common practice. Labrouste\u2019s deployment of a mechanical interface in drawing mirrors his use of exposed iron in the building itself and carries with it many of the same implications regarding the search for a modern, realistic, and industrialized form of expression.

Those improvements can be achieved in two areas: firstly, the area of objective and consistent shoreline recognition and secondly in the area of accurate georeferencing of the detected line. From the possible lines, the High Water Line (HWL) is most clearly represented in the photographs by a line of high brightness gradient. Three different enhancement and filtering techniques were utilized for the detection of the HWL. A combination of two of the methods provided an optimal detection methodology. The improvement in the area of georeferencing was achieved by mainly the increase in the number and accuracy of the control points relative to manual methods./// Les techniques d'analyse digitale des images appliquees a la digitalisation de photographies aeriennes permet d'ameliorer signifi-cativement la detection des processus littoraux.

Portraits seek to render the subjective objectively visible. In portraiture two fundamental aims come into conflict: the revelatory aim of faithfulness to the subject, and the creative aim of artistic expression. In the first part of my paper, studying works by Rembrandt, I develop a typology of four different things that can be meant when speaking of an image's power to show a person: accuracy, testimony of presence, emotional characterization, or revelation of the essential \"air\" (to use Roland Barthes' term). In the second half of my paper this typology is applied to examples from painting and photography to explore how the two media might differ.

Through readings of works of art and social activism that make use of lynching photographs, this essay considers ways in which photography has functioned as a technology of memory for African Americans, what the essay calls critical black memory, and proffers a mode of historical interpretation that both plays upon and questions photography's documentary capacity. The essay makes two claims specifically. First, the mechanical reproduction of lynching by way of the photograph has been central to the recounting and reconstitution of black political cultures throughout the Jim Crow and post-Civil Rights era. From the usage of lynching photography in pamphlets by early twentieth-century anti-lynching activists, to posters created by mid-century civil rights organizations, to their deployment in contemporary art and popular culture, this archive has been a constitutive element of black visuality more broadly. Second, African American engagements with photography as a \"site of memory\" suggest a mode of historical interpretation in which African Americans simultaneously critique the \"truth-claims\" of photography while they mobilize the medium's documentary capacity to intervene in the classification and subjugation of black life.\n      </p>", "The size and distribution of measurement errors associated with major techniques for estimating numbers of hibernating bats are unstudied, although this is the principle method of enumerating several endangered bat species. However, decisions concerning the listing status of a species under the Endangered Species Act require consistent and accurate estimation of population size and trends. Recent advances in digital photography have improved the ability to produce a quantitative record of the numbers of bats in hibernacula. We surveyed clusters of Indiana bats in a hibernaculum and compared results from counts of digital photographs of clusters to results from 4 variations of visual estimation. We counted bats in photographs using Geographic Information System digitization over the photograph. Total counts from 2 sets of photographs varied by &lt;1.5%. Nonphotographic estimation techniques varied from 76% to 142% of counts from photographs for clusters for which estimation (rather than counting) was used. Where feasible, photography can improve status and trend information for species of concern, permitting more timely and specific management actions.\n      </p>", "With advances in computer technology, the use of hemispherical photography to assess forest canopy cover and understory light environments has become increasingly simplified. Numerous investigators have utilized this technique and employed various protocols for photo acquisition. Several studies have noted the potential for subjective bias at various stages throughout the procedure. However, it remains unclear as to what influence either the identity of the investigator or camera height may have on the outcome of the analysis. Based on considerations derived from the literature, we evaluated two aspects of the hemispherical photography technique (camera height and experimenter error) to determine if decisions made at various points in the process contribute additional variance that may ultimately affect the interpretation or comparability of studies. The first consideration was camera height. A variety of camera heights have been used in the literature. We found no significant differences (P &gt; 0.50) in either estimates of percent open sky or available global radiation obtained at heights of either 30 or 150 cm in a mixed oak forest in southern Ohio. The second consideration was to assess how different experimenters analyzed the same set of hemispherical photographs. We found no significant differences among ten experimenter's measures of either percent open sky or available global radiation (P &gt; 0.75). Based on our results, we feel more confident about the comparison of results from independent studies done by different investigators using a variety of photo acquisition protocols.\n      </p>", "With the increasing popularity of remote photography in wildlife research, a large variety of equipment and methods is available to researchers. To evaluate advantages and disadvantages of using various types of equipment for different study objectives, we reviewed 107 papers that used either time-lapse or animal-triggered photography to study vertebrates in the field. Remote photography was used primarily to study avian nest predation, feeding ecology, and nesting behavior; additional applications included determining activity patterns, presence-absence monitoring, and estimating population parameters. Using time-lapse equipment is most appropriate when animals occur frequently in the photographic frame, the activity of interest occurs repeatedly, or no distinct event occurs to trigger a camera. In contrast, animal-triggered (light or mechanically triggered) systems are appropriate when events occur infrequently or unpredictably and there is a great likelihood that a trigger will be activated. Remote photography can be less time consuming, costly, and invasive than traditional research methods for many applications. However, researchers should be prepared to invest time and money troubleshooting problems with remote camera equipment, be aware of potential effects of equipment on animal behavior, and recognize the limitations of data collected with remote photography equipment.\n      </p>", "\"Straight\" and \"queer\" are key terms in American photographic discourse: \"straight\" served as the central concept of camera work between the 1920s and the 1960s, whereas \"queer\" photography questioned and challenged straight standards in the late twentieth century.

This piece explores the early years of \"straight\"; it contrasts the representation of cross-dressers by \"straight artists\" Weegee, Lisette Model, and Diane Arbus, and by queer photography's representatives, Nan Goldin and Mark Morrisroe.

In the last 20 years, the social role of photography has shifted: from origins in scopic regimes that racialized and dispossessed Aboriginal peoples to an era of contemporary reappropriation, recontextualizing colonial archives, and producing new Indigenous high art photography. Photographs are no longer stable, visible testimony of Indigenous peoples' presumed imminent decline or innate savagery but are, rather, colonial objectifications now available for resignification as evidence of kinship networks, land claims, and local knowledge systems. In July 2006, two exhibitions were spearheading these important transitions. \"Colliding Worlds\" opened at Melbourne Museum, and \"Michael Riley: Sights Unseen\" premiered at the National Gallery of Australia (NGA) in Canberra. Together, these exhibitions destabilize historical legacies of the visual in Australia's national imaginary, resignifying photography as a medium of new knowledge production, aesthetic expression, and social change.\n      </p>", "This article traces the evolution of food photography through the lens of its political context. The ways in which prop stylists and food stylists defined food photography trends was guided by more than their unique interpretation of assigned art direction. The political zeitgeist was also a guiding force. From the socially conservative leadership during the Reagan/Bush years to the promises of hope and change defining the Obama presidency\u2014the tenor of each administration left its mark on food photography.\n         During the Reagan/Bush years, legislation favored the moneyed classes; food photography reflected the tastes of a culture rife with opulent excess. Food was presented in fantastical sets propped with precious accoutrements, some having hardly anything at all to do with the eating or serving of food. The Clinton administration's pro-family domestic agenda set the cultural tone for Martha Stewart's ascendency and for her magazine's visual message to endure. Both Clinton and Stewart brought us back to the real world. Food sets became whiter and brighter as prop stylists jettisoned intricately detailed props for those with cleaner, simpler lines. The muddled disinformation fed to us during the George W. Bush years played out in the confusing, tumultuous compositions proliferating Gourmet's food photography during his presidency. Yellow, the color of hope and promise, cast its hue on the food pages of magazines at the onset of Obama's presidency; but just as he chose to address policymaking by embracing a myriad of viewpoints, so too did magazines embrace a mix of visual viewpoints to please their readers. What we were left with, on both fronts, was an all-over-the-place quality lacking clear definition.\n         Photographs from Gourmet, Food &amp; Wine, Bon Apetit, Weight Watcher's Magazine, Woman's Day and Fine Cooking serve as visual reference points.\n      </p>", "James Clifford's 1981 essay 'On Ethnographic Surrealism', which proposed an intimate connection between surrealism and ethnography in Paris in the early thirties, has resulted in much debate. The present text considers the place of photography in that debate in two ways. Firstly, the essay traces the placement of photographs of Dogon masks (taken by Marcel Griaule on the Dakar-Djibouti expedition of 1931-33) in a number of sites--on display in the Mus\u00e9e de l'Homme, in Griaule's book Masques dogons (1938), in the Surrealist-oriented magazine Minotaure (1933), and finally in Michel Leiris's L'Afrique fant\u00f4me (1934). In each site, the meaning of the image shifts, with Leiris in particular investing it with elements of extreme subjectivity. In the second part of the essay, this 'surrealist ethnography' is related to the 'surrealist documentary' of the same period, as exemplified by Andr\u00e9 Breton's Nadja (1928) and the photographs and films of Brassa\u00ef, Eli Lotar, Jean Painlev\u00e9 and Luis Bu\u00f1uel.

En premier lieu, l'article examine la localisation des photos de masques dogons prises par Marcel Griaule au cours de la Mission Dakar-Djibouti (1931-33) dans certains sites: le Mus\u00e9e de l'Homme, le livre de Griaule, Masques dogons (1938), la revue d'inspiration surr\u00e9aliste, Minotaure (1933) et enfin L'Afrique fant\u00f4me (1934) de Michel Leiris. Dans chaque site, le sens des images se modifie, en particulier dans le livre de Leiris o\u00f9 elles sont investies d'une subjectivit\u00e9 exacerb\u00e9e. Dans la seconde partie de l'article, cette \"ethnographie surr\u00e9aliste\" est mise en rapport avec l' \"imagerie surr\u00e9aliste\" de la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode, telle qu'elle est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Nadja (1928) d'Andr\u00e9 Breton ainsi que par les photographies et les films de Brassa\u00ef, Eli Lotar, Jean Painlev\u00e9 et Luis Bu\u00f1uel. Enfin, on s'interroge sur la signification que peuvent rev\u00eatir ces pratiques pour une ethnographie ou un usage de l'image post-modernes.\n      </p>", "The success of monitoring programs often is determined by the ability to detect short-term changes in ecological systems that are occurring at fine scales of resolution. Here we describe a blimp system to acquire low-altitude aerial photography and videography useful for evaluating fine-scale patterns in rangeland communities. The tethered blimp served as a portable and economical platform capable of lofting still and video camera equipment to an altitude of 122 m above the earth's surface. The system was an effective tool to monitor rangeland vegetation, providing a compromise between ground-based methods of data collection and fixed-wing or satellite remote sensing.\n      </p>", "The Swedish turret for vertical photography is a little known but valuable device for establishing excavation controls and discovering alignments, patterns and relationships not readily discernible from the ground.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Many shorebirds are associated with regions of high coastal zone productivity, which may contribute to high prey abundance. Chlorophyll levels of primary producers contribute to the red tones of an infrared photograph. The hue of an infrared photograph was positively related to the chlorophyll concentration of the sediment surface across all sites. However, invertebrate density was not strongly related to surficial sediment chlorophyll concentration or photograph hue. The color infrared photography method is useful to quickly assess the surficial sediment concentration of the phytobenthos, but of low value to estimate invertebrate prey densities.\n      </p>", "The status of photographs as keystones of historical explanation has become a topic of urgent intellectual and cultural interest around the world, at the same time as methods of shaping historical narratives are also changing in ways that compel attention to the employment of photographs in historiography. By exposing the questions we ought to raise about all historical evidence, photographs reveal not simply the potential and limits of photography as a historical source, but the potential and limits of all historical sources and historical inquiry as an intellectual project. As the papers in this issue make apparent, this is precisely the promise and ultimate potential of the historical study of photographs\u2014that it pushes their interpreters to the limits of historical analysis.

CIR, video, and HHR detected 48%, 42% and 36%, respectively, of the injured crop area as defined by visual evaluation (injury ratings &gt;0 on a scale of 0 to 9). The remote techniques were unable to differentiate crop injury that did not involve the entire plant canopy. Reflectance measurements in the visible red (R) (630-690 nm) and NIR (760-900 nm) wavelengths were taken and used in herbicide dosage prediction equations. Predicted herbicide dosages were significantly, positively correlated (P\u22640.01) with physical measures of herbicide present. These studies suggest that remote detection and mapping of moderate and severe herbicide injury is possible. Further, NIR videography, with near-real-time capability and low cost may be the system of choice for this type of application.\n      </p>", "Salt cedar (Tamarix ramosissima Ledeb.) is a small shrubby tree that is taking over wetland and riparian habitats in the western United States. Biocontrol experiments are underway based on the Chinese leaf-eating beetle, Diorhabda elongata deserticola, as a means for controlling salt cedar. Kite aerial photography and ground observations were conducted in 2003 to document the effects of beetle biocontrol on salt cedar at the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation study site near Pueblo, Colorado. High-resolution August images provided clear visual evidence of salt cedar defoliation by beetles, and the images were suitable for quantitative analysis. This approach could be employed successfully to monitor other types of biocontrol study sites.\n      </p>", "Despite its growing popularity as a method across the social sciences, the methodological literature on auto-photography is remarkably sparse. In an effort to begin redressing this gap, this paper provides an account of the ways in which auto-photography was used to complement other research methods in a (re) examination of the geographies of homelessness. It describes how auto-photography illuminated 'hidden' spaces that do not typically feature in public (or academic) imaginations of homelessness, and provided more nuanced understandings of the use, meanings and dynamics associated with other, apparently already 'known' spaces. It concludes that whilst auto-photography presents a number of logistical and ethical challenges\u2013particularly when used with such a vulnerable group\u2013it is nevertheless a powerful heuristic tool.\n      </p>", "Owen Clayton, \"London Eyes: William Dean Howells and the Shift to Instant Photography\"(pp. 374\u2013394)\n         Toward the end of the nineteenth century, one of William Dean Howells's many avid readers, finally meeting him in the flesh, expressed surprise that the famed writer was not dead. Although he had not actually departed from the world, it was true that by this time the venerable \"Dean\"was at a low ebb. While younger authors were taking the novel in directions about which he was, at the least, ambivalent, Howells was aware that his own best work was behind him. Yet, throughout his career, he maintained a desire to test different literary approaches. In England in 1904, Howells tested a conceit that would allow him to keep pace with the literary movements of the day. This consisted of an extended photographic metaphor: an association of himself with the Kodak camera. He used this figuration to move beyond the philosophical foundations of his previous work. Criticism has largely overlooked this endeavor, which Howells buried away in the somewhat obscure travelogue London Films (1905). This essay shows how London Films used its photographic metaphor to question positivistic observational assumptions, the way in which this was a response to William James's Essays in Radical Empiricism (1912), and, finally, why Howells ultimately went back on his attempt to create a Kodak school in fiction.\n      </p>", "First Nations children and youth in Canada are often portrayed as passive or suffering victims. This field report presents the research project, Photography as a Talking Stick, in which more than 60 children and youth from the Innu community of Uashat mak Mani-Utenam in Quebec, Canada participated. The main finding of this collaborative photography research suggests that, while certainly experiencing and recognizing difficulties in their lives, when asked to document what they like and dislike in their community, the participants mainly chose to photograph and comment on positive aspects of their lives. The relational nature of the annotated photographs and the editorial choices of the participants highlights the responsibility of both mass media and academic literature to balance their reporting with young people's input. The concept of empowerment is expanded to include the project's impacts on the researcher and audience, as well as the participants themselves.\n      </p>", "Conservation and management of snow leopards (Uncia uncia) has largely relied on anecdotal evidence and presence-absence data due to their cryptic nature and the difficult terrain they inhabit. These methods generally lack the scientific rigor necessary to accurately estimate population size and monitor trends. We evaluated the use of photography in capture-mark-recapture (CMR) techniques for estimating snow leopard population abundance and density within Hemis National Park, Ladakh, India. We placed infrared camera traps along actively used travel paths, scent-sprayed rocks, and scrape sites within 16- to &lt;tex-math&gt;$30\\text{-}{\\rm km}^{2}$&lt;/tex-math&gt; sampling grids in successive winters during January and March 2003-2004. We used head-on, oblique, and side-view camera configurations to obtain snow leopard photographs at varying body orientations. We calculated snow leopard abundance estimates using the program CAPTURE. We obtained a total of 66 and 49 snow leopard captures resulting in 8.91 and 5.63 individuals per 100 trap-nights during 2003 and 2004, respectively. We identified snow leopards based on the distinct pelage patterns located primarily on the forelimbs, flanks, and dorsal surface of the tail. Capture probabilities ranged from 0.33 to 0.67. Density estimates ranged from 8.49 (SE = 0.22) individuals per 100 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 2003 to 4.45 (SE = 0.16) in 2004. We believe the density disparity between years is attributable to different trap density and placement rather than to an actual decline in population size. Our results suggest that photographic capture-mark-recapture sampling may be a useful tool for monitoring demographic patterns. However, we believe a larger sample size would be necessary for generating a statistically robust estimate of population density and abundance based on CMR models.\n      </p>", "This article explores the significance of the material practices of photography and its archiving in interpretive approaches to the relationship between photographs and history. Drawing on work in material culture studies in anthropology and on the concept of \"material hermeneutic,\" it argues that photographs should not be understood only through forensic and semiotic analysis of content, but as objects that constitute material performances of a complex range of historiographical desires in the negotiation of the relations among past, present, and future. The analysis is grounded in an exploration of the material practices of the photographic survey movement in England between 1885 and 1918. This loosely cohered group of amateur photographers recorded a historical topography of ancient churches, cottages, passing events, and folk customs in order to create a photographic record for the benefit of future generations. As such it was a self-conscious statement of \"popular historicism.\" The members' concern for key values of permanence and accuracy, expressed through the detail of photographic and archival processes, reveals the ways in which cultural loss and photographic loss become mutually sustaining metaphors for each other, and in which the photographs themselves are material markers of both evidential value and of an affective historical imagination.\n      </p>", "Productive ground cover (PGC) is often used as a measure of sward health and persistence. To measure PGC, a camera stand was constructed to provide diffuse lighting of grass swards for color digital photography; the photographs were classified into productive and nonproductive cover using Mahalanobis distance. The PGC measurement techniques were tested on a grazing experiment that used four forage types: Lakota prairie grass (Bromus catharticus Vahl.), Kentucky 31 endophyte (Neotyphodium coenophialum)-free tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum [Schreb.] S. J. Darbyshire), Kentucky 31 endophyte-infected tall fescue, and Quantum (novel-endophyte) tall fescue. The accuracy of the PGC maps was assessed using a stratified subsample of 48 images, 12 from each of four productive cover classes (0%-39%, 40%-59%, 60%-79%, and 80%-100%). On each of these 48 images 100 random points were labeled by a single skilled interpreter. The PGC percentages thus derived had an 83.7% agreement with the PGC maps. However, the percentages derived from the PGC maps were not well correlated with the PGC percentages derived from either ocular estimation (r = 0.22) or a simple digital point quadrat method (r = 0.47). This experiment highlights the potential for semiautomated classification of ground-based digital photographs for estimating PGC, though further research (including more direct comparison with established field techniques) is warranted. /// La cobertura basal (productiva PGC) a menudo es usada para medir la persistencia y salud de la pradera.

Scanned aerial photographs were digitally processed by various remote sensing methods, such as histogram equalization, principal component transformation, Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, and classification (both unsupervised, i.e., Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique, and supervised, i.e., Parallelepiped and Maximum Likelihood algorithm). The results were geometrically corrected by registration into orthophoto images. Field data from 1991 assisted in class labelling and vegetation description. A detailed vegetation analysis was conducted using 1989 multispectral photographs since the field-verification and comparison to ground-based vegetation map could be done with only two-year difference. The unsupervised classification resulted in six classes (three of them mixed) with a 60.6% overall accuracy of unmixed classes. Some important vegetation types could not be separated. The supervised classification resulted in nine classes with the overall accuracy of 81.1%. The most common vegetation types were: mat-grass communities (40.4% of the total area) and tall grass and herb communities (23.1%). Pine stands, the best separated of vegetation types, were evaluated on the multispectral photographs from 1986 and 1997 and the P. mugo stands doubled in area over 10 years. The aerial-photograph based maps were compared with an available vegetation map obtained by a field survey. The correspondence between both ranged from 24-75%, with the highest values obtained for pine stands and mat-grass communities. In comparison to the field survey, aerial photography provided less detail and vegetation was characterized mostly by dominant species. The approach failed to map small patches of heterogeneous or atypical vegetation and to differentiate vegetation types with dominants of similar appearance. Nevertheless since this method is comparably less time- and labour-consuming, it seems suitable for mapping distinct vegetation types, surveying larger areas and identifying changes over time.\n      </p>", "Digital photography and subsequent image analysis for ground-cover measurements can increase sampling rate and measurement speed and probably can increase measurement accuracy.

The paper operates from the premise that photography is a technology of visualization that both draws on and establishes a visual economy through which events and issues are materialized in particular ways. This allows the paper to pose questions and develop understandings about Mofokeng's work in terms of the way certain factors coalesced to enable a particular representation of black South Africans in the global image economy. Central to this is the role of assumptions about exposure and visibility in relation to violence, assumptions that Mofokeng's work, as a critique of conventional documentary work, explicitly contests. In exploring the invisibility of everyday life, Mofokeng expands notions of documentary photography and photojournalism. This paper demonstrates this point by connecting Mofokeng's work to a contemporary controversy in European photojournalism to highlight how a more complex understanding of documentary photography is necessary.\n      </p>", "The author points out that there are three important ways in which photographs have been used in the plastic fine arts: (1) as a source of reference in making art objects, especially paintings, (2) as components incorporated in art objects and (3) as documentary records of art works.

The effects of fetal bovine serum, insulin and hydrocortisone were analyzed. Quantitative characterization documented dome diameter (mode diameter 0.26 to 0.52 mm), dome area occupied (average 23%, maximum 38.7%), and density (average $78 domes per cm^2$ , maximum $117 domes per cm^2$ ) for standard culture conditions. Insulin and hydrocortisone had a primary effect on dome density whereas 15% fetal bovine serum had a minimal effect. However, insulin and hydrocortisone had a synergistic optimal effect on dome population. Time-lapse cinematography revealed that the dome population is not static, but a very dynamic one. Domes underwent irregular pulsations of expansion and contraction. Dome enlargement was either by a series of expansions and contractions, by lateral involvement of other cells, or by coalescence of two or more domes. Domes have been considered to be the in vitro counterpart of the in vivo acinus of the mouse mammary gland. However, quantitative dome population characterization has not been available.

Our goal has been to develop equipment and techniques for infrared kite aerial photography. Attempting to conduct infrared photography from kites has proven to be a considerable challenge for several reasons. Among the most important limitations are those inherent in infrared film and conventional cameras. Infrared film has no ISO speed rating, and camera light meters do not measure infrared energy in the scene. Furthermore, KAP equipment should be relatively compact, rugged, light weight, and inexpensive. We have designed, built, and field tested two KAP rigs based on the Canon EOS RebelX camera, which is a 35-mm, full-featured, SLR camera. Our first rig is a dual-camera setup, in which the cameras take simultaneous color-visible and color-infrared photographs. This rig has radio control of the camera shutters. Camera tilt and pan positions are set manually prior to each flight. The second rig is for a single camera (color-infrared only); the rig has full radio control for pan, tilt, and shutter. The dual-camera rig weighs 1.5 kg, and the single-camera rig is just over 1 kg. Based on considerable field testing, we have determined appropriate manual light settings under full-sun conditions--1/250 shutter speed and f-9.5 aperture. Our preliminary results suggest that infrared KAP may be valuable for detailed investigations of vegetation, soils, and other environmental features.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Through exploring the visual effects of three-dimensional (3D) montage, he came to construct photo-objects and photo-installations. He regards photography as a tool of preliminary design, which refers not only to the production of objects, but also to the creation of a situation or a visual trick documented by the camera. After a series of kinetic compositions with light, he came to the conclusion that light needs to be structured (by means of lenses, masks, etc.) in order to create further visually interesting transformations through motion, colour and overlay.\n      </p>", "This paper is in four main sections each dealing with some aspect of photography as it applies to expeditions. The first section is a discussion of the role of the photographer, his selection and his pre-expedition tasks. There follows a brief account of some of the points to be borne in mind when choosing photographic equipment. Section three is in six parts, each dealing with a particular environment and the problems it poses for the photographer. The choice of environments includes those most likely to give problems, namely the humid tropics, arid tropics, coastal locations, cold environments, mountain locations, caves. The final section discusses the sale of an expedition's photography and the ways in which photographs can be looked upon as a valuable source of income.\n      </p>", "This is a review essay covering three recent books related to representations of farm labor in California: Richard Steven Street, Everyone Had Cameras: Photography and Farmworkers in California, 1850\u20132000 (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2008); Jan Goggans, California on the Breadlines: Dorothea Lange, Paul Taylor, and the Making of a New Deal Narrative (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2010); Rick Nahmias, The Migrant Project: Contemporary California Farm Workers (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 2008).\n      </p>", "The Photographic Library of the Council of Industrial Design now forms part of the Design Council Archive at the University of Brighton. This essay examines the early years of the Library concentrating on the reasons for its formation and the acquisition, classification and distribution of photography. I argue that the Council's dependence on photography was bound up in its wish to promote a particular formalist point of view that manifested itself in the reproduction of industrial design by photographic means. The Council promoted a 'way of seeing' as much as the industrially designed products it represented and photography became the key currency in this process, providing evidence of the Council's mediation between manufacturers and consumers.\n      </p>", "A simple photographic instrument and a universal stage, both for employment in the photography of microfossils, are described and illustrated.\n      </p>", "Quantitative assessment of vegetation change is often conducted by digitally analyzing time series of aerial or vertical photography. Change analysis conducted using repeated oblique or landscape photography, however, has been limited to qualitative assessments. The purpose of this study was to develop sampling and analysis techniques for using a time series of digitized landscape photography to quantify vegetation change on rangeland landscapes. Digital images were created from black-and-white landscape photographs acquired in 1917, 1962, and 2000 near Whiskey Mountain in the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed of southwestern Idaho. Images were spatially registered to each other using control points and a polynomial transformation algorithm. Thirty random pixels along each of 30 random image lines were selected as point samples (n = 900) from within each image. The landscape feature represented in each selected pixel was classified into 1 of 15 cover types. Cover-type classification accuracy for the 2000 image was estimated to be 92.2% based on ground-truth data collected in the field. Classification accuracy was increased to 98.9% by combining rare or poorly separable cover-type classes. Image cover of vegetation cover types was quantified for each photography acquisition date. Changes in image cover of each cover type and direction of cover-type conversions were determined for each intervening time period. Analysis of image cover using repeated landscape photography is constrained by limitations imposed by oblique view angles and variable image quality. Repeat landscape photography, however, can be used to quantitatively assess long-term dynamics of vegetation cover on rangeland landscapes with visually distinct vegetation types. /// La evaluaci\u00f3n cuantitativa del cambio de la vegetaci\u00f3n a menudo es conducida por el an\u00e1lisis digital de series de tiempo de fotograf\u00edas a\u00e9reas o verticales. El an\u00e1lisis de cambio usando fotograf\u00eda oblicua repetida o de paisaje ha estado limitada a evaluaciones cualitativas. El prop\u00f3sito de este estudio fue desarrollar t\u00e9cnicas de muestreo y an\u00e1lisis para usar series de tiempo de fotograf\u00edas de paisaje digitalizadas para cuantificar el cambio de vegetaci\u00f3n en paisajes de pastizal. Se crearon im\u00e1genes digitales partir de fotograf\u00edas de paisaje en blanco y negro adquiridas en 1917, 1962 y 2000 cerca de la monta\u00f1a Whiskey en la Cuenca Hidrol\u00f3gica Experimental Reynolds Creek en el suroeste de Idaho. Las im\u00e1genes fueron registradas espacialmente una de otra usando puntos de control y un algoritmo de transformaci\u00f3n polinomial. Como puntos de muestreo dentro de cada imagen se seleccionaron aleatoriamente 30 pixeles a lo largo de cada una de 30 l\u00edneas de imagen aleatorias (n = 900). La caracter\u00edstica del paisaje representada en cada p\u00edxel seleccionado fue clasificada dentro de 1 de 15 tipos de cobertura. La exactitud de la clasificaci\u00f3n por tipo de cobertura para las 2000 im\u00e1genes fue estimada en 92.2%, basada en datos verdaderos colectados en campo. La exactitud de la clasificaci\u00f3n aument\u00f3 a 98.9% al combinar clases de tipo de cobertura raras o pobremente separables. La imagen de cobertura de los tipos de cobertura de vegetaci\u00f3n fueron cuantificados para cada fecha de adquisici\u00f3n de las fotograf\u00edas. Los cambios en la imagen de cobertura de cada tipo de cobertura y la direcci\u00f3n de las conversiones de tipo de cobertura fueron determinadas en cada per\u00edodo de tiempo que intervino. El an\u00e1lisis de las im\u00e1genes de cobertura usando la fotograf\u00eda repetida del paisaje esta restringido por limitaciones impuestas por el \u00e1ngulos de vista oblicuos y la calidad variable de la imagen. Sin embargo, la fotograf\u00eda repetida de paisaje puede ser usada para evaluar cuantitativamente las din\u00e1micas a largo plazo de la cobertura de vegetaci\u00f3n de los paisajes de pastizal con tipos de vegetaci\u00f3n visualmente distintos.\n      </p>", "Kite aerial photography (KAP) is a means to acquire large-scale, highly detailed imagery for various environmental applications. Previous color-infrared KAP was developed for film-based cameras, but is now effectively obsolete. The authors have built a KAP rig and field tested a digital color-infrared camera, the Tetracam ADC, which produces results that are generally comparable with color-infrared film photography. Field testing was conducted at the Cheyenne Bottoms Preserve of The Nature Conservancy in central Kansas. The resulting images are high-contrast photographs that depict emergent vegetation in bright red-pink colors and show water bodies nearly black, as would be expected in color-infrared imagery. Color-visible digital cameras produce better apparent spatial resolution, whereas the Tetracam ADC camera provides an extended spectral range into the near-infrared. For detailed environmental field investigations involving kite aerial photography, a combination of color-visible and color-infrared cameras is recommended for improved results overall.\n      </p>", "The current abundance of scholarship concerning the technological development of photography has coexisted with a proportionate absence of recent critical analysis of photographic images. Given photography's long-standing embrace of technological advances, even predating the portable camera or roll film, this article revisits some early uses of scientific photography in order to clarify the impact of digital technology on contemporary photographic practice. The author uses scientific photography and photographic archives as the groundwork for photographic experiments into what might be called analytical photography.
