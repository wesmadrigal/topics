This article introduces a competing values approach as a conceptual framework for identifying e-government value and describing potential e-government effectiveness models: organizational learning, digital democracy, information security, and cost efficiency. Using data from a survey of South Korean public officials, this article identifies e-government values as perceived by public officials. This research also analyzes public officials' perceptions of partial failures in their e-government efforts and appropriate consequences for failing to achieve e-government goals.

The purpose is to determine the types of initiatives and investments in IT and related capacity building public agencies should emphasize to increase the performance of their e-government initiatives. This research begins by discussing seven internal IT capacity factors and then examines relevant research questions and hypotheses. Based on a content analysis of interview transcripts, the article examines the relationship between IT capacity and e-government performance and discusses implications for further research.\n      </p>", "We describe the increasing importance of UK Civil Government OR and explore possible reasons for its expansion.

Specifically, it examines whether being in the majority translates into more positive attitudes toward government than being in the minority. Using surveys conducted by the International Social Survey Project (ISSP) in 12 democracies in 1996, it finds that being in the majority generally translates into more positive attitudes toward government. However, this effect is not of uniform magnitude across countries, nor does it affect all attitudes toward government equally. Specifically, the data show that being in the political majority or minority strongly affects attitudes toward the performance of the political system and the power of government, but does not affect people's levels of political efficacy in systematic ways. /// Les auteurs comparent l'effet du statut soit majoritaire soit minoritaire sur l'attitude envers le gouvernement dans les nouvelles d\u00e9mocraties et dans les d\u00e9mocraties \u00e9tablies.

Stage I is the cataloging of information online and Stage II the completion of transactions online. This article empirically derives and tests indices of the development of local governments in these stages along with the e-government relationships being either Government to Citizen (G2C), Government to Business (G2B), or Government to Government (G2G). This two-stage model is applied to data from an e-government survey. Some of the results indicate that local governments in Stage II (transaction phase) have the following attributes: a council-manager form of government, located in the Western U.S., having populations greater than 250,000, having separate IT departments, and benefit from e-government in, for example, reducing administrative costs. Barriers such as privacy and security limit e-government growth.\n      </p>", "The conventional wisdom in public opinion research suggests that the white public views government spending as a single race-coded issue. This article develops an alternative theory that rests on two propositions. First, the white public sees government spending not as a single issue, but rather, as two distinct issues: spending on the deserving poor and spending on the undeserving poor. Second, political sophistication strengthens the impact racial stereotypes have on attitudes toward spending on the undeserving poor, and it does not affect the relationship between stereotypes and attitudes toward spending on the deserving poor. These hypotheses are tested using data from the 1996 and 1992 NES surveys. The empirical results provide strong support for both propositions.\n      </p>", "This paper uses grounded theory to explore internal (intrafirm) conflicts in the formulation of business-government strategies by corporations with diversified business units. We find that three types of conflict exist within firms: conflict over proactive policy positions advocated by the firm (prepolicy issues), conflict over reactive internal distribution of compliance costs/benefits (postpolicy issues), and representational conflict (e.g., individual business units vs. corporate representation in the external public policy arena). We also develop a grounded framework for organizational structures for conflict resolution in the strategic management of government relations, based upon our case studies, and find a relationship between particular structures and the degree of diversification.\n      </p>", "A model is presented in which individuals can vote over government subsidies to a private good and over redistributive taxation. The subsidized good is purchased and shared by couples who act noncooperatively, while possibly being altruistic towards each other. The framework allows a separation of the subsidy policy from redistributive policy. In a majority voting equilibrium the subsidy is used exclusively to correct the individuals' spending pattern. The results suggest that spending on private goods should be an important item in government expenditures when there is strong positive income bias in the political process and/or when household decisions are relatively inefficient.\n      </p>", "This study offers both an analytical framework of and empirical evidence on the key management strategies and capacities for successful information technology (IT) outsourcing by public agencies. The analytical framework draws insights from studies on IT and public administration, public sector contracting out, and business information systems and IT outsourcing. Using the framework, the research examines IT outsourcing at three federal agencies. Data were collected through interviews and document review, which were analyzed using the variable-oriented comparative case method. In general, this study confirms the importance of management and capacity building in IT outsourcing. Moreover, the results offer specific guidance on IT outsourcing. First, public agencies need to take a long-term, strategic approach to managing IT outsourcing arrangements. Second, IT outsourcing should be considered a managed relationship rather than a traditional procurement. Last, the use of performance measurement with a service-level agreement is an important ingredient for successful IT outsourcing.\n      </p>", "This article presents a basic conceptual framework for investigating the relations among government performance, citizen satisfaction, and trust. It then reviews results from a number of previous empirical studies by the author and other investigators that shed light on specific linkages suggested by the framework.

Implications for public managment, including the need for more citizen-driven measures of government performance, are discussed.\n      </p>", "Public sector reforms often focus on high impact agencies to restore trust in government and in public administration. Using an in-person survey on citizens' attitudes toward public services, we test what public agencies contribute to citizens' general image of government. We show that general measures of satisfaction with the functioning of public services contain more than just an evaluation of bureaucratic encounters; political factors influence this assessment. Specific evaluations of service quality can differ substantially from attitudes toward public services at large. Therefore, low trust in government, a negative attitude toward public administration at large, and a positive image of many specific public services may coexist.\n      </p>", "E-government services have become increasingly common and more sophisticated among governments in the United States. These services are often purchased from private vendors, as public managers seek to be innovative and entrepreneurial. A record of cost overruns and failures, however, suggests that public managers may not always have the appropriate capability to successfully deploy e-government services. One means of increasing this capability is through acquisition processes known as competitive negotiations. Through negotiating with private vendors before and after contract award, public managers can obtain needed expertise in areas of system requirements, design, and implementation. Two case studies involving the use of the state of Florida's invitation to negotiate purchasing process are discussed to illustrate how managerial capability can be increased when purchasing e-government services.\n      </p>", "This article outlines the concept of u-government.

After observing widespread corruption and misuse of relief aid by the Bangladesh government in 1974 and subsequent years, external sources began to channellize emergency assistance to the victims through NGOs. Realizing that NGOs were usurping its authority over external disaster assistance, the government looked for opportunities to demonstrate its ability to deliver services to victims. An opportunity came in July 1998 when Bangladesh experienced a devastating flood. Using data collected from 348 households in 11 villages, this paper compares support received by the respondents from the Bangladesh government and NGOs during and immediately after the flood. Respondent opinions regarding emergency relief distribution suggest that both sources performed satisfactorily and an overwhelming majority of them thought that the government performed better than it had previously in distributing relief assistance to flood victims. Following an analysis of the survey data, this paper discusses the policy implications for future disaster assistance efforts in Bangladesh and elsewhere.\n      </p>", "This paper aims at investigating Japanese government's subsidy policy for private universities by applying statistical approaches to various types of quantitative data. Firstly, we briefly describe the history of the government subsidy policy to identify the dominant factors behind it and also explain the structure and mechanism of this subsidy. Secondly, by using 2005 data, we try to find influential factors in allocating both general subsidies and special subsidies for private universities. Thirdly, using the data in two periods given as 1975-1979 and 2000-2004, we try to elucidate the structural properties of the subsidy policy by applying correlative rank analyses approaches in order to measure the \"dominance power\" of the top-ranking subsidy-recipient schools. The results show that the number of faculty members is the most influential for general subsidies, while the number of students is the most dominant variable for special subsidies.\n      </p>", "A general model of participation in a transfer program is developed and applied to data obtained from housing allowance programs in Brown County, Wisconsin and St. Joseph County, Indiana. Estimates of the parameters of the model are obtained from pooled data for the two sites, and the fitted model is used to estimate the equilibrium level of participation and the time required to reach it. The model predicts that the participation rate three years after the housing allowance program's start-40 percent-will rise to a maximum of 51 percent when equilibrium is reached. The model also predicts that 95 percent of the equilibrium level will be reached 5.5 years after the program's start. Although below expectations, the 51 percent equilibrium participation rate is not low compared with other government transfer programs; it is about the same as New York City's welfare and food stamp programs, for example. The model provides valuable insights into the dynamics of government transfer programs. In particular, it shows that the equilibrium participation rate equals the ratio of the rate at which eligible nonparticipants enroll in the program (enrollment rate) to the sum of the enrollment rate and the rate at which participants leave the program (termination rate). If the enrollment and termination rates are equal to each other, as they tend to be in the transfer programs studied, then in equilibrium at a given time only 50 percent of the eligible households will be program participants. The analysis suggests that the most practical way to increase participation is to increase the enrollment rate.\n      </p>", "The paper reports the results of interviews with senior government administrators in Nigeria in which they were asked a range of questions about their own work and about the problems that are likely to be encountered in trying to introduce operational research into the government service. It is thus in contrast with most papers on O.R. in developing countries, which are written primarily from the viewpoint of practitioners. The administrators confirmed that there was a wide range of problems recognized as being suitable for the O.R. approach, and identified some of the barriers to the introduction of an effective O.R. service.\n      </p>", "Much like businesses with electronic commerce, public organizations are beginning to embrace electronic government (e-government). This article defines the term e-government, discusses the literature of local-level e-government, and documents the adoption and sophistication of e-government among U.S. local governments. It employs data from a survey conducted in 2000 to examine local adoption of e-government. E-government adoption among local governments generally tracks previously documented patterns of information technology adoption, which show a statistically significant relationship between adoption and such demographic variables as population size, form and type of government, region, and metro status. The article compares the results of that survey to a normative model of e-government maturity and finds that the emergence of e-government at the local level is still in its formative stages. The analysis also examines perceived impacts from e-government, sophistication of e-government offerings, barriers to adoption of e-government, and ways in which these variables might be interrelated.\n      </p>", "The use of Zero Base Budgeting (ZBB) as a management tool in the public sector has increased significantly since 1972. Recent surveys have indicated that 12 state governments, several municipalities, and the federal government have implemented a ZBB system. The experiences of ZBB users in the private sector from the perspective of individuals who have implemented such systems has been well documented in the literature. In contrast, little has been written about the appropriateness and effectiveness of using ZBB in the public sector. This paper attempts to partially bridge the knowledge gap on the use of ZBB in the public sector by reporting the findings of a research project exploring the use of ZBB in local governments. Findings reported herein are concerned with (1) the extent to which ZBB is used in municipalities, (2) an analysis of the structure of the ZBB process in practice, (3) the characteristics of user cities and the rationale for their use of ZBB, and (4) the benefits and problems associated with the implementation of ZBB in the public sector.\n      </p>", "Europeanisation is now widely researched in the social sciences, but a geographical contribution to these debates is lacking. Yet Europeanisation's myriad socialisation and learning processes have been configured over centuries by territorial propinquity and sites of government and power, with construction and projection of these continent-wide processes by political elites integral to nation building and latterly European integration, that is the building of 'EUrope'. We argue here that an examination of the under-researched scales and spaces of Europeanisation can furnish a more encompassing geographical understanding of this multifaceted suite of processes, and help address lacunae in contemporary social science accounts on Europeanisation's origins and contemporary manifestations under the imprimatur of European integration.\n      </p>", "This study uses large cross-country samples and several measures of happiness, income, and government spending to revisit the relation between government spending and the population's happiness. The main finding is that increased government spending does not lower happiness in broad cross-country contexts. Much caution is, therefore, urged in interpreting the negative association between government spending and happiness reported in some earlier studies and the suggested policy implications. Three additional points are noted. First, the weight of the evidence suggests a significant positive association between income and happiness. Second, estimates based on income and government-share data from Penn World Table and the new International Comparison Program show similar patterns. Third, the parameter for generalized trust seems fragile.\n      </p>", "Improved New York City services and management are part of a long-term trend of incremental, almost self-perpetuating innovation within local American governments over five decades, rather than stemming from new developments attributable to the national and eventually global Reinventing Government movement of the 1990s. Management reform and service expansion have been a constant in New York City government over the past half century, first through additional spending, then through management innovation on a stable budget. Reinvention and traditional public administration both contributed to a sustained effort at improving service delivery, which New York reflects in its budget allocations. Decades before the first United Nations Global Forum on Reinventing Government (1999), New York City, like most American local governments, began expanding and improving the delivery of services. Today, considered from a public administration viewpoint, the programs that New York City spends money on and the outputs of those programs have not changed dramatically in the last quarter-century. The principles of government efficiency and effectiveness that are at the center of reinvention discussions are simply the traditional key elements of the field of public administration that are already integral to American local government as demonstrated by New York City. For decades, New York City's mayors and their administrations have fought poverty and crime; increased access to health care and services; and improved sanitation, education, information and communications technologies, and other services by adhering to well-developed strategies of management reform continually improved within the dynamic field of public administration.\n      </p>", "The United States Commercial Aviation Partnership (USCAP), a group of government and industry stakeholders, combined several operations research methods in an analytical process and model that encompasses the US commercial aviation industry, including travelers, airlines, airports, airline and airport suppliers, government agencies, and travel and tourism entities. With input from these stakeholders, the model, combining system dynamics and econometrics, evaluates the effects of proposed security measures over 25 years. It enables all stakeholders to share a common understanding of these effects and helps government decision makers to improve security without undue and unforeseen operational and economic impact. The model uses linear and nonlinear programming, single and multivariate regression, system dynamics, econometrics, and Monte Carlo simulation. Since 2004, the government has considered the model results in determining policies for screening and credentialing airport employees, screening passengers and cargo, determining security staffing levels, and charging security fees. All participating stakeholders reviewed each analysis for acceptability. Based on the model's success, they envision extending its use to include nonsecurity policy issues. September 11, 2001, the day commercial airplanes became weapons of mass destruction, is personal to many of us and has changed our perspectives on our lives and our world. The official death toll in the attacks was 2,986, including the airline passengers and airline crew members, workers and visitors in the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the police and firefighters, and the 19 hijackers. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) halted all flight operations at the nation's airports for the first time in US history and swiftly grounded the approximately 5,000 commercial aircraft that were in flight. Only military aircraft were flying over the US for the rest of that and the next few days. The events of that day left the airline industry and its supporting companies financially devastated.\n      </p>", "The aim of this paper is to focus on the institutional process by which the Brazilian government spends, borrows, and collects taxes. I am going to evaluate the conventional view that taxes finance government spending, that bond sales are financing operations, and that the Brazilian federal government is operationally constrained. This view arises from a misunderstanding of both treasury and central bank operations. Balance sheets are used to show the reserve effects of the treasury and central bank operations and to explain the cooperation between the central bank and the treasury. It concludes that logically taxes and bonds can not finance government spending and that a sovereign government that issues its own non convertible currency can not become insolvent.\n      </p>", "Barrens were areas of scrub oak and prairie plants that were noted by Government Land Office (GLO) Surveys in Illinois. Surveyors described four vegetation types: prairie, barrens, scattering timber, and forest. Since settlement, these vegetation types have nearly disappeared. We used GIS and the GLO survey notes for Jersey and Greene Counties in southwestern Illinois to locate and estimate the area of barrens present at the time of the surveys. Using these estimates it was possible to determine that barrens covered about ten percent of each county. The larger barrens areas were surrounded by prairie and located in the more level eastern portions of the counties. Carya spp., Quercus marilandica, and Q. stellata were more abundant in barrens than in other vegetation types. Surveyor-designated prairies were located both on prairie soils (argiudolls) and forest soils (hapludalfs). Barrens, scattering timber, and forest were all found on forest soils and on steeper slopes than prairies. The distribution of vegetation types suggests that barrens represent an expansion of woody vegetation onto especially vulnerable prairie sites during the Little Ice Age (1450 to 1850 AD).\n      </p>", "We explore a novel channel through which government spending can stimulate consumption and welfare through its effects on aggregate productivity, without directly affecting either utility or production possibilities. In the presence of monopolistic competition and increasing returns to specialization, it is shown that government spending can partly alleviate the inefficiencies of monopolistic competition. This is because government spending generates an endogenous increase in total factor productivity by increasing the variety of intermediate goods. If the degree of increasing returns to variety is large enough, a rise in such wasteful government spending may increase consumption levels enough to increase welfare.\n      </p>", "Here we argue for the use of cointegration and error correction analysis to combine economic factors that are nonstationary with political factors that are stationary into an empirical model of the evolution of public policy over long periods. The approach is applied to disentangle the contributions of economics and politics to the evolution of public expenditure by the Government of Canada over 130 years. Political competition emerges as the primary political factor affecting government size.\n      </p>", "Applying the systems approach in practice requires compromises to be made in its ideals. This paper discusses this problem by examining two case studies of programme budgeting which can be seen to be an application of the systems approach; it attempts to expand the dimensions of budgeting away from an annual exercise based on functions to a process of medium-term planning based on programmes. The two case studies are the introduction and suspension of Planning-Programming-Budgeting-System (P.P.B.S.) in U.S. Federal Government and the various developments in the U.K. in the Public Expenditure Survey (P.E.S.C.). These provide illuminating contrasts in their intended scope and successful implementation. This contrasting experience suggests questions about systems theory. Should the essential characteristic of the systems approach be expansionism or adaptability? Can systems writing afford to ignore compromises necessary to achieve implementation, especially those made to satisfy political interests?\n      </p>", "In recent years, the agency paradigm has become central to theoretical research in managerial accounting. Empirical research in the area of executive compensation has tested the consistency of agency model predictions with observed compensation data. However, it seems difficult to trace specific instances where results and insights obtained from agency models have affected actual management practice. This article describes one such instance in the context of government contracting, showing how agency theory was used to design incentive contracts. The research reported here was initiated by the German Department of Defense (GDOD). The Department commissioned a study to examine the applicability of a class of incentive schemes subsequently referred to as budgeted-based schemes. To implement these schemes, the GDOD expressed interest in a constructive procedure that would derive suitable budget-based schemes for specific procurement projects. I describe such a procedure and discuss a number of institutional factors that affected the way the budget-based schemes were applied to two pilot projects in Germany. Traditionally, government contracts under sole-source conditions have been awarded either as fixed-price or cost-plus contracts. The use of fixed-price contracts has been confined to projects with relatively few technological and economic uncertainties. With such uncertainties, fixed-price contracts are unattractive from a risk-sharing perspective. Yet, even with a risk-neutral contractor (because of size and diversification) governments are typically reluctant to sign fixed-price contracts when there are major informational asymmetries. If the government is relatively ignorant about inputs and resources required for the project, it will have difficulties disputing the firm's ex ante cost calculation. As a consequence, the firm earns an informational rent; that is, the firm will extract a higher price than it would have if the government had shared the firm's knowledge and expertise. Cost-plus contracts avoid the problem of overpayment, but, as has been well documented, the government subjects itself to the problem of cost padding. To limit the negative incentives of cost-plus contracts, it has become common practice in the United States to replace standard cost-plus contracts with cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts, so that the firm's profit allowance is fixed rather than being proportional to actual project costs. In recent years, there has been an increasing trend in the United States to provide positive incentives for cost control by using cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts. At the outset of a project, the parties negotiate a cost target, and the firm's profit increases proportionally with cost underruns relative to the cost target. Conversely, the incentive profit decreases at the same rate with cost overruns. In effect, the firm thus bears a share of actual project costs. A recent survey by the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO 1987) shows that for the period 1978-84 firms' cost-share parameters typically varied between 15 and 25 percent, but were as high as 50 percent in unusual cases. A major concern voiced repeatedly in connection with cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts is that the government is unable to formulate realistic cost targets for many projects. If the target is set unrealistically low, the firm is likely to suffer a financial penalty. Conversely, an unrealistically high cost target leads to additional \"undeserved\" profits. For this reason, the GAO states that cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts are confined to procurement projects where \"the government has a sound basis to estimate contract costs, but where uncertainties exist that make a fixed-price contract impractical\" (GAO 1987, 1). The relatively low cost-share parameters currently used (15 to 25 percent) may reflect the government's desire to mitigate the effects of unrealistic cost targets. The budget-based schemes considered in this study can be viewed as a refinement of cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts. In addition to actual cost, the incentive fee now depends as well on a cost estimate that the firm submits, typically at the start of the project. In effect, the firm selects a budget (target cost), and the incentive profit is proportional to the budget variance. Previous modeling analysis has shown that the budget-based schemes create desirable reporting and performance incentives (see Kirby et al. 1991). The government receives information that is useful for its budget planning process, since the contracting firm is induced to submit an unbiased cost estimate. Specifically, the firm has an incentive to reveal truthfully its own assessment of expected project costs. To some extent, the budget-based schemes therefore avoid the issue faced by cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts described above. Instead of having the government formulate a realistic cost target, this task is now left to the better informed firm. From a cost-control perspective, the budget-based schemes have been shown to be optimal incentive mechanisms. By offering a menu of contracts, the government can tailor performance incentives to the firm's privately observed cost information. Specifically, the firm chooses a high target profit in return for a high cost-share parameter, provided its cost information is relatively favorable. A high cost-share parameter will induce the firm to conduct the project in a more efficient way. The resulting cost savings are effectively split since the firm receives a large incentive profit. As a consequence, both sides will be better off.\n      </p>", "Testable implications are derived in a present-value borrowing-constraint model for the U.S. federal government.

It is assumed that a hypothetical futures trader obtains the government reports one day in advance of their release. A futures market trading rule is established which uses early access to the reports together with a priori expectations of the reports' contents. We find the market information in the government reports is of little or no value to a futures trader in advance of the release date because this information is already incorporated in the futures price.\n      </p>", "The administrative expenditure of China has been growing rapidly in the past decades.

In the years since the September 11 terrorist attack, states have been beset with economic recession, a federal focus on homeland security, and the war in Iraq, as well as debilitating natural disasters. How well have states managed through these fiscal, political, economic, natural, and international storms? This research examines state government budget management capacity as measured by a 50-state survey to understand the challenges faced by states, the advancements made to support best practices in budgeting, and the problems that remain. Findings tease out bright sports--states have worked hard to reach and maintain a long-term budgeting perspective, particularly by improving the accuracy of revenue and expenditure estimates. Also, many states have improved budgeting transparency by increasing citizen access to budget information, documents, and budget discussions. On the other hand, state budget management progress suffers from the politics of budgeting: More states are having difficulty passing the budget on time, antiquated tax structures are intransigent, and political expediency takes precedence over principles of good budget management. In the end, the political discipline necessary to reach compromise regarding the budget, and to work toward budget balance, will suppress state budget management progress.\n      </p>", "Estimates of government transfers to typical U.S. corn, wheat, and cotton farms are regressed on estimates of market-derived farm income to show that U.S. farmers receive greater government transfers when they face relatively unfavorable market conditions. This transfer countercyclicity is shown to be unrelated to potential deadweight losses constraining government transfers. It is argued that prevailing political economy models have difficulty explaining transfer countercyclicity because they focus on political agents' constraints to the neglect of political agents' objectives.\n      </p>", "Issue importance mediates the impact of public policy issues on electoral decisions. Individuals who consider that an issue is important are more likely to rely on their attitudes toward that issue when evaluating candidates and deciding for whom to vote. The logic behind the link between issue importance and issue voting should translate to a link between issue importance and performance voting. Incumbent performance evaluations regarding an issue should have a stronger impact on the vote choice of individuals who find that issue important. The analysis demonstrates that there is a significant interaction between performance evaluations and issue importance. People concerned about an issue assign more weight to their evaluations of the government's performance on that issue when making up their mind.\n      </p>", "The U.S. government embraces the concepts of privatization and market competition, but the realm of contracting shows that it has not always been able to put its principles into practice. Although the contracting system is supposed to be open and competitive, in recent years the government has often awarded contracts with little or no competitive bidding, has chosen to award mostly cost-plus type contracts that force the government to assume more of the risk, and lacked efficiency in monitoring and overseeing private contractors. While the number and value of contracts have increased, the workforce to oversee these contracts has been reduced, preventing the government from adequately enforcing compliance with the contractors, and the government has not made use of past performance evaluations in its contracting system. Private contractors that do business with the U.S. government are for the most part well-established firms with ample resources and inside contacts; many contracts are still being awarded on preferential treatment and to the larger and well-established contractors.\n      </p>", "This paper presents a cross-national test of the effects of personal religious identity and participation in organized religion on psychological well-being, and examines whether their effects vary as a function of the degree of government regulation of individual liberties in a given country. These questions are explored with the cross-sectional fourth wave of the World Values Surveys, utilizing data from 65 countries and hierarchical linear modeling to test cross-level effects. The results indicate two key findings: (1) personal religious identity is positively associated with life satisfaction throughout the world, but the association increases in size under conditions of greater governmental regulation; and, (2) the association between participation in organized religion and life satisfaction is positive under conditions of low government regulation, is attenuated as government regulation increases, and becomes negative when government regulation is high. The implications of these results for future research on religion and psychological well-being are discussed.\n      </p>", "The effects of government programs on rice production in Taiwan are examined under the rational expectations hypothesis.

This paper analyzes three components of municipal governments\u2014the form of government, the size of the city council, and the election method of city councilors. Once fixed effects estimation is employed, the positive relationship between city council size and expenditure disappears.\n      </p>", "We examine the relationship between government size and economic growth, controlling for economic freedom and globalization, and using Bayesian Averaging over Classical Estimates in a panel of rich countries. Countries with big government have experienced above average increases in the KOF globalization index and in the Fraser institute's Economic freedom index. To maintain comparability with earlier studies, we use two sample periods: 1970-1995 and 1970-2005. Government size robustly correlates negatively with growth. We also find some evidence that countries with big government can use economic openness and sound economic policies to mitigate negative effects of big government.\n      </p>", "The impact of government institutions on the value of improved climate forecasts is examined. Results suggest that crop insurance and earned income tax credit have little effect on the expected change in after-tax cash flows. Federal tax law has only a modest influence. As expected, the disaster program decreases the value of improved climate forecasts. With no price changes, the farm program lowers the value of the forecasts because of the acreage reduction provisions. With at least some price decreases, the farm program increases the value of climate forecasts. Here, the price supports override the acreage reduction provisions.\n      </p>", "This paper empirically analyzes whether government size is conducive or detrimental to life satisfaction in a cross-section of 74 countries. We thus provide a test of the longstanding dispute between standard neoclassical economic theory and public theory. According to the neoclassical view, governments play unambiguously positive roles for individuals' quality of life, while the theory of public choice has been developed to understand why governments often choose excessive involvement in \u2014 and regulation of \u2014 the economy, thereby harming their citizens' quality of life. Our results show that life satisfaction decreases with higher government consumption. For low, middle income, and male people, this result is stronger when the government is leftwing, while government consumption appears to be less harmful for women when the government is perceived to be effective. Government capital formation and social spending have no significant impact on life satisfaction.\n      </p>", "The article explores government compliance with international pressures measured as policy adoption and institutional reform. The findings reveal that government compliance is determined by the domestic political system and depends on the configuration of political actors mobilized in support of reform. Legislative reform is facilitated by a strong women's movement and mobilized female parliamentarians. Institutional reform depends on the strength of the women's movement and its ability to form coalitions with political actors within government elites, most importantly governing parties. Finally, the effect of women's movements' actors on the institutional reform is moderated by the ideology of political parties in power.\n      </p>", "An induced innovations framework was used to develop a median voter model to test factors affecting county government's decisions to adopt alternative service delivery methods. Size measures of population and tax base, fiscal measures of tax revenues, the share of tax base in agriculture, and access to human capital were significantly related to structural change of local government.\n      </p>", "Previous literature modeling the demand for religion has identified socioeconomic factors, religious human capital and religious market structure as being the fundamental determinants of the level of participation in religious services and practices. Building on the existing literature, this study analyzes the effect of government regulation and intervention on religious activity. Using religion-related data as well as demographic and economic data from 22 Eastern European countries after the fall of Communism, the existence of any form of religious restrictions is found to reduce church attendance rates.\n      </p>", "Attempts to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of local government have lagged behind the higher tiers of governance in Australia, and it is only in the comparatively recent past that systematic efforts have been made to measure the performance of Australian local government. This paper seeks to review municipal efficiency measurement in Australia and to advance the argument that the present reliance on partial measures of performance is inadequate and should be heavily augmented by data envelopment analysis (DEA). We summarize progress made in efficiency measurement on a state-by-state basis and then examine performance measurement in water and wastewater as a more detailed case study. On the basis of this evidence, we argue that DEA provides the best means of providing public policymakers with the necessary information on municipal performance.\n      </p>", "Following years of civil strife, Uganda emerged as a \u201cmovement only\u201d state under the National Resistance Movement led by Yoweri Museveni. One of the major innovations of this new government was to implement a strategy of administrative and fiscal decentralization. This experiment was long hailed as an African success story, but the reemergence of multiparty politics in 2006 is having a major impact on local governance. This study traces the development of political parties and local governments in Uganda. It then examines how multiparty politics has resulted in changes that have impacted decision making at the local government level. The study concludes that multiparty politics is leading to fiscal insolvency of local governments, the creation of unviable new district governments, and administrative recentralization.\n      </p>", "Since 1997, cooperation initiatives involving Asian countries have become more visible and ambitious. These initiatives reflect incentives for regional cooperation in Asia that are the product of prior levels of regional integration and international developments. While many countries in the region stand to gain from more substantive cooperation, they are likely to find certain cooperative goals difficult to achieve. This difficulty cannot be ascribed to the commonly cited obstacles to cooperation in Asia: economic diversity, inter-state political rivalry and the influence exercised by the US. Rather, parts of the new regional agenda are complicated by the kind of government organizations that exist in some countries. Government organizations that lack domestic regulatory capacity are poorly equipped to participate in some regional initiatives.\n      </p>", "This study of the 1973 Local Government Elections in England and Wales shows that the position of a candidate's name on the ballot paper can have an important effect in terms of the number of votes which he receives. In particular the lower-placed members of each party are quite seriously disadvantaged. Investigations into the relationship between this positional effect and other aspects of the election show that it occurs quite generally. A simple model is formulated which attempts to explain the phenomenon.\n      </p>", "An international movement is well under way to develop electronic-government or \"e-government\" systems to facilitate cross-organizational service delivery. E-government corresponds to the use of technology, particularly Web-based Internet applications, by government agencies to enhance access to and delivery of public services. Great attention has been devoted to stemming the rates of failure encountered with these systems, including a major conference convened by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on \"The Hidden Threat to E-Government: Avoiding Large Government IT Failures.\" In this article, we examine the OECD's recommendations in light of the environmental context of public organizations. After carefully reviewing the recommendations for e-government emanating from the OECD conference--which emphasize hierarchical, top-down, control-oriented approaches to the development of these systems--we offer a contrasting set of guidelines that may be more beneficial to the complexity and uncertainty of the public-sector environment.\n      </p>", "Geographers examining the spaces of government and governance, and in particular those drawing upon the writings of Michel Foucault on government and governmentality, have tended to overlook the importance of different media, technical devices and practices of self-government to specific rationalities and programmes of government. In this paper I argue that the materialities and immaterialities of many mundane media technologies, the way they articulate and translate particular programmes of government, and the way they instil practices of self-government in citizens, are important but frequently overlooked dimensions of the geographies of government. I focus on the codes of countryside conduct - The Country Code/Countryside Code - that have been published in England and Wales since 1951. I examine how the National Parks Commission, and subsequently the Countryside Commission and Countryside Agency, identified the potential strengths and limitations of using the Country Code booklet to govern the conduct of visitors to the countryside. The paper shows how the material form of the booklet and methods of distributing and promoting it were seen to matter, and examines how civil servants attempted to extend the 'reach' of the Code and articulate its message through a diverse range of media which entailed different kinds of performative encounters in different spaces.\n      </p>", "In 2004 and 2009, the incumbent central governments in India enjoyed a high level of voter satisfaction. Why then did incumbents lose elections in 2004, while winning them in 2009? The different electoral outcomes can be explained by a combination of satisfaction with a constituent's member of Parliament and the performance of the government at the state level, as well as satisfaction with the government at the national level. This analysis rejects the conventional argument of general satisfaction with the performance of the central government as being the determinant of electoral outcomes in national elections.\n      </p>", "This article explores the potential of the collaborative approach for local government program evaluation, particularly programs administered by nonprofits. City budget staff in Charlotte, North Carolina, partnered with the nonprofit in charge of a special tax district in a collaborative evaluation (CE) to assess the district's impact. An examination of this experience suggests that CEs are costly in terms of time and staff resources and raises questions about cooption and bias. However, it also suggests the promise of increased communication and better relations between local governments and nonprofits, improved evaluation skills of program staff, and increased likelihood of utilization of evaluation results.\n      </p>", "Dans cette \u00e9tude, nous comparons la taille et la structure de l'\u00c9tat au Canada et aux \u00c9tats-Unis, de 1929 \u00e0 2004, \u00e0 l'aide de donn\u00e9es de comptabilit\u00e9 nationale et de donn\u00e9es sur l'emploi.

The challenge of defining the public sector for comparative purposes is explored and illustrated, especially with respect to the treatment of non-profits, and a number of intriguing similarities and differences in the comparative evolution of the public sectors are identified that remain to be explained. Use of a new Fisher-type government deflator for Canada indicates that, as of 2003, real government spending relative to real income was about 27 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in both countries.\n      </p>", "Building on prior research in Confucianism and business, the current study examines the effects of Confucianism on consumer trust of government involvement with products and company brands. Based on three major ideas of Confucianism \u2013 meritocracy, loyalty to superior, and separation of responsibilities \u2013 it is expected that consumers under the influence of Confucianism would perceive products from government-involved enterprises to have more desirable attributes and show preference for their company brands. Findings from an empirical study in the Chinese automobile market support the hypotheses. The results suggest that small firms doing business in China would especially benefit from some association with the government. These results also provide managerial implications for enterprises in other countries with a Confucian cultural background.\n      </p>", "NGOs have been a major actor in South Korea's democratic governance and have sometimes played key roles in cooperation with the government. However, their once prominent status is in decline, attributed here to their structural weakness, over-politicization, and the risk of being potentially co-opted by the government\n      </p>", "Trade in Australian education services has expanded rapidly over recent years. The sector is the third largest exporter of Australian services. In 2001-2002, exports of education were about $A 4.2 billion. Government assistance to the sector includes export market development, regulation of education standards, and funding education activities; university research and development, for example. This paper examines the case for further government intervention in the export of education, and the appropriate forms of assistance if further government intervention is justified. The paper predominately focuses on assisting higher education exports because this activity dominates education exports.\n      </p>", "Government interventions have a pervasive impact on international grain trade, yet models of that trade treat the role of government as an exogenous influence. A model endogenizing government is presented as an alternative to spatial equilibrium trade models. That model is also used to interpret parameters in a net import demand model and to argue that the effect of international prices and production on trade often will be smaller than what is derived from domestic supply and demand equations. Econometric evidence supporting that contention is presented for trade in wheat and feed grains by thirty-three countries.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Using state-level data for 1970-93, a simultaneous equation model was developed to estimate the direct and indirect effects of different types of government expenditure on rural poverty and productivity growth in India. The results show that in order to reduce rural poverty, the Indian government should give highest priority to additional investments in rural roads and agricultural research. These types of investment not only have much larger poverty impacts per rupee spent than any other government investment, but also generate higher productivity growth. Apart from government spending on education, which has the third largest marginal impact on rural poverty and productivity growth, other investments (including irrigation, soil and water conservation, health, and rural and community development) have only modest impacts on growth and poverty per additional rupee spent.\n      </p>", "Electronic government is being increasingly recognized as a means for transforming public governance. Despite this increasing interest, information systems (IS) literature is mostly silent on what really contributes to the success of e-government Web sites. To fill this gap, this study examines the role of trust in e-government success using the updated DeLone and McLean IS success model as the theoretical framework. The model is tested via a survey of 214 Singapore e-government Web site users. The results show that trust in government, but not trust in technology, is positively related to trust in e-government Web sites. Further, trust in e-government Web sites is positively related to information quality, system quality, and service quality. The quality constructs have different effects on \"intention to continue\" using the Web site and \"satisfaction\" with the Web site. Post hoc analysis indicates that the nature of usage (active versus passive users) may help us better understand the interrelationships among success variables examined in this study. This result suggests that the DeLone and McLean model can be further extended by examining the nature of IS use. In addition, it is important to consider the role of trust as well as various Web site quality attributes in understanding e-government success.\n      </p>", "The frequent demands for protection by the fertilizer industry in many developed countries may have important implications for the agricultural sector. This paper provides a theoretical justification for government intervention in the fertilizer market in the form of an import tariff against foreign competitors. However, a superior policy would be for the government to counter the competitive distortion that exists in the market. An even better outcome is attained by using both policies simultaneously. Moreover, since the fertilizer industry undergoes continuous structural change, the extent to which optimal policies should vary is also investigated.\n      </p>", "A substantial body of theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrates that interregional competition for factors of production leads to convergence of per capita output. Is there an analogous process that leads to convergence of public sector activity? Skidmore et al. develop a model that is consistent with the macroeconomic growth literature, which predicts convergence in government spending. Using this framework, we test for convergence in government spending using detailed data from Wisconsin for a variety of municipal government expenditure categories over the period 1990-2000. Our empirical investigation provides compelling evidence of convergence in per capita government spending for all the expenditure categories we study.\n      </p>", "Current Extension programming in community development, much of it directed at local government problems, appears a potpourri of stylistic approaches. The public choice paradigm explicitly establishes a theoretical basis for the view that government's primary role is providing for resolution of the constant and inevitable conflicts between the values of citizens. It views the level and mix of services provided by government as a reflection of that political process rather than a scientifically determinable optimum. These arguments clarify differences between \"process\" and \"substantive\" approaches to Community Resource Development programming and suggest a framework for Extension strategies for improving local government.\n      </p>", "The Federal Government of the United States has collected and published an increasing volume of statistics from the founding of the republic, but its contributions to statistical theory and method did not really begin until 1933. Before then, the bulk of Federal statistics was done by tabulation and compilation, and methods were largely intuitive. The Roosevelt New Deal and the Committee on Government Statistics and Information Services (COGSIS) made probability sampling and statistical analysis a significant part of Government planning and operations. By early in World War II, Federal statisticians had become leaders rather than just followers in statistical theory and methods. This article provides a summary of how this happened and especially of the subsequent development of survey sampling from finite populations. Attention is then turned to the development of statistical analysis in the Federal Government, a more diverse subject, which is both related to probability sampling in significant ways and very interesting because it is probably still in an early stage of development. This paper also provides commentary on some recent developments in the Federal statistical system in general during the period 1977 to 1992.\n      </p>", "After more than a decade of research in the field of e-government, it is now timely and appropriate to reflect upon the overall developmental directions in the area. The purpose of this paper is to explore research progress to date by systematically analyzing the existing body of knowledge on e-government related issues, and to reveal if there is a lack of theoretical development and rigor in the area. Usable data relating to e-government adoption research currently available were collected from 434 research articles identified from the ISI Web of Knowledge database, and by manually identifying relevant articles from journals dedicated to electronic government research such as Transforming Government: People, Process, and Policy (TGPPP), Electronic Government, an International Journal (EGIJ), and International Journal of Electronic Government Research (IJEGR). Based on our investigation of this extant literature, our findings revealed that generic e-government applications were explored more than any specific applications, and the technology acceptance model (TAM) was the theory most often utilized to explain research models. It was also revealed that except for DeLone and McLean's (1992, 2003) IS success model, all other theories and models (for example, TAM, diffusion of innovation (DOI), unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), and theory of planned behavior (TPB) have performed consistently with acceptable variance across various studies in the context of e-government adoption research. Although a large number of theories and theoretical constructs were borrowed from the reference disciplines, their utilization by e-government researchers appears to be largely random in approach. The paper also acknowledges the limitations of the study and suggests research directions for future researchers.\n      </p>", "Key Settlement Policy divides rural settlements into two types-those in which expansion is allowed and those in which it is not. Although suitability for residential expansion is not completely synonymous with suitability for infrastructure investment (nor vice versa) the designation of Key Settlement or non-Key Settlement status does not have a significant impact on infrastructure and service provision. In the light of central and local public expenditure economies and of the 1985 Transport Act, therefore, key Settlement Policy takes on a renewed political importance. In 1982 the Warwickshire policy was changed, involving some changes in designation, and also a beginning of decentralization of designation decisions away from the county to the constituent districts. The change was justified by the argument that the policy had previously been ineffective. However, analysis of the 17 key settlements and 17 control non-key settlements from 1966 to 1981, with respect to population change, refusal rates, Planning Inspectors' decision letters, and appeal decisions, shows that the policy was effective. It is argued that the reason for the policy change in 1982 stems from central government and County Council political objectives, and that decentralization of designation powers to districts constitutes a loss of accountability for rural policy in Warwickshire.\n      </p>", "During 2002, the Australian Education Minister conducted a year-long review of tertiary education under the title Higher Education at the Crossroads. The policy statement arising from that review was released on 13 May 2003. It incorporates a combination of new financial incentives on students and universities, potential expansion of full-fee places, and increased intrusion into university priority setting. The policy statement promised a $ A 1.5b expansion in funding over four years, with more fully- funded university places, and an emphasis on improving the quality of teaching and learning. The strategy is market-driven and could create a 'fee-culture' in Australian universities. Implementation of the new policy is not assured as it has to pass a hostile Senate. The implementation process also carries risks for government and universities. This paper describes the government's proposals and analyses their premises and effects.\n      </p>", "Changes in the U.S. farm economy during the 1980s have caused many farmers to give careful consideration to participation in the government farm program. Analytical techniques to identify optimal participation and resulting crop mix strategies at a whole-farm level can aid farmers faced with these decisions. This paper presents a mathematical programming approach adaptable to farm-level decision analysis. An empirical example involving a Texas farm suggests that resource levels, base acreage endowments, limited cross compliance, and returns outside the program can influence participation decisions.\n      </p>", "Few studies have empirically assessed the factors that affect government agencies' public responsiveness from a public management perspective. This article tests a preliminary model that explains the level of public responsiveness with variables about external political environments and internal organizational characteristics. The hypotheses are tested with survey data from state health and human service agencies. The results show that the support of elected officials, the influence of the public and media, and decentralization of decision making have a positive impact on public responsiveness. Results-based management changes have a quadratic \u2229-shaped relation with public responsiveness. Further, the influence of client groups has a negative impact on public responsiveness.\n      </p>", "Research has demonstrated that nonprofit organizations are committed to the performance accountability of service delivery. However, nonprofits often lack the organizational capacity to track service performance as compared to local government. This article presents a case study on how local government can assist nonprofit organizations with building performance capacity for results-based management in the context of mutual accountability. The premise is that local government officials are accountable for why public dollars are granted to nonprofits and for whether those funds are used to accomplish their intended purpose. This research demonstrates that local government can expand the performance capacity in nonprofit organizations with an investment of resources in training and technical assistance and that nonprofits are receptive to results-based management. It also finds that leadership and collaboration are fundamental to mutual accountability.\n      </p>", "In this paper, we develop an endogenous growth model with market regulations on explicitly modeled financial intermediaries to examine the effects of alternative government financing schemes on growth, inflation, and welfare. In the presence of binding regulation, there is always a unique equilibrium. We perform four alternative policy experiments; a change in the seigniorage tax rate, a change in the seigniorage tax base, a change in the income tax and a change in the fiscal-monetary policy mix. We find that in the presence of binding legal reserve requirements, a marginal increase in government spending need not result in a reduction in the rate of economic growth if it is financed with an increase in the seigniorage tax rate. Raising the seigniorage tax base by means of an increase in the reserve requirement retards growth and it has an ambiguous effect on inflation. An increase in income tax financed government spending also suppresses growth and raises inflation although not to the extent that the required seigniorage tax rate alternative would. Switching from seigniorage to income taxation as a source of government finance is growth reducing but deflationary. From a welfare perspective, the least distortionary way of financing an increase in the government spending requirements is by means of a marginal increase in the seigniorage tax rate. Under the specification of logarithmic preferences, the optimal tax structure is indeterminate.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Extending Meltzer and Richard's static analysis of government size the article offers a theory of growth of government. At low stages of economic development the median voter, identified as a relatively poor worker, prefers to have no or only small redistributive taxation in order to foster savings. Through this channel he expects improvements of his labor productivity and wage. At higher stages of development, however, when capital is relatively abundant and prospects of further labor productivity gains through capital accumulation are smaller, the incentive to tax and redistribute income rises. Yet, in line with previous work on growth and infrastructure spending the median voter prefers a constant share of productive public spending at all times. Hence, government growth is solely driven by an expanding welfare state.\n      </p>", "We study how satisfaction with service delivery affects trust in public agencies in an empirical setting. Our basic assumption is that the causal relation between satisfaction and trust cannot be fruitfully analyzed unless the measures are controlled for a common component, which we identify as the predisposition toward government. The empirical results suggest that the impact of a negative experience with a public agency is much more pronounced than the effect of a positive one. Decreasing the number of disappointed clients will, therefore, have a stronger effect on increasing trust in the public sector than increasing the number of (already) well-pleased clients: Trust comes on foot and goes away on horseback.\n      </p>", "In recent years, while the significance of the state has diminished, the role of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) has increased in most developing countries. Although NGOs are often identified with powerless groups, they themselves have become powerful and influential, especially because of their external sources of financial support, cooperation, and advocacy. More specifically, NGOs have recently gained more prominence in comparison with government institutions. This article studies the case of Bangladesh where the number of NGOs has proliferated and some globally known NGOs have emerged. First, it briefly explains the structure of government, and profiles the major development NGOs, in Bangladesh. It then illustrates the basic dimensions and indicators of change in the power relations between the government and these NGOs. It also examines the major local and global forces enhancing the power and influence of NGOs. Finally, it analyzes the critical outcomes of this changing balance of power between the government and NGOs. /// Au cours des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, le r\u00f4le de l'Etat s'est amoindri cependant que celui des ONGs s'accroissait dans la plupart des pays en voie de d\u00e9veloppement.

It is also increasingly underlined by research, both from the field of development theory/politics and from comparative research on democratisation processes. These broader arguments are narrowed down by concentrating on local electoral rules, with a geographical focus on the countries of Southern Africa. The contribution presents data for all Southern African countries on the types of elected bodies at sub-national level of government, the composition of local councils, the regularity and simultaneity of local and national elections, the electoral systems and the rules governing candidature at the local level. Electoral rules are just one set of institutions that matter in local politics, and there is no doubt that other variables (such as local administration, resource allocation or capacity-building) are equally important. But the assumption is that local electoral institutions are relevant for the democratisation of both local and national politics, and should thus merit closer scrutiny. The comparative study of different countries offers additional insights into similarities or specific constraints and problems that countries face in organising local elections, as well as into the institutional solutions that they eventually opted for. Vor dem Hintergrund der Demokratisierungsprozesse im s\u00fcdlichen Afrika hat die Regulierung des politischen Wettbewerbs auch auf der lokalen Ebene in den letzten Jahren an Bedeutung gewonnen. Der Beitrag systematisiert die verstreuten Informationen \u00fcber die Reformen der Kommunalverfassung und lokale Wahlen in allen SADC-L\u00e4ndern. Dabei werden sowohl die Typen von gew\u00e4hlten Institutionen, das Zusammenwirken von gew\u00e4hlten und ernannten Ratsmitgliedern, die Rolle der B\u00fcrgermeister, die Regelm\u00e4\u00dfigkeit der Durchf\u00fchrung von Wahlen, die Wahlsysteme und das passive Wahlrecht n\u00e4her beleuchtet. In einem zweiten Schritt werden einige Hypothesen zu den m\u00f6glichen Auswirkungen der in den SADC-L\u00e4ndern stark variierenden institutionellen Regelungen sowohl f\u00fcr die Demokratisierung der Lokalpolitik als auch R\u00fcckwirkungen auf die nationale Ebene diskutiert. /// Dans le contexte des processus de d\u00e9mocratisation dans la r\u00e9gion de l'Afrique australe les activit\u00e9s des institutions locales \u00e9lues ont \u00e9galement attir\u00e9 l'attention des observateurs. Beaucoup d'\u00e9tats ont reform\u00e9 leur syst\u00e8mes gouvernementales \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle locale. L'article pr\u00e9sente un sommaire des r\u00e8gles en vigueur dans tous les \u00e9tats de la r\u00e9gion: On trouve done un aper\u00e7u syst\u00e9matique des institutions \u00e9lues et des dispositions r\u00e9glant la candidature et le mode de scrutin. Sur la base de cette collection de donn\u00e9es de base quelques hypoth\u00e8ses sont avanc\u00e9es sur les effets des institutions locales aussi bien sur la d\u00e9mocratisation de la vie politique locale que sur les processus politiques nationaux.\n      </p>", "We show that the composition of government spending influences the longrun behavior of the real exchange rate. We develop a two-sector small open-economy model in which an increase in government consumption is associated with real appreciation, while an increase in government investment may generate real depreciation. Our empirical work confirms that government consumption and government investment have differential effects on the real exchange rate and the relative price of nontradables.\n      </p>", "Firms employ a variety of political strategies (e.g., lobbying, contributions) in an attempt to gain influence or access to the public policy process. A variety of benefits may accrue to firms that are successful in creating a linkage with the government: information, access, influence, reduced uncertainty and transaction costs, etc. However, the direct benefits of such strategies are difficult to observe. One political strategy is studied here-personal service (having a firm representative serve in a political capacity). Event-study methodology results show that such linkages with the government positively affect firm value. These findings indicate that firm-specific benefits may result from political strategies.\n      </p>", "Recent government decisions to improve the economic health of North Norway have had significant spatial impact. This region is a continuing problem area because of the dearth of physical and human resources. Postwar capital investment, loans, and other schemes to encourage industry have emphasized urban growth and depopulated many rural farming and fishing areas. Variations in regional growth are largely a result of investment decisions favoring industrial development, and the resultant migration of labor to manufacturing areas. The trend toward urbanization and the concentration of economic activity has been slowed by a recent shift in national planning to favor more marginal communities and activities such as farming and fishing.\n      </p>", "PERT/CPM in project management scheduling systems is applied and used less frequently than the literature would seem to suggest. Eighteen almost-identical government units were studied to document a situation that appears to be ideally suited to PERT/CPM but where the success ratio was 4 out of 18 cases. We then identify some factors to explain why or why not the PERT/CPM techniques were not successful. Of nine factors identified, the two important factors turned out to be (1) the level of person making the introduction and (2) the stated purpose of the introduction. Suggestions for improving acceptance then conclude the paper.\n      </p>", "Performance of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in meeting the political preferences of its administrators is highly sensitive to the choice of eligibility, bid solicitation, and bid selection criteria used in making program implementation decisions. Decisions made in the first year of CRP implementation led to suboptimal results; net government cost could have been reduced while simultaneously increasing the extent to which erosion and supply control objectives were met. Simulation of the outcomes for a fully enrolled reserve under alternative implementation schemes indicates that future performance can be improved by manipulating key control variables to directly target preferences.\n      </p>", "Until recently, the study of Chinese historical writings of the 1920s and 1930s has centered on \"the May Fourth approach to history,\" especially the Doubting Antiquity Movement (yigu yundong) led by Gu Jiegang. By privileging their historical writings as modern or progressive and labeling their opponents' as traditional or regressive, we fail to see the full scope of the modern Chinese historical debate and overlook its social and political underpinnings. In this article, based on a close reading of \"History of Chinese Culture\" (Zhongguo wenhua shi) of Liu Yizheng (1880-1956), the author seeks to contextualize the historical debate in terms of the political and social change in post-1911 China. Written in the early 1920s when intellectuals still could express different views of the nation without the fear of state censorship, Liu's \"History of Chinese Culture\" gave renewed emphasis to local self-government, thereby challenging the expansion of the state.\n      </p>", "Most research on the causes of growth in government expenditure has focused on the demand for government services. In this paper, we argue that in fact this growth may have occurred because of changes in supply. Changes in technology leading to increased specialization and thus increased opportunity costs of self-production have led to increased market production and increased record keeping. Also, female labor force participation has increased. Both of these factors serve to reduce the (efficiency) cost of collecting taxes; if the demand for government spending has not changed, this increase in supply would lead to a larger public sector. We estimate a system of simultaneous equations for the period 1929-1970 incorporating this hypothesis, and the results are consistent with the theory. We are able to explain virtually all of the growth of government; increases in female labor force participation seems to be a very important variable in this explanation.\n      </p>", "Public choice explanations of government growth fall into three main categories: budget-maximization theories, rational-choice models, and path-dependent models like the \"ratchet hypothesis\". The strengths and weaknesses of these theories as explanations for government growth are considered along with some facts about the actual growth of government to conjecture about its trajectory in the twenty-first century. Government size seems to have been constrained in the past primarily by its ability to raise revenue. Growth rates in the new century thus appear to depend on factors constraining government's ability to continue to expand the tax base.\n      </p>", "This article describes an ongoing effort by the International City/County Management Association (ICMA) to assess the knowledge of practicing local government managers. The development of the Applied Knowledge Assessment (AKA) is described, as are some of the controversial issues that surround this effort. Work began on this assessment tool in 1997, and it is now required to become an ICMA credentialed manager. This article also examines the demographics of the 1,603 participants who have taken this instrument to date. This insider's view of this process should help to stimulate a wider dialogue about the role of these types of assessment tools in the field of public administration.\n      </p>", "Several of the transition economies are devolving fiscal authority to subnational governments at a time when it is also important to consolidate fiscal policy. This can be problematic because, without appropriate care, the central government's ability to determine the level and structure of revenues, public spending, and borrowing may well diminish as fiscal policy is devolved. This paper focuses on how the center can maintain its ability to conduct fiscal policy while devolving revenue, spending, and borrowing powers to lower levels of government. Empirical evidence shows that countries with good governance have maintained fiscal control despite a high degree of fiscal devolution. And decentralization is associated with better fiscal outcomes for middle-income countries with strong governance. Fiscal management issues are explored in four key areas: budget coordination mechanisms at the macro level, tax-effort incentives and revenue-sharing mechanisms, expenditure control and hard-budget constraints, and criteria and rules for borrowing.\n      </p>", "Since 1980, local government in Britain has seen moves towards the private provision of local services. The regulation school of political economy provides an explanation for this trend. However, privatization has been opposed by local government trade unions. The development of national trade union policy on local government privatization is discussed. This national policy is subject to local variations which are illustrated by the cases of two contrasting local authorities, in Wandsworth and Newcastle. These cases suggest that some reworking of conventional regulation theory may be required if it is fully to account for social struggles around privatization, and the resulting geographically uneven transition to a new pattern of local service provision.\n      </p>", "We argue that making lawmakers more accountable to the public by making it easier to identify their policy choices can have negative consequences. Specifically, we analyze a model of political agency with a single lawmaker and a representative voter. In our model, the lawmaker has better information than the voter about the appropriateness of alternative policy courses. In addition, the voter is uncertain about the incumbent's policy preferences \u2014 specifically, the voter is worried the incumbent is an ideologue. Our model suggests that when lawmakers expect their policy choices to be widely publicized, for those lawmakers sufficiently concerned about reelection, the desire to select policies that lead the public to believe they are unbiased will trump the incentive to select those policies that are best for their constituents. Hence, lawmakers who would do the right thing behind close doors may no longer do so when policy is determined in the open.\n      </p>", "We investigate empirically the determinants of the quality of governments in a large cross-section of countries. We assess government performance using measures of government intervention, public sector efficiency, public good provision, size of government, and political freedom. We find that countries that are poor, close to the equator, ethnolinguistically heterogeneous, use French or socialist laws, or have high proportions of Catholics or Muslims exhibit inferior government performance. We also find that the larger governments tend to be the better performing ones. The importance of (reasonably) exogenous historical factors in explaining the variation in government performance across countries sheds light on the economic, political, and cultural theories of institutions.\n      </p>", "Major changes to improve performance are never easy. Yet one can get the impression from Osborne's and Gaebler's Reinventing Government that any government can \"just do it.\" Seven caveats are offered for changing government.\n      </p>", "In \"The Two Faces of Government Spending,\" Paul Goren applies a confirmatory factor model to data from the Center for Political Studies (CPS) National Election Studies (NES) to show that public attitudes toward policy spending are two dimensional. Here, I show that a unidimensional model, derived from nonparametric item response theory, can be used to represent the same data. This latter model provides additional insights about specific spending responses and also produces results that are equivalent to the two-dimensional model with respect to the impact of racial stereotypes. Therefore, by scientific standards, the unidimensional representation of public opinion toward government spending seems to be preferable.\n      </p>", "Although the past 20 years seem to indicate that modeling for public policymaking has not been very successful, as better decision support systems and other user-friendly computer systems are developed, analysts, policymakers, and staff members will have an opportunity to work more closely throughout the whole process from problem definition to implementation. Policy analysts will be in greater demand in government and as consultants to government agencies.\n      </p>", "This paper examines the effectiveness of government transfers in overcoming the Samaritan's dilemma in a family in which the child saves an insufficient amount in order to induce larger bequests from the parent. The results are as follows. First, exogenous government transfers do not affect intergenerational consumption allocation if bequests are operative. Second, assuming that government transfers are chosen strategically, the government precommits to such a level of transfers from the parent to the child that bequests become inoperative, and thus rids the child of the incentive for undersaving. This engenders an efficient intertemporal allocation of consumption.\n      </p>"], "words": {"concept": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "chinese": {"number": 1, "prob":
