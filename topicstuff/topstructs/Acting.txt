{"total_words": 804, "documents": ["To create high-affinity antibodies, B cells target a high rate of somatic hypermutation (SHM) to the Ig variable-region genes that encode the antigen-binding site. This mutational process requires transcription and is triggered by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), which converts deoxycytidine to deoxyuridine. Mistargeting of AID to non-Ig genes is thought to result in the malignant transformation of B cells, but the mechanism responsible for targeting SHM to certain DNA regions and not to others is largely unknown. Cis-acting elements have been proposed to play a role in directing the hypermutation machinery, but the motifs required for targeting SHM have been difficult to identify because many of the candidate elements, such as promoters or enhancers, are also required for transcription of Ig genes. Here we describe a system in cultured hybridoma cells in which transcription of the endogenous heavy-chain Ig gene continues in the absence of the core intronic enhancer (E\u03bc) and its flanking matrix attachment regions (MARs). When AID is expressed in these cells, SHM occurred at the WT frequency even when E\u03bc and the MARs were absent together. Interestingly, SHM occurred at less than the WT frequency when E\u03bc or the MARs were individually absent. Our results suggest that these intronic regulatory elements can exert a complex influence on SHM that is separable from their role in regulating transcription.\n      </p>", "A central claim in Kantian ethics is that an agent is properly morally motivated just in case she acts from duty alone. Bernard Williams, Michael Stocker, and Justin Oakley claim that certain emotionally infused actions, such as lending a compassionate helping hand, can only be done from compassion and not from duty. I argue that these critics have overlooked a distinction between an action's manner, how an action is done, and its motive, the agent's reason for acting. Through a range of examples I demonstrate how an emotion can determine an action's manner without also serving as the motive. Thus, it is possible for an agent to act compassionately from duty alone. This distinction between the manner and the motive of an action not only restores a central claim in Kantian ethics but it also allows for an expanded role of emotions in moral action.\n      </p>", "Modern theories of acting follow Stanislavsky and emphasize emotional truthfulness achieved through self-expression, but an older tradition emphasizes technique and imitation and this emphasis is argued to be equally relevant to movie acting.\n      </p>", "This paper classifies smooth actions of a finite group $G$ acting on a sphere of sufficiently high dimension with precisely two fixed points (and the action free elsewhere) by relating the group action to an element of the group's Whitehead group. Essentially, if that element is zero, the action corresponds to a free action on a sphere of dimension one less. If not, what we call the \"double\" of the action is. An example is constructed to show that the various cases can occur.\n      </p>", "Is the acting white hypothesis empirically viable? The strong version of this hypothesis\u2014that African American students are negatively sanctioned by peers for academic success, while their similar white peers are not sanctioned\u2014misses the possibility that some students preemptively pull back academic effort without having received sanctions. This article tests a weak version of the hypothesis\u2014that some academically engaged African American students perceive the costs of peer sanctions to be sufficiently high to scale back overt academic engagement before receiving peer sanctions. The weak version predicts sufficiently high costs of sanctions in schools with racialized social norms about academic engagement. The author uses multilevel modeling to test strong and weak versions of the hypothesis on a nationally representative sample of African American and white students. While the results do not support the strong version of the acting white hypothesis, they point to a mild form of the weak version of the hypothesis.\n      </p>", "Several different self\u2010incompatibility (SI) syndromes have been previously reported from Polemoniaceae, including differences in genetic control, timing of the response, and the location of pollen tube inhibition. In order to examine the evolutionary linkage between genetic control and site of pollen tube inhibition, crossing experiments and microscopic analyses were performed on an additional species of Polemoniaceae, Ipomopsis tenuifolia. Thirteen individuals from a natural population were used for the parental crosses; three F1 full\u2010sibling arrays were grown to maturity. Strong self\u2010incompatibility was found in the parental population on the basis of significant differences in the percentages of seed set in self\u2010 versus outcross matings. In the F1 arrays, none of the outcrosses or backcrosses was completely incompatible, leading to a large number of mating types. On the basis of the number of mating types in the F1 arrays, self\u2010recognition in this species must be based on full allelic matching of at least three loci. Pollen tubes were observed inside the ovary after both cross\u2010 and self\u2010pollination using SEM and fluorescent microscopy, suggesting that self\u2010pollination recognition takes place in the ovule, representing a late\u2010acting SI system. The large number of different SI mechanisms reported in the Polemoniaceae suggest that this family may be particularly labile in its breeding system.\n      </p>", "Recently, site-directed mutagenesis uncovered four positive cis-acting elements in the 5' promoter region of the chicken skeletal \u03b1-actin gene that directs myogenic tissue-restricted expression. In this study, interactions between the four promoter sites were examined by means of a series of insertion mutations that increased the linker region between adjacent elements by roughly half or complete DNA helical turns. Unexpectedly, transcriptional activity for all three sets of linker mutants, as assayed with a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene, was found to vary in a fashion resembling a damped sinusoid with a period of roughly 10 base pairs, where the sinusoidal maxima appeared when length was increased by half-integral number of helix turns. We present a model which states that in the undistorted wild-type 5' flanking sequence, linker domains position each of the four promoter sites on the helix face opposite that of its immediate neighbors; when any of the three linkers is increased by approximately a half-integral number of helix turns, pairs of neighboring promoter sites are brought into alignment. We propose that this is the required orientation for inducing skeletal muscle-specific promoter activity, achieved in the wild-type promoter as a result of protein-induced torsional deformation.\n      </p>", "The pharmacokinetics of a long-acting oxytetracycline preparation administered i.v. and i.m. to American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) at 10 mg/kg was determined. Plasma levels of oxytetracycline were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography, and the resulting concentration versus time curve was analyzed using compartmental modeling and noncompartmental modeling techniques for i.v. and i.m. samples, respectively. A two-compartment model best represented the i.v. data. Intravenous administration of oxytetracycline resulted in an extrapolated mean plasma concentration at time zero of 60.63 \u00b1 28.26 \u03bcg/ml, with average plasma drug levels of 2.82 \u00b1 0.71 \u03bcg/ml at the end of the 192-hr sampling period. Plasma volume of distribution for i.v. oxytetracycline was 0.20 \u00b1 0.09 L/kg, with a harmonic mean elimination half-life of 15.15 hr and mean total body clearance rate of 0.007 \u00b1 0.002 L/hr/kg. Intramuscular administration of oxytetracycline achieved a mean peak plasma concentration of 6.85 \u00b1 1.96 \u03bcg/ml at 1 hr after administration, with average plasma drug levels of 4.96 \u00b1 1.97 \u03bcg/ml at the end of the 192-hr sampling period. The harmonic mean terminal elimination half-life for i.m. oxytetracycline was 131.23 hr. Based on the results of this study, long-acting preparations of oxytetracycline administered parenterally to American alligators at 10 mg/kg q 5 days is expected to maintain plasma concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration of 4.0 \u03bcg/ml for susceptible organisms.\n      </p>", "Functional tests, performed by microinjection into Xenopus laevis oocytes, show that a DNA fragment containing the modulator of the early histone H2A gene of Paracentrotus lividus enhances transcription of a reporter gene when located, in the physiological orientation, upstream of the tk basal promoter. Gel retardation and DNase I footprinting assays further reveal that the H2A modulator contains at least two binding sites [upstream sequence elements 1 and 2 (USE 1 and USE 2)] for nuclear factors extracted from sea urchin embryos, which actively transcribe the early histone gene set. Interestingly, USE 1 is highly homologous to a cis-acting element previously identified in the H2A modulator of Psammechinus miliaris [Grosschedl, R., M\u00e4chler, M., Rohrer, U. &amp; Birnstiel, M. L. (1983) Nucleic Acids Res. 11, 8123-8136]. Finally, a cloned oligonucleotide containing the USE 1 sequence competes efficiently in Xenopus oocytes with the H2A modulator to prevent enhancement of transcription of the reporter gene. From these results, we conclude that USE 1 and perhaps USE 2 in the H2A modulator are upstream transcriptional elements that are recognized by trans-acting factors common to Xenopus and sea urchin.\n      </p>", "Although breeding system investigations were previously performed in only nine of the 100 Tabebuia species, indications of self\u2010incompatibility have been found in all of them, and the four species studied for the site of incompatibility reaction showed some kind of late\u2010acting self\u2010incompatibility. Polyembryony has been found in T. chrysotricha and T. ochracea, with adventitious origin of the extra embryos being shown in the latter. We investigated the breeding system in five species of Tabebuia by hand\u2010pollination experiments, fluorescence microscopy study of in situ pollen tube growth, and histological analysis of postpollination events. Although both T. chrysotricha and T. heptaphylla developed fruits by self\u2010pollination, polyembryony was verified only in the former, which indicates that self\u2010fertility in Tabebuia is not necessarily associated with apomixis. The remaining species were 100% self\u2010sterile. Although some penetrated ovules in crossed pistils of T. vellosoi were found at the 48\u2010h interval, none of the ovules in selfed pistil was penetrated at the same interval, with penetration of many ovules occurring 72 h postpollination. In T. impetiginosa, ovule penetration efficiency 48 h after pollination was higher in cross\u2010 than in self\u2010pollinated pistils, and the majority of the ovules in selfed pistils were penetrated and fertilized in 72 h. The incidences of ovule fertilization and endosperm initiation were significantly slower in selfed compared with crossed pistils, and a clear developmental slowdown of the endosperm occurred in selfed pistils before abscission, although no other signs of developmental malfunctions were detected. In all of the self\u2010sterile species, abortion of selfed pistils occurred in a small period after pollination, and no swelling of the ovary was observed in T. umbellata. All of these results agree with the occurrence of late\u2010acting self\u2010incompatibility in T. impetiginosa, T. umbellata, and T. vellosoi, and no evidence was found that self\u2010sterility in these species is due to inbreeding depression.\n      </p>", "Recent scholarship on sati has stressed the fact that the 'problem' of sati is that the problem extends far beyond and begins far before the act itself. One of the things that lies prior to and post the act is language, yet sati is an act that stands in a curious relationship to language. I will examine the relationship between the physical act of sati and the language that surrounds it: the 'story' prior to the act which gives the act its meaning; the act itself which stands in an ironic relationship to the story - I will argue that the act is in fact possible only because it displaces the original story, so that every act of becoming sati presents itself not as a radical act in experience, but as an 'acting out' of the original story. It is in this acting out of a displaced story, that the boundary between the physical act and language becomes obscured and the body doing the act begins to occupy a liminal position, as it itself begins to function as a language - a language, which in its aspect of an 'acting out' obscures its own act. Lastly, I will consider the implications of the symbolic language of sati for the contemporary woman.\n      </p>", "The long-acting tranquilizers zuclopenthixol decanoate and pipothiazine palmitate were used to calm recently captured red-necked wallabies (Macropus rufogriseus). The two drugs were administered in combination at dose rates of 7.5, 10, and 15 mg/kg, and the response of the wallabies was monitored and compared with an untreated group. Giving both drugs at a dose rate of 10 mg/kg produced the most consistent levels of tranquilization. Tranquilization at all dose rates declined after 10 days. No side effects were observed, although elevated plasma fibrinogen and alkaline phosphatase levels occurred in all animals.\n      </p>", "Thirteen adult free-living male African elephants (Loxodonta africana) were anesthetized and given 20-100 g of a long-acting oxytetracycline (OTC) preparation either i.m. or i.v. Five dosages were established based on body measurements (the sum of the body length and the girth in centimeters). Serum concentrations of OTC were measured 48 hr after injection. Serum concentrations \u22650.5 \u03bcg/ml were measured in 11 of 12 elephants receiving OTC dosages of 52-133 mg/cm either i.v. or i.m. The i.m. administration route produced serum concentrations from 0.75-1.6 \u03bcg/ml in four of four elephants. A dosage of 60-80 mg/cm i.m. or i.v. should provide a therapeutic serum concentration of OTC for at least 48 hr. The use of an i.v. catheter avoids multiple i.m. injections of large drug volumes.\n      </p>", "Efficiency is understood as the purpose of machines, as an indisputable mechanical attribute intrinsic to them as objects, but this article suggests that it is articulated in their images.

I begin by noting that my original definition of \"the burden of 'acting White'\" should not be confused with a prominent misconception of the problem as the \"fear\" of \"acting White.\" I then offer a revised definition that has emerged in the wake of the collision of meanings attributed to the Capital High study. At the core of the twists and turns this concept has taken is attempted identity theft: In exchange for what is conventionally identified as success, racially defined Black bodies are compelled to perform a White identity by mimicking the cultural, linguistic, and economic practices historically affiliated with the hegemonic rule of Euro-Americans. Third, drawing on recent work on the impact of gender-specific racial performances on Black males' and Black females' academic success, I analyze quantitative data from Capital High to explain the gender-specific response patterns of male and female students to the dilemmas implicit in academic success. Finally, I suggest possible implications of the centrality of the burden of \"acting White\" for the academic performance of Black students and the identity of African Americans more generally.\n      </p>", "The art of acting has been defined as the ability to live truthfully under imaginary circumstances. Our many years of researching theatrical expertise have produced findings relevant to text comprehension, learning theory, cognitive aging, and expert memory. In this article, we first discuss how large amounts of dialogue, learned in a very short period, can be reproduced in real time with complete spontaneity. We then turn to abstracting the essence of acting and applying it to diverse undertakings, from discovering optimal learning strategies to promoting healthy cognitive aging. Finally, we address the implications of acting expertise on current theories of embodied cognition.\n      </p>", "Two independent cis-acting insulin response elements (IREs) in the gene encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate: NAD+ oxidoreductase (phosphorylating), EC 1.2.1.12], designated IRE-A and IRE-B, are sufficient to direct insulin-inducible gene expression. Using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, a 4-fold increase in the amount of IRE-A DNA bound to nuclear proteins was detected when extracts isolated from insulin-stimulated differentiated 3T3-L1 cells or from the liver of rats refed a high-carbohydrate/low-fat diet after a 72-hr fast were compared to control nuclear extracts. The points of contact between protein and IRE-A DNA may represent a sequence recognized by at least one class of insulin-sensitive transcription factor(s).\n      </p>", "The murine pre-B leukemic cell line 70Z/3 contains both an unrearranged immunoglobulin \u03ba -light-chain gene and a functionally rearranged but silent \u03ba -light-chain gene. Mitogenic stimulation of growing 70Z/3 cells with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activates \u03ba -light-chain-gene transcription and results in a 10- to 20-fold increase in cytoplasmic \u03ba -light-chain mRNA. The induction of \u03ba gene expression by LPS was probed by using an inhibitor of protein synthesis. Concomitant treatment of 70Z/3 cells with LPS and cycloheximide failed to block \u03ba -light-chain mRNA accumulation, indicating that new protein synthesis is not required for the activation of \u03ba -gene expression. Treatment of 70Z/3 cells with cycloheximide alone resulted in \u03ba -mRNA induction equivalent to those produced by LPS alone. The \u03ba mRNA synthesized in the presence of cycloheximide was intact and able to direct the synthesis of \u03ba light chains. Nuclear transcription assays revealed that cycloheximide, like LPS, activated \u03ba -gene transcription. These findings indicate that the trans-acting factors necessary for \u03ba -light-chain-gene transcription are present in pre-B cells, but their activity is blocked by short-lived inhibitory proteins.\n      </p>", "Interferon (IFN) induces transcription of major histocompatibility class I genes by way of the conserved cis-acting regulatory element, termed the IFN consensus sequence (ICS). Binding of nuclear factors to the ICS was studied in gel mobility shift assays with the 5&lt;sup&gt;\u2032&lt;/sup&gt; upstream region of the murine H-2L&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; gene. We found that the ICS binds a constitutive nuclear factor present in lymphocytes and fibroblasts regardless of IFN treatment. Within 1 hr after IFN treatment, new ICS binding activity was induced, which consisted of at least two binding activities distinguished by their requirement for de novo protein synthesis. Methylation interference and competition experiments showed that both constitutive and induced factors bind to the same \u2248 10-base-pair binding site within the ICS. Site-directed mutagenesis of H-2L&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusion genes showed that mutations in the binding site, but not in other regions of the ICS, abolish transcriptional activation of class I genes by IFN, providing evidence that specific binding of nuclear factors to the ICS is an essential requirement for transcriptional induction. Finally, we show that IFN-inducible genes of various species share a sequence motif that is capable of competing for the nuclear factors identified here. We propose that specific protein binding to the conserved motif represents a basic mechanism of IFN-mediated transcriptional induction of a number of genes.\n      </p>", "Six C-peptide deficient diabetics receiving twice daily mixtures of short and intermediate acting insulins were selected for study because of persistently raised blood glucose concentrations before and after breakfast. They were investigated to assess the effect of moving their evening injection of intermediate acting insulin to bedtime. The patients' usual twice daily insulin treatment was optimised and compared with the bedtime regimen during inpatient metabolic studies and an outpatient crossover study. With the conventional injection regimen blood glucose concentration rose sharply from 0500 to reach a fasting mean value of 10\u00b1SE 1.6 mmol/l (180\u00b129 mg/100 ml) and 16.8\u00b12.2 mmol/l (303\u00b140 mg/100 ml) after breakfast. By contrast, when the evening dose of intermediate acting insulin was delayed until bedtime the nocturnal rise in blood glucose concentration started later and was significantly lower both fasting (7.5\u00b11.1 mmol/l (135\u00b120 mg/100 ml); p&lt;0.02) and after breakfast (13.2\u00b11.4 mmol/l(238\u00b125 mg/100 ml); p&lt;0.02). Fasting blood concentrations of ketone bodies (3-hydroxybutyrate) were also significantly decreased. Plasma free insulin concentrations showed the predicted changes in five of the six patients. Blood glucose profiles collected over four months during the outpatient study confirmed the beneficial effect of giving intermediate acting insulin at bedtime.\n      </p>", "Expression of the pea rbcS-3A gene, one of a family of genes encoding the small subunit of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase [EC 4.1.1.39], is regulated by light and is restricted to chloroplast-containing cells. We analyzed the effects of light and development on rbcS-3A expression in transgenic plants. Two highly conserved sequences (``boxes'' II and III) around nucleotide position -150 (relative to the transcription initiation site, +1) are required for rbcS-3A expression. The so-defined positive elements overlap with previously identified negative light-regulatory elements. In the case of box II, which has sequence similarity to the core enhancer motif of simian virus 40, a GG\u2192 CC transversion is sufficient to abolish expression. The effect of mutations in boxes II and III can only be measured when sequences upstream of -170 are removed, because sequences both 5&lt;sup&gt;\u2032&lt;/sup&gt; and 3&lt;sup&gt;\u2032&lt;/sup&gt; of -170 can direct light-regulated and organ-specific expression. This implies that there is a redundancy of cis-acting elements in the 5&lt;sup&gt;\u2032&lt;/sup&gt; noncoding region of rbcS-3A. However, we show that the sequences upstream of -170 are dispensable only in the mature leaves of a green plant. In contrast, in the young, expanding leaves at the top of a green plant, as well as in seedlings, the distal elements are required for high-level expression. Therefore, redundancy is not absolute, and the requirements for rbcS-3A expression change during plant development.\n      </p>", "Acting out is a common occurrence in group psychotherapy.

Second, this article examines the notion of acting White and ties it to the critical literature on Whiteness, in the process demonstrating how it fosters White supremacy by making Whiteness an invisible category. Finally, it is argued that rather than a rejection of academic success, cultural agency is at the heart of Black students' resistance to acting White. It is asserted that at a fundamental level, Black students are seeking liberation from the destructive grips of White supremacy and a culturally affirming way of being human.\n      </p>", "Neo-Humean instrumentalists hold that an agent's reasons for acting are grounded in the agent's desires. Numerous objections have been leveled against this view, but the most compelling concerns the problem of \"alien desires\" - desires with which the agent does not identify. The standard version of neo-Humeanism holds that these desires, like any others, generate reasons for acting. A variant of neo-Humeanism that grounds an agent's reasons on her values, rather than all of her desires, avoids this implication, but at the cost of denying that we have reasons to act on innocent whims. A version of neo-Humeanism that holds that an agent has reason to satisfy all of her desires that are not in conflict with her values appears to allow us to grant the reason-giving force of innocent whims while denying the reason-giving force of alien desires.\n      </p>", "An unusual subset of DNA-binding proteins, termed cis-acting proteins, has been shown to act preferentially at their site of synthesis; the transposases of several bacterial insertion sequences (ISs) fall into this class. The transposase of IS903 exhibits a strong preference for action in cis: complementation of defective transposons in trans occurs at less than 1%. Furthermore, transposition mediated by transposase acting in cis is extremely sensitive to the distance between the 3' end of the transposase gene and the nearest transposon inverted repeat; we find that an insertion of 1 kilobase of DNA reduces transposition to 1-2% of control levels. Here we show that there is a strong correlation between the stability of transposase and its ability to act in trans. We found that the wild-type transposase is a very unstable protein with a physical half-life of about 3 min. However, a transposase-\u03b2-galactosidase fusion protein has a much greater half-life and can act equally well in cis or in trans. In addition, the native transposase is stabilized in lon- strains of Escherichia coli, and, in these protease-deficient strains, trans action of transposase is increased 10- to 100-fold. These results suggest that instability of the IS903 transposase is a major determinant of its cis action and that the La protease, product of the lon gene, is an important determinant of transposase instability.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Naturally occurring regulatory variation is a source of genetic variability that is well documented but poorly understood. Two members of the Hawaiian picture-winged Drosophila, D. affinidisjuncta and D. hawaiiensis, display markedly different levels of alcohol dehydrogenase (alcohol: NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.1) in the larval midgut and Malpighian tubules. To analyze the regulation of the alcohol dehydrogenase genes from these two species, their homologous alcohol dehydrogenase genes were cloned and introduced, via P element-mediated transformation, into the germ line of Drosophila melanogaster. Histochemical and electrophoretic analyses of larval transformants demonstrate that major differences in the tissue-specific levels of alcohol dehydrogenase production are characteristic of the alcohol dehydrogenase genes themselves. While these results do not directly address possible species-specific differences in the tissue distribution of trans-acting regulatory components, they indicate that demonstrable differences in cis-dominant regulatory information are sufficient to account for the observed regulatory variation.\n      </p>", "The invariant chain protein is intracellularly associated with class II major histocompatibility proteins. In many cases, the expression of these molecules appears to be regulated in a similar manner. Contained within the promoter of the invariant chain gene are sequences (X and I\u03b31) that are similar to the X and Y box elements of class II genes, suggesting that these sequences might be involved in its regulation. DNase I footprinting reveals additional cis-acting elements (I\u03b32 and I\u03b33) that contain sequence similarities to NF-\u03baB and/or H2TF1/KBF1 recognition sequences. A series of fusion constructs with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene were used to analyze the role of these sequences (I\u03b31, I\u03b32, I\u03b33, and X and Y elements) in both normal and mutant B lymphocytes. These data suggest the likelihood of multiple X box proteins in B cells, which can act as both negative and positive regulatory factors.\n      </p>", "Mutations of transposable element Ac were tested for their capability to excise themselves from their location autonomously, to be excised by an active Ac, or to act in trans in the excision of an Ac\u0394 element. Removal of 101 amino acids from the N terminus of the Ac protein does not decrease excision. A cis-acting site between base pairs 186 and 207 is important for excision by the wild-type protein but is not necessary for excision by the truncated protein. Improvement of the sequence context of the first AUG does not have a significant effect. Mutations in a small open reading frame of Ac encoding a 102-amino acid protein do not visibly alter excision frequency.\n      </p>", "The temperature-sensitive mutant CRT46 of Escherichia coli K12 is unable to initiate new rounds of DNA replication at 42 degrees C. Mutants of bacteriophage P2 have been isolated, which, in the prophage state, allow mutant CRT46 to grow at 42 degrees C. The lysogenic bacteria that grow at 42 degrees C are apparently replicating under the control of prophage P2, which substitutes for the bacterial initiation system. The ability of prophage P2 to cause this suppression phenomenon depends on the position of the prophage on the bacterial chromosome. Those lysogenic strains that are able to grow at 42 degrees C all carry the prophage close to metE. The P2 mutants that allow CRT46 to grow at 42 degrees C have insertions in the early region of the P2 genome. The suppression requires the cis-acting protein formed by gene A of P2.\n      </p>", "Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), which replicates in cytoplasm of infected cells, contains and identical leader RNA sequence at the 5\u2032 end of each of the virus-specific mRNAs. Previous studies suggested that the synthesis of these mRNAs does not involve conventional RNA splicing and may instead require priming by a free leader RNA. In this communication, we demonstrate that, during a mixed infection with two different MHVs, the leader RNA sequences from one virus could be detected on the mRNAs of the coinfecting virus at a high frequency, as if the leader sequence and mRNAs were joined together from two randomly segregating RNA segments. This finding demonstrates that MHV mRNA transcription utilizes independently transcribed leader RNA species that possess the trans-acting property. This study thus provides further evidence in support of the unique model of ``leaderprimed transcription'' for coronavirus mRNA synthesis.\n      </p>", "Alternative splicing generates various Ly-5 glycoprotein isoforms of the cell surface that typify different cell lineages and stages of hematopoietic differentiation in the mouse; exons 4-6 are incorporated to generate a B-cell isoform (B220) and excluded from a T-cell isoform (T200), the other coding exons (3 and 7-33) being shared. As a first step to understanding the mechanisms regulating Ly-5 alternative splicing, and thus determining Ly-5 isoforms, a minigene representing exons 3-7 was transfected into Ly-5-expressor T cells and B cells and into nonexpressor L cells for comparison of splicing patterns. We conclude that all the information required for faithful splice-site selection according to cell type is contained within the resulting pre-mRNA. The splicing pattern manifested by nonexpressor L cells may represent a default and nonregulated type. We postulate trans-acting factor(s) to account for the selection of appropriate exons, and we provide support for this interpretation from analysis of fused hybrid T-B cells, which exhibited B-cell specific Ly-5 transcripts. Splicing patterns were well conserved despite substantial disruption of constructs. However, extensive deletion analyses suggested that cis sequences flanking and within exon 6 affect the exclusion of that exon in T cells.\n      </p>", "Two long-acting neuroleptics were used to tranquilize nine captive cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus). Perphenazine enanthate (3.0 mg/kg) and zuclopenthixol acetate (0.6 mg/kg) were each administered to separate groups of three cheetahs in a double blind trial. Both products were administered together to a third group of three animals at the same dosages. Behavioral effect, duration of effect, and possible side effects were observed by a predefined protocol. Under standardized holding conditions, the cheetahs were observed 5 days before drug administration and 14 days after administration. Daily activity was defined and statistically evaluated by a U-test. A significant reduction of activity was observed after administration in all three trials. Zuclopenthixol acetate at 0.6 mg/kg alone and in combination with perphenazine enanthate caused inappetence, ataxia, extra pyramidal reactions, akathisia, and prolapse of the third eyelid. Zuclopenthixol acetate should not be used in cheetahs. Perphenazine enanthate did not cause inappetence, reduced appetite, or any of the previously mentioned side effects when used alone. It produced satisfactory tranquilization and is suitable and safe for cheetahs at 3.0 mg/kg. This dosage should be varied depending on health, age, and temperament of the individual cheetah.\n      </p>", "In this article, I reflect on Signithia Fordham and John Ogbu's classic research on the \"burden of 'acting White'\" to develop a long overdue dialogue between Africana studies and critical white studies. It highlights the dialectical nature of Fordham and Ogbu's philosophy of race and critical race theory by locating the origins of the \"burden of 'acting White'\" in the work of W.E.B. Du Bois, who provides some of the intellectual foundations for this work. Following the work of F. W. Twine and C. Gallagher (2008), I then survey the field of critical whiteness studies and outline an emerging third wave in this interdisciplinary field. This new wave of research utilizes the following five elements that form its basic core: (1) the centrality of race and racism and their intersectionality with other forms of oppression; (2) challenging white supremacy, patriarchy, heteronormativity, and other dominant ideologies; (3) a critical reflexivity that addresses how various formulations of whiteness are situated in relation to contemporary formulations of Black/people of color identity formation, politics, and knowledge construction; (4) innovative research methodologies including asset-based research approaches; and, finally, (5) a racial elasticity that identifies the ways in which white racial power and pigmentocracy are continually reconstituting themselves in the color-blind era and beyond (see A. A. Akom 2008c).\n      </p>", "In this paper I examine the effects that the competitive environment in which plants are grown and the timing of herbivore damage have on the expression and pattern of selection acting on plant tolerance to herbivory and resistance to herbivores. I conducted a field experiment involving 720 plants from 24 full-sib families of the common morning glory, Ipomoea purpurea. Plants were grown in one of two competitive environments, and the levels of resistance and tolerance to naturally occurring folivory expressed by the 24 families were estimated three times during the growing season: soon after plants emerged, when plants began to flower, and when seed capsules began to mature. Low- and high-competition environments were established using different densities of interspecific competitors. Herbivory had a negative effect on plant fitness in both competitive environments, and consistent with the compensatory continuum hypothesis, herbivory was more detrimental in the high- than low-competition environments. Phenotypic analyses also revealed that early- and late-season damage were more detrimental than mid-season herbivore damage. Although fitness was more negatively affected by herbivore damage in the high- than low-competition environments, competition did not affect the pattern of selection acting on defense traits. Similarly, the patterns of selection acting on either resistance or tolerance to early-, mid-, and late-season herbivory did not differ significantly. Therefore, there was little evidence that environmental or seasonal differences in the pattern of selection acting on defense traits will constrain their evolution.\n      </p>", "I defend a strong version of the Kantian claim that actions done solely from duty have moral worth by (1) considering \"pure\" cases of acting from duty, (2) showing that love and sympathy, unlike a sense of duty, can often lead us to do the wrong thing, (3) carefully distinguishing moral from non-moral virtues, and (4) by distinguishing pathological sympathy from practical sympathy. Not only is acting purely from a sense of duty superior to acting from love and sympathetic feelings, but the cold-heartedness found in Kant's examples should be thought of as a virtue rather than a vice.\n      </p>", "Tissue-specific factors control the differential expression of nuclear genes encoding plastid proteins. To identify some of these factors, the light-independent spinach RPL21 gene encoding the plastid ribosomal protein L21 was chosen as a model. The RPL21 promoter organization was defined by transient and stable transfections of RPL21 promoter deletion mutants fused to a reporter gene. The following results were obtained. (1) We identified a strong core promoter, spanning the transcription start site region, sufficient to drive high levels of gene expression. (2) We identified two non-overlapping positive and negative domains, located upstream from the core promoter region, that modulate core promoter activity independently of light. (3) We found that the positive domain contains a new cis-acting element, the S2 site, related to but different from the light-responsive GT-1 binding site. We show that the S2 site binds a leaf-specific nuclear factor (named S2F). The S2 site is conserved in the promoter region of many nuclear genes encoding plastid proteins. Experiments with transgenic tobacco plants confirmed that the S2 site is critical for positive domain activity in leaf tissues. The S2 site is thus identified as a new tissue-specific, light-independent regulatory element.\n      </p>", "Let $B$ be a ring, $G$ a finite group of automorphisms acting on $B$ and $B^G$ the fixed subring of $B$.

In contrast to representational and/or mimetic meta-theories of acting, which construct their views of action from a position as an outside observer to the process/phenomenon of acting, an enactive view provides an account of acting from \"inside\" the process itself-that is, from the perspective of the actor as enactor/doer. Acting is not to be viewed as embodying a representation of a role or a character, but rather should be understood as a dynamic, lived experience in which the actor is responsive to the demands of the particular moment within a specific (theatrical) environment.\n      </p>", "This study, like numerous others, found parental absence to be associated with problematic behavior on behalf of children. Sex of the absent parent was found to be correlated with the type behavior manifested; absence of the father with \"acting-out\" and absence of the mother with \"acting-in\" behavior. This relationship existed regardless of whether parental absence precipitated the problematic behavior or merely aggravated and caused pre-existing problems to become worse. The propensity of children of absent fathers to act-out and of absent mothers to act-in was shown to be related to whether children were aware of their parents' incarceration. This association was true of those children who were told their parents were in prison but untrue of those offspring who were led to believe that their mother or father was absent for other more socially acceptable reasons.\n      </p>", "Sensations of acting and control have been neglected in theory of action. I argue that they form the core of action and are integral and indispensible parts of our actions, participating as they do in feedback loops consisting of our intentions in acting, the bodily movements required for acting and the sensations of acting. These feedback loops underlie all activities in which we engage when we act and generate our control over our movements. The events required for action according to the causal theory, or Searle's theory, do not add up to agency. I find the agent at work, her engagement in her action, in her sensation of acting. It is often thought that bodily movements are either mere events or actions. I suggest that there is a third possibility: that they are activities which are not actions. Activities, whether they are actions or not, differ from mere events in that they are controlled from within the brain. They are actions only if this control forms agent control, that is, control in which the conscious mind, the agents' intentions in acting and her sensations of acting, participates. Internally wayward actions are characterized by the fact that the person involved does not have a sensation of action and therefore does not control her movements. In the absence of such a sensation she does not act.\n      </p>", "To establish on a quantitative basis the subcellular distribution of the enzymes that glycosylate dolichyl phosphate in rat liver, preliminary kinetic studies on the transfer of mannose, glucose, and N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate from the respective 14C-labeled nucleotide sugars to exogenous dolichyl phosphate were conducted in liver microsomes. Mannosyltransferase, glucosyltransferase, and, to a lesser extent, N-acetylglucosamine-phosphotransferase were found to be very unstable at 37\u00b0C in the presence of Triton X-100, which was nevertheless required to disperse the membranes and the lipid acceptor in the aqueous reaction medium. The enzymes became fairly stable in the range of 10-17\u00b0C and the reactions then proceeded at a constant velocity for at least 15 min. Conditions under which the reaction products are formed in amount proportional to that of microsomes added are described. For N-acetylglucosaminephosphotransferase it was necessary to supplement the incubation medium with microsomal lipids. Subsequently, liver homogenates were fractionated by differential centrifugation, and the microsome fraction, which contained the bulk of the enzymes glycosylating dolichyl phosphate, was analyzed by isopycnic centrifugation in a sucrose gradient without any previous treatment, or after addition of digitonin. The centrifugation behavior of these enzymes was compared to that of a number of reference enzymes for the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi complex, the plasma membranes, and mitochondria. It was very similar to that of enzymes of the endoplasmic reticulum, especially glucose-6-phosphatase. Subcellular preparations enriched in Golgi complex elements, plasma membranes, outer membranes of mitochondria, or mitoplasts showed for the transferases acting on dolichyl phosphate relative activities similar to that of glucose-6-phosphatase. It is concluded that glycosylation of dolichyl phosphate into mannose, glucose, and N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate derivatives is restricted to the endoplasmic reticulum in liver cells, and that the enzymes involved are similarly active in the smooth and in the rough elements.\n      </p>", "The function of the 5&lt;sup&gt;\u2032&lt;/sup&gt;-flanking region of a rat glutathione S-transferase Ya subunit structural gene has been examined in homologous and heterologous cells. By using the 5&lt;sup&gt;\u2032&lt;/sup&gt;-flanking region of the Ya subunit gene fused to the structural gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, we have identified two cis-acting regulatory elements in the upstream region of the Ya gene. One element is required for maximum basal level expression in homologous cells, whereas the second element is required for inducible expression of the Ya gene by planar aromatic compounds such as \u03b2 -naphthoflavone. The cis-acting element required for inducible expression of the Ya gene by \u03b2 -naphthoflavone is functional only in cells with normal dioxin receptors.\n      </p>", "In herpes simplex virus 1-infected cells, the transcription of \u03b1 genes, the first set of genes to be expressed, is induced by a virion component, the \u03b1 -trans-induction factor, and requires a cis site. Homologs of the cis site are present in the promoter-regulatory domains of all \u03b1 genes and bind two cellular proteins designated as \u03b1 H1 and \u03b1 H2-\u03b1 H3. We report that \u03b1 -trans-induction factor, synthesized in vitro or present in nuclear extracts of infected cells, forms complexes with viral DNA fragments containing its cis-acting site only in the presence of cellular proteins and only under conditions that also enable the binding of the \u03b1 H1 protein to the DNA. The induction of \u03b1 genes by \u03b1 -trans-induction factor appears, therefore, to be mediated by the interaction of the viral protein with cellular proteins at its cis-acting site.\n      </p>", "Replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is dependent on the viral Rev protein. This protein acts in concert with the cis-acting rev-responsive element present in intron-containing RNAs to facilitate nuclear export of these RNAs. Here we show that a cis-acting 219-nucleotide sequence from an unrelated \"simple\" retrovirus, Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV), enables Rev-independent HIV-1 replication. This sequence is present in an untranslated region near the 3' end of the MPMV genome. The MPMV element is also able to efficiently substitute for Rev in expression of Gag/Pol and Env proteins from subgenomic constructs. We hypothesize that the MPMV element functions by interacting with a cellular factor that plays a role in mRNA transport analogous to that of the Rev protein. It might be possible to exploit this element in the development of an HIV vaccine.\n      </p>", "The negative factor (nef) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 acts to down-regulate virus replication. To decipher the step in the virus life cycle affected by nef, functional proviral clones with (pHIV F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) or without (pHIV F&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) a deletion mutation in the nef gene were constructed. In CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells, 30- to 50-fold more virus was produced over the course of 18-20 days with cultures infected with F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; compared to F&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; virus. In CD4&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; cell lines, 2- to 10-fold greater virus production was found from cultures transfected with pHIV F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; than those transfected with pHIV F&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The negative regulatory effects of nef on pHIV F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; could be supplied in trans with a plasmid expressing only the nef gene product. Virus produced by COS-1 cells transfected with pHIV F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; or pHIV F&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; showed similar binding, uptake, uncoating, and reverse transcription. Analysis of HIV-1 RNA and structural protein levels and rates of viral RNA synthesis in CD4&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; cells also showed 2- to 10-fold higher levels in cells transfected with pHIV F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; compared to pHIV F&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The activity of a HIV-1-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) plasmid was also suppressed by nef, whereas other CAT plasmids were unaffected. These findings demonstrate that nef acts as a specific silencer of HIV-1 transcription. This activity may be critical for maintenance of HIV-1 latency in vivo.\n      </p>", "Expression of class II genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) has been studied in an Abelson-murine-leukemia-virus-transformed pre-B-cell line, R8, and its class II molecule (Ia)-negative variant, R8205. These variant cells contained barely detectable levels of RNA specific for all class II genes, including the nonpolymorphic invariant chain gene (Ii), and did not express cell surface Ia. Fusion of this murine Ia-negative cell line to the human Ia-positive Raji cell produced an interspecies hybridoma that expressed the murine Ia. These data are further evidence for the existence of a trans-acting factor(s) that can regulate class II gene expression. Furthermore, the T-cell-derived lymphokine B-cell-stimulatory factor 1 (BSF-1) induced expression of class II genes in the R8205 cells. Exposure of R8205 cells to an antibody that has been shown to mimic BSF-1 activity on normal B cells also resulted in expression of class II genes. These data demonstrate that three distinct signals--a lymphokine, an alloantibody binding to membrane structures, and an interspecies trans-acting factor--can induce expression of class II genes.\n      </p>", "The adjacent and divergently transcribed yp1 and yp2 genes of Drosophila were separated at a site that is 342 base pairs upstream of yp2 and 883 base pairs upstream of yp1. Each gene was separately used to transform Drosophila germ-line-producing flies with a single copy of the introduced gene. Transcripts from the introduced genes were found only in adult females. Thus, the introduced genes maintain the sex- and time-specific expression pattern of the endogenous yp genes. However, the pattern of tissue-specific expression differed among the two introduced genes and the endogenous genes. Transcripts from both of the endogenous genes are found in fat bodies and ovaries. In contrast, transcripts from the introduced yp1 gene are found only in fat bodies, and those from the introduced yp2 gene are found only in ovaries. Thus, each introduced DNA segment lacks at least one of the cis-acting elements required for the normal pattern of tissue-specific expression. These results indicate that the expression of a yp gene in different tissues is determined by different cis-acting elements.\n      </p>", "The selective transcription of the Rat insulin 1 gene is mainly dependent on a beta-cell-specific enhancer element located in the 5&lt;sup&gt;\u2032&lt;/sup&gt; flanking DNA. In analogy to many other viral and cellular enhancers, the insulin enhancer has been shown to be of a mosaic structure and the cis-acting elements of importance for the enhancer activity have been defined. Two short sequences are of crucial importance for the enhancer activity since mutation of either sequence leads to a decrease in activity (by a factor of \u2248 10), and the double mutant eliminates all enhancer activity. This study shows that these two major cis-acting elements interact with beta-cell-specific proteins. These two enhancer modules carry an 8-base-pair homology and compete with each other for protein binding, suggesting that they interact with the same protein, designated insulin enhancer binding factor 1 (IEF 1). Since mutation of these sequences eliminates the enhancer activity and protein binding, we propose that IEF 1 is the key regulator controlling the selective activity of the insulin gene enhancer.\n      </p>", "X-ray studies on human insulins prepared by semisynthetic and biosynthetic methods have recently been undertaken. Human insulin differs from porcine insulin only at the COOH terminus of the B-chain. The present study reports the crystal structure of 4-zinc human insulin, which is used clinically as a slow-acting preparation. The structure has been refined, using 1.85- angstrom resolution data, to a residual of 0.173. The unit cell is rhombohedral, space group R3, with hexagonal cell constants a = 80.953 and c = 37.636 angstrom, and it is nearly isomorphous with that of 4-zinc porcine insulin. As a result of a conformational change of the first eight residues of the B-chain of molecule 1 from an extended conformation observed in the 2-zinc structure to an \u03b1 -helical one, the coordination around one of the zinc ions on the 3-fold axis has changed, an additional zinc ion in a general position is bound by the hexamer, and additional hydrogen-bonded interactions help stabilize dimer and hexamer formation. Unlike the surface of the 2-zinc insulin hexamer, which possesses a shallow depression containing a zinc ion and its coordinating water molecules, the 4-zinc human insulin hexamer contains a zinc and chloride ion at the bottom of an 8- angstrom tunnel produced by three parallel \u03b1 -helices. These \u03b1 -helices shield the zinc ion from the environment, decreasing the rate of dissociation of the hexamer, and provide an explanation for the slow-acting aspect of the 4-zinc crystalline form.\n      </p>", "Studies of RNA replication among the positive-strand RNA animal viruses have been hindered by the apparent inability of their RNA-dependent RNA polymerases to initiate replication on the corresponding negative-sense RNAs. However, here I report that in the case of the nodavirus flock house virus (FHV), which has a bipartite positive-sense RNA genome, the viral RNA replicase can replicate a negativesense transcript of the genome segment that encodes the viral capsid proteins. For this work, the FHV replication cycle was experimentally reconstructed in baby hamster kidney cells that were transfected with specialized transcription plasmids designed to direct the synthesis of RNAs which corresponded closely to the two genome segments of FHV. The RNA replicase encoded by the larger genome segment could utilize either the positive or the negative strand of the smaller segment as a template, and it catalyzed RNA replication to produce similar RNA products in the two situations. Surprisingly, studies of the nucleotide sequences that were required for replication showed that the 3' end of the negative-strand RNA contained only a minimal cis-acting signal. The success of these experiments will facilitate further studies of the cis- and trans-acting factors involved in the recognition and replication of negative-sense RNA in this system.\n      </p>", "Transposition of Tn5 and of its component insertion sequence IS50R is regulated through the action of two proteins it encodes: a cis-acting transposase, Tnp, and a trans-acting inhibitor of transposition, Inh. The mechanism of the cis-acting Tnp and the relevance of inhibition to cis action have been addressed in the current study. A specific colony morphology assay for transposition of Tn5 was shown to be sensitive to Inh produced in trans and was used to screen for mutants in Inh and/or Tnp with altered regulation. A dominant mutant in IS50R that promotes transposition in trans was isolated and characterized. The mutant (449F) carries a Leu \u2192 Phe mutation at position 449 in Tnp. This mutation reduces the frequency of Tn5 or IS50R transposition in cis but allows Tnp-449F to act as efficiently in trans as it does in cis. Tnp-449F is sensitive to inhibition and, furthermore, Inh-449F is a competent inhibitor in trans. These results show that Tnp-449F is a trans-acting transposase, unlike wild-type Tnp, which is cis-acting.\n      </p>", "This paper formalizes a widely discussed peer effect titled \"acting White.\" \"Acting White\" is modeled as a two-audience signaling quandary: signals that induce high wages can be signals that induce peer group rejection.

Stimulation of in vitro transcription mediated by the enhancer element involves its recognition by specific trans-acting factors present in the nuclear extract.

At least nine sites of protein-DNA interaction were detected over \u2248 400 base pairs of enhancer sequence. The regions of nuclease protection are associated with 21-, 19-, 18-, and 17-base-pair repeat elements as well as with a unique sequence, creating a large nucleoprotein complex.

With such late-acting self-incompatibility, mixed loads of self-and cross-pollen can be extremely wasteful by causing abortion of whole fruits and consequent wastage of both cross-pollen and cross-fertilized ovules. We contend that the evolution of pollinia and loss of carpel fusion in certain Apocynaceae represent adaptations to prevent or compensate for these negative effects of mixed pollen loads. Trends in the agglutination of pollen can be seen in the tetrads of Apocynum L., which are transported on sticky band-like translators; the masses of tetrads of Periplocoideae, which are deposited onto the sticky scoop portion of a spoon-like translator; the pollinia of Secamonoideae, which have a clip-like translator but no outer covering; and the pollinia of Asclepiadoideae, which are completely enclosed by a waxy outer covering. In many genera of the Rauvolfioideae, the ovary is syncarpous, but in most Apocynoideae and all Periplocoideae and Secamonoideae, the gynoecium consists of two carpels that are free in the ovule-bearing region but fused in the upper region to produce a compitum, which enables pollen placed on one stigmatic area to supply pollen tubes to both ovaries. In at least some Asclepiadoideae, however, a compitum is lacking, although postgenital fusion between the carpel apices still takes place. Parallel trends in pollen delivery and receipt also occur in taxa from other angiosperm families in which late-acting self-incompatibility systems have been implicated.\n      </p>", "In contrast with our previous results (Hen, R., Borrelli, E. &amp; Chambon, P. (1985) Science 230, 1391-1394), which demonstrated that the mouse immunoglobulin heavy chain transcriptional enhancer is repressed in lymphoid cells by the products of the adenovirus type 2 E1A transcription unit, we show here that these products activate the same enhancer in mouse fibroblast L cell lines that contain stably integrated copies of a recombinant in which the enhancer is inserted upstream from the chicken conalbumin promoter. In addition, competition experiments suggest that the activity of the heavy chain enhancer may be repressed by a trans-acting factor in mouse L cells.

[Environ Health Perspect 111:681-687 (2003)] recently concluded that \"dioxin TEQ [toxic equivalent] exposures within roughly 3-fold of current background levels may be carcinogenic\" to humans. In contrast, my meta-analysis using an interceptonly model implied zero additional human cancer deaths from all exposures to dioxin-like compounds, including those arising via dietary intake. How can different investigators reach such markedly different conclusions from similar analyses of essentially the same data? The answer lies in different selections for a dose metric, different assumptions regarding the elimination half-life for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in humans, different assumptions regarding the importance of the most recent 15 years of exposure, and extrapolations from potential effects of TCDD exposure to potential effects of TEQ exposures. Resolution of the ongoing debate regarding the potential human carcinogenicity of dioxin will require detailed information on exposure to TCDD and on direct-acting carcinogens in the workplace, as well as a dose-response model that adequately reflects TCDD's characteristics as a promoter.\n      </p>", "The synthesis of cytochrome P-450c is induced remarkably in cultured cells as well as animal tissues in response to added chemicals such as 3-methylcholanthrene and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin. To study this mechanism, we joined the sequence of 5\u2032-flanking and upstream regions of the P-450c gene to the structural gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. The fusion gene was introduced into Hepa-1 cells for the assay of the expressed acetyltransferase activity. At least three cis-acting regulatory regions that are responsible for the inductive expression were determined in the sequences from nucleotide -3674 to -3067, from -1682 to -1429, and from -1139 to -1029, relative to the transcription start site, by external deletion analysis. Further detailed analysis of the region (nucleotides -1139 to -1029) most influential on the inducibility revealed that a regulatory element consisting of 10 base pairs termed a drug regulatory element (DRE) and its homologues were tandemly arranged in this region. The consensus sequence deduced from DREs is 5\u2032-C GN $_{\\text{G}}^{\\text{T}}{}_{\\text{G}}^{\\text{A}}$ GCTGGG-3 $^{\\ prime}$ .

Various regions of the 5&lt;sup&gt;\u2032&lt;/sup&gt; flanking sequence were fused with a bacterial chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase gene. The transcriptional activity of each construct was determined by the transient expression assay after introduction into a hepatoma cell line. Multiple regulatory elements were identified. Two enhancing elements were located 2.5 and 2.2 kilobases upstream from the transcription start site and designated GST-P enhancers I and II (GPEI and GPEII, respectively). A consensus sequence of the phorbol 12-O-tetradecanoate 13-acetate responsive elements was present in the GPEI and at position -61. GPEII contained two of the simian virus 40 and one of the polyoma enhancer core-like sequences. A silencing element was also found 400 base pairs upstream from the cap site. In accordance with the above observation, endogenous GST-P gene was found to be stimulated when the rat fibroblast line 3Y1 was treated with phorbol 12-O-tetradecanoate 13-acetate. Phorbol 12-O-tetradecanoate 13-acetate enhanced the expression of the transfected GST-P gene to a much higher degree in HeLa cells than in the hepatoma cells, which constitutively expressed the endogenous GST-P. The results are discussed in terms of the specific derepression of GST-P gene during hepatocarcinogenesis in the rat.\n      </p>", "Murine embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells are refractory to infection by retroviruses because retroviral long terminal repeat (LTR) enhancers have little activity in EC cells. A previous report described the isolation of clonal EC cell lines that express the integrated neomycin-resistance gene (neo) linked to the Moloney murine leukemia virus LTR. The expression of the neo gene was explained by a cis-acting mechanism [Taketo, M., Gilboa, E. &amp; Sherman, M. I. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 2422-2426]. From one such EC cell line, we isolated the flanking cellular sequence 5\u2032 to the proviral genome, ligated it to various test constructs, and transfected into the parental EC cells. The cellular sequence increased expression of the LTR-linked neo gene significantly, in a manner independent of its orientation and position. The neo mRNA was initiated at the bona fide promoter of the LTR. By deletion analyses, we defined a region of DNA essential for the enhancer activity and determined its sequence. This region contains distinctly characteristic stretches as well as some similarity to various viral and cellular enhancers. Thus the LTR-linked neo gene is expressed because the provirus is integrated in the vicinity of this enhancer that is active in undifferentiated EC cells.\n      </p>", "To determine whether hepatitis B virus (HBV) regulates the expression of the human \u03b2 -interferon gene, a series of recombinant bovine papilloma virus plasmids containing the human interferon gene and various fragments of the HBV genome were constructed and used to transform C127 cells, a murine fibroblast line. Analysis of the DNA from transformed C127 cells indicated that the interferon gene was intact and that the plasmids replicated as stable multicopy elements. The 1828-base-pair BamHI HBV DNA fragment containing the core antigen gene, but not the 2755-base-pair Bgl II HBV DNA fragment encoding both the surface antigen and the X antigen, suppressed the production of human \u03b2 -interferon. No effect by any of the recombinant plasmids on the synthesis of murine interferon was detected. The suppression of human \u03b2 -interferon by HBV occurs via a trans-acting factor. A frameshift mutation within the HBV core gene alleviates the inhibitory activity; thus we infer that the core protein is this factor or is crucially associated with this activity.\n      </p>", "Prophages P1 and Mu produce a trans-acting factor possessing the din+ activity which catalyzes the inversion of the specific DNA segment responsible for flagellar phase variation of Salmonella. din mutants were isolated from P1CMclr100 phage by selecting phages that did not suppress the yh2 mutation of Salmonella in prophage state. No inversion loop structure was detected among DNA forms arising after denaturation and rehybridization of DNAs extracted from the din mutants. The DNA fragment containing C region of P1 was cloned on a plasmid vector, pCR1. The resulting hybrid plasmid, pKK2, was shown to possess the din+ activity: the vh2 mutant of Salmonella harboring the plasmid changed the flagellar phase. From analysis of the plasmid by use of BamHI and Bgl II, the din gene specifying the din+ activity was located near or within the C region of P1. It is highly plausible that the din gene of P1 was also involved in the inversion of the C region. Similarly, the DNA fragment containing the G and \u03b2 segments of Mu was cloned on pCR1. The resulting hybrid plasmid, pKK101, also possessed the din+ activity.\n      </p>", "Mutations in the unc-52 gene on linkage group II retard the construction of body-wall muscle sarcomeres during larval development in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Unc-52 mutants show decreased accumulation of myosin heavy chains relative to other polypeptides during larval development, correlating with the structural retardation. Pulse radiolabeling experiments show that decreased synthesis of specific body-wall myosin heavy chains that are encoded by the unc-54 gene on linkage group I is responsible for the defective myosin accumulation. In the wild type, a constant ratio of the synthesis of the unc-54-coded myosin B to myosin A, about 2:1, is maintained during the larval stages in which the synthesis of both myosins increases exponentially and rapid sarcomere growth and addition ensues. During the first 26 hr of larval development, before any structural or behavioral effects of unc-52 mutations are apparent, the synthesis of myosin heavy chains is also normal. By 38 hr, decreased synthesis of myosin B is detected in the unc-52 mutant SU200, when sarcomere growth slows considerably. The effects of mutation in the unc-52 locus are trans acting upon the synthesis of unc-54-coded myosin in a specific set of muscle cells during a defined period of larval development.\n      </p>", "Affective delivery, or expressing positive emotions in service interactions, helps satisfy customers. But employees cannot always feel positive and, to avoid breaking display rules, may act. Surface acting (modifying facial expressions) and deep acting (modifying inner feelings) were tested as predictors of stress and of coworker-rated affective delivery. Consistent with a dramaturgical perspective, affective delivery ratings were negatively related to surface acting but positively related to deep acting. Surface acting, but not deep acting, was related to stress.\n      </p>", "Murine embryonal carcinoma F9 cells, which do not express appreciable levels of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I mRNA, start to express the mRNA and proteins upon differentiation induced by retinoic acid (RA). To investigate the molecular mechanism of this regulation, we examined in F9 cells transient expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene directed by the 5&lt;sup&gt;\u2032&lt;/sup&gt; flanking region of a MHC class I gene, H-2L&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;. The native 1.4-kilobase H-2L&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; 5&lt;sup&gt;\u2032&lt;/sup&gt; upstream region gave very low CAT activity in undifferentiated F9 cells. Deletion between positions -210 and -135 relative to the cap site resulted in a 4- to 5-fold increase in CAT activity as compared with constructs containing the region. However, all of these constructs, regardless of the deletion, expressed comparable CAT activity in differentiated F9 cells. These data suggest the presence of a negative cis-acting element that is under developmental control. Further analysis revealed that the sequence conferring the negative regulation resides between positions -195 and -161. This region, highly conserved among the MHC class I genes, is found to be capable of increasing CAT activity in NIH 3T3 cells that express the class I genes constitutively. Further, this regulatory sequence, when connected to the simian virus 40 promoter, produced repressive and enhancing effects in F9 and NIH 3T3 cells, respectively. Based on these results, we suggest that the expression of MHC class I genes during development involves switching from negative to positive regulation dictated by the class I regulatory element located between positions -195 and -161.\n      </p>", "The K562 human leukemia cell is an erythroid-like cell that may serve as a model for the study of globin gene expression in transcriptionally active human erythroid cells. K562 cells express all globin genes with the exception of that for \u03b2 -globin; failure to produce \u03b2 -globin could result from an acquired mutation in each of the \u03b2 -globin genes or from an alteration in the regulatory factor environment of the \u03b2 -globin gene. To uncover a possible acquired mutation, restriction endonuclease analysis of genomic K562 DNA and expression studies of a cloned K562 \u03b2 -globin gene were carried out. Restriction endonuclease analysis revealed no structural alteration of the K562 \u03b2 -globin genes. Analysis of the polymorphic Ava II site in intervening sequence 2 of the \u03b2 -globin gene showed that K562 cells contain two different \u03b2 -globin alleles, both of which are inactive. A K562 \u03b2 -globin gene was cloned, ligated into the expression vector pLTN3B, and introduced into COS cells. Transcripts were analyzed by RNA blot, dot blot, S1 nuclease mapping, and primer extension assay. The cloned K562 \u03b2 -globin gene was transcribed in COS cells as efficiently as a normal \u03b2 -globin gene introduced into COS cells; the mRNA was 10 S and polyadenylylated; the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini and the processing of transcripts were identical to that of mRNA transcribed from a normal gene. Based on these data we suggest that the absence of \u03b2 -globin gene expression results not from an alteration in the \u03b2 -globin gene, but from a quantitative or qualitative alteration in a trans-acting factor important in \u03b2 -globin gene expression.\n      </p>", "The insertion sequence IS903 has perfect, 18-base-pair terminal repeats that are the presumed binding sites of its transposase. We have isolated mutations throughout this inverted repeat and analyzed their effect on transposition. We show that every position in the inverted repeat (with the possible exception of position 4) is important for efficient transposition. Furthermore, various substitutions at a single position can have a wide range of effects. Analysis of these hierarchical effects suggests that transposase contacts the minor groove in the region from position 13 to position 16 but makes major groove (or more complex) interactions with the outer portion of the inverted repeat. Our data indicate that the transposase exhibits relaxed specificity for the ``second'' end of a transposed segment; the defect in transposition of virtually all mutant inverted repeats can be rescued by a wild-type end. However, this rescue exhibits a pronounced position effect; in most cases, it is efficient only when the wild-type end is close to the 3&lt;sup&gt;\u2032&lt;/sup&gt; end of the transposase gene. This confirms the cis-acting nature of the transposase protein and suggests the initial transposase-inverted repeat interaction is the rate-limiting step in transposition. From the behavior of transposons with one mutant and one wild-type end, we infer that the inverted repeat contains two functional domains--one for initial complex formation with transposase and the other for effective completion of transpositional recombination. To support this hypothesis we show that an end with a mutation in one domain can significantly rescue an end with a mutation in the other domain.\n      </p>", "Transcription of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes is regulated by the conserved MHC class I regulatory element (CRE). The CRE has two factor-binding sites, region I and region II, both of which elicit enhancer function. By screening a mouse \u03bb gt11 library with the CRE as a probe, we isolated a cDNA clone that encodes a protein capable of binding to region II of the CRE. This protein, H-2RIIBP (H-2 region II binding protein), bound to the native region II sequence, but not to other MHC cis-acting sequences or to mutant region II sequences, similar to the naturally occurring region II factor in mouse cells. The deduced amino acid sequence of H-2RIIBP revealed two putative zinc fingers homologous to the DNA-binding domain of steroid/thyroid hormone receptors. Although sequence similarity in other regions was minimal, H-2RIIBP has apparent modular domains characteristic of the nuclear hormone receptors. Further analyses showed that both H-2RIIBP and the natural region II factor bind to the estrogen response element (ERE) of the vitellogenin A2 gene. The ERE is composed of a palindrome, and half of this palindrome resembles the region II binding site of the MHC CRE. These results indicate that H-2RIIBP (i) is a member of the superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors and (ii) may regulate not only MHC class I genes but also genes containing the ERE and related sequences. Sequences homologous to the H-2RIIBP gene are widely conserved in the animal kingdom. H-2RIIBP mRNA is expressed in many mouse tissues, in agreement with the distribution of the natural region II factor.\n      </p>", "In most angiosperms, the endosperm develops before the embryo, but with harmony between the two structures until final seed formation. In an embryological study, we show that inbreeding depression causes disharmony in development of the two structures in two Leguminosae shrubs, Cytisus multiflorus and C. striatus. Our main objective was to test the causes of self-sterility in the two species by comparing the embryological development of the self seeds with that of cross seeds. In developing selfed seeds of C. multiflorus, the embryo reaches at most the globular stage and never forms mature seeds, while in C. striatus a few mature selfed seeds are formed. In both species, the main cause of abortion of developing selfed seeds is diminished endosperm development (low values of the ratio of endosperm to embryo), which triggers collapse of the endosperm and embryo. The results indicate that self-sterility in C. striatus is postzygotic because of strong, early inbreeding depression, while in C. multiflorus there exists a mixed pre- and postzygotic mechanism; the prezygotic mechanism causes rejection of some self-pollen tubes in the style/ovary, and the early inbreeding depression triggers abortion of fertilized ovules that escaped that action.\n      </p>", "The resistance of some minority students to school is a topic of great theoretical and practical concern for educators.

In particular, we prove that the fundamental group of a finite, developable complex of groups will have finite asymptotic dimension provided the geometric realization of the development has finite asymptotic dimension and the vertex groups are finitely generated and have finite asymptotic dimension. We also prove that property A is preserved by this construction provided the geometric realization of the development has finite asymptotic dimension and the vertex groups all have property A. These results naturally extend the corresponding results on preservation of these large-scale properties for fundamental groups of graphs of groups. We also use an example to show that the requirement that the development have finite asymptotic dimension cannot be relaxed.\n      </p>", "In most self-incompatible (SI) plants, pollen tube growth in self-pollinated flowers is inhibited on the stigma or in the style. SI systems that operate in the ovary have been assumed to be extremely rare. Evidence from many plant species is presented to show that the SI barriers in the ovary, described here as late-acting SI systems, are quite common. The late-acting SI systems are divided into four categories: (1) ovarian inhibition of incompatible pollen tubes before the ovule is reached; (2) prefertilization inhibition in the ovule; (3) post-zygotic rejection of the embryo, and (4) ovular inhibition for which the cytological details have not been established. Whether or not post-zygotic incompatibility systems can be distinguished from inbreeding depression depends upon the assumptions underlying the genetic models of self-incompatibility. However, four approaches are outlined that could distinguish between active uniform rejections that are presumably evolved responses to inbreeding depression and the passive, variable failures that are commonly understood to be expressions of typical inbreeding depression. Possible advantages of late-acting SI include an extended period of time over which pollen genotypes may be evaluated by the maternal parent and greater flexibility in the choice of male parents. Due to a paucity of data regarding the genetics and physiology of late-acting SI systems, little can be said at this time about the possible diversity of such systems of their evolutionary relationships with classical game-tophytic and sporophytic SI. An hypothesis for the operation of post-zygotic SI is described whereby maternal resources to developing embryos are terminated if the embryo (and/or endosperm) fall below a threshold level of heterosis. This hypothesis is a modification of one first proposed by Westoby and Rice in 1982 to explain variable maternal resource allocation to developing embryos. /// Pour la majorit\u00e9 des plantes autost\u00e9riles, la croissance du tube pollinique, lorsque l'autopollinisation a lieu, est inhib\u00e9e sur le stigmate ou dans le style.

Estimates of natural selection acting on the new population can be used to deduce maladaptation and tailor efforts to reduce its effects. We estimated natural selection acting on Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) undergoing restoration to the Connecticut River (U.S.A.). More than 3500 mark-recapture records in a small tributary (West Brook, Massachusetts) were used to estimate selection acting on body length, body mass, condition factor, and growth. Estimates were obtained for three to four different cohorts, two age classes (second and third years of life), and two seasons (winter and summer). We found little evidence that any of the traits were subject to strong directional selection (favoring larger or smaller trait values). Interestingly, fish that were larger or had higher condition factors rarely survived at higher rates, a result conflicting with the conventional \"bigger is better\" expectation. We also found little evidence that any of the traits were subject to strong or consistent stabilizing selection (favoring trait values near the mean). Our results suggest that the specific traits we examined are not limiting adaptation and are probably not preventing the population from becoming self-sustaining. Future efforts should concentrate on other potentially limiting traits, such as the timing of smolt migration. Our results also suggest that any additional introductions of exogenous fish need not be concentrated on the size or growth of juveniles in potential source populations.\n      </p>", "Actions of discrete groups on the real line are considered. When the group of homeomorphisms is solvable several sufficient conditions are given which guarantee that the group is semiconjugate to a subgroup of the affine group of the line. In the process of obtaining these results sufficient conditions are also determined for the existence of invariant (quasi-invariant) measures for abelian (solvable) groups acting on the line. It turns out, for example, that any solvable group of real analytic diffeomorphisms or a polycyclic group of homeomorphisms has a quasi-invariant measure, and that any abelian group of $C^2$ diffeomorphisms has an invariant measure. An example is given to show that some restrictions are necessary in order to obtain such conclusions. Some applications to the study of codimension one foliations are indicated.\n      </p>", "A 24-hr treatment of V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts with 12.4 \u03bc M cholesterol 5\u03b1 ,6\u03b1 -epoxide induced 8-azaguanine-resistant mutants at frequencies 4.6- to 11.8-fold higher than the spontaneous mutation rate.

Cholesterol epoxide was found to be accumulated by cells and transformed to cholestane-3\u03b2 ,5\u03b1 ,6\u03b2 -triol, which was more toxic and a more potent inhibitor of DNA synthesis than the epoxide but, at concentrations less than 17.8 \u03bc M, was not significantly mutagenic. Consideration of the rates of cholesterol epoxide conversion to cholestane triol shows that this conversion can result in abolition of the mutagenicity of the epoxide. Conditions under which conversion of the epoxide to the triol is low, as in the case of low epoxide hydrolase activity, favor mutagenicity whereas rapid conversion to triol favors cytotoxicity.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Let M = G/L be a compact homogeneous manifold with G acting effectively and with a G-invariant CR structure of hypersurface type; then any maximal compact subgroup K $\\subset $ G acts transitively on M.\n      </p>", "We prove that groups acting geometrically on \u03b4-quasiconvex spaces contain no essential Baumslag-Solitar quotients as subgroups.

SQ12 employs microfluidic spheres encasing OTC crystals, which allows for longer release of the OTC compared with other injectable antibiotics. The objectives of the study were to determine serum and tissue levels of SQ12 in turkey breeder hens to 14 days postinjection and to evaluate effects of SQ12 on reproductive status. Thirty photostimulated hens were housed in litter floor pens and provided with 14.5 hr of light per day in a curtain-sided facility. Six hens served as untreated controls. Twelve hens per treatment group received SQ injections in the neck with SQ12 at 11.4 (L dose group) or 22.7 mg/kg (H dose group) to assess low and high doses, respectively. Serum samples were obtained from each hen at predose and 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 168, 240, and 336 hr postinjection. All hens were euthanatized at 14 and 15 days postinjection. One-half of the hens in each treatment group were sampled (liver, lung, kidneys, and breast muscle) for tissue residue levels of OTC. The control group had no detectable OTC in serum or tissues at any sample collection time. There were no detectable serum levels of OTC in either treatment group prior to injection. The average serum concentrations of the L and H dose groups showed similar depletion curves although the H dose group was 42% higher at maximum concentration than the L group. Average tissue concentration of OTC for all tissues sampled from the H dose group was twice that of the L dose group. All tissue levels were below the OTC residue tolerance limit. SQ12 provided an extended source of OTC in serum of turkey breeder hens with no effect on reproductive status. SQ12 may provide for a novel treatment of bacterial infection in turkey breeder hens with longer lasting serum levels compared with other single injectable OTC products. /// Un novedoso producto (SQ12) de aplicaci\u00f3n subcut\u00e1nea, a base de oxitetraciclina, ha sido dise\u00f1ado para ser usado en explotaciones de producci\u00f3n animal. El SQ12 emplea esferas micro fluidas que contienen oxitetraciclina en forma cristalina, lo cual permite una liberaci\u00f3n mas prolongada de la oxitetraciclina en comparaci\u00f3n con otras formas inyectables del antibi\u00f3tico. Los objetivos de este estudio fueron la determinaci\u00f3n de los niveles s\u00e9ricos y tisulares del SQ12 en las reproductoras hasta los 14 d\u00edas despu\u00e9s de la inyecci\u00f3n, y la evaluaci\u00f3n de los efectos del producto sobre el aparato reproductivo de los animales. Treinta pavas foto estimuladas fueron mantenidas en corrales, sobre piso con yacija y expuestas a 14.5 horas de luz por d\u00eda en casetas con cortinas laterales. Seis de los animales sirvieron como grupo control no inoculado. El resto de la parvada fue dividida en grupos de 12 animales por tratamiento experimental, recibiendo inyecciones subcut\u00e1neas de SQ12 a raz\u00f3n de 11.4 mg/kg (grupo de dosis baja) o 22.7 mg/kg (grupo de dosis alta), con el fin de determinar los par\u00e1metros mencionados a dosis bajas y altas del producto, respectivamente. Se tomaron muestras de sueros de cada ave antes del inicio de los tratamientos y a intervalos de 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 128, 240 y 336 d\u00edas despu\u00e9s de la inoculaci\u00f3n del producto. Todos los animales fueron sacrificados a los 14 y 15 d\u00edas despu\u00e9s del inicio del tratamiento. La mitad de los animales en cada tratamiento fueron usados para la obtenci\u00f3n de muestras de tejido (h\u00edgado, pulm\u00f3n, ri\u00f1\u00f3n y m\u00fasculo pectoral) para determinar los niveles de residuos tisulares de oxitetraciclina. El grupo control no present\u00f3 niveles detectables de oxitetraciclina en las muestras de suero o tejido en ninguna de las muestras tomadas. No se detectaron niveles s\u00e9ricos de oxitetraciclina en ninguno de los animales previo a la inoculaci\u00f3n del producto. Los promedios de las concentraciones s\u00e9ricas en los grupos de dosis alta y baja mostraron curvas similares de eliminaci\u00f3n, aunque el grupo de dosis alta present\u00f3 un promedio de concentraci\u00f3n s\u00e9rica m\u00e1xima ( C max) 42% m\u00e1s alto que el del grupo de dosis baja. Los promedios de las concentraciones tisulares de oxitetraciclina en todos los tejidos obtenidos del grupo de dosis alta fueron por lo menos dos veces m\u00e1s altos que los del grupo de dosis baja. Todos los niveles de residuos tisulares estuvieron por debajo del nivel de tolerancia m\u00e1xima residual permitidos para la oxitetraciclina. El producto SQ12 proporciona una fuente de liberaci\u00f3n prolongada de oxitetraciclina en el suero de las pavas reproductoras, sin presentar efectos adversos en el estado reproductivo de los animales. El SQ12 puede proporcionar una forma novedosa de tratamiento contra las enfermedades de origen bacteriano en las parvadas de pavos reproductores, con niveles s\u00e9ricos m\u00e1s prolongados, en comparaci\u00f3n con otras preparaciones del producto.\n      </p>", "Transacting siRNA (tasiRNA) biogenesis in Arabidopsis is initiated by microRNA (miRNA) -guided cleavage of primary transcripts. In the case of TAS3 tasiRNA formation, ARGONAUTE7 (AGO7)-miR390 complexes interact with primary transcripts at two sites, resulting in recruitment of RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE6 for dsRNA biosynthesis. An extensive screen for Arabidopsis mutants with specific defects in TAS3 tasiRNA biogenesis or function was done. This yielded numerous ago7 mutants, one dcl4 mutant, and two mutants that accumulated low levels of miR390. A direct genome sequencing-based approach to both map and rapidly identify one of the latter mutant al\u00edeles was developed. This revealed a G-to-A point mutation (mir390a-1) that was calculated to stabilize a relatively nonpaired region near the base of the MIR390a foldback, resulting in misprocessing of the miR390/miR390* duplex and subsequent reduced TAS3 tasiRNA levels. Directed substitutions, as well as analysis of variation at paralogous miR390-generating loci (MIR390a and MIR390b), indicated that base pair properties and nucleotide identity within a region 4-6 bases below the miR390/miR390* duplex region contributed to the efficiency and accuracy of precursor processing.\n      </p>", "ABSTRACT Brokeback Mountain is the first gay film to achieve major box-office success, testament to the progressive integration of homosexuality in liberal North American communities.
