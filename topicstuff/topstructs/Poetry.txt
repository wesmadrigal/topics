{"total_words": 1117, "documents": ["Although much attention has recently been given to modern little magazines, critics largely have failed to consider how the bibliographical elements of these magazines were instrumental in their production and dissemination of poetic modernism. Focusing on \"Poetry\": A Magazine of Verse, this article argues for the importance of these elements, showing how format leads to form. It contends that \"Poetry\" extended the poetic presentation already at work in middlebrow mass circulation magazines, turning the poem into an aesthetic object for contemplation isolated on the page and framed by a border of white space. Subsequently this promoted a consolidation of genre and an opening up of form that pitted \"poetry\" against popular \"verse.\" Finally, this article shows that these formal and generic innovations uniquely positioned \"Poetry\" to showcase Imagism(e) and offers a re-reading of one of its most lasting examples, Pound's \"In a Station of the Metro.\"\n      </p>", "Beno\u00eet de Cornulier's writings on French poetry concentrate on metrical boundaries, or caesura; however, the the criteria upon which he bases his analyses are useful in studying rhythm, or the relatioship between syllables within the alexandrine's two h\u00e9mistiches. This study focuses on three aspects of rhythm in French poetry: the definition of rhythm following Cornulier; the development of a method using the computer to detect rhythmic patterns in traditional isometrical alexandrines; the results of such a study when applied to three classical seventeenth-century plays which are composed of isometrical alexandrines (Corneille's Polyeucte, Racine's Ph\u00e8dre, and Moli\u00e8re's Le Tartuffe).\n      </p>", "For just over a year in 1947-1948, Muriel Spark was editor of the prestigious but conservative \"Poetry Review\" in London, the journal of the Poetry Society. This made her the only female editor of a little magazine in Britain at the time, and one of the very few in the English-speaking world. Her editorship was short-lived, apparently because her preference for modernist poetry and her policy of publishing new writers offended many of the Society's members. In this paper I look more closely at Spark's innovative editorship and the reasons it came to a premature end, drawing on a reading of the magazine and also on the Spark archives.\n      </p>", "Poet Gary Snyder talks about West Coast poetry and being a California poet.\n      </p>", "This review of Jahan Ramazani's A Transnational Poetics examines its engagement with debates about why poetry has been overlooked in transnational cultural studies and the dialogic framework and methodology that Ramazani develops for internationalizing poetry studies. Ramazani advances a critical vocabulary for characterizing the rich cross-culturalism of poetic production by adapting concepts from globalization theory such as the \u201ctranslocal.\u201d This interdisciplinary book will be of particular relevance to readers who are interested in what is at stake in internationalizing literary studies and how this transforms the practice of literary interpretation.\n      </p>", "The creation of poetry can be an intensely healing process, as therapeutic as the other arts and talking therapies. This paper examines three areas. First, it sets out some opinions about the specific qualities of poetry that make it particularly valuable as part of a therapeutic process. It goes on to give exemplified information about how poetry is used within healthcare in Britain. Finally, it indicates the current growth of interest in this area, with brief descriptions of pilot research studies where poetry has been offered by a writing therapist, or by nursing or medical practitioners.\n      </p>", "Laura Riding renounced the writing of poetry sometime shortly after the publication of her Collected Poems in 1938. She variously indicates the reasons for this refusal in her post-poetry writing, most typically explaining that poetry contains an \u201cabsolute incompatibility\u201d between what she calls its \u201ccreed\u201d and its \u201ccraft.\u201d For Riding, then, her renunciation is mandated by an essential character of poetry, rather than determined or shaped by historical or cultural contexts. In this essay, I attempt to read Riding's refusal against or alongside her own arguments and suggest the ways in which her departure from poetry was precipitated by a reading of modernism as both the fulfillment and undoing of what she considered poetry's promise and possibility. Also, with reference to Maurice Blanchot, George Bataille and Jean-Luc Nancy's reading of Rimbaud, I argue that Riding's renunciation is a refusal of \u201cpoetry as philosophy\u201d that, rather than putting an end to poetry, extends its possibilities. I conclude my essay with a discussion, by way of Jerome McGann, of Riding and her relationship to the Language Poets.\n      </p>", "It is argued that concepts of what is poetry and what is a journal are broader than might be considered and vital to the spirit of I AM in us. It begins with word derivations that shed light on conceptual connections that might otherwise be missed.

Conclusion: We are I AM and I AM is us.\n      </p>", "Music has had a presence in the poetry of Jos\u00e9 Hierro from his first collection, \"Tierra sin nosotros\", to his most recent \"Cuaderno de Nueva York\". For the poet and scholars, music plays a pivotal role in the expression of emotion, an artistic goal that is central to the poet's concept of what poetry is and what it should do. While music is implicated in the expression of emotion, to date, there have been no studies that explain this relationship. The Symbolists' notion of music's inherent ambiguity as a model for poetic language, and Nieztsche's concept of musical dissonance help to contextualize Hierro's use of music as a metaphor and aesthetic model. As a metaphor signifying unlimited imaginative potential, music becomes for the poet a means for suggesting unnamed emotions, for conveying temporal existence, and ultimately, for negotiating the sense of Otherness that one may feel in foreign cultures.\n      </p>", "\"Russell Simmons Presents Def Poetry\" is a cable phenomenon bringing the art of performance poetry into the homes of millions of television viewers. Performance poetry is present for a new generation to appreciate. This research focuses on how the African oral element of nommo is present in \"Russell Simmons Presents Def Poetry\". This research seeks to uncover how the concept of nommo is manifested in \"Def Poetry\" and how the use of nommo becomes an effective element in this genre. Using an Afrocentric rhetorical analysis, the characteristics of nommo studied were rhythm, soundin' out, repetition, stylin', lyrical quality, improvisation, historical perspective, indirection, call and response, and mythication.\n      </p>", "The extraordinary oeuvre of Spanish poet Claudio Rodr\u00edguez (1934-1999) has been examined in the light of literary history and theory and of philosophies of communication, but the question of how his work relates to its social and historical context has received much less attention. Through considering his treatment of childhood and the sympathy for innocent, vulnerable creatures expressed in his poetry, we discover a voice that rejects the predominant masculinist discourse of the Spanish postwar period and provides an alternative to the militant Christianity espoused by the Franco regime. The application of Bakhtinian theory to Rodr\u00edguez's poetry reveals his contestatory response to rigid gender roles and to the discourse of power that characterized the Franco regime, allowing us to question narrow genre distinctions that define poetry as monologic and to connect his poetry to the wider literary panorama of the Spanish postwar period.\n      </p>", "'Altering the past' is a semi-quotation from T. S. Eliot's 'Tradition and the Individual Talent': With respect to the formal(ist) principles embraced in the 1960s by the Northern Irish poets Seamus Heaney, Derek Mahon, and Michael Longley, Edna Longley asks whether this aesthetic, and its subsequent influence, might retrospectively modify canons of modern poetry. Starting with a comparison between Eliot's view of tradition and that of W. B. Yeats, Longley traces the way in which the Yeatsian view of tradition has been redefined by various Northern Irish poets. She also examines certain assumptions which have governed the criticism of Northern Irish poetry and the ideological difficulties in the way of perceiving it as a collective and thus more powerful phenomenon.\n      </p>", "This article explores the limits of a thematic approach to the recovery of political modes of signification in statehood-generation poetry. I challenge, through a neo-Adornian perspective, the common view that statehood-generation poetry is either fundamentally apolitical or always aligned with normative statist/universalist positions. In the process I explore those aspects of Yehuda Amichai's early work, collected in Shirim, 1948\u20131962, that were perceived as revolutionary and even dangerous. Through close readings of two lyric poems, \u201cTo the Full Severity of Compassion\u201d and \u201cI Want to Die in My Bed,\u201d I demonstrate how biblical allusions and carefully crafted intertextual play work together with metaphor and other stylistic formations of verbal art to create a strong, if oblique or \u201cnegative,\u201d critique of bellicose nationalism and to register an unequivocal protest against the valorization of militarism and triumphalist statism.\n      </p>", "On October 30, 1975\u2014a historical pivot point between 1930s film noir and 1990s gangsta rap\u2014 Bay Area poet Nashira Priester introduced to San Francisco State University\u2019s (SFSU) Poetry Center audience the city\u2019s latest musical outlaws: the West Coast Gangster Choir, a multi-racial ensemble of vocalists and musicians led by then-emerging poet Jessica Hagedorn.

By way of a stylistic approach \u2014 foregrounding the recurrence of a specific vocabulary related to painting, of formal and pictorial frames (the picture within a picture) and of images suggestively symbolical \u2014, the analysis will reveal that, in spite of the informality of the dialogue enhanced by the use of free verse lines, the poem actually becomes a dialogue between the art of painting and the art of poetry. /// O presente trabalho faz uma leitura do poema \"Conversation\" (1997), de P.K.Page, que reproduz a lembran\u00e7a de um di\u00e1logo entre a poeta canadense e o embaixador israelense Arie Aroch, enquanto ambos pintavam um quadro no est\u00fadio da Estrada da G\u00e1vea, no Rio de Janeiro.

Both Ranci\u00e8re and the Language Poets, I argue, make a political claim for the aesthetic by way of writing's disruptive reconfiguring of ordinary forms of sensory experience. Also, both position aesthetics as anterior to politics and thereby grant to aesthetics a determining relation to the political. While in part interested in making plain the parallels between Ranci\u00e8re and the Language Poets, the essay also argues that this \u201cthinking together\u201d permits both a clarification of the political aesthetic project of Language Poetry and a recognition of a substantial shift in Ranci\u00e8re's thinking as he moves from political philosophy to aesthetics.\n      </p>", "Critics conventionally turn to Jos\u00e9 Lezama Lima's essays to describe his poetic system. Relatively rare in Lezama criticism are readings of individual poems. Since Lezama is commonly described as a neo-baroque poet, the absence of studies of the intertextual relationships between Lezama's poetic language and that of his Golden Age precursors is surprising. Lezama's dialogue with the poetry of Golden Age Spain is especially intense in \"Ah, que t\u00fa escapes.\" The poem, with its rich recasting of the poetic language of the Spanish baroque, is also an allegory of the reading experience.\n      </p>", "The tradition of composing epitaphs was popular throughout Europe. Religious content was joined by commemoration of a person\u2019s station in life or even commemoration of nonpersons such as dogs. Playfulness and satire were standard elements of epitaphs during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Humor appeared in epitaphs, which became known as \u201ctavern\u201d or \u201cpot poetry\u201d when composed in the convivial company of others. The British Isles has been full of friendships between poets and the keepers of pubs. Many of the first have left us word of the second. Epitaphs remembering landlords, brewers, drinkers, drunkards, and teetotallers make up a genre of their own. A number of those have been collected for the purpose of this essay.\n      </p>", "This article explores the use of poetic form for the transcription of an oral history interview. It looks at the poetic form's effect on analysis, the method of poetic transcription, writing as an analytical process, the suitability of poetry to representing discourse and the effects and implications of using a literary form.

I focused on her central role in the construction of the social identity of the village. I explored song as a narrative form through which members of this group were building a distinctive sense of belonging. While many inhabitants of this community used to perform songs, Kouskoussaina was locally recognised as particularly gifted. Her poetry gave voice to complex community memories of the Ottoman Empire. Through her poetry, multiple pre-national recollections associated with the recent past in the Ottoman Empire were revealed. My investigation used participant observation and oral history techniques.\n      </p>", "The teaching of literature through CAI raises problems of both a linguistic and instructional nature; student involvement and creativity in studying literature, and especially poetry, is difficult to build into a computer-based lesson. We have confronted these difficulties in the lesson Poetry I, which introduces undergraduates to basic concepts of poetic verse in a design using screen display, speech synthesis, and verse processing to maximize interactivity and student involvement. The lesson contains instructional modules which include the student's composition of a limerick. Computational processing of the limerick's text enables the program to offer guidance as the student composes and revises the verse and gains first-hand experience with metrical language. The significant problems inherent in processing verse are addressed by adapting Digital Equipment Corporation's DECTalk speech synthesizer as an engine converting natural language verse text into accessible strings of phonemic symbols. Although the verse processor cannot \"scan\" verse, it can interpret DECTalk's symbols reliably enough to successfully stimulate students' thinking about their verse compositions. Preliminary responses to the program have been favorable and demonstrate its effectiveness in involving students more deeply in learning about poetic verse. This suggests that the techniques of verse processing prototyped in Poetry I might be usefully extended to other types of verse and levels of study.\n      </p>", "Gloria Fuertes is considered a leader in contemporary peninsular poetry, and yet a clear understanding of her poetics and of her uniqueness has not been achieved. Her distinctive poetics and persona are here considered in the context of her relationship to the peninsular poets of her generation and the public that she creates. The form of her poems suggests that Gloria Fuertes transforms our perception of poetry by demystifying the poet and by degentrifying poetic language. Her poems typically are of a dual nature, a simple narration which, at the same time, presents a literary topos in a new light. Fuertes creates a new poetics by substituting each of the elements of the poetic discourse, the text, the poet, and the reader. She replaces them with her own popularized versions, thus creating a powerful poetic style that answers the quest of her generation for a new aesthetics of poetry.\n      </p>", "Applying the method of discourse structure analysis described by Grosz and Sidner to lyric poetry, one views the poet as the Initiating Conversational Participant, and the reader as the Other Conversational Participant as she recreates the poem upon reading it. In poetry the linguistic and intentional structures function in counterpoint to the metrical and stanzaic structures, respectively, producing the effects that define poetry. Analysis of attentional state can reveal the dynamics of the focussing process in a poem, providing a unique perspective on its operation. More research is needed to extend the theory to adequately handle lyric poetry.\n      </p>", "Lesley Wheeler's Voicing American Poetry is a synthetic investigation into the several meanings of \u201cvoice\u201d in the context of written, spoken and recorded poetry of the twentieth century. In five case studies, Wheeler interrelates textual manifestations of voice, technologies of sound production and dissemination, and collaborative poetics that call attention to the bodies that produce poetry. By doing so, Wheeler aims to demonstrate and encourage conversation among communities of poets, listeners, and readers that often disagree about the proper uses of and audiences for poetry. While the work sometimes loses its focus on these goals, the insightful and engaging case studies indicate the fruitfulness and future potential of Wheeler's synthetic approach to poetic voice.\n      </p>", "This article discusses the interaction between convention, as perpetuated by the oral tradition, and the artist's individual touch in vernacular Najdi poetry (also called Naba\u1e6di poetry). The focus is on the introductory verses-the equivalent of the classical \"nas\u012bb\"-which picture the highly charged state of mind that induced the artist to compose his poem. Within these preludes the description of the creative process itself features as a distinct subtheme. Thus the conventional framework of the \"nas\u012bb\" offers ample scope for the expression of the Arabian poet's personal feeling and sense of individuality. This paper gives particular attention to the imagery and extended similes that translate these surges of emotion into dramatic scenes from the life of the Bedouins and villagers of the Najd. This is illustrated with examples from modern Bedouin poetry based on taped records, and preludial verses by a generation of premodern Najdi poets taken from written Saudi sources. The article is rounded off with a conclusion offering some general thoughts on the interplay between the tradition and the poet's individuality within the wider context of the modern development of Saudi Arabia.\n      </p>", "This article consists of ethnographic drama, poetry, and prose. Following interpretivist traditions focusing on how individuals make sense of and make meaning from their lived experience, the author, a heterosexual woman, travels with a gay male friend/participant to visit his estranged father, a retired Air Force pilot and elder in the Mormon Church. The work attempts to show the dialogic construction, negotiation, and transformation of identities and relationships.\n      </p>", "An adaptation of Carol Myers-Scotton's Markedness model serves to explore the use of code switching (CS) in bilingual poetry from a sociolinguistic perspective. This model accounts for the speaker's sociopsychological motivations when they engage in CS: the use of CS can be interpreted as either a marked or an unmarked choice of discourse mode. Transplanting this perspective to the analysis of poetry while taking into account the nature of the intended readership, it can be said that the author makes a marked choice when he/she wishes special consideration from the reader: the use of culturally loaded Spanish words that are intimately connected to ethnic identity is an example of this mode. But poetry exhibits another type of switching: the type considered unmarked or expected in oral in-group communication. In this case by using the preferred form among bilingual peers the author expands the medium (from oral to written) and thus, the forum of CS as an expected discourse mode.\n      </p>", "The paper examines the historical and literary characteristics of mul \"wine\" in Persian poetry. Unlike may, which is a wide-spread term denoting \"wine\" in New Persian, mul is never employed in the writings of many outstanding representatives of Persian poetry-from the early period until R\u016bdak\u012b and Daq\u012bq\u012b.

It surveys the major paradigms and methods in this regard, exploring the viable alternatives and possibilities for reading the tradition. Modern African poetry in the context of the essay refers to African poetry in the received European languages--English, French and Portuguese--but for practical convenience, its focus is limited to modern African poetry of English expression and, to some extent, Francophone African poetry in English translation. The study assesses significant efforts made by African and non-African critics with regard to defining the tradition of modern African poetry. The notion of critical reception in the study is, consequently, so inclusive that it accommodates practices as diverse as canon formation, the formulation of critical criteria and the construction of African literary geography. /// Cet article analyse la production de savoir critique dans les \u00e9tudes consacr\u00e9es \u00e0 la litt\u00e9rature africaine, et plus particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 la po\u00e9sie africaine moderne.

Then I discuss the connections between the images that the poem's male speaker/driver sees. These images seem to be both unlinked and linked: they aggressively flaunt an I-see-this-I-see-that aesthetic, and they subtly suggest a passing\" narrative of voyeurism. Finally, Ispeculate on how the poem's verbal and visual inventiveness implies a dynamic theory of ekphrasis.\n      </p>", "In his poetry, Cardenal presents the Aztecs as a symbol of evil due to their militarism and practice of human sacrifice, while the two pre-Hispanic Mexican heroes, Quetzalcoatl and Nezahualcoyotl, symbolize righteousness because of their peaceful religious and civilized practices. Through this contrast among indigenous figures, Cardenal indirectly denounces contemporary social injustices committed by dictators and imperialists, and implies their inevitable downfall. Cardenal uses a variety of historical and literary sources such as Nahuatl poetry to interpret pre-Hispanic indigenous society, and literary critics have not questioned the historical validity of such representations. Cardenal's interpretation relies heavily on the images of the Aztecs, Quetzalcoatl, and Nezahualcoyotl that were influenced by a colonial ideology. Ironically, by doing so, Cardenal engages in a colonization of indigenous culture, the kind of activity that he condemns.\n      </p>", "Une des fonctions de la po\u00e9sie manganja est de r\u00e9soudre une situation conflictuelle.

This in its turn will formulate the nature and status of women's poetry in the twenty-first century. In surveying twentieth-century poetry in Britain, the signs are that just as the label 'poetess' was a handicap to the self-perception of a woman at the beginning of this century, so the label 'woman poet' will shackle her in the next, largely because her end-of-the-twentieth-century predecessors will have become mythologized as a literary underclass, undermined and overlooked. One reason for the pattern of the last three hundred years, where women publish and then slip from literary histories, is that they do not receive proper attention from male-dominated literary criticism. Although women now seem to be sufficiently published to make segregation unnecessary, there is still a case for positive discrimination or their names will disappear from the records. Positive discrimination in the form of gendered segregation is, however, opposed by poets because of their uneasy relationship with one another. Women poets need an alternative line of development to the 'masculinity complex' whereby they unsuccessfully seek recognition within the male traditions, or the 'female affiliation complex' which prevents them from identifying themselves with one another. It will be argued that there is an emerging tendency in recent poets to plunder and appropriate the associations of the male tradition and that feminist critics need to theorize this aesthetic and make connections between poets so that they become positive role models for poets of the future.\n      </p>", "Contemporary French poetry is not without paradox.

Many consider Walt Whitman the poet of democracy, so perhaps it is not so surprising that Dewey himself admired him as the \u201cseer\u201d of democracy. My paper will use Whitman's poetry to illuminate a level of communication almost always entirely ignored by philosophers and political theorists, yet critical to all human (and oftentimes human-animal) interaction. Whitman's poetry artfully achieves unhindered communication at the height of consummatory aesthetic experience. However, it also achieves expansive community through communion at a primordial nonlinguistic, animal level. Relying on Whitman, this paper explores the pre-linguistic animal origins of meaning in Dewey's and why such a starting place remains important to the comprehension of all meaning, including especially, the most exquisite consummatory aesthetic experiences. My paper shows that such communication makes an important contribution to the emergence of linguistic communication, social cohesion, and the democratic polis.\n      </p>", "John Sitter argues that the gender of personifications in eighteenth-century English poetry is cognitively significant rather than merely conventional or \u201cgrammatical,\u201d and that many of the \u201ccelestial\u201d maids described in quasi-religious terms in the period's poetry function as permissibly secularized versions of the Blessed Virgin\u2014in a country suspicious of any leaning toward Mariolatry.

The major poetic and musical characteristics of each genre are presented, followed by an explanation of the techniques of improvisation employed during debate in the respective genres. The paper notes the limited time available to the poet-singers to produce their meaningful, artistic poetry; briefly discusses their training; and indicates the expertise of these artists, capable of improvising and singing their creative poetry while debating serious intellectual issues. The paper stresses the originality of the practice of poetic debate and its artistic, educational, and cultural values.\n      </p>", "The paper argues that there is a proper place for literature within aesthetics but that care must be taken in identifying just what the relation is. In characterising aesthetic pleasure associated with literature it is all too easy to fall into reductive accounts, for example, of literature as merely \" fine writing\". Belleslettrist or formalistic accounts of literature are rejected, as are two other kinds of reduction, to pure meaning properties and to a kind of narrative realism. The idea is developed that literature\u2014 both poetry and prose fiction\u2014 invites its own distinctive kind of aesthetic appreciation which far from being at odds with critical practice, in fact chimes well with it.\n      </p>", "A primeira parte deste trabalho \u00e9 dedicada \u00e0 no\u00e7\u00e3o de presen\u00e7a de Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht.

Presence is related to the material and bodily aspect of an aesthetic object. We have tried to bring this concept into a discussion about poetry and translation by means of a criticism of readings aimed only at finding meanings and interpreting the poems. Taking as a starting point the assumption that in poetry there is somewhat presence, it is necessary therefore to translate not only its meaning, but also its rhythm, its music, its rhymes, in other words, everything that constitutes a poem. We have also brought into this discussion a reading of Paul Zumthor with the aim of better elaborating the question of performance in poetry. After that, in a deeper elaboration of the relations between sound and meaning, Roman Jakobson's thought on the poetic function is also discussed. As a conclusion we have brought Haroldo de Campos' thought on translation in a perspective that, once more, emphasizes the material aspect of the poem.\n      </p>", "Despite the formative influence of Warren and Brandeis's article \"The Right to Privacy\" (1890) on subsequent U.S. law, few assertions have caused more confusion and dismay than their claim that privacy is protected fundamentally by the individual's right to \"an inviolate personality.\" Troubled by the evidently spiritual nature of this claim, commentators have attempted to locate privacy rights in narrower, more easily definable tort protections, like freedom from intrusion. This article makes the claim that, to be properly understood, Warren and Brandeis's emphasis on \"inviolate personality\" must be read as the culmination of a two-centuries-old debate about the nature of the individual\u2014a debate that was conducted primarily in literature, and especially in poetry. During the course of the eighteenth century, poets mounted an increasingly sophisticated attack on the dominant social-constructionist psychology of the age. In opposition to contemporary views that a person was the product of his or her environment, poets came to see the individual as self-generated\u2014through a process requiring solitude. The pivotal figure in this history is Wordsworth, whose argument and language Warren and Brandeis echo. Although some present-day scholars have attempted to recoup Warren and Brandeis's emphasis on inviolability, they have tended to do so through recourse to social-constructionist arguments. In so doing, they have missed the spirit of Warren and Brandeis's original claims.\n      </p>", "For more than three decades, Marjorie Perloff and Charles Bernstein have been our foremost champions of poetic invention. This review looks at their new books: Unoriginal Genius and Attack of the Difficult Poems, asking the question, how can poetry be original in the twenty-first century?\n         Basing her investigation in the established modernisms of Eliot, Pound and Benjamin, Marjorie Perloff suggests answers through a series of close readings of texts by poets including Yoko Tawada, Caroline Bergvall, Susan Howe and Kenneth Goldsmith. These writers, claims Perloff, represent a contemporary shift from poetries of confession or creation to poetries of reinvention, citation and translation. While addressing the same shift, Charles Bernstein's collection of \u201cessays and inventions,\u201d takes a less traditional critical approach. His speeches, reviews, satirical prose-poems and essays range in subject from Tin-Pan Alley and PennSound to the Yasusada hoax and Yiddish shtick. At times comic, at times earnest and always highly idiosyncratic, Bernstein's Attack of the Difficult Poems has something for everyone. Together, these two books blaze a trail into a new century of poetry, boldly going where, it seems, we have gone before.\n      </p>", "There remaining a few pockets of resistence to overwhelming evidence in favour of the Eastern Arabic ultimate background of the meters and metrics of Andalusi Stanzaic poetry, it behooves impartial scholarship to deal with alternative arguments eventually raised by those still defending the Hispanic hypothesis, and such is the purpose of this paper, in which the author takes issue with an allegedly early Stanzaic Irish poem with a \"zajalesque\" structure, as well as with an attempt at proving that a non-Khalilian, presumably Hispanic type of metrics was practiced in Al-Andalus.

Hill's poem responds to David V. Erdman's argument that Blake was resolutely, if ineffectually and sometimes secretly, opposed to war. It also establishes Hill's own cryptic but definite resistance to contemporary war and warmongers, while it mourns poetry's public powerlessness to halt the violent competition for material resources. Ignored by the majority, poetry fails to bring about the ethical social change that poets often envision. The layering of perspectives (Hill the poet and scholar writing about Erdman the scholar, who is explicating Blake the poet and artist) allows for a multidimensional interpretation of the role of poets and prophetic poetry. Despite their fury at society's deafness and greed, and frustration at their own incapacities, poets\u2014because if they are great poets, they are prophets, too\u2014continue to speak to their audiences about the problems of this world and about the better worlds that can be imagined.

His aloofness notwithstanding, modern tenets such as meditations on reality, debates about culture, and experimentation with music occur in Stevens's poetry. Critics often, and rightly, align the musical qualities of Stevens's verse with classical motifs. This article places the musicality of Stevens's poetry in a jazz context, and contends that poems from throughout his career - especially in Harmonium (1923) and Ideas of Order (1936) - contain jazz elements and can be read as jazz texts. Stevens employs linguistic repetitions, thematic variations, improvisatory flourishes, allusions, and wordplay that indicate the influence and presence of jazz, without ever mentioning the music by name. Ultimately, Stevens can be considered a poet who experimented with jazz, giving his work additional sonic and contextual resonance.\n      </p>", "This article is an exercise in poetic jurisprudence. It argues that Joseph Raz's political and moral philosophy and Philip Larkin's poetry can be understood as ways of becoming \"less deceived\" about the nature of social life. However, Larkin's poetry also reckons the costs of practical reason. Rather than being encouraged towards moral perfectionism, the less deceived are left with the sense of life exhausting itself and the terrible fear of death. What if reason cannot provide comfort? If the old rituals of religion are no longer sufficient, how does practical reason help us to celebrate and endure? Might there be a different thinking of human solidarity in Larkin? This takes us towards a reading of the most intriguing line from the poem \"An Arundel Tomb\": \"what will survive of us is love.\"\n      </p>", "In this 1909 lecture, E.M.

Al-Sar\u012b al-Raff\u0101\u02d2 played an important role in the expansion and development of short descriptive poetry in Arabic in the late ninth and tenth centuries. This genre of poetry uses elaborate rhetoric to provide a nuanced commentary on the role of material things, bodies (both human and non-human), and locations in social life. Short descriptive poetry is part of an expansion of the cultural sphere, which includes yet extends beyond the political sphere at this time. An important feature of short descriptive poetry is an interest in the bodily pleasures enjoyed in the context of informal sociability. Descriptions of locations in which pleasure gatherings take place situate the interiority of the pleasure scene in counterpoint to the world beyond the pleasure scene, which includes politics, the military, morality, social hierarchy, and religion. In addition, nature serves as a transition space between the interiority of the pleasure scene and the cultural sphere of the outside world. Al-Sar\u012b's descriptions of mills, bath houses, and rooms in which birds have nested illustrate this counterpoint between the drinking party and the outside world, and between the time out for pleasure and the flow of time and events in the outside world.\n      </p>", "Contemporary critics who study women's literature often focus on the very act of speaking, or the possession of a voice. The speaker in a poem seems to lend the women of her time a voice to express their feelings and in so doing offers a female perspective on social and cultural aspects of life. Adopting ideas from Virginia Woolf's \"A Room of One's Own\" as well as H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous's notion of \"writing the body,\" this article explores how women poets find a private space in their own rooms for examining \"liberated\" selves. A new conception of body and space is presented in these lyric voices. In contrast, in the voices of many critics, we hear a glaring double standard that exposes the persistence of patriarchal inhibition of women's freedom of expression. This dialogic tension between the voices reveals women's predicaments and their strong protests against the status quo in contemporary China.\n      </p>", "Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e9tica acerca dos procedimentos de cria\u00e7\u00e3o po\u00e9tica de Oswald de Andrade, tendo em vista a natureza antropof\u00e1gica de sua poesia.

Among the many painters Ashbery was to review and publish about, one was the Chicago-born, Paris-based abstract expressionist Joan Mitchell and an exhibition of hers at a Paris gallery in 1964. In this essay I examine the early, more \u201cabstract\u201d poetry that Ashbery was developing during this period, thinking about it alongside the paintings of Mitchell (and, in particular, his writings about them). My contention is that Ashbery was in many ways emboldened by Mitchell's complex engagements with representation and abstraction, especially as they relate to the landscape. Ashbery was, through his close examination of such work, moved towards ever greater poetic and linguistic experimentations of his own.\n      </p>", "This essay examines the contexts of an \"anthropological imaginary\" that inform a close reading of William Carlos Williams's Spring and All (1923). It seeks to expand the associations of modernism and anthropology from the typical conflation of these terms with the poetry of T.S. Eliot and anthropologist James Frazer by linking Williams's interests with Franz Boas, the most established anthropologist in the United States at the time. William's focus on the local is similar to Boass stress on site-specific observation. But Williams's local is the result of a pattern of dislocation in modernity, which Williams incorporates in his poems and turns back against the disembodied scientific language of anthropology that cannot record the participant-observer's disruption and desire.\n      </p>", "In the controversial question about the appropriate metrical analysis of the contemporary Bedouin \"qa\u1e63\u012bda,\" the role of different types of syllable structure in different Bedouin dialects has thus far been overlooked. It nevertheless presents itself as a most fundamental issue associated with a further question about the implications of the spread of a poetic tradition over a linguistically heterogeneous area. Najd is recognized as the core area of the Bedouin \"qa\u1e63\u012bda\" poetry, and the Najdi-type dialects display a syllable structure closely akin to the type postulated for the quantitative metrical analysis. On the other hand, the different syllable structure of the dialects outside the core area has gradually undermined the metrical role of the stress. As a result, from the strictly synchronic point of view, stress may in some areas be defined as the basis of the metrical structure of Bedouin poetry.\n      </p>", "Este trabalho estuda a po\u00e9tica de Manuel Bandeira a partir de um ponto de vista do cr\u00edtico Otto Maria Carpeaux, aceito pelo poeta: a possibilidade de apreender o itiner\u00e1rio po\u00e9tico do autor de Estrela da vida inteira tomando como base duas de suas poesias \u2014 \"Pneumot\u00f3rax\" e \"Can\u00e7\u00e3o do vento e da minha vida\".

Clare directly confronted what it means to lose one's place in the world, to be exiled from a place not because you have left it, but because it has left you. No Romantic poet wrote more passionately than Clare about the joy of experiencing nature in all its immediacy, and no poet argued more strongly for its permanence and continuity across generations, and yet few poets have conveyed in more poignant terms what it means to lose one's nature for good. This paper considers Clare as a poet who writes about what it means to experience the end of nature and to live on long after the nature that one took to be basic to one's life was gone. Although for many people during the nineteenth century such an idea was unthinkable, for many others, especially in colonial contexts, it was a fact of life. Alongside the many new natures that were coming into being at this time, others were being destroyed or utterly changed. Clare's poetry gives us some insight into what it meant to at least one author to survive the death of one's nature.\n      </p>", "To increase the accuracy of writing and speaking skills, students need to understand how to use the language by learning the basic parts of speech and observing grammatical structures in a meaningful context.

In 'Dilemmas and Developments: Eavan Boland Re-examined' Sarah Maguire argues that in recent years women poets have clearly achieved greater confidence as a result of changes in their audience.

Yet women's poetry of the First World War seems generally to have been condemned as 'bad'. It inspires an ambiguous response from readers who recognize the value of its historical, social and psychological content, but shudder at the limitations of its form. However, I believe that a much more fruitful reading of these 'recalcitrant' texts is possible. It is not my intention to deny either their problematic nature, or the diversity and complexity of male responses to the war, but rather to emphasize that women's experience of the First World War was radically different from that of men, and we should not therefore be constrained by the traditional parameters of 1914-18 criticism when we explore these works. This article examines a selection of this poetry in the light of the psychological processes of grief and bereavement, and in so doing indicates other areas in which constructive readings of these texts might be made. Why do we expect the articulation of a radically new and uniformly consistent poetic voice from what was a large and diverse group of women? The expectations of modernism ironically have created a literary 'mainstream' out of a selection of experimental, and largely male, writing. I hope to show that the 'failure' of these women to conform to our textual 'great expectations' is irrelevant. The single most characteristic feature of these women's experience of war was isolation. Their position had neither the homogeneity of the trenches, nor the intense intellectualism of experimental circles. Predominantly middle class, alienated by absence and bereavement, they attempted to articulate the unprecedented nature of their experience. That their experiments were not wholly successful is perhaps indicative of the near impossibility of the task they undertook.\n      </p>", "Through an engagement with Gary Watt's Equity Stirring: The Story of Justice Beyond Law, this essay explores basic questions about equity and the relations between law and literature: What is equity and why is it important?

In particular, it suggests parallels between the concerns of this work and those of feminist poststructuralism.
