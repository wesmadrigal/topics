{"total_words": 471, "documents": ["More and more resources are becoming available on the Web, and there is a growing need for infrastructures that, based on advertised descriptions, can match demands with supplies in an electronic marketplace. Several matchmakers rely on simple keyword matching, but significant matching results can only be obtained by exploiting the semantics inherent in structured descriptions. To this end, a novel knowledge representation approach is proposed, based on description logics, that is superior to both keyword- and basic subsumption-based matchmaking. The properties a matchmaker should have are formalized, and a matchmaking facilitator, compliant with the desired properties, is presented. The system embeds a NeoClassic reasoner whose structural subsumption algorithm has been modified to allow match categorization into potential and partial, and ranking of matches within categories. Experiments show good correspondence between users and system rankings.\n      </p>", "Service-oriented computing will allow for the automatic discovery, composition, binding, and invocation of Web services. The single most important component of this goal is appropriate matchmaking. This paper presents a service-description language and its associated matchmaking algorithms. Together they precisely capture requester preferences through fuzzy sets, express and use instance information for matchmaking, and deal efficiently with multiple effects. The approach described here has been extensively evaluated both in experiments and in the 2006 Semantic Web Services Challenge.\n      </p>", "Ontology languages like OWL allow for semantically rich annotation of resources (e.g., products advertised at on-line electronic marketplaces). The description logic (DL) formalism underlying OWL provides reasoning techniques that perform matchmaking on such annotations. This paper identifies peculiarities in the use of DL inferences for matchmaking that derive from OWL's open-world semantics, analyzes local closedworld reasoning for its applicability to matchmaking, and investigates the suitability of two nonmonotonic extensions to DL, autoepistemic DLs and DLs with circumscription, for local closed-world reasoning in the matchmaking context. An elaborate example of an electronic marketplace for PC product catalogs from the e-commerce domain demonstrates how these formalisms can be used to realize such scenarios.\n      </p>", "The semantic Web can make e-commerce interactions more flexible and automated by standardizing ontologies, message content, and message protocols. This paper investigates how semantic and Web Services technologies can be used to support service advertisement and discovery in e-commerce. In particular, it describes the design and implementation of a service matchmaking prototype that uses a DAML-S based ontology and a description logic reasoner to compare ontology-based service descriptions. By representing the semantics of service descriptions, the matchmaker enables the behavior of an intelligent agent to approach more closely that of a human user trying to locate suitable Web services. The performance of this prototype implementation was tested in a realistic agent-based e-commerce scenario.\n      </p>", "Matchmaking in e-marketplaces consists of finding and retrieving promising counterparts for a given request from the set of available advertisements. This paper proposes the use of nonmonotonic inferences (concept contraction and concept abduction) in a semantic-matchmaking process for ranking resource descriptions. The more amendments needed, the less is the degree of match. If a request is compatible with an advertisement but does not subsume it, concept abduction can be used to hypothesize extra features in the advertisement. The more it is necessary to hypothesize, the less is the degree of match. These basic ideas are utilized to compute a meaningful matchmaking ranking. Using logical explanations on matchmaking results, an approach and algorithms are proposed for the progressive refinement and revision of requests, up to an almost exact match. The related issue of user interaction is also tackled, and a user-friendly tool is presented that allows full utilization of the semantic-based query/revision/refinement process while completely hiding logical technicalities.\n      </p>", "Matching problems are discussed in many elementary probability books, such as Feller (1968). In one version of the problem, as described by Hodges and Lehmann (1964), the photographs of n film stars are paired randomly with n photographs of the same stars taken when they were babies, and the distribution of the number of correct matches is derived. In this paper we shall study the same problem when the photographs are paired on the basis of various measurements that are made on them, rather than randomly. For example, suppose that r different facial measurements are made on the photograph of each star and that s facial measurements are made on each baby photograph. By comparing these measurements, it will typically be possible to devise a method for pairing the photographs that will yield a larger number of correct matches than would be obtained from random pairing. In fact, the procedures that will be developed in this paper can be regarded as formalizations of the heuristic procedures that a person follows when he pairs the photographs on the basis of perceived resemblances. In other versions of the same problem, dental records of parents are to be matched with dental records of their children, or measurements made on the chest X-rays of n individuals are to be matched with other medical records of these same individuals. The problems described here are related in principle to problems of document linkage that have been treated in the statistical literature [see, e.g., DuBois (1969) and the references given there] but the models and methods that are used here seem to be new and unrelated to the models and methods that have previously been used in such problems. For any positive integer k, we shall let Rk denote the space of all k-dimensional vectors z = (z1, \u22ef, zk), where $- \\infty &lt; z_i &lt; \\infty$ for i = 1, \u22ef, k. Now let T denote an r-dimensional random vector (r \u2265 1), let U denote an s-dimensional random vector (s \u2265 1), and suppose that T and U have some specified joint distribution over the space Rr + s. We shall assume that a random sample of n vectors (t1, u1), \u22ef, (tn, un) has been drawn from this joint distribution. It is assumed, however, that before the values in this sample can be observed, each vector (ti, ui) in the sample is broken into two separate vectors, namely the vector ti with r components and the vector ui with s components. The vectors t1, \u22ef, tn are then observed in some random order, say \u03bd1, \u22ef, \u03bdn and the vectors u1, \u22ef, un are observed in some independent random order, say w1, \u22ef, wn. As a result of this randomization, it is not known how the vectors \u03bd1, \u22ef, \u03bdn and the vectors w1, \u22ef, wn were paired in the original sample. It is assumed that a priori (i.e., before the specific values of \u03bd1, \u22ef, \u03bdn and w1, \u22ef, wn are observed) all n! ways of pairing \u03bd1, \u22ef, \u03bdn with w1, \u22ef, wn are equally likely to reproduce the original sample. The observed vectors \u03bd1, \u22ef, \u03bdn and w1, \u22ef, wn will be called the values of a broken random sample from the specified joint distribution of T and U. The general problem to be considered here is that of pairing the observed vectors \u03bd1, \u22ef, \u03bdn with the observed vectors w1, \u22ef, wn in order to reproduce as many of the vectors (ti, ui) from the original sample as possible. The application of this model to the problem of matching the photographs of n individuals with their baby photographs or matching two sets of medical records of n individuals should be clear. The important assumption that we have made here is that the observations for the n given individuals can be regarded as the values in a random sample of size n from some larger population of individuals for which the probability distribution is known. In this paper we shall assume that the joint distribution of T and U can be represented by a joint pdf f of the following form: \\begin{equation*}\\tag{1.1} f(t, u) = \\alpha(t)\\beta(u) e^{\\gamma(t)\\delta(u)} \\quad t \\in R^t, u \\in R^s,\\end{equation*} where \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4 are arbitrary real-valued functions of the indicated vectors. If either r = 1 or s = 1, and if the joint distribution of T and U is a multivariate normal distribution, then their joint pdf will be of the form (1.1). A multivariate normal distribution of this type is undoubtedly the most important special case of (1.1). In particular, if both t and u are one-dimensional, the pdf of every bivariate normal distriubtions is of the form (1.1). Another example of a vivariate pdf of the form (1.1) is \\begin{align*} f(t, u) &amp;= t e^{-t(1+u)} \\\\ t &gt; 0, u &gt; 0, \\\\ &amp;= 0 \\\\ \\text{otherwise}\\end{align*} We shall now present a summary of the specific problems that will be considered in this paper and some of the results that will be obtained. In Section 2, the problem of pairing the vectors \u03bd1, \u22ef, \u03bdn with the vectors w1, \u22ef, wn in order to maximize the probability of a completely correct set of n matches is considered. It is shown that the probability is maximized if the values of \u03b3(\u03bd1), \u22ef, \u03b3(\u03bdn) are ordered from smallest to largest, the values of \u03b4(w1), \u22ef \u03b4(wn) are similarly ordered, and corresponding terms in these two orderings are paried with each other. This solution is also the maximum likelihood solution for the problem of pairing \u03bd1, \u22ef, \u03bdn with w1, \u22ef, wn. In Section 3 this maximum likelihood solution is applied to the multivariate normal distribution and is shown to have a natrual and intuitive interpretation in terms of regression. In Section 4, we consider the problem of choosing a vector wj from the set w1, \u22ef, wn in order to maximize the probability of correctly matching one specified vector \u03bd1 from the set \u03bd1, \u22ef, \u03bdn. It is shown that if \u03b3(\u03bdi) is the minimum or the maximum of the n values \u03b3(\u03bd1), \u22ef, \u03b3(\u03bdn), then \u03bdi should be paired with a vector wj for which \u03b4(wj) is a minimum or a maximum, respectively. For intermediate values of \u03b3(\u03bdi), the solution is shown to be more complicated. In Section 5, the problem of pairing \u03bd1, \u22ef, \u03bdn with the vectors w1, \u22ef, wn in order to maximize the expected number of correct matches is considered. Although the general solution of this problem is complicated, it is shown here again that the vector \u03bdi for which \u03b3(\u03bdi) is a minimum should always be paired with the vector wj for which \u03b4(wj) is a minimum and the vector \u03bdi for which \u03b3(\u03bdi) is a maximum should always be paired with the vector wj for which \u03b4(wj) is a maximum. In particular, it follows that when n = 3, the solution to this problem and the maximum likelihood solution are always identical. In Section 6, sufficient conditions are given under which, for an arbitrary value of n, the maximum likelihood solution will also maximize the expected number of correct matches. The simplest and most striking sufficient condition given there, but also the most severe condition, is that [ maxi \u03b3(\u03bdi) - mini\u03b3(\u03bdi) ] [ maxj \u03b4(wj) - minj \u03b4(wj) ] \u2264 1. Finally, in Section 7, some examples are given in which these sufficient conditions are not satisfied and the maximum likelihood solution does not maximize the expected number of correct matches.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "We study how matchmakers use prices to sort heterogeneous participants into competing matching markets and how equilibrium outcomes compare with monopoly in terms of prices, matching market structure, and sorting efficiency under the assumption of complementarity in the match value function. The role of prices to facilitate sorting is compromised by the need to survive price competition. We show that price competition leads to a high-quality market that is insufficiently exclusive.

A modern marriage-broker has at his disposal more information about prospective mates than a normal person would come across during a life-time of courting. A close look at 10 matchmaking offices in Tel Aviv, Israel, reveals some of the social and individual predicaments combined with this apparent rationality. Even though courting is often viewed as a matter of pure exchange, the successful completion of the process is seriously disturbed if market calculations become overt and conscious. When a person's critical faculties are fully alert he might be incapable of overlooking any disadvantages in a potential partner. To reach a favorable decision about a prospective mate, a person has to put himself into the emotional mood of \"falling in love\". The matchmaking exchange system is a residual market, which offers a second opportunity to those who failed to find their mate through the methods prescribed by the norm of \"romantic love\". Thus a sense of failure and self doubt is common among clients. Matchmaking has a long and noteworthy history among European Jews. Its revival, under extremely different conditions, in modern Israel, is rather striking: some 10,000 matchmaking advertisements appeared during one year (1977) and about 15 marriage-broking offices operated in Tel Aviv. Nevertheless it seems that only a very small part of clients actually find their mates through matchmaking. Conventional courting retains its position as the most popular as well as most effective method of mate selection. Th\u00e9oriquement, on peut contester que le commerce d'arranger des mariages rationalise le proces de selectionner un conjoint. Un agent de mariage moderne a \u00e0 sa disposition plus de renseignements sur les conjoints prospectifs que la personne ordinaire trouverait pendant un vivant de cour. Un regard s\u00e9rieux \u00e0 10 bureaux qui arrangent des mariages en Tel Aviv, Israel, r\u00e9v\u00e8le quelques predicaments sociales et individuelles combin\u00e9es avec cette rationalit\u00e9 apparente. M\u00eame si on consid\u00e8re que le cour n'est qu'une affaire d'\u00e9change, l'ach\u00e8vement r\u00e9ussi du proc\u00e8s est d\u00e9rang\u00e9 si les calculs du march\u00e9 deviennent ouverts et conscients. Quand les facult\u00e9s critiques d'une personne sont compl\u00e8tement alerte, is peut \u00eatre incapable de laisser passer des d\u00e9savantages d'un conjoint potentiel. Pour arriver \u00e0 une decision favorable sur un conjoint prospectif il faut se mettre dans l'humeur \u00e9motif associ\u00e9 avec l'amour. Le syst\u00e8me \u00e9changeux d'arranger des mariages est un march\u00e9 r\u00e9siduel, qui offre une autre occasion aux ceux qui n'ont pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 trouver leurs conjoints par les m\u00e9thodes pr\u00e9scrites par la norme d'amour romantique. Ainsi des sens de manque et de doute en soi sont communs parmi les clients. L'arrangement des mariages a une histoire longue et remarquable parmi les Juifs europ\u00e9ens. Son renouvellement, sous les conditions extr\u00eamement diff\u00e9rentes en Israel moderne, est assez remarquable; quelques 10,000 avertissements pour arranger des mariages se presentaient dans une ann\u00e9e (1977) et environ 15 bureaux des agents de mariage s'op\u00e9raient en Tel Aviv. Quand m\u00eame il parait que, en actualit\u00e9, seulement une petite partie des clientes trouvent leurs conjoints par le syst\u00e8me d'arranger des mariages. Le cour conventional maintient sa position comme la m\u00e9thode la plus populaire et la plus \u00e9fficace de s\u00e9lectionner un conjoint. Te\u00f2ricamente se podr\u00eda arguir que el apareamiento comercial de personas vuelve razonable el proceso de la selecci\u00f3n de un c\u00f3nyugue. Un casamentero moderno tiene a su disposici\u00f3n mas informaci\u00f3n sobre los presuntos candidatos que la que una persona podr\u00eda encontrar durante toda una vida de galanteo. Una indagaci\u00f3n a fondo de unas 10 instituciones de apareamiento en Tel Aviv, Israel, revela algunos de los apuros sociales e individuales combinados con esta aparente racionalidad. A pesar de que el galanteo es a menudo visto como una cuesti\u00f3n de puro intercambio, el exitoso desenlace del proceso es seriamente alterado si los c\u00e1lculos del mercado illegan a ser patentes y concientes. Cuando las facultades cr\u00edticas de una persona estan completamente alertas peude que se encuentre incapacitada de pasar por alto cualesquier desventajas en un posible c\u00f3nyugue. Para Uegar a una decisi\u00f3n favourable sobre un posible consorte, la persona tiene que estar en la disposici\u00f3n de \u00e0nimo emocional de \"sentirse enamorado.\" El sistema de intercambio de a paraeamiento es un mercado de residuo que ofrece una segunda oportunidad a aquellos que no han podido encontrar su c\u00f3nyugue a trav\u00e9s de los m\u00e9todos prescritos por la norma del \"amor rom\u00e1ntico.\" Es as\u00ed que es com\u00fan entre los clientes un sentido de fracaso y duda de s\u00ed mismo. El apareamiento tiene una historia larga y notable entre los jud\u00edo-europeos. Su renacimiento bajo extremadamente diferentes condiciones en el Israel moderno, es mas bien sorprendente; unos 10,000 anuncios de apareamiento aparecieron durante un a\u00f1o (1977) y funcionaron alrededor de 15 oficinas en Tel Aviv. A pesar de todo parece que solo una peque\u00f1a fracci\u00f3n de clientes llegan a encontrar a su c\u00f3nyugue por medio del apareamiento. El galanteo convencional retiene su posici\u00f3n como el medio m\u00e1s popular as\u00ed como el m\u00e1s efectivo para la selecci\u00f3n de un c\u00f3nyugue.\n      </p>", "Recent trends in marriage and fertility in Israel are reviewed.

Niche-based theories propose that coevolutionary changes among species lead to character divergence (displacement), which allows for coexistence by partitioning resources among species. In contrast, ecological-drift theories propose that species diversity results from a balance of migration, speciation, and extinction, with little microevolutionary change. We use a game-theory model to reconcile drift and niche perspectives by developing a theory of species \"marriage.\" Initially, ecological drift may determine which species encounter each other in a competitive arena. Once species come into contact, historical niche development as a result of prior coevolutionary molding of competitive ability determines which species may coexist. The model shows that only species that display the well-known tradeoff between seed size and competitive ability as a result of past competitive histories comply with the requisite for mutual evolutionary stability. Mutual evolutionary stability of competitive ability tends to make reproductive outputs more similar between species, increasing the chances of ecological equilibrium, i.e., the coexistence of species competing for a single resource. Moreover, mutual evolutionary stability guarantees that such an ecological equilibrium will be stable. The species-marriage model predicts that two or more plant species will coexist indefinitely (i.e., \"marry\") when their difference in seed size, their densities, and the resource availability obey a specific quantitative relation. For example, when resource availability is high, married species should be characterized by a greater asymmetry in seed size than when resource availability is low. Thus, in the species-marriage model, competition can shape the detailed properties of communities without violating the postulates of ecological-drift theory.\n      </p>", "Over the past 20 years, research has expanded educators' knowledge of the impact of high school tracking on students' curriculum opportunities and outcomes. Researchers also know that students are unevenly distributed among tracks, with low-income and minority students more likely to be in low ability classes for the non-college-bound. At the same time, they still understand little about how schools actually match particular students to tracked courses. Scholars and educators variously draw on technical/structural (e. g., a match between tracking and the differentiated structure of workforce), cultural (e. g., norms regarding race, social class, and educational prospects), and political or individualistic (e. g., choice, parent pressure) theories to explain students' track assignments. To shed further light on the school dynamics that shape track-related course taking, we provide findings from a 2-year examination of tracking decisions at three comprehensive high schools. Setting these findings against prior theoretical and empirical work, we suggest an eclectic explanation that blends structural, cultural, and individualistic explanations for track assignments. High school tracking decisions, we conclude, result from the synergy of three powerful factors: differentiated, hierarchical curriculum structures; school cultures alternatively committed to common schooling and accommodating differences; and political actions by individuals within those structures and cultures aimed at influencing the distribution of advantage. Both research on tracking and efforts at school restructuring could benefit from this broader perspective.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Customers arrive sequentially at times x\u2081 &lt; x\u2082 &lt;... &lt; x n and stay for independent random times Z\u2081,..., Z n &gt; 0.

After matchmaking the matchmaker dissociates from the complex, permitting the matched protein to engage in other protein-protein interactions to bring about the effector function. Matchmaking is most commonly used under circumstances that require targeted, high-avidity DNA binding without relying solely on sequence specificity. Molecular matchmaking is an extensively used mechanism in repair, replication, and transcription and most likely in recombination and transposition reactions, too.\n      </p>", "           ", "Eric Rohmer's films are repeatedly concerned with love affairs and matchmaking schemes, and they feature social occasions during which much of the talk concerns intimacy and romance.

HIV-positive women in northern Nigeria have appropriated a support group to facilitate their marriage arrangements.

Within an interdisciplinary framework, based on a foundation of work on Irish vernacular furniture, it combines a variety of sources from art history, photography, ethnography and travel writing to postcards and poetry. The relative reliability of evidence from foreign visitors versus the native Irish is assessed. Areas of social and material culture, such as the 'stage Irishman', racism, why women didn't wear shoes, why boys were dressed as girls and the pre-arrangement of rural marriage, become touchstones for the analysis of myths and realities perpetuated through contemporary sources.\n      </p>", "           ", "Electronic intermediaries play an important role in many Web-based electronic markets, adding value for participants by offering such services as matchmaking and trust. This paper presents an economic model of intermediation where the intermediary offers services to two types of actors: consumers and providers. When consumers are heterogeneous, differentiated by their willingness to pay for intermediation, the intermediary can potentially offer two (or more) levels of service quality to target different consumer segments. The analysis in this paper highlights the aggregation benefit that consumers derive from having access to multiple providers through the intermediary. According to prior research on vertically differentiated digital goods, it is optimal to offer only one quality level in the market, because segmentation causes cannibalization and lowers profits. In the case of intermediation, however, the aggregation benefit makes it optimal for the intermediary to offer both levels of service. The intermediary's profits increase when the quality of the lower-quality service is decreased, suggesting that the two quality levels should be differentiated as much as possible. If the aggregation effect is intense, the intermediary should make the service free for providers.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "This article presents a pragmaphilological approach to the analysis of a recently discovered Novgorodian birchbark letter (N955) written in the course of matchmaking.

Traditionally marriage was arranged by the head of the family, with the help of a matchmaker, and young couples did not meet until the day of their wedding. Since 1950, the Chinese have been granted by law the freedom to choose their marriage partners without parental interference. Yet, meeting the right person is not easy in a country where free association of both sexes was frowned upon for so many centuries and where there are still few opportunities for young people to mix. At the same time, Chinese society has no place for single people and everyone is expected to marry eventually. Matchmakig has become a task shared by relatives, friends, colleagues and even the State. Grass-roots organizations, the Women's Federation, the Youth League and unions have set up various kinds of matchmaking devices; marriage agencies, both private and sponsored by the State, have flourished. Since the early 80's, placing ads in journals has also become a popular way to search for a mate.

The first chapter appeared in 1892, while the complete work was published in book form only in 1910. In the process of compilation, Sholem Aleichem introduced significant changes throughout the text, and these provide us with important insights into the manner by which the author transformed a fragmentary work into a singular composition, one of the highlights of his literary achievment. Critics perceived Menakhem Mendl as the epitome of a particular socio-historical figure: the shtetl Jew who forged his way into a dynamic capitalistic world. Employing the literary genre of letterwriting, the author creates a confrontation between two worlds. Opposite the main character who has set out towards new horizons, we encounter his wife, Sheyne Sheyndl, who represents the rustic provincial. Critics also considered the six chapters of the work repetitive, thereby creating an inner rhythm which commences by introducing false hopes for quick enrichment, only to be followed by the inexorable and sudden fall. Thus the perception that the story has no natural conclusion, inasmuch as the central character doesn't really change, and nothing precludes the repetition of similar events. By examining Sholem Aleichem's process of editing the work for its complete publication, it becomes clear that the emerging structure is not a mechanical amalgam of independent chapters. The author did not arrange the chapters according to the original chronological sequence of their publication; his purpose was clearly to create a distinct progression of stages through which the main character would pass. He starts out in Odessa, the dynamic urban center that symbolized the rapid development of Russian capitalism in those days. From here he moves to Kiev, which although less important than Odessa nevertheless was deemed a major metropolis in the hero's eyes. In the concluding chapters Menakhem Mendl returns to the world of the shtetl, and to the same reality he had sought to break away from at the start of his journey. This gradual descent from the large capitalistic city back to the shtetl is linked to another aspect that emerges from the work's organization: In the first three chapters, where Menakhem Mendl functions either as a stock broker or middleman, he is involved in an abstract sort of trade whose internal mechanisms are not all that clear to him. This provides endless opportunities for comic effect. But when he begins, in the fourth chapter, to devote himself to writing, and when he tries his hand at matchmaking in the fifth chapter \u2014 human beings become a commodity in his eyes. In the last chapter, where we find him selling insurance policies, the two trends begin to merge: while on the one hand dealing again in amorphous commerce, he still sees people as a commercial commodity. At the same time the final chapter serves to summarize the central character's progression through the book: Menakhem Mendl begins as an insurance agent in Odessa, but winds up miserable in a remote village. But Menakhem Mendl the character is oblivious of the extreme changes that overtake him throughout the book. The dimensions of his field of endeavor gradually diminish, while at the same time the gap between his inner world and false hopes for quick enrichment and the progressive deterioration of his undertaking continues to grow, Menakhem Mendl remains unaware of this deterioration. These implications emerge only when the book is analyzed in its entirety. In the process of editing the work, Sholem Aleichem transformed the separate chapters into a structurally unified literary composition, bearing far more meaning as a whole than merely the sum of the implications hidden in each chapter.\n      </p>", "The family life of medieval Jewry is commonly portrayed as an idyllic picture of steadfastness and moderation. The present article suggests a totally different reality for German Jewish society in the fifteenth century. As a point of departure the author examines the manifesto of R. Seligmann Bing(c. 1395-1471), a rabbi in Bandernach, Bingen and Oppenheim, who is known for his unsuccessful attempt to convene a council of rabbis of the Rhineland (1454). The document is part of a long halakhic treatise preserved in the author's handwriting. One section of the text (Ms. London) is currently in the Montefiore Library (#146), while the other portion (Ms. Oxford) is part of the Oppenheim collection (#93) at the Bodleian Library. The work, written in the late 1460s was apparently never completed, and has survived only in draft form. It was never copied, probably due both to its length (over 1,000 pages) as well as faulty editing. Pages 74a-80a of the Bodleian manuscript contain three letters to anonymous addressees, and apparently were intended for rabbis of the Rhineland. The first letter contains a general condemnation of 'the state of the generation', and from it there emerges a tension between scholars and laymen. In the second letter R. Seligmann denounces the rapid turnover of marriage partners, facilitated by hasty divorces (instigated by both husbands and wives). The writer was obviously aware of, and alludes to the central role of erotic attraction in the development of this situation. The dissolution of marriages was further facilitated by the ease into which people entered new marriage contracts, frequently drawn up even before the termination of the first marriage, or immediately upon its dissolution. The third letter enumerates the regulations that prohibit such matchmaking, and the addressees are urged to obey these laws. All three letters are part of a plea aimed at preventing hasty divorces, and it is evident that such divorces resulted from the ease with which alternate partners could be acquired. Thus, the desire to live in a state of marriage was itself not weakened, but rather the mobility of this state rendered it frail and insecure. This in any case is the situation described by R. Seligmann. The contents of the resolutions put forward at the council of Bingen are not entirely known. It is possible that before us are the draft proposals of that council, herewith incorporated in a work concluded some ten years later. The frequency of divorce in this society is substantiated by further evidence. In a collection of divorce documents, in manuscript, of R. Zalman Segal, the son of R. Seligmann and rabbi in Nurenberg from 1455, there are copies of forty-six gittin granted during a period of fifty years in Nurenberg, Mainz, Bingen, Bonn, and Worms. If these divorces are added to yet others, also extant in manuscript, we arrive with ease at thirty gittin granted in Nurenberg during a period of twenty-six years (1416-1442), and this \u2014 for a community of some seventy adults. This is an extremely high rate, and while it is reasonable to assume that the local court also granted divorces to the residents of surrounding areas, these were probably a minority of the gittin issued at Nurenberg. The same high rates are similarly verifiable regarding Mainz and Bingen. The social situation described here may also be reflected in the budding in 15th century Germany of a particular literary genre in the form of treatises devoted to the laws of divorce ('sidre gittin'). At the same time the professional status of the rabbi upon whom the title 'morenu' (Meister) had been conferred also becomes defined. One of the primary functions of this official was the arrangement of gittin, a function hitherto not considered the sole prerogative of the rabbi. Ever increasing numbers of rabbis would discover in the arrangement of divorces a major source of income, the average fee of 10 gulden being a substantial sum of money. Tension among the rabbis of Germany frequently surfaced, with certain rabbis attempting to prevent the settling of a rival in their community. If one considers the minuscule size of Jewish communities in 15th century Germany, and Nurenberg was a 'large' community, it becomes evident that those serving in the rabbinate were rewarded with an adequate livelihood. A major source of this income were fees deriving from frequent divorces and ensuing marriages. Consequently, the establishment of the rabbinate as a profession, with professional and social interests, coincides with the general tendency to minimize the severity of divorce. While the proclivity to divorce was undoubtedly influenced by demographic factors as well, such as frequent migrations from city to city, the circumstances linking the high divorce rate with the establishment of the professional status of the rabbinate cannot be ignored. The growing demand for the rabbi's services contributed directly to his professional and financial well-being. The literature dealing with the issues of divorce provided this activity with an additional aura of theoretical legitimacy, thus enhancing the dependence on the rabbi's services. It appears that this aspect of Jewish family life has no parallel in the non-Jewish sector of German society. One reason is the basic fact that divorce was not sanctioned by canonical law. Frequently, however \u2014 and again in Nurenberg \u2014 we encounter a rise in the number of children born out of wedlock, and this may reflect a weakening of the marital framework among the bourgeoisie. The study of family life in Germany, however, is still in its preliminary stages, and thus such conclusions may be premature. R. Seligmann's second letter is published in an appendix to the article.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "This article attempts to make a wake-up call to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to respond to the plight of minority business owners while also fulfilling their role of educating students.

Aside from the traditional problem of limited capital resources many challenges have ensued from the economic, social, and political changes in our society today. As long as the current political and economic climates persist, leading to a negative impact on the economies of minority population, institutions of higher learning, particularly HBCUs, have a unique opportunity to be the catalyst of change in the development and promotion of minority businesses.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Adjustment of marriage tradition is one approach toward understanding processes of ethnicity. In this paper, the marriage tradition within the Greek-American community of Tucson, Arizona, is examined. Old ways of early immigrants, the ideal of endogamy and attempts to promote endogamy are reported. That ethnic group heterogeneity renders unqualified endogamy a fantasy is discussed. Ethnic group members adjust their marriage ideals as they concomitantly attempt to adjust the cultural identity of their exogamous spouses. Justage de la tradition du mariage est un approche vers la compr\u00e9hension des processus des conditions ethniques. Dans cet expos\u00e9 on examine la tradition du mariage dans la communaut\u00e9 greque-am\u00e9ricaine de Tucson, Arizona. Les vieilles fa\u00e7ons des premiers immigr\u00e9s, l'id\u00e9al du mariage dans le groupe ethnique, et les efforts d'encourager le mariage dans le groupe ethnique. On discute que le concept du groupe ethnique h\u00e9t\u00e9rog\u00e8ne rend l'id\u00e9e du mariage dans le groupe ethnique inconditionnel comme fantaisie. Les membres du groupe adaptent leurs id\u00e9aux de mariage tandis qu'ils essaient au m\u00eames temps d'adapter l'identit\u00e9 culturelle de leur \u00e9poux qui viennent du m\u00eame groupe ethnique.

Las viejas costumbres de los primeros emigrantes, el ideal de la endogamia y los intentos para promover la misma son reportados. La heterogeneidad del grupo \u00e9tnico que convierte la endogamia sin derecho, en una fantas\u00eda, se discute.
