These parallels mean that evolutionary biologists and historical linguists seek answers to similar questions and face similar problems. As a result, the theory and methodology of the two disciplines have evolved in remarkably similar ways. In addition to Darwin's curious parallels of process, there are a number of equally curious parallels and connections between the development of methods in biology and historical linguistics. Here we briefly review the parallels between biological and linguistic evolution and contrast the historical development of phylogenetic methods in the two disciplines. We then look at a number of recent studies that have applied phylogenetic methods to language data and outline some current problems shared by the two fields.\n      </p>", "Mainland Southeast Asia provides a dramatic demonstration of the areal phenomenon in linguistics: When languages are spoken historically in the same location they often show significant parallels in the organization of a wide range of structural domains, whether the languages descend from the same historical source. The effects of areal diffusion raise fundamental questions for the traditional essentialist vision of languages as entities with offspring that diverge, with shared innovations marking divergent branches and internal processes of evolution accounting for diversity among modern languages. Recent theoretical and empirical research on linguistic diversity, language change, and social diffusion of innovation argues for a unit-based approach to language change and relatedness, where the units of analysis are individual speakers and individual linguistic items. This review begins with discussion of the language situation in Mainland Southeast Asia, where the language \"genealogies\" have been dramatically permeated by socio-historical contact, then explores theoretical and methodological implications for research on language both generally and in its areal context.\n      </p>", "This paper explores the notion of fractals - structures that display a similar degree of complexity at whatever scale they may be viewed - in relation to investigating African history.

Regarding the 'Bantu Problem' in particular, linguistic research, particularly language classification, has oriented historical study and been a guiding principle for both historians and archaeologists. Some historians have also embraced the comparison of cultural vocabularies as a core method for reconstructing African history. This paper evaluates the merits and limits of this latter methodology by analysing Bantu pottery vocabulary. Challenging earlier interpretations, it argues that speakers of Proto-Bantu inherited the craft of pot-making from their Benue-Congo-speaking ancestors who introduced this technology into the Grassfields region. This 'Proto-Bantu ceramic tradition' was the result of a long, local development, but spread quite rapidly into Atlantic Central Africa, and possibly as far as Southern Angola and northern Namibia. The people who brought Early Iron Age (EIA) ceramics to southwestern Africa were not the first Bantu-speakers in this area nor did they introduce the technology of pot-making.\n      </p>", "A review of selected influential works in Spanish Applied Linguistics in the twentieth century is presented with an accompanying bibliography.

We first list four unique features of language instruction: (1) the object-language-meta-language distinction; (2) computer as written medium vs. language as primary spoken medium; (3) teaching of second language skills vs. linguistics; (4) the computer as an electronic tool vs. the computer as a cognitive entity simulating the speaker. We then show how these unique characteristics of language instruction (mother-tongue and foreign language) impose special proposals on language courseware. These proposals should be observed in the development of language courseware and in the evaluation of such programs. Clearly, these proposals integrate with general courseware proposals.\n      </p>", "Let Nn be the number of occurrences in n trials of an event governed by a two-state Markov chain (of first order or second order).

Results indicate that these children use DMs to specifically mark differences in status and in familiarity/intimacy between interlocutors: High-status roles (parents, teachers) reveal greater use of DMs than lower-status roles (children), and this difference increases when familiarity decreases (i.e., more DMs by teacher in the classroom setting than by parent in the family setting).

Zellig Harris had advocated a close alliance between grammatical and information-theoretic principles in the analysis of natural language, and early formal-language theory provided another strong link between information theory and linguistics. Nevertheless, in most research on language and computation, grammatical and information-theoretic approaches had moved far apart. Today, after many years on the defensive, the information-theoretic approach has gained new strength and achieved practical successes in speech recognition, information retrieval, and, increasingly, in language analysis and machine translation. The exponential increase in the speed and storage capacity of computers is the proximate cause of these engineering successes, allowing the automatic estimation of the parameters of probabilistic models of language by counting occurrences of linguistic events in very large bodies of text and speech. However, I will argue that information-theoretic and computational ideas are also playing an increasing role in the scientific understanding of language, and will help bring together formal-linguistic and information-theoretic perspectives.\n      </p>", "The field of language and sexuality has gained importance within socio-culturally oriented linguistic scholarship. Much current work in this area emphasizes identity as one key aspect of sexuality. However, recent critiques of identity-based research advocate instead a desire-centered view of sexuality. Such an approach artificially restricts the scope of the field by overlooking the close relationship between identity and desire. This connection emerges clearly in queer linguistics, an approach to language and sexuality that incorporates insights from feminist, queer, and sociolinguistic theories to analyze sexuality as a broad sociocultural phenomenon. These intellectual approaches have shown that research on identity, sexual or otherwise, is most productive when the concept is understood as the outcome of intersubjectively negotiated practices and ideologies. To this end, an analytic framework for the semiotic study of social intersubjectivity is presented.\n      </p>", "This paper synthesizes research on linguistic practice and critically examines the legacy of Pierre Bourdieu from the perspective of linguistic anthropology. Bourdieu wrote widely about language and linguistics, but his most far reaching engagement with the topic is in his use of linguistic reasoning to elaborate broader sociological concepts including habitus, field, standardization, legitimacy, censorship, and symbolic power. The paper examines and relates habitus and field in detail, tracing the former to the work of Erwin Panofsky and the latter to structuralist discourse semantics. The principles of relative autonomy, boundedness, homology, and embedding apply to fields and their linkage to habitus. Authority, censorship, and euphemism are traced to the field, and symbolic power is related to misrecognition. And last, this chapter relates recent work in linguistic anthropology to practice and indicates lines for future research.\n      </p>", "This paper uses the comparative method of historical linguistics to investigate the hypothesis that languages of two well-established families of Mesoamerica, Totonacan and Mixe-Zoquean, are related in a larger genetic grouping dubbed Totozoquean. Proposed cognate sets comparing words reconstructed for Proto-Totonacan (PTn) and Proto-Mixe-Zoquean (PMZ) show regular sound correspondences attesting to the descent of these two languages from Proto-Totozoquean (PTz). Identification of sound correspondences facilitates reconstruction of PTz\u2019s phonological inventory and vocabulary. The PMZ words used in the comparison are from Wichmann (1995). The PTn words are reconstructed by the authors, who provide the Totonacan cognate sets on which these reconstructions are based, as well as discussion of the classification and phonological history of Totonacan languages. Evidence is cited indicating that Totozoquean is comparable to Indo-European in chronological depth.\n      </p>", "Independent evidence favors pragmatic characterizations of the distribution of mood in complement clauses in Spanish. Examination of the behavior of different types of complements in two different grammatical constructions supports the argument that the differences in behavior are the result of the different pragmatic status of the complement. Empirical evidence supports the hypothesis that complements which represent old information appear in the subjunctive mood. The notion of old information serves to revise standard explanations of the use of mood in some negated complements and to explain some uses of the subjunctive mood that have been rarely discussed in the literature.\n      </p>", "The proposal that linguistic sounds such as phonemes, features, syllables, or tones can be meaningful, or sound-symbolic, contradicts the principles of arbitrariness and double articulation that are axiomatic to structural linguistics. Nevertheless, a considerable body of research that supports principles of sound symbolism has accumulated. This review discusses the most widely attested forms of sound symbolism and the research programs linked to sound symbolism that have influenced linguists and anthropologists most. Numerous reports of magnitude sound symbolism in the form of experimental studies and comparative surveys have been integrated into a biologically based theory of its motivation. Magnitude sound symbolism also catalyzed a number of experimental studies by psychologists and linguists in search of a universal sound-symbolic substrate underlying all languages. Although the search for a sound-symbolic substrate has been abandoned, the success rates of these studies have never been satisfactorily explained. Sound-symbolic processes have had a definitive impact on morphological analyses of phonesthemes and on historical linguists' understandings of diachronic processes. A typologically widespread form of sound symbolism occurs as a kind of lexical class known as the ideophone, which is conspicuously underdeveloped in standard average European languages, and highly perplexing for linguists and anthropologists. Although it has always been a respectable domain of inquiry in ethnopoetics and interpretive ethnography, the case for sound symbolism has of late been argued with renewed vigor on the part of psychological anthropologists and philosophers who see a paradigm shift under way.\n      </p>", "In the development of tengo vengo from TENE\u014c VENI\u014c the flexional vowels became yod and raised the stem vowels from /\u03c3/ to /e/ blocking diphthongization.

One, the imperfect subjunctive theory, claims that the inflected infinitive developed from the Latin imperfect subjunctive in volitional clauses. The other, the creative theory, views the inflected infinitive as a strictly Luso-Romance phenomenon, without any direct Latin predecessor. In this study I adapt the imperfect subjunctive theory to include purpose clauses rather than volitional clauses to account for Old Portuguese data that show a high correlation between the purpose prepositions pera and por and the inflected infinitive. Since the inflected infinitive is already established by the time of the earliest documents in Portuguese, there is no hard evidence that would permit a definite solution to the riddle of its development.

We used corpus linguistics tools to process and quantify the large body of text, not to describe the nature of the discourse, but rather, in the tradition of critical discourse analysis, to prompt reflection on a range of possibilities for directing classroom discourse. We found that the word just was one of the most common words to appear in these classrooms. Drawing on Bakhtin's (The dialogic imagination. Austin: University of Texas Press, 1975/1981) distinctions between monoglossic and heteroglossic utterances, we found that the word just acted as a monoglossic tool, closing down dialogue. We propose, however, that just can also be used as a heteroglossic tool as it can focus attention and thus invite dialogue.\n      </p>", "New methods of documenting languages with digital technologies has led to a multitude of different formats that are difficult to reuse over time. To overcome the problems surrounding the portability of digital language documentation, linguists are in the process of formulating best-practice recommendations to increase the likelihood of their work's long-term survival. This paper describes the implementation of a comprehensive set of current best-practice recommendations pertaining to content, format, discovery, access, citation, preservation, and rights in the context of the language documentation efforts of the Texas German Dialect Project. This project is different from others in that it is not primarily concerned with digitizing and archiving existing recordings. Instead, the archive it is creating is the end-result of a research project whose workflow begins with data-collection in the filed and ends with depositing digitized and annotated language materials in a web-accessible digital archive of Texas German. This paper shows how a number of conflicting bestpractice recommendations can be resolved, thereby satisfying the diverse needs of academic research, teaching, and outreach to the community. As such, the results reported here are an important contribution to the search for strategies guaranteeing the long-term survival of digital language documentation resources.\n      </p>", "Anaphoric NP use and interpretation in Spanish may be constrained by grammatical, semantic, and pragmatic factors. While syntactic and semantic constraints place restrictions on what is referentially possible or acceptable in sentences, empirical data suggest that the use and interpretation of anaphoric NPs in Spanish conversational discourse (excluding reflexives and reciprocals) adhere to two neo-Gricean principles of language use. Furthermore, analysis of naturally occurring conversations among native speakers reveals that the pattern of anaphora predicted by the neo-Gricean framework is constrained by antecedent salience, mutual knowledge, and semantic entailments. These data suggest that instances of intended coreference may be considered conversational implicatures that can be explained in terms of pragmatic rules of language use and intervening consistency constraints.\n      </p>", "This article describes the circumstances surrounding the recent publication in book form and on CD-ROM of an edited version of Frs.

The key components of the model include the linguistic data resources themselves and those focused on the knowledge derived from data. Data resources include the ever-increasing amount of linguistic field data and other descriptive language resources being migrated to the Web. The knowledge resources capture generalizations about the data and are anchored in the General Ontology for Linguistic Description (GOLD). It is argued that such a model is in the spirit of the vision for a Semantic Web and, thus, provides a concrete methodology for rendering highly divergent resources semantically interoperable. The focus of this work, then, is not on annotation at the syntactic level, but rather on how annotated Web resources can be linked to an ontology. Furthermore, a methodology is given for creating specific communities of practice within the overall Web infrastructure for linguistics. Finally, ontology-driven search is discussed as a key application of the proposed model.\n      </p>", "This paper is an exposition as well as a critical examination of M. Frank's response to the Derrida/Searle debate. It argues that Frank's critique of Derrida and Searle is partly justified but suffers from a number of shortcomings. The author agrees with Frank's argument that Derrida fails to explain how linguistic meaning is possible on the basis of purely differential relations between signs (diff\u00e9rance) and supports his view that the human subject, in spite of its lack of complete self-transparency, is endowed with more autonomy and semantic creativity than Derrida is willing to grant it. The paper tries to show, however, that much of Frank's critique of linguistic theory as represented by the work of Searle is unjustified because it is informed by a questionable notion of linguistic determinism rooted in Schleiermacher and Saussurean structuralism, a notion of ineffable or non-conceptual individual meaning that remains insufficiently explicated, and a generally anti-naturalist attitude towards language which leads to a misunderstanding of the role linguistics and related cognitive sciences can (and cannot) play in the hermeneutic sciences.\n      </p>", "The study of language has a special role in discussions of qualitative methodology by anthropologists. In Section (I) the origins of this role are sketched, and in (II) some consequences and implications. The principal implication is the need for a study of language that is equivalent to linguistic ethnography, addressed to institutions of our own society, such as education. This need, the possibility that change in this regard is up against deeply embedded cultural views of language, and the study of assessment of language development outside of schools are touched on in (III). (IV) takes up the characterization of the kind of ethnography that is intended, stressing a distinction between \"ethnography\" and \"field work,\" a conception of linguistic inquiry as generically the interpretation of codes, and a conception of ethnography as the discovery and interpretation of cultural worlds.

The results of a data-based experiment involving two groups of native English speakers studying Spanish reveal that native language transfer plays a prominent role in hampering the acquisition of the voiced spirants [\u00a2 \u00a4 f]. Students largely fail to spirantize the voiced stops in L2 speech and incorrectly transfer the phonemic status of English /\u00a4/ to Spanish, leading to a slower rate of acquisition of this phone. The presence of orthographic v also interferes with the acquisition of Spanish [b] and [\u00a2] and leads to a decrease in accurate pronunciation during formal reading tasks.\n      </p>", "The contrastive use of the present perfect and the preterite in the Spanish-speaking world differs from region to region. For the Andean region, however, where Spanish is in contact with Quechua, it has been claimed that this contrast is neutralized. The thesis proposed is that in this variety the present perfect and the preterite, along with the pluperfect, are in fact in contrast on the basis of a spatio-temporal parameter derived from the notion of present relevance. In particular, the use of the present perfect is sensitive to the relationship between the location of the past event and that of the speaker at the moment of speech. In consequence, the contrasts between the present perfect and the other two forms are modified. These innovative uses are derived from the interaction between the semantic systems of Quechua and Spanish and are consistent with universals of the semantic development of verbal markers.\n      </p>", "Academic knowledge of human linguistic diversity owes much to descriptions written, over four centuries ago, under the aegis of European colonial regimes around the world. This comparative review considers a small part of that body of linguistic descriptive work relative to its conditions of production: authorial interests that animated such writings, ideological and institutional milieux that enabled and shaped them, and the authoritative character they took on as natural symbols of colonial difference. European technologies of literacy enabled missionary and nonmissionary linguistic work that resulted in representations of languages as powerful icons of spiritual, territorial, and historical hierarchies that emerged in colonial societies. As descriptions of languages traveled from exotic colonial peripheries to European metropoles, they came under the purview of comparative philology. This disciplinary precursor to modern linguistics helped to legitimize colonial linguistic projects and legislate colonial difference on a global scale.\n      </p>", "Highly inflected languages such as Spanish and Portuguese pose special problems for even the simplest natural language processing programs because the software must incorporate a large amount of morphological information.

SN completely relexified in the direction of English, whereas SM only partly relexified toward English. Evidence suggests that Ndjuka (ND) is not a product of relexification, but developed from an eighteenth-century English pidgin.

But even a relatively young discipline such as modem linguistics is more diverse in its procedures and concerns than might appear to those working in other fields. In this paper I attempt to show how certain kinds of linguistic inquiry might be relevant to those whose primary concern is rhetoric. I argue that these practices are often opposed to what I call the dominant paradigm in modern linguistics, with its commitment to abstraction and idealization. I discuss first those strands of linguistics, such as discourse analysis, text-linguistics, and stylistics, which tend to take the social formation for granted; I end by considering recent trends in so-called critical language study. Finally, I offer some thoughts on how linguistics may proceed in order to achieve a more programmatic rapprochement with rhetoric.\n      </p>", "Drawing on resources from anthropology, linguistics, psychology, and education, this paper examines critically the effects of literacy on cultural traditions, linguistic behavior, socio-economic organization, cognitive processes, and child development.

The paper also considers the implications for anthropological, psychological, and linguistic theories of the increased attention given to the study of literacy and its effects on language, thought, and society.

It also has nonlinguistic (e.g., sociological) implications, such as the claim that Creole languages are a \"handicap\" for their speakers, which has undermined the role that Creoles should play in the education and socioeconomic development of monolingual Creolophones. Focusing on Caribbean Creoles, and on Haitian Creole in particular, it is argued that Creole Exceptionalism, as a sociohistorically rooted \"r\u00e9gime of truth\" (in Foucault's sense), obstructs scientific and social progress in and about Creole communities. Various types of Creole Exceptionalist beliefs are deconstructed and historicized, and their empirical, theoretical, and sociological flaws surveyed. These flaws have antecedents in early creolists' theories of Creole genesis, often explicitly couched in Eurocentric and (pre-/quasi-)Darwinian doctrines of human evolution. Despite its historical basis in colonialism and slavery and its scientific and sociological flaws, Creole Exceptionalism is still enshrined in the modern linguistics establishment and its classic literature, a not unexpected state given the social structure of scientific communities and the interaction between ideology and \"paradigm-making.\" The present Foucauldian approach to Creole Exceptionalism is an instantiation of a well-defined area of the linguistics/ideology interface.

It also proposes a principle for guiding prescriptive recommendations in the future as well as a theoretical framework and a procedure for predicting the consequences of prescriptive recommendations. The procedure illustrates a hypothetical prescription: the substitution of singular they for prescriptive he. Projected benefits of the prescription include neutral connotation, naturalness, simplicity, and lexical availability. Projected costs include covert and overt referential ambiguity; partial ambiguity; conceptual inaccuracy; loss of precision, imageability, impact, and memorability; bizarreness involving certain referents and case forms; distancing and dehumanizing connotations; unavailability of the 'he or she' denotation; potentially disruptive and long-lasting side effects on other areas of the language. Procedures are also illustrated for determining the relative frequency of such costs and benefits and for estimating the relative disruptiveness of the costs in normal language use.

A five-way aspectual classification system is defined on the basis of three aspectual features, making use of the concept of predicates as event structures. The aspectual value of a sentence can differ from that of its predicate due to the operation of aspectual functions. Sentential aspect is ultimately derived from the operation of various components of the sentence on the aspectual properties of the predicate. A system of twelve semantic features describing the core meaning of verbs provides a level of specificity that can distinguish different senses of verbs and could be used to predict their consequent syntactic and semantic behavior. The computational utility of these models will be tested on a working machine translation system.\n      </p>", "A historical study of variation in the relative clause marker in Scottish English indicates that sociolinguistic methodology has some important contributions to make to historical linguistics. The use of the frequency with which NPs in certain syntactic positions are relativized as a measure of syntactic complexity reveals that the WH relativization strategy appears to have entered the language in the most complex styles and least frequently relativized syntactic positions, until it eventually spread or diffused throughout the system. The addition of the WH relativization strategy seems to have resulted in a 'squish' of two strategies which are opposed in stylistic meaning rather than in actual qualitative change in the relative system. The process of diffusion can be seen as completed as far as the more formal styles of the modern written language are concerned, but it has not really affected the spoken language, where the native TH strategy prevails.\n      </p>", "Recent times have seen a marked growth of interest in historical linguistics, as well as an increased role for diachronic factors within synchronic theory. This suggests that a fundamental re-assessment of the relationship between synchrony and diachrony in linguistic theory is in order, particularly with regard to its role in linguistic explanation.

So the formula is: Agents (1) intend; (2) to use model, M; (3) to represent a part of the world, W; (4) for some purpose, P. This conception legitimates using similarity as the basic relationship between models and the world. Moreover, since just about anything can be used to represent anything else, there can be no unified ontology of models. This whole approach is further supported by a brief exposition of some recent work in cognitive, or usage-based, linguistics. Finally, with all the above as background, I criticize the recently much discussed idea that claims involving scientific models are really fictions.\n      </p>", "The paper is concerned with the changing address norms in China since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949.

The paper presents firstly the more general functions of the suffix in the Ngayarda languages and then discusses the use of the suffix to mark kin relationships. It is argued that the general \"collective activity\" meaning of the suffix has generalised to the marking of certain kin relationships through the recognition that collective activity is a feature of these particular relationships.

Surprisingly, it is possible to make the complicated system somewhat more transparent and, accordingly, easier to learn, applying only a few considerations: a) Originally the difference between the independent order (IO) and the conjunct order (CO) could not be so extreme as it is now. b) From this it follows that the prefixes are not original but secondarily added to the verb forms, formerly making use only of pronominal suffixes. So the prefixes are veiling the original system and here left out of consideration, c) Consequently, all pronominal information must have been found in the suffixes alone, in the CO as well as in the IO. d) This means that some important morphemes, where expected by the ration of the system, were entirely lost, leaving no traces.

But the forty-seven applicants who chose to use sex-neutral greetings had no well-established pattern to follow. Hence, they used nineteen different forms, which shows that the matter is currently in a state of experimentation. From an analysis of the candidates' supporting data, it was clear that the writers who used the sex-neutral greetings were the better qualified candidates.

The speaker's use of linguistic forms seems to be related more to his conscious or subconscious social intentions than to linguistic principles which inhere in the basilect to acrolect continuum model with which many creolists work.

It is also, I would guess, a universal that in all societies people value respectability granted to them. If this is lost, the losers may become ineligible for many of the responsibilities and privileges of that society or subsociety. In this article, three ways are discussed by which such ``credit rating'' can be lost-as told by one member of a particular geographical subsection of the Mixtec society, as he has seen and lived it. Difficulties arose for some of its members, for example, from their refusal to vote with the majority, or from failure to care for children adequately in terms of grandparents' evaluation of the parents' responsibility, or from moral delinquency as judged by other members.

This skepticism, however, is paradoxically at odds with the great success that strategic management has enjoyed. How might one explain this paradox?

We then supplement this implicit definition with an examination of the espoused definitions of the field obtained from a group of boundary-spanning scholars.

For example, the comparative approach reveals that prehistoric languages of eastern North America having glottochronological dates earlier than 700 B.P, such as Proto-Iroquoian (2700 B.P), lacked words for bean. Protolanguages of the region with glottochronological dates younger than 700 B.P had bean terms. These linguistic results accord with the AMS finding that beans do not become archaeologically visible in the region until around C.E. 1300. The earliest AMS date for beans of Mesoamerica is around 2300 B.P This date is considerably younger than glottochronological dates for prehistoric languages of the area, such as Proto-Mayan (3400 B.P), for which bean terms are posited. Linguistic findings for protolanguages of Mesoamerica suggest that the regional bean chronology is considerably older than that indicated through archaeological dating.\n      </p>", "Despite the platitude that analytic philosophy is deeply concerned with language, philosophers of science have paid little attention to methodological issues that arise within historical linguistics. I broach this topic by arguing that many inferences in historical linguistics conform to Reichenbach's common cause principle (CCP). Although the scope of CCP is narrower than many have thought, inferences about the genealogies of languages are particularly apt for reconstruction using CCP. Quantitative approaches to language comparison are readily understood as methods for detecting the correlations that serve as premises for common cause inferences, and potential sources of error in historical linguistics correspond to well-known limitations of CCP.\n      </p>", "This article raises questions about the practice of teaching minority (ethnic/immigrant) languages as academic subjects in multilingual settings and points to directions in which the field of applied linguistics must move in order to develop adequate principles of language learning that can support such instruction. The article consists of three principle sections. Section one defines the term \"linguistic minority\" and offers examples of linguistic minority populations. Section two describes the teaching of Spanish to bilingual-Spanish-speaking students in the United States. It then illustrates the broad problems and questions encountered in teaching minority languages as school subjects by drawing on the discussion of the history, development, and current status of the teaching of Spanish to bilingual minorities in the U.S. Section three proposes a reconceptualization of the language teaching focus within applied linguistics that takes into account the problems and challenges surrounding the teaching of minority languages.\n      </p>", "This study focuses on the ancient past of coastal Guinea's Rio Nunez region, a coastal rice-growing region virtually unexplored by studies of West African rice and rice farmers. It argues that coastal cultivators have adapted mangrove rice-farming systems in situ for approximately the past 1,000 years, a historical period pre-dating the European travelers 1 accounts on which the current literature heavily relies. Rather than diffusing from the interior, these specialized farming systems grew organically out of land-use systems. Using the comparative method of historical linguistics and cultural vocabulary, the study establishes different stages in coastal farmers' experimentation, adaptation and specialization in the coastal environment and approximates historical dates when the different stages occurred. And with botanical and biological studies of mangrove vegetation, the study distinguishes between the softer, spongy roots of white mangroves and hard, twisted roots of red mangroves. The interdisciplinary evidence reveals that knowledge of white mangroves was an early formative stage in cultivators' fabrication of coastal land-use systems. Lastly, from an examination of loanwords, the study discusses the important contributions made by Mande groups, who speak the Susu language in the Rio Nunez region, in intensifying mangrove rice-farming systems indigenous to the coast and extending them from zones of white to those of red mangroves. The interdisciplinary methods and sources enable the study to capture localized experimentation and innovation as continuous processes, thereby breaking with the current literature's emphasis on diffusion from the interior to the coast.\n      </p>", "After reviewing some major features of the interactions between Linguistics and Philosophy in recent years, I suggest that the depth and breadth of current inquiry into semantics has brought this subject into contact both with questions of the nature of linguistic competence and with modern and traditional philosophical study of the nature of our thoughts, and the problems of metaphysics. I see this development as promising for the future of both subjects.\n      </p>", "Despite considerable activity in the various areas of \"sociolinguistics,\" the disciplinary boundary between sociology and linguistics is quite sharp in contrast with that between anthropology and linguistics. The quality of much research on language and society has suffered as a consequence of the lack of communication between the fields and absence of any exchange of competences. Two areas of research are discussed where interdisciplinary cooperation seems most promising: the social origins of linguistic change in progress, and the analysis of interaction in conversation.\n      </p>", "Speech, language, and discourse are objects of study, theoretical constructs, and methods of praxis within several disciplines. Aphasia, or disturbed speech/language due to brain dysfunction, provides an opportunity to examine and engage in discourse where word meanings change and the illusion of speaker intentionality is recognized. Speaking to aphasics evokes the experience of fieldwork in which \"dialogue\" is a means for making sense out of someone else's culture. Formal attempts to study aphasia are often concerned with representation--of \"speech,\" \"the other,\" and \"discourse\" itself. Linguistic approaches are accepted as scientific within aphasiology because they help to separate sense (discovery) from non-sense (artifact). Yet, a critique of linguistics-in-aphasia, motivated by other postmodern critiques of linguistics, quickly reminds us why representation is a modern failure. On the other hand, Derrida's suggestion that the \"free play of signifiers\" is a playful \"dissemination,\" which arises out of his critique of linguistics, is confounded by speech with aphasics. Tyler's postmodern dismissal of all science as empty formalism is not surprising since postmodern approaches tend to privilege meaningfulness. Hegemonic meaningfulness is more consistent with theorizations than with practices.\n      </p>"], "words": {"consider": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "illustrates": {"number": 1,
