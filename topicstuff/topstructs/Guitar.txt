{"total_words": 158, "documents": ["we investigate a role for vision in skilled guitar playing, focusing on visual contributions to the representation of basic first-position root chords (C, A, G, E, D). Experiment 1 involved naming or playing guitar chords displayed in different visual formats (letter, photograph, chart) and orientations. Experiment 2 employed a Stroop-like design, involving identification of the visual or auditory dimension for congruent or incongruent pairs of chord photographs and sounds. Our results demonstrate that visual representations of guitar chords are orientation sensitive and associated with their corresponding actions and sounds. We discuss the implications of our findings for understanding the multimodal nature of musical skill, and consider how the format of visual information can impact acquisition of musical skill.\n      </p>", "Some of the most interesting and puzzling early guitar sources are held in Portugal, at Lisbon's Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation and at Coimbra University Library. Notated in tablature, they display a large number of pieces of supposed African origin, along with many Iberian dances and instrumental items. While the African influence is suggested by the titles, literary sources, historical context and musical features, dances such as the arromba, c\u0101ozinho, cubanco, gandu, sarambeque, cumb\u00e9 and paracumb\u00e9 also reveal a strong connection with Iberian forms from the period, such as the canario, villano and j\u00e1caras. Its ultimate place of origin-Africa, Iberia or America-does not seem as relevant as the interaction process itself, with all the economic, social, racial and political implications: most of that repertory was shared by musicians in different places of the Iberian dominions in Europe, Africa and the Americas, be they white or black, slaves or free artists. The article contextualizes that repertory historically, relying mostly on the works by Brazilian poet Greg\u00f3rio de Mattos (1636-96), a source of information on the music heard in the streets, homes, convents and brothels of 17th-century Brazil. Many of his descriptions and opinions deal with the music of slaves, free blacks and mulattos; they include many of the titles found in Portuguese guitar tablatures. The analysis of this musical material raises important questions that are addressed in the article: was this music created by black guitar players who assimilated Iberian materials and playing techniques? Or was it composed by white Iberian musicians, maybe as exotic depictions, or caricatures? What is African and what is Iberian in such music, and on what terms did such interaction take place? The article finishes with historical data on Brazilian mulatto musicians-guitar players, singers and poets-who lived in Lisbon and enjoyed some success during the second half of the 18th century.\n      </p>", "This article presents a preliminary study of a new manuscript by the guitarist Santiago de Murcia recently discovered in Chile. The manuscript is entitled Cifras selectas de guitarra and is dated 1722. Among the c.8o works it contains, whether as single items or grouped together in suites, most are sets of variations on Spanish dances such as the villano, vacas and canarios, though French dances and even pieces of probable American origin, such as the cumb\u00e9, are also found. The article is divided into four sections: the first outlines Santiago de Murcia's importance and the previously known sources for his music (the Resumen de acompa\u00f1ar, printed in 1714, and the manuscripts 'Passacalles y obras de guitarra' and the 'C\u00f3dice Sald\u00edvar No. 4', copied c.1732); the second analyses the structure of the Cifras selectas de guitarra, the circumstances surrounding its discovery and its contents; the third studies the concordances between this manuscript and others by Murcia as well as other collections; and the fourth presents some hypotheses on the context for its production and reception, putting forward evidence to suggest that it was not intended for Madrid and surrounding regions, but possibly for Spanish America, and even specifically for Chile. All this necessitates revision of some of the received ideas about Murcia and reveals the wide circulation of guitar music in the 18th century.\n      </p>", "The purpose of this study was to identify the underlying aural factors of guitar performance by developing a guitar performance rating scale using facet-factorial techniques. The initial phase of the study included gathering items concerning the characteristics of a good or poor guitar performance from guitar performance literature, previously constructed rating scales, and statements from professional guitar players, guitar teachers, and college guitar majors. The item pool of statements was examined for suitability and placed into a priori categories established in previous research. The 99 item statements were paired with a five-point Likert scale and used by 67 volunteer judges to adjudicate 100 recorded samples of a wide range of guitar performance excerpts. The results of the 134 item pool adjudications were factor analyzed using a varimax rotation to identify the underlying factor structure and the items that best supported each factor. The results of the factor analysis yielded a five-factor structure consisting of interpretation, tone, technique, rhythm/tempo, and intonation. These factors accounted for approximately 71% of the total variance. The selection of the 32 items chosen to represent the factors of the Guitar Performance Rating Scale (GPRS) was based on factor loadings. Alpha reliability for the GPRS was estimated at .962 for the 32 item scale.\n      </p>", "Popular in the United States since the 1930s, the guitar is now widely available as a classroom teaching tool. Many music educators worldwide are finding the instrument useful in promoting student participation and engagement in music study. This article describes some of the pitfalls and opportunities the guitar affords.\n      </p>", "The string instruments lauded in Pierre de Ronsard's odes to the lyre, lute, and guitar serve to exemplify the range of his poetic powers and scope of his professional aspirations. In \"A sa lire,\" the subject poses as a restorer of ancient instruments, asserting his precedence as an inventor of French odes after classical models and revealing his ambition to conquer the court with a renovated national poetry. In \"A son luc,\" he invests the contemporary string with the epic-making potential of the Pindaric lyre, thereby announcing his intention to compose a French national epic. In \"A sa guiterre,\" he associates the instrument with the Horatian lyre. The guitar thus represents the amatory voice that surfaces occasionally in the odes collection, intruding on the nobler endeavors to which the young poet sought to draw attention. The ode to the guitar heralds the canzoniere that would be Ronsard's next major project and anticipates that his love poetry, rather than the odes or the projected epic, would prove a source of lasting fame.\n      </p>", "Tinkering has long figured prominently in the history of the electric guitar. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, two guitarists based in the burgeoning Southern California hard rock scene adapted technological tinkering to their musical endeavors. Edward Van Halen, lead guitarist for Van Halen, became the most celebrated rock guitar virtuoso of the 1980s, but was just as noted amongst guitar aficionados for his tinkering with the electric guitar, designing his own instruments out of the remains of guitars that he had dismembered in his own workshop. Greg Ginn, guitarist for Black Flag, ran his own amateur radio supply shop before forming the band, and named his noted independent record label, SST, after the solid state transistors that he used in his own tinkering. This paper explores the ways in which music-based tinkering played a part in the construction of virtuosity around the figure of Van Halen, and the definition of artistic 'independence' for the more confrontational Black Flag. It further posits that tinkering in popular music cuts across musical genres, and joins music to broader cultural currents around technology, such as technological enthusiasm, the do-it-yourself (DIY) ethos, and the use of technology for the purposes of fortifying masculinity.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

It is divided into three sections. The first synthesizes the previous data and conjectures about Murcia and his known sources (a printed book and three manuscripts), taking into consideration the suggestions about an eventual trip to Mexico and his possible links with a family of instrument builders from the court in Madrid. The second outlines, for the first time, a biography based on documentary evidence found in Spanish archives, demonstrating that his parents were Juan de Murcia and Magdalena Hern\u00e1ndez, and that he was born in Madrid in 1673 and died there in 1739, which implies, among other things, that he was probably a well-known guitarist when he entered the queen's household in about 1704. Finally, the third part explores the ways in which this new evidence modifies some of our current views and assumptions on Santiago de Murcia's work, pointing out that some of his music had to be written at (or before) the beginning of 18th century and that at least two of the inheritors of his music papers had close contacts with Mexico, which might be related to the preservation of most of his sources there.\n      </p>", "\"Johnny Guitar's\" allegorical uses of politics and gender are highly contradictory.
