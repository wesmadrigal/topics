Powerful alters enable them to act out wishes they cannot express directly. Possession serves both as an idiom of distress and of indirect self-assertion, facilitated by ritualized, culturally structured dissociation.\n      </p>", "The recent renewal of interest in trance, within the field of ethnomusicology as well as without, warrants a reconsideration of the particular challenges of studying musics of spirit possession. These include a disciplinary focus on 'the music', an approach that runs the risk of artificially abstracting music from the larger ritual and cultural complex of which it is a part. They also involve wrestling with the limits of epistemology and with personal convictions and social biases that influence the encounter with the unseen. Particularly problematic is the tension between native explication of possession trance, which grants agency to supernatural beings, and the parameters of academic discourse, which are shaped by the search for 'rational' explanations. These entrenched yet often unacknowledged attitudes, I argue, can be counterproductive, for they prevent us from learning from, or even acknowledging, indigenous understandings of the relations between music, trance, and possession, and ultimately reify the barrier between Self and Other. Drawing on my ethnographic experience studying and performing Tunisian stambeli, I consider the potential value of applying a radically empirical approach to the study of spirit possession musics.\n      </p>", "An investigation into the possible motivations for the engraving of the petroglyphs in the Fontainebleau region in central France.

Sociologists have long concerned themselves with the distinction between individual reactions to external stimuli and social behavior. While trance states may be individual responses, they also involve subtle forms of social interaction and are dependent upon the context in which they occur. The repetitive format of ritual activities can trigger and help to sustain trance behaviors. Data for this analysis of religious experiences in public settings are drawn from audio and video recordings of worship services among the African Apostles, an indigenous African church. Members' own accounts of the trance states are examined in concert with the recorded materials in order to gain insight into the subjective and social interpretations of collective religious experience.\n      </p>", "A small but significant body of recent research has successfully crossed the boundaries between ethnomusicology and psychology, and both disciplines are demonstrating a growing interest in charting interactions between music, context and individual consciousness. The phenomenon of trance is a clear example of the interaction of mind with specific cultural contexts, and cross-disciplinary approaches would appear highly relevant to future research. However, outside ethnomusicology and anthropology, despite the burgeoning field of music and consciousness studies, attitudes towards the constructs of trance and altered states of consciousness as reputable areas of scholarly enquiry are somewhat ambivalent. One reason for this is a continued lack of academic consensus over definitions of the terms 'trance' and 'altered states'. This paper re-assesses the different ways in which trance has been conceptualised in the literature. It argues that the continued ethnomusicological focus on high arousal models of trance has led to the neglect (or exclusion) of other types of trancing, particularly specific instances of European-American secular trancing, and associated literature. I draw on my own UKbased study of solitary musical involvement in daily life, which has been informed by both psychological and ethnomusicological perspectives.\n      </p>", "The trance hypothesis for Bushman rock art has not been fully accepted because the underlying principle has gone unrecognized.

Three case studies of kagura are examined: (1) \u014cmoto Kagura, in which an authentic shamanic trance is still performed and which serves as a point of comparison; (2) Hana Matsuri, which has a kagura dance which is believed to indicate that the dance once included a possession-trance (\"kamigakari\"); (3) Hayachine Kagura which never included a possession-trance but still displays clear shamanic choreography in its dances. Using these case studies, the shamanic character of kagura is discussed, as well as why such shamanic choreography is preserved even where real trance does not exist. It is also shown how \"kamigakari\" is expressed in dance and how it functions in such performances.\n      </p>", "Bone destruction, caused by aberrant production and activation of osteoclasts, is a prominent feature of multiple myeloma. We demonstrate that myeloma stimulates osteoclastogenesis by triggering a coordinated increase in the tumor necrosis factor-related activation-induced cytokine (TRANCE) and decrease in its decoy receptor, osteoprotegerin (OPG). Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization studies of bone marrow specimens indicate that in vivo, deregulation of the TRANCE-OPG cytokine axis occurs in myeloma, but not in the limited plasma cell disorder monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance or in nonmyeloma hematologic malignancies. In coculture, myeloma cell lines stimulate expression of TRANCE and inhibit expression of OPG by stromal cells. Osteoclastogenesis, the functional consequence of increased TRANCE expression, is counteracted by addition of a recombinant TRANCE inhibitor, RANK-Fc, to marrow/myeloma cocultures. Myeloma-stroma interaction also has been postulated to support progression of the malignant clone. In the SCID-hu murine model of human myeloma, administration of RANK-Fc both prevents myeloma-induced bone destruction and interferes with myeloma progression. Our data identify TRANCE and OPG as key cytokines whose deregulation promotes bone destruction and supports myeloma growth.\n      </p>", "Examination of cultural and social factors surrounding zar spirit possession diagnoses in Northern Sudan suggests that a major issue addressed by the cult is the cultural overdetermination of women's selfhood. Circumcision and infibulation operate to establish in women a sense of self congruent with the cultural image of woman as reproducer. When experiences and expectations fail to mesh, some women fall ill and are ultimately diagnosed as possessed. Through acceptance of the possession diagnosis and participation in curing rites involving trance, a patient is given scope to expand and regenerate her sense of self and recontextualize her experiences.

However, it is wrong to suppose that this characteristic can be observed only in poems which draw upon the inner world of fantasy for their imagery. In a considerable body of his earlier poems, Rossetti evokes a level of dreaming by means of the intense representation of external, rather than internal, reality. His aim is to suggest that he, or a central character, is in the grip of an emotion so intense that he has slipped away from the controls of waking consciousness into a state of mental abstraction wherein sense experiences come to him in the highly acute mode of the dream, in a random fashion that full consciousness never allows. He has, in short, been transported to the state of trance. This concern with the process of the dream-state rather than its substance can be seen in poems that arise out of circumstances of anguish, such as \"The Woodspurge\" and others that deal with the supra-rational accession of insight, such as \"The Card Dealer.\" In \"The Blessed Damozel\" the two concerns coalesce, pointing to Rossetti's later manner as a poet of dream.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Tumor necrosis factor-related, activation-induced cytokine (TRANCE), a tumor necrosis factor family member, mediates survival of dendritic cells in the immune system and is required for osteoclast differentiation and activation in the skeleton. We report the skeletal phenotype of TRANCE-deficient mice and its rescue by the TRANCE transgene specifically expressed in lymphocytes. TRANCE-deficient mice showed severe osteopetrosis, with no osteoclasts, marrow spaces, or tooth eruption, and exhibited profound growth retardation at several skeletal sites, including the limbs, skull, and vertebrae. These mice had marked chondrodysplasia, with thick, irregular growth plates and a relative increase in hypertrophic chondrocytes. Transgenic overexpression of TRANCE in lymphocytes of TRANCE-deficient mice rescued osteoclast development in two locations in growing long bones: excavation of marrow cavities permitting hematopoiesis in the marrow spaces, and remodeling of osteopetrotic woven bone in the shafts of long bones into histologically normal lamellar bone. However, osteoclasts in these mice failed to appear at the chondroosseous junction and the metaphyseal periosteum of long bones, nor were they present in tooth eruption pathways. These defects resulted in sclerotic metaphyses with persistence of club-shaped long bones and unerupted teeth, and the growth plate defects were largely unimproved by the TRANCE transgene. Thus, TRANCE-mediated regulation of the skeleton is complex, and impacts chondrocyte differentiation and osteoclast formation in a manner that likely requires local delivery of TRANCE.\n      </p>", "This article provides an overview of anthropology's 150-year discussion of the incest taboo in light of the last 30 years of feminist and psychoanalytic discoveries about the incestuous abuse of children.

Symbolic self-portraits of shamans, with identification based on ethnographic analogy, are considered the most basic artistic evidence of shamanism. However, when attempting to infer shamanistic activity from rock art, it is necessary to test function with as many models as possible. Pictographs in Dillinger Cave (24CA346) in central Montana have been broadly classified as ceremonial based on setting and figure analogy. Figures at this cave serve as selectively the best test case in central Montana for the Neuropsychological Model of Lewis-Williams and Dowson (1988), which focuses on identifying kinds of figures that might be drawn during trance. Analysis indicates that Dillinger Cave figures resemble images created during an altered state of consciousness, supporting the shamanistic function of the art. However, concordance with the model does not establish that elements were drawn during trance, explain why or how trance may have been entered, or indicate cultural meaning of the drawings.\n      </p>", "Spirit possession healing in prerevolutionary China serves as an example of the more general phenomenon of possession trance.

This paper presents nineteenth and twentieth century Bushman ethnography to show that these people entered an altered state of consciousness that most researchers call 'trance' to heal the sick, go on out-of-body journeys, make rain and transform themselves into animals. The combination of trance experience with these 'supernatural' activities suggests that, whatever social differences exist between these Bushman ritual practitioners and those in certain Asian and North American societies, it is appropriate to term them 'shamans'.

Osteoclast-like cells (OCLs) are formed by coculturing spleen cells with osteoblasts or bone marrow stromal cells in the presence of bone-resorbing factors. The cell-to-cell interaction between osteoblasts/stromal cells and osteoclast progenitors is essential for OCL formation. Recently, we purified and molecularly cloned osteoclastogenesis-inhibitory factor (OCIF), which was identical to osteoprotegerin (OPG). OPG/OCIF is a secreted member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family and inhibits osteoclastogenesis by interrupting the cell-to-cell interaction. Here we report the expression cloning of a ligand for OPG/OCIF from a complementary DNA library of mouse stromal cells. The protein was found to be a member of the membrane-associated tumor necrosis factor ligand family and induced OCL formation from osteoclast progenitors. A genetically engineered soluble form containing the extracellular domain of the protein induced OCL formation from spleen cells in the absence of osteoblasts/stromal cells. OPG/OCIF abolished the OCL formation induced by the protein. Expression of its gene in osteoblasts/stromal cells was up-regulated by bone-resorbing factors. We conclude that the membrane-bound protein is osteoclast differentiation factor (ODF), a long-sought ligand mediating an essential signal to osteoclast progenitors for their differentiation into osteoclasts. ODF was found to be identical to TRANCE/RANKL, which enhances T-cell growth and dendritic-cell function. ODF seems to be an important regulator in not only osteoclastogenesis but also immune system.\n      </p>", "This essay examines alternative religious vocations and choices of cures that are open to women in the Sri Lankan Buddhist context.

It is a privileged medium through which these spirits reveal their wishes and conditions their willingness to assure the community's well-being. On the human side, in order to be possessed an 'opening of the mind' is requested and needs to be activated through collective song-dance performances that recall the flowing motions of the spirits' water world and convey the longing for this maternal universe. As a critique of the predominant use of the term 'agency' in reference to autonomy and resistance, this paper adheres to a context-based view that relies on the way the actors experience the phenomenon.

Becoming an oracle healer is related with an afflicted life crisis, arising from the need for spiritual expression. The crisis reaches its peak in a trance, which enables the appearance of a spiritual being and thereby only then sanctions the person's capability to be an oracle healer. The individual thus chosen must serve the community as healer of both people and animals. However, he or she must be trained first, i. e. learn consciously how to go into trance, a training which involves great effort and self-denial, both physical and financial. The burden connected with the office of oracle and healer is seldom assumed willingly, instead it is seen as a fate decreed by the spirits and gods. Yet, in the Tibetian-Ladakhian context, not to accept this calling means a life-long confrontation with the opposing powers of good and evil for the person. The denial of office can only be achieved when an official ritual of refusal is performed.
