Following historical research, we identified the sets of skis corresponding to the 'milestones' of skiing evolution in terms of ingenuity and technology, built replicas of them and measured the metabolic energy associated to their use in a climate-controlled ski tunnel. Six sets of skis were tested, covering a span from 542 AD to date. Our results show that: (i) the history of skiing is associated with a progressive decrease in the metabolic cost of transport, (ii) it is possible today to travel at twice the speed of ancient times using the same amount of metabolic power and (iii) the cost of transport is speed-independent for each ski model, as during running. By combining this finding with the relationship between time of exhaustion and the sustainable fraction of metabolic power, a prediction of the maximum skiing speed according to the distance travelled is provided for all past epochs, including two legendary historical journeys (1206 and 1520 AD) on snow. Our research shows that the performances in races originating from them (Birkebeiner and Vasaloppet) and those of other modern competitions (skating versus classical techniques) are well predicted by the evolution of skiing economy. Mechanical determinants of the measured progression in economy are also discussed in the paper.\n      </p>", "In large areas of the Austrian mountain region tourism represents the only economic alternative to alpine farming, and for decades its development has been promoted. There has been a great expansion of winter sports facilities and especially the development of mass skiing on glaciers. Opinions on glacier-skiing areas have differed widely right from the start, and the supporters as well as the opponents have put forward ecological, economic, and social arguments. The supporters comprise mainly inhabitants of the mountain communities involved; the opponents live primarily in urban areas. This paper aims to present the perspective of the locals, that is, of the population groups that are immediately affected. Their evaluation of glacier-skiing is predominantly positive although they have increasingly developed an objective, critical view. This enables them to take advantage of the favourable effects of such large-scale tourist projects while, at the same time, avoiding the negative ones. /// Dans beaucoup de r\u00e9gions des Alpes autrichiennes, le tourisme repr\u00e9sente la seule alternative \u00e9conomique \u00e0 l'agriculture de montagne. En cons\u00e9quence l'am\u00e9nagement touristique y est encourag\u00e9 depuis des d\u00e9cennies. L'expansion du ski alpin et l'\u00e9quipement des glaciers pour le ski de masse jouent dans ce sens un r\u00f4le particulier. Les opinions concernant les domaines de ski sur glacier \u00e9taient cependant, au d\u00e9but, tr\u00e8s partag\u00e9es. De la part de leurs partisans comme de leurs adversaires des arguments d'ordre \u00e9cologique, \u00e9conomique et social alimentaient la controverse. Parmi les personnes favorables viennent tout d'abord les habitants de la montagne tandis que les adversaires se recrutent essentiellement dans les r\u00e9gions urbaines. Nous exposerons ici le point de vue et les perspectives de la population locale, c'est \u00e0 dire de ceux qui sont directement concern\u00e9s.

Sein Ausbau wird daher seit Jahrzehnten forciert. Die Ausweitung des Schisports und die Erschlie\u00dfung der Gletscher f\u00fcr den Massenschilauf spielen dabei eine besondere Rolle. Die Meinungen \u00fcber die Gletscherschigebiete waren jedoch von Anfang an geteilt, und es wurden sowohl von den Bef\u00fcrwortern als auch von den Gegnern \u00f6kologische, \u00f6konomische und soziale Argumente ins Treffen gef\u00fchrt. Zu den Bef\u00fcrwortern z\u00e4hlen in erster Linie die Bewohner der Berggebiete, w\u00e4hrend die Gegner vor allem in den st\u00e4dtischen R\u00e4umen zu finden sind. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird versucht, die Perspektive der Einheimischen, d.h. der unmittelbar betroffenen Bev\u00f6lkerung darzustellen. Diese Bev\u00f6lkerungsgruppe bewertet die Gletscherschigebiete im allgemeinen sehr positiv und sie verbindet mit ihnen hohe \u00f6konomische Erwartungen. Sie entwickelt jedoch in zunehmendem Ma\u00dfe eine objektiv-kritische Sicht: Das versetzt sie in die Lage, die g\u00fcnstigen Wirkungen solcher touristischer Gro\u00dfprojekte in Hinkunft besser zu nutzen und die negativen Effekte st\u00e4rker zur\u00fcckzudr\u00e4ngen.\n      </p>", "A clinical study of 684 consecutive skiing injuries, all those observed during the 1960-61 season at a New England resort, provided data on frequency of specific types of injuries and on variations in type with age, sex, and skiing experience. Sprains were the most common injury, the ankle and knee the most frequent sites. Twenty-five percent of knee sprains were associated with a sprain or a fracture of an ankle, a syndrome which has been observed elsewhere. Fractures of the lateral malleolus accounted for 34 percent of fractures and 12 percent of all injuries. Eleven percent of the injuries were lacerations and abrasions. With increasing age there was a shift from fractures of the tibial shaft alone to fractures of both tibial and fibular shafts. Ankle fractures as opposed to tibial fractures were uncommon among the young members of the case series, but they increased markedly with advancing age. Since fractures from causes other than skiing accidents have also been shown to exhibit this pattern, these shifts may reflect fundamental age differences in injury thresholds. In addition, there were shifts in type of injury with sex and expertise. The data provided no evidence of a relationship between rates of application of force and type of injury, but such a relationship is possible.\n      </p>", "This report describes the first adequately controlled investigation of any type of recreational accident. The population at risk, those skiing at a large New England resort on four consecutive weekends, was sampled by interviewing and inspecting the equipment of every 50th person obtaining a ticket to ski. The case series consisted of the injured from the same population. The overall injury rate was 5.9 per 1,000 ski-man-days, but major variations in rates with age, sex, and skiing ability were found. Among males there was a significant association between the occurrence of injury and the use of nonrelease bindings. That this was true only for musculoskeletal injuries of the lower extremities suggests that the differences resulted from the bindings per se, rather than from associated differences in skiing. Among females no significant differences in any of the injury groups were found in relation to the use of release bindings. The most reasonable interpretation of this sex difference is that the forces required to disengage ski boots from these bindings tended to exceed the injury thresholds of females, but not those of males. This suggests that an attempt should be made through the lowering of release-binding thresholds to extend to females at least the partial protection such bindings now afford males. In addition, a similar attempt should be made to improve their efficacy for males. No differences were found between cases and controls with respect to a number of other variables, including age when person first skied, history of previous injury, height, weight, ski length, sleep during each of the previous 2 nights, and marital status. The directions which further research might take are discussed and strategies for prevention are outlined.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "The development of ski-runs and lifts for downhill skiing in the Black Forest has led to extensive damage. Vegetation cover and topsoil have been lost, resulting in soil erosion and extended needle-ice solifluction. The mapping of damage in skiing areas, primarily applied in alpine regions, is now being undertaken in lower mountain areas; it indicates the relationships between types of damage, frequency, distribution, location, aspect, and relief. The analysis of the snow-cover conditions at the Schauinsland between the winters of 1976/77 and 1993/94 shows an exceptional variability in snow depth as well as duration of snow cover. Classification of the damage on test plots for the period 1985/86 indicates that graded areas, used as pastures, are extremely susceptible to geomorphological processes, especially erosion and solifluction, and that consequential damage is very likely. It is possible to quantify the erosion and accumulation rates during the summer by simple measurements. The results of the study at Schauinsland reveal different parameters with which to evaluate recent geomorpho-dynamic processes. These can be used to develop a program for ski-tourism that will result in less damage and will allow damaged areas to regenerate. /// La construction de pistes et de t\u00e9l\u00e9si\u00e8ges pour le ski alpin en For\u00eat-Noire a caus\u00e9 des d\u00e9g\u00e2ts importants.

Flight profiles included 800-m, 400-m, 200-m, and 100-m flybys (horizontal distance from cliff nest on parallel course), as well as approaches and popouts where helicopters flew toward, or popped out from behind, adult-occupied cliff nests (0 m, horizontal distance). Between 1981 and 2007, during the only 8 years when nesting in the TCA was confirmed by presence of chicks, WPG annually flew 108-2,836 helicopter flights in the same drainages on 10-37 days between 15 December and 15 April, with no effect on early courtship, nest repair, or subsequent nesting success. Total WPG operating days (x\u0304 = 62.4) and helicopter hours (x\u0304 = 210.6) fluctuated annually but did not increase 1974-2007 (Cox-Stuart trend test, P = 0.371, 0.393, respectively). Apache helicopter testing (227 passes) did not reduce golden eagle nesting success or productivity rates within the same year (t 111,96 = 0.495, 0.782, P = 0.622, 0.436, respectively), or rates of renewed nesting activity the following year, compared with 81-101 non-manipulated nesting territories. We recorded no response during 66% and only watching during 30% of Apache passes at 0-800 m from nesting golden eagles. No other reactions occurred until after hatching when \u22644 golden eagles accounted for 5 flatten and 3 fly behaviors at 3 nest sites. No responding pairs failed to fledge young because of testing.Limited fly responses suggested helicopters only precipitated an imminent departure, rather than causing startled, avoidance reactions. Responsiveness between test weeks 1 and 2 decreased (X\u00b2\u2082 = 32.167, P \u2264 0.001). Apache helicopters were twice as loud as WPG helicopters at comparable distances. Sound decreased with distance, most rapidly when flights were perpendicular to cliffs or ridges. Eagle ambient behaviors and watching the helicopter occurred randomly throughout recorded sound levels during helicopter testing (76.7-108.8 decibels, unweighted). Much helicopter sound energy is below golden eagles' auditory threshold, thus reducing potential impacts. Neither our observations nor our testing indicated special management restrictions are required for helicopters flying near nesting golden eagles in northern Utah. Our results underscore the necessity for circumstance-specific research, as well as enlightened resource management to accommodate unexpected results.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

We examined changes in seasonal weather patterns in recent decades (1942-2005) at two Alaska destinations, King Salmon and Anchorage. The results indicate that climate warming has had both positive and negative effects on opportunities for tourism. The overall weather conditions for sightseeing in King Salmon have improved significantly with a lengthening of the season, which now starts 10 days earlier than in the 1940s. Conversely, weather conditions for skiing in Anchorage have deteriorated, primarily because weather suitable for skiing now ends about nine days earlier than in the 1940s. Future climate change (i.e., continued warming) is very likely to extend the sightseeing season at King Salmon, but is less likely to improve the quality of the peak season. At the same time, though warming is likely to shorten the total time for skiing each year at Anchorage, it is also likely to improve the quality of the winter season and increase the frequency of years when skiing quality peaks in mid-winter. For both activities, changes of spring temperature will have the greatest impact on tourism weather. Tourism indices such as the one presented here can be tailored to the requirements of specific tourist activities, providing an opportunity for improved tourism planning and decision making. /// Cette \u00e9tude pr\u00e9sente une m\u00e9thode d'identification et de cat\u00e9gorisation des variations m\u00e9t\u00e9orologiques saisonni\u00e8res propices \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s touristiques particuli\u00e8res et ce, \u00e0 l'aide d'un indice climatique touristique reposant sur des donn\u00e9es m\u00e9t\u00e9orologiques horaires.

Par contre, les conditions m\u00e9t\u00e9orologiques pour le ski se sont d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9es \u00e0 Anchorage, principalement parce que le temps se pr\u00eatant au ski se termine maintenant environ neuf jours plus t\u00f4t que dans les ann\u00e9es 1940.

The assessment of PA is a valuable and important issue, however, there are several methodological issues among the available methods of measurement that may have implications for the prevention of specific diseases. The purpose of this study was to examine the differences between an objective method of measurement and the subjective estimation of the PA for novice skiers. Seventy-five students aged 19-21 years old with no previous experience in ski participated in this study. Participants wore a heart rate monitor during practice in order to record the exercise intensity. Simultaneously, a trained observer recorded their time on task. A day after the objective measurement, the participants filled a questionnaire in order to estimate their perceived exertion during practice as well as their perceived time on task. The results showed (1) differences between the observed time on task and the perceived recalled time, (2) no differences overall between the recorded and perceived recalled intensity of exercise but when groups were split according to their objective intensity a difference was found for each group respectively. Participants overall had overestimated the time on task, but they had underestimated the intensity of their effort recalled 1 day after their practice. These results raise the question whether a questionnaire as method of measuring PA is reliable, especially when it is used to estimate energy expenditure. However, further studies must be made in order to examine the implications of such a question.\n      </p>", "           ", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The shepherds attacked it especially during the Valach colonization in the 15th and 16th centuries. Because the Valachs practiced summer grazing at high altitude, above the forest belt, they were deforesting the mountains not only from the mountain foot upward but also downward, lowering the timberline. Grazing and deforestation intensity and accompanying lowering of the timberline can be related primarily to the petrographical composition of the substratum, soil, relief conditions, vegetation, and ownership. In general, the best conditions for alpine grazing are found on the basic substrates, rich in minerals, with a thick and coherent soil cover and smooth slopes with few rock outcrops. After deforestation floristically poor associations develop on the more acid substrates which are less suitable for grazing. The bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) does not tolerate tramping by cattle and it is replaced by the grass Nardus stricta L. forming floristically monotonous and very poor meadows of hard grass (Nardetum strictae) which is also less suitable for grazing. On the carbonate substrata, especially on widespread dolomite and limestone, floristically rich pastures, which are highly suitable for sheep, develop following deforestation. Thus deforestation has proceeded most extensively on areas underlain by carbonate rocks resulting in a lowering of the timberline by 200 to 300 m (in some places by much more than this) below the level of the climax timberline. The most depressed timberline occurs in the Kriv\u00e1nska Mal\u00e1 Fatra (Small Fatra), the White Tatras (Belansk\u00e9 Tatry) and the West Tatras (Z\u00e1padne Tatry), in the carbonate part of the High Tatras (Vysoke Tatry), and of the Low Tatras. The relief and geomorphological conditions are important factors influencing the impact of man upon the timberline. The shepherd is attracted to smooth periglacial ridges such as those characteristic of the Small Fatra and Great Fatra (Vel'k\u00e1 Fatra), which are not very far from the timberline. During the 20th century the timberline has been influenced by recreational activities, especially by winter sports. Thick and long-lasting snow cover and periglacial relief provide good conditions for skiing. On grassy surfaces covered with grazing plant communities, water penetrates very slowly into the soil. In the region of timberline total precipitation is high and evaporation is low; slopes are smooth, grassy, and steep, so that runoff is rapid. Trampling by cattle destroys the plant cover and gives rise to rapid erosion. Deforested smooth and grassy slopes provide conditions for increased avalanche activity. The mountain areas most menaced by avalanches, where the timberline was especially lowered by grazing are the Great Fatra, the Mesozoic part of the Kriv\u00e1nska Small Fatra, the White and West Tatras, and in part the Low Tatras (N\u00edzke Tatry). Reduction of the above-mentioned undesirable phenomena is urgently needed. At timberline, it is possible to improve the forest and water economy, to develop the winter sport areas, and also to practice grazing. However, in order to understand the landscape processes as a basis for efficient land-use planning, it will be necessary to undertake a theoretical reconstruction of the climax or natural timberline.\n      </p>", "Outdoor winter recreation exerts an increasing pressure upon mountain ecosystems, with unpredictable, free-ranging activities (e.g., ski mountaineering, snowboarding, and snowshoeing) representing a major source of stress for wildlife. Mitigating anthropogenic disturbance requires the spatially explicit prediction of the interference between the activities of humans and wildlife. We applied spatial modeling to localize conflict zones between wintering Black Grouse (Tetrao tetrix), a declining species of Alpine timberline ecosystems, and two free-ranging winter sports (off-piste skiing [including snow-boarding] and snowshoeing). Track data (snow-sports and birds' traces) obtained from aerial photographs taken over a 585-km transect running along the timberline, implemented within a maximum entropy model, were used to predict the occurrence of snow sports and Black Grouse as a function of landscape characteristics. By modeling Black Grouse presence in the theoretical absence of free-ranging activities and ski infrastructure, we first estimated the amount of habitat reduction caused by these two factors. The models were then extrapolated to the altitudinal range occupied by Black Grouse, while the spatial extent and intensity of potential conflict were assessed by calculating the probability of human-wildlife co-occurrence. The two snow-sports showed different distribution patterns. Skiers' occurrence was mainly determined by ski-lift presence and a smooth terrain, while snowshoers' occurrence was linked to hiking or skiing routes and moderate slopes. Wintering Black Grouse avoided ski lifts and areas frequented by free-ranging snow sports. According to the models, Black Grouse have faced a substantial reduction of suitable wintering habitat along the timberline transect: 12% due to ski infrastructure and another 16% when adding free-ranging activities. Extrapolating the models over the whole study area results in an overall habitat loss due to ski infrastructure of 10%, while there was a &gt;10% probability of human-wildlife encounters on 67% of the remaining area of suitable wintering habitat. Only 23% of the wintering habitat was thus free of anthropogenic disturbance. By identifying zones of potential conflict, while rating its relative intensity, our model provides a powerful tool to delineate and prioritize areas where wildlife winter refuges and visitor steering measures should be implemented.\n      </p>", "In view of the damage and hazard they pose to human life and property, snow avalanches are a major natural hazard in the Romanian Carpathian Mountains. Despite the loss of life in recent years, geomorphological understanding of snow avalanches in Romania remains limited. The Sinaia ski area, located in the Bucegi Mountains, is the most important ski resort in the Romanian Carpathians with two distinct centres of skiing activity: the Valea Dorului and Carp Valley. Winter sports such as alpine skiing, freestyle and freeriding have significantly increased in popularity in recent years. The Sinaia ski area comprises both marked and off-piste trails, which make the region attractive to a wide range of skiers. At the same time, there is also an increased probability of hazardous avalanches due to both natural causes and the activity of skiers. In this paper we outline the use of the dendrogeomorphological method to reconstruct past avalanche activity and to assess the magnitude and frequency of avalanches in order to gain a better understanding of this hazard. Using the nearby mountain weather stations of Omu (2505 m) and Sinaia (1500 m), we examine the annual variation in the number of days with snowfall, heavy snowfall and the number of days with snow cover over the past 46 years, together with an assessment of the risk of avalanches. In order to achieve this, we obtained cores and cross sections from 62 trees in the area for dendrogeomorphological analysis. Tree-ring analysis demonstrates a strong correlation between meteorological data, avalanche risk and avalanche activity, when taking topographic parameters and tree distribution patterns into consideration.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Many sports landscapes are said to have become increasingly 'artificial' over time.

The analysis\u2014which refers to a stated preference framework\u2014contributes to the ongoing discussion of whether benefits resulting from reduced mortality risk should be valued differently depending on the age of the beneficiaries. By focussing on a life-threatening environmental phenomenon I show that the consideration of the individual's age-specific hazard rate is important. If a particular risk affects all individuals regardless of their age so that their hazard rate is ageindependent, VSL is rather constant for people at different age; if hazard rate varies with age, VSL estimates are sensitive to age. The results provide an explanation for the mixed outcomes in empirical studies and illustrate in which cases an adjustment to age may or may not be justified. Efficient provision of live-saving measures requires that such differences to be taken into account.\n      </p>", "New Zealand is a very mountainous country with sparsely populated mountain lands. While large tracts are held in private ownership and used in pastoral production, the majority is state owned. New Zealand's protected natural area system encompasses the Southern Alps/Ka Tiritiri o te Moana and the North Island peaks, with the highest mountains in the country within Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park, a World Heritage Site. Thirty percent of New Zealand's land area falls within the protected natural area system, managed by the Department of Conservation (DOC). Within these mountain lands, there is a range of mountain recreation opportunities including skiing, alpine climbing, hiking, wilderness fishing, and hunting. Aircraft-based activities, such as scenic over-flights, heli-hiking, and glacier skiing, dominate some mountain regions. Ski fields represent small enclaves of high-level facility and infrastructure development within an environment that is largely unmodified wilderness. To facilitate high-quality recreational experiences and protect the natural mountain environment, DOC provides facilities such as huts and tracks, and applies management techniques to minimize visitor conflict and biophysical impacts. Commercial activities in parks are managed through concessions that place controls upon these activities.\n      </p>", "The intoxication of recreational boaters has become a serious problem. The usual policy prescription to this type of problem is to step up monitoring efforts to deter excessive drinking. However, this may be too expensive. This paper examines an alternative strategy--substituting lower blood alcohol limits for monitoring blood alcohol levels. Statutes that lower blood alcohol limits would be especially useful in areas such as recreational boating where monitoring would be very costly. This same policy could be used to curtail socially excessive blood alcohol levels in air, bus and rail transportation and recreational activities such as snowmobiling and skiing.\n      </p>", "This study demonstrates how the joint distribution of a set of conditional trip counts to a system of recreation-sites can be adjusted for on-site sampling. An econometric approach is proposed that addresses both the size-biased distribution of the sampled visits and the weighted distribution of reported visits to ancillary destinations in a multivariate random utility framework. Estimation results indicate that uncorrected models produce biased estimates of trip counts and welfare measures. The empirical application examines jet skiing in the Lake Tahoe region.\n      </p>", "1. Areas of disturbed ground up to 1100m used for skiing in the Cairngorm Mountains, Scotland, and the verges of a new road to the skiing grounds, were seeded by the chairlift operators, and the roads authorities, between 1966 and 1968. The establishment of the seed mixtures, and the subsequent invasion by self-sown species, was followed from 1969 to 1976. 2. On the lower ground (up to 850 m) invasion by heather (Calluna vulgaris) was very successful, but on higher ground colonization by indigenous species was poor. Bryophytes, however, were successful at all altitudes, producing about 20% cover after 1 year, and 50% or more after 8 years. 3. Most colonizing vascular plants were also present in the surrounding undisturbed vegetation, but there were also a number of ruderals. These survived better than the local species in places such as road margins, where disturbance continued. 4. Lowland (60-210 m) turves transplanted satisfactorily to altitudes up to 1200 m, but did not increase much in size except at the lowest sites (650-690 m).\n      </p>", "Increasing demand for backcountry recreation opportunities during winter (e.g., snowshoeing, helicopter-assisted skiing, snowmobiling) in steep, high-elevation terrain has elevated concern about disturbance to brown bears (Ursus arctos) denning on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska, USA. To help identify areas where such conflicts might occur, we developed a spatially explicit model to predict potential den habitat. The model indicated brown bears selected locations for den sites with steep slopes, away from roads and trails. Den sites were associated with habitat high in elevation and away from potential human contact. We then compared areas with the highest probability of providing den habitat with patterns of snowmobile and nonmotorized recreation on a portion of the Kenai Peninsula. We found limited overlap between the 2 recreation activities and potential den habitat for brown bears. At the landscape scale, however, backcountry skiing overlapped more high-quality den habitat than did snowmobile riding. Our results may be used by land management agencies to identify potential conflict sites and to minimize the potential effects of recreation activities on brown bears in dens.\n      </p>", "Background: The extent to which helmet use reduces the risk of injury in ski- and snowboard-related accidents is unclear. We studied the association of helmet use with injuries of the head, face, and neck among skiers and snowboarders involved in falls and collisions. Methods: We conducted a case-control study, using ski patrol injury reports for the years 2000-2005 from 3 ski resorts in the western United States. We identified all skiers and snowboarders involved in falls or collisions who received care from the ski patrol. Helmet use among persons with injuries of the head (n = 2537), face (n = 1122), or neck (n = 565) was compared with helmet use among those involved in falls and collisions who received care for injuries below the neck (n = 17,674). We calculated odds ratios for head, face, and neck injury among helmeted compared with unhelmeted persons. Results: The adjusted odds ratios were 0.85 for head injury (95% confidence interval = 0.76-0.95), 0.93 for facial injury (0.79-1.09), and 0.91 for neck injury (0.72-1.14).

We evaluated seasonal habitat use by resident adult wolverines using radiotelemetry locations from 2 multiple-use landscapes in British Columbia. Food, predation risk, and human disturbance hypotheses were considered in logistic regression analyses of used and random landscapes. Male wolverine habitat associations were most supported by the food hypothesis in both summer and winter. Moose (Alces alces) winter ranges, valley bottom forests, and avalanche terrain were positively associated with winter male wolverine use. Habitat use by male wolverines in winter was also negatively associated with helicopter skiing areas in the Columbia Mountains. Habitat associations of females were more complex; combinations of variables supporting food, predation risk, or human disturbance hypotheses were included in most supported models from both summer and winter in both study areas. Females were associated with alpine and avalanche environments where hoary marmot (Marmota caligata) and Columbia ground squirrel (Spermophilus columbianus) prey are found in summer. Roaded and recently logged areas were negatively associated with female wolverines in summer. In the Columbia Mountains, where winter recreation was widespread, females were negatively associated with helicopter and backcountry skiing. Moose winter ranges within rugged landscapes were positively associated with females during winter. Our analysis suggests wolverines were negatively responding to human disturbance within occupied habitat. The population consequences of these functional habitat relationships will require additional focused research. Our spatially explicit models can be used to support conservation planning for resource extraction and tourism industries operating in landscapes occupied by wolverines.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "This research examined the enduring nature of involvement with three recreational activities (golf, downhill skiing, windsurfing) and associated products using a panel survey approach. Over 280 participants completed in-season questionnaires that assessed involvement using Laurent and Kapferer's (1985) Consumer Involvement Profile scale. Respondents were contacted with follow-up instruments in the off-season and preseason. The data suggested that activity involvement scores on the attraction (importance, pleasure) and risk probability dimensions were stable between seasons but sign (symbolic value) and risk consequence scores fluctuated. Product involvement scores for all four dimensions were stable both across seasons and based on length of participation. Positive relations were found between activity involvement and length of participation. Six distinct activity involvement-based clusters were found. Discriminant analyses suggested that cluster memberships were generally stable across seasons.\n      </p>", "Studies of soil movement have been carried out in the Sudetes Mts. for nearly 30 years, mainly by means of wooden pegs (columns). In those mountains three hypsometric-climatic zones were distinguished: low meadows, up to a height of 800 m, old forest at 800-1200 m and high meadows, above 1200 m. In the low meadow zone surficial creep movement amounts to 2-3 mm per year (mean value over 10 years). In the high meadows the soil movement rate is three times greater, 8-9 mm per year. In the old forest zone no creep movement was observed during 12 years.

Distance powerfully structures many human spaces, and its effects are constantly revised by new technologies. For analytical purposes, both physical and human spaces may be transformed to produce conceptually simplified descriptions of apparently complex processes.

Examples range over behavioural, Shakespearian, air passenger, cross-country skiing and other spaces, and include the effects of spatial structure on the diffusion of influenza, HIV, and a virulent form of rabies.

This study proposes two alternative approaches to introduce user-specific driving costs into recreation demand models. The first approach is based on a refined measurement of driving costs based on engineering considerations. The second strategy estimates perceived per mile cost as a function of vehicle attributes in an empirical framework. We find strong evidence that driving costs are a visitor-specific concept, and that prescribed and perceived costs differ substantially. However, welfare measures generated by these alternative specifications are not statistically different from those produced by the standard model in our application of jet skiing in the Lake Tahoe region.\n      </p>", "Human locomotion was studied for 160 societies through the use of early travel accounts, missionaries' reports, and the ethnographic literature. As a result of the value Western society has placed on a sedentary way of life, and the consequent devaluation of movement, the common \"striding gait\" of humans has taken on a kind of misplaced concreteness. Humans facultatively employ a number of locomotor patterns besides the habitual bipedal gait: long-distance running, climbing, leaping, crawling, swimming, and skiing (the latter two are not dealt with in this paper). Human locomotion, like that of animals, is an analogous rather than a univocal concept, admitting great variation, plasticity, and subtle differences in gait, style, speed, and endurance. These multiple concepts have important implications for the construction of models of the evolution of hominid bipedalism.\n      </p>", "Background: Snow sports such as skiing and snowboarding are recognized as hazardous, but population-based injury rates or specific risk factors have been difficult to estimate as a result of a lack of complete data for both numerator and denominator. Methods: We used data from 3 surveys to estimate the number of participants and annual number of outings in Quebec by age, sex, activity, and calendar year. Injuries reported by ski patrollers were used to estimate injury rates among skiers and snowboarders for the head and neck, trunk, upper extremity, and lower extremity. Results: Head-neck and trunk injury rates increased over time from 1995-1996 to 1999-2000. There was a steady increase in the rate of injury with younger age for all body regions. The rate of head-neck injury was 50% higher in snowboarders than in skiers (adjusted rate ratio [ARR] = 1.5; 95% confidence interval = 1.3-1.8). Women and girls had a lower rate of head-neck injury (0.73; 0.62-0.87). Snowboarders were twice as likely as skiers to have injuries of the trunk (2.1; 1.7-2.6), and more than 3 times as likely to have injuries of the upper extremities (3.4; 2.9-4.1). Snowboarders had a lower rate of injury only of the lower extremities (0.79; 0.66-0.95). Snowboarder collision-related injury rates increased substantially over time. Conclusions: Except for lower extremity injuries, snowboarders have a higher rate of injuries than skiers. Furthermore, collision-related injury rates have increased over time for snowboarders. Targeted injury prevention strategies in this group seem justified.\n      </p>", "Tourism has been part of the mountain economy in Sweden for the past century. With the current decline of the extractive industries in this rural area, tourism is taking on new significance for many communities. This article gives an overview of tourism in the extensive Swedish mountain region, with a focus on types of recreational activities and their regionality. The data presented are based on a national sample of participation in mountain tourism. Findings show that 43% of the Swedish adult population (2.66 million individuals) visited the mountains at least once during a 5-year period (1995-1999). Winter activities-skiing and snowmobiling-were the dominant forms of mountain recreation. Tourism activity patterns differ distinctively across the 4 mountain counties: whereas winter tourism dominates in the southern parts of the region, the north receives visitors mostly in the summer. Only 5% of visitors to the Swedish mountains are from outside Scandinavia. In a single year, 9 times as many people visited the Swedish mountains as live there, but despite these numbers the population in the region is continually decreasing.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Although the effects of price bundling on purchase behavior have been well researched, the effects of price bundling on postpurchase consumption behavior have received almost no attention. In this article, the authors build on the sunk cost literature (e.g., Thaler 1980, 1985) and predict that price bundling leads to a disassociation or \"decoupling\" of transaction costs and benefits, thereby reducing attention to sunk costs and decreasing a consumer's likelihood of consuming a paid-for service (e.g., a theater performance). Four studies show this to be the case. In two lab studies, the authors show that having a bundled four-day ski pass as opposed to four one-day ski tickets decreases a person's likelihood of skiing on the final day of a four-day ski vacation. They replicate this result in a field study, showing that multiperformance ticket holders are more likely to forgo a given theatrical performance than are single-performance ticket holders, all else held constant. In a final study, the authors show that the decreased attention to sunk costs brought about by price bundling can be either cognitively driven (i.e., it is difficult to allocate a single payment across multiple benefits) or motivationally driven (i.e., there is an underlying desire to avoid consumption). Their findings have practical implications for managers interested in predicting or influencing actual product consumption.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img
