{"total_words": 1034, "documents": ["PolC is the polymerase responsible for genome duplication in many Gram-positive bacteria and represents an attractive target for antibacterial development. We have determined the 2.4-\u00c5 resolution crystal structure of Geobacillus kaustophilus PolC in a ternary complex with DNA and dGTP. The structure reveals nascent base pair interactions that lead to highly accurate nucleotide incorporation. A unique \u03b2-strand motif in the PolC thumb domain contacts the minor groove, allowing replication errors to be sensed up to 8 nt upstream of the active site. PolC exhibits the potential for large-scale conformational flexibility, which could encompass the catalytic residues. The structure suggests a mechanism by which the active site can communicate with the rest of the replisome to trigger proofreading after nucleotide misincorporation, leading to an integrated model for controlling the dynamic switch between replicative and repair polymerases. This ternary complex of a cellular replicative polymerase affords insights into polymerase fidelity, evolution, and structural diversity.\n      </p>", "QxDB (quantitative x-modelling database) is a web-based generic database package designed especially to house quantitative and structural information. Its development was motivated by the need for centralized access to such results for development of mathematical models, but its usefulness extends to the general research community of both modellers and experimentalists. Written in PHP (Hyper Preprocessor) and MySQL, the database is easily adapted to new fields of research and ported to Apache-based web servers. Unlike most existing databases, experimental and observational results curated in QxDB are supplemented by comments from the experts who contribute input to the database, giving their evaluations of experimental techniques, breadth of validity of results, experimental conditions, and the like, thus providing the visitor with a basis for gauging the quality (or appropriateness) of each item for his/her needs. QxDB can be easily customized by adapting the contents of the database table containing the descriptors that characterize each data record according to an informal ontology of the research domain. We will illustrate this adaptability of QxDB by presenting two examples, the first dealing with modelling in oncology and the second with mechanical properties of cells and tissues.\n      </p>", "Reproducible and discriminating typing methods are required for epidemiological investigations. Numerical typing systems analyse patterns obtained in various ways by calculating similarity coefficients between isolates. In the present study, various measures of the efficiency of a numerical typing system are quantified. These include reproducibility, accuracy, and discrimination power. Three different numerical typing methods for Escherichia coli were compared using these measures: (a) Biotyping with API 50 CH system, (b) Biochemical fingerprinting with the API 50 CH system and (c) Biochemical fingerprinting with the PhP-EC system. Biotyping qualitatively measures the results of a set of biochemical reactions as + or -. Biochemical fingerprinting also uses biochemical reactions, but the tests are scored quantitatively by measuring the kinetics and intensity of each reaction. It was found that biotyping yielded poor reproducibility. When biochemical fingerprinting analysis was used with the API 50 CHE system the reproducibility and the discrimination was good. The PhP-EC system for biochemical fingerprinting showed equal reproducibility but was superior to the API 50 CH system with regard to discrimination power.\n      </p>", "The PhenePlate (PhP) biochemical fingerprinting system is an automated method for typing of bacteria, based on the evaluation of the kinetics of biochemical reactions, performed in microtitre plates. In the present study the PhP-Klebsiella/Enterobacter (KE) system was evaluated for typing of Enterobacter cloacae and employed to study the epidemiology of faecal E. cloacae strains isolated from infants in 22 Swedish neonatal wards. The PhP-KE system showed a high reproducibility and discrimination for E. cloacae isolates. Among 64 epidemiologically unrelated E. cloacae strains, 49 distinct phenotypes were found, and the diversity index was 0\u00b7985. E. cloacae was found as a part of the dominating Gram-negative aerobic bacterial flora in 83 out of 953 infants studied. The incidences of E. cloacae colonization varied between 0 and 35% in different wards, but in contrast to previous data for Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli, there was little evidence of spread of particular strains in the wards. We also discuss two different measures of nosocomial transmission of bacterial strains: transmissible strains and epidemic index.\n      </p>", "The human Paf1 complex (Paf1C) subunit Parafibromin assists in mediating output from the Wingless/Int signaling pathway, and dysfunction of the encoding gene HRPT2 conditions specific cancer-related disease phenotypes. Here, we characterize the organismal and molecular roles of PLANT HOMOLOGOUS TO PARAFIBROMIN (PHP), the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) homolog of Parafibromin. PHP resides in an approximately 670-kD protein complex in nuclear extracts, and physically interacts with other known Paf1C-related proteins in vivo. In striking contrast to the developmental pleiotropy conferred by mutation in other plant Paf1C component genes in Arabidopsis, loss of PHP specifically conditioned acclerated phase transition from vegetative growth to flowering and resulted in misregulation of a very limited subset of genes that included the flowering repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C. Those genes targeted by PHP were distinguished from the bulk of Arabidopsis genes and other plant Paf1C targets by strong enrichment for trimethylation of lysine-27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3) within chromatin. These findings suggest that PHP is a component of a plant Paf1C protein in Arabidopsis, but has a more specialized role in modulating expression of a subset of Paf1C targets.\n      </p>", "The PHP (patient hygiene performance) method for assessing oral debris was compared with the DI-S (debris index--simplified) aspect of the Greene and Vermillion OHI-S (oral hygiene index--simplified). In the PHP method, erythrosin dye is used to stain the debris, and the tooth surface is subdivided into five sections, each of which is assessed for the presence of debris. Two examiners calculated the DI-S and PHP scores for 55 children 11 to 12 years old. The investigation was structured to determine the interexaminer relationship for the DI-S scores and the interexaminer and intraexaminer relationship for the PHP scores when the teeth were stained with a dye tablet. In addition, the interexaminer relationship was determined for the PHP method when liquid dye was substituted for the dye tablet. The results of all methods were subjected to statistical analysis, and the following conclusions were drawn. 1. The examiners' results were more consistently alike when they used the PHP method than when they used the DI-S method. 2. Each examiner was able to repeat the PHP examination with a high degree of consistency. 3. The PHP method is sufficiently sensitive to justify its use in dental health education and research.\n      </p>", "Hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia caused by parathyroid hormone (PTH)-resistance are the only discernible abnormalities in pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ib (PHP-Ib). Because mutations in the PTH/PTH-related peptide receptor, a plausible candidate gene, had been excluded previously, we conducted a genome-wide search with four PHP-Ib kindreds and established linkage to a small telomeric region on chromosome 20q,which contains the stimulatory G protein gene. We, furthermore, showed that the genetic defect is imprinted paternally and thus is inherited in the same mode as the PTH-resistant hypocalcemia in kindreds with PHP-Ia and/or pseudo-pseudohypoparathyroidism, two related disorders caused by different stimulatory G protein mutations.\n      </p>", "We examined the expression of the \u03b1 subunit of the stimulatory GTP-binding protein (G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) in fibroblasts of subjects with pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) type Ia by transfer blot hybridization and S1 nuclease analyses. Six subjects with PHP type Ia showed decreased steady-state content of G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; \u03b1 mRNA. S1 nuclease analysis indicates that both long and short forms of G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; \u03b1 mRNA are decreased, with no apparent change in the ratio of long to short forms in PHP compared with normal individuals. It appears likely that in some cases of PHP type Ia the genetic lesion affects the maintenance of mRNA levels for all forms of the G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; \u03b1 subunit.\n      </p>", "Approximately 100 genes undergo genomic imprinting. Mutations in fewer than 10 imprinted genetic loci, including GNAS, are associated with complex human diseases that differ phenotypically based on the parent transmitting the mutation. Besides the ubiquitously expressed Gs\u03b1, which is of broad biological importance, GNAS gives rise to an antisense transcript and to several Gs\u03b1 variants that are transcribed from the nonmethylated parental allele. We previously identified two almost identical GNAS microdeletions extending from exon NESP55 to antisense (AS) exon 3 (deINESP55/deIAS3\u20134). When inherited maternally, both deletions are associated with erasure of all maternal GNAS methylation imprints and autosomal-dominant pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ib, a disorder characterized by parathyroid hormone\u2014resistant hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. As for other imprinting disorders, the mechanisms resulting in abnormal GNAS methylation are largely unknown, in part because of a paucity of suitable animal models. We now showed in mice that deletion of the region equivalent to deINESP55/deIAS3-4 on the paternal allele (\u0394Nesp55 &lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; ) leads to healthy animals without Gnas methylation changes. In contrast, mice carrying the deletion on the maternal allele (\u0394Nesp55 &lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; ) showed loss of all maternal Gnas methylation imprints, leading in kidney to increased 1A transcription and decreased Gs\u03b1 mRNA levels, and to associated hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Besides representing a murine autosomal-dominant pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ib model and one of only few animal models for imprinted human disorders, our findings suggest that the Nesp55 differentially methylated region is an additional principal imprinting control region, which directs Gnas methylation and thereby affects expression of all maternal Gnas-derived transcripts.\n      </p>", "We reviewed the records of 65 patients with panhypopituitarism (PHP) for the frequency and types of infections requiring hospitalization, and documented serious infections in 13 of 65 patients with PHP. The increased frequency of serious infectious diseases in patients with PHP is likely to contribute to increased age-specific mortality.\n      </p>", "Background: Falls are frequent occupational accidents, and are responsible for a significant amount of lost working time and, more importantly, for a high mortality. The factors involved in falling mechanisms can be of external or individual origin, the latter being less well identified. Aims: To assess the relations between certain individual characteristics and occupational accidents due to imbalance. Methods: A total of 427 male employees, who had been victims of at least one occupational accident with sick leave due to imbalance (cases) and 427 controls were recruited among the employees of a large French railway company. A standardised questionnaire on life conditions and professional factors, and a description of the accidents was filled in by an occupational physician for each subject. Results: Some job categories were more affected by a specific release mechanism of work related falls. Certain individual characteristics such as smoking, alcohol consumption, inactivity, sleep disorders, and request for a job change were correlated with the occurrence of occupational accidents. Sick leaves of eight days or over were more frequent in older and overweight injured workers. Some lesions were linked with the specific fall released mechanisms. Conclusions: Individual characteristics can increase the risk of occupational accidents, especially falling. This study identified subjects most at risk on whom prevention related to working conditions and falls could be focused.\n      </p>", "Pseudohypoparathyroidism, type I (PHP-I) is an inherited disorder of primary resistance to multiple hormones that work by stimulating adenylate cyclase. In an attempt to clarify the mode of inheritance of PHP-I, we measured the activity of the N protein, a receptor-cyclase coupling component, in erythrocyte membranes. Erythrocyte N-protein activity was reduced by \u2248 50% in erythrocytes of 15 PHP-I patients and was normal in 19 of their clinically normal first degree relatives. Reduced N-protein activity and the PHP-I phenotype in these families exhibited both dominant and recessive patterns of inheritance. This suggests that at least two distinct genetic loci are involved in inheritance of N-protein deficiency. In two additional families, dominant inheritance of the PHP-I phenotype was associated with normal activities of erythrocyte N protein. Thus, it appears that mutation of at least one additional genetic locus, not involving the N protein, can produce PHP-I.\n      </p>", "           ", "A role for differential glycoconjugation in the emission of phenylpropanoid volatiles from ripening tomato fruit (Solanum lycopersicum) upon fruit tissue disruption has been discovered in this study. Application of a multiinstrumental analytical platform for metabolic profiling of fruits from a diverse collection of tomato cultivars revealed that emission of three discriminatory phenylpropanoid volatiles, namely methyl salicylate, guaiacol, and eugenol, took place upon disruption of fruit tissue through cleavage of the corresponding glycoconjugates, identified putatively as hexose-pentosides. However, in certain genotypes, phenylpropanoid volatile emission was arrested due to the corresponding hexose-pentoside precursors having been converted into glycoconjugate species of a higher complexity: dihexose-pentosides and malonyl-dihexose-pentosides. This glycoside conversion was established to occur in tomato fruit during the later phases of fruit ripening and has consequently led to the inability of red fruits of these genotypes to emit key phenylpropanoid volatiles upon fruit tissue disruption. This principle of volatile emission regulation can pave the way to new strategies for controlling tomato fruit flavor and taste.\n      </p>", "We studied platelets of patients with the genetic disorder pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) to test whether the nucleotide-binding proteins mediating stimulation of adenylate cyclase (termed Ns) are identical to those mediating inhibition of cyclase (termed Ni). Functional responses to hormones that work through stimulation of adenylate cyclase are blunted in PHP patients. The erythrocytes of many of these patients (PHP-Ia) have previously been shown to have decreased Ns activity whereas those of other PHP patients (PHP-Ib) have normal Ns activity. We find that this decreased Ns activity (measured by the ability to restore adenylate cyclase activity to membranes prepared from S49 cyc- cells) also occurs in the platelets of PHP-Ia but not of PHP-Ib patients. Platelets from both groups of patients accumulate less cAMP in response to prostacyclin than do platelets from control subjects. In contrast to the decreased Ns function in patients with PHP-Ia, we find that Ni function in platelets is similar in these patients and control subjects in several types of experiments: (i) epinephrine-mediated inhibition of prostacyclin-stimulated cAMP production in intact platelets; (ii) the affinity of platelet \u03b1 2-adrenergic receptors for epinephrine, as determined by competition for [3H]yohimbine binding; (iii) the decrease in receptor affinity for epinephrine produced by Na+ and GTP; and (iv) the concentration dependence of GTP for decreasing the affinity of these receptors for epinephrine. Because Ni is expressed normally in platelets from patients that are genetically deficient in Ns, we conclude that Ns and Ni are likely to be distinct gene products.\n      </p>", "Galen is well known as a critic of Stoicism, mainly for his massive attack on Stoic (or at least, Chrysippean) psychology in \"On the Doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato\" (PHP) 2-5. Galen attacks both Chrysippus' location of the ruling part of the psyche in the heart and his unified or monistic picture of human psychology. However, if we consider Galen's thought more broadly, this has a good deal in common with Stoicism, including a (largely) physicalist conception of psychology and a strongly teleological view of natural entities, shared features which are acknowledged in several treatises outside \"PHP.\" Why, then, is Galen such a remorseless and negative critic of Stoicism in \"PHP\"? Various factors are relevant, including the shaping influence on Galen of the Platonic-Aristotelian (part-based) psychological framework. But, it is suggested here, an important underlying factor is the contrast between two ways of thinking about the part-whole relationship, a 'composition' and a 'structure' approach or an atomistic and holistic approach. This contrast is most evident and explicit in one section of \"PHP\" 5, where Galen, criticising Chrysippus' holistic psychology, denies that the Stoic thinker is entitled to use the concept of part at all. But the contrast is also seen as pervading Galen's response to Stoic thought more generally, in \"PHP\" and elsewhere, in ways that inform his explicit disagreements with Stoic theory. Stoicism is presented here as having a consistently 'structure' (or holistic) approach. Galen's approach is seen as more mixed, sometimes sharing, or aspiring towards, a holistic picture, and yet sometimes (especially in \"PHP\" 5), adopting a strongly 'composition' or atomistic standpoint. This (partial) contrast in conceptual frameworks is presented as offering a new perspective on Galen's critique of Stoic psychology in \"PHP\" and on his relationship to Stoic thought more generally.\n      </p>", "Distance learning is an effective strategy to address the many barriers to continuing education faced by the public health workforce. With the proliferation of online learning programs focused on public health, there is a need to develop and adopt a common set of principles and practices for distance learning. In this article, we discuss the 10 principles that guide the development, design, and delivery of the various training modules and courses offered by the North Carolina Center for Public Health Preparedness (NCCPHP). These principles are the result of 10 years of experience in Internet-based public health preparedness educational programming. In this article, we focus on three representative components of NCCPHP's overall training and education program to illustrate how the principles are implemented and help others in the field plan and develop similar programs.\n      </p>", "The Public Health Programs and Services (PHP&amp;S) Branch of the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services began a strategic planning effort in January 1986 to meet new disease trends, curb rising health care costs, consolidate limited resources, and handle shifting demographics. A strategic plan was designed to assess the opportunities and challenges facing the agency over a 5-year horizon. Priority areas were recognized, and seven strategic directives were formulated to guide PHP&amp;S in expanding public health services to a changing community. Health promotion was acknowledged as a critical target of the strategic planning process. Among the most significant results of the health promotion directive was the establishment of an annual Public Health Week in Los Angeles County. Beginning in 1988, 1 week per year was selected to enhance the community's awareness of public health programs and the leadership role PHP&amp;S plays in providing these programs to nearly 9 million residents of Los Angeles County. Events in Public Health Week include a professional lecture series and the honoring of an outstanding public health activist and a media personality who has fostered health promotion. Other free community activities such as mobile clinics, screenings, and health fairs are held throughout the county. With intensive media coverage of Public Health Week, PHP&amp;S has been aggressive in promoting its own services and accomplishments while also educating the community on vital wellness issues. The strategic methodology employed by PHP&amp;S, with its emphasis on long-range proactive planning, is receiving national recognition and could be adopted by similar agencies wishing to enhance their image and develop unique health promotion projects in their communities.\n      </p>", "The ``justification hypothesis'' attributes mental retardation in phenylketonuria (PKU) to an inability of the heterozygous mother to deliver an appropriate amount of tyrosine to the PKU fetus who, in turn, is unable to correct for this deficiency because of its genetic constitution. We tested this hypothesis by measuring concentrations of tyrosine and phenylalanine in cord blood obtained at delivery from nine infants with PKU and five infants with persistent (non-PKU) hyperphenylalaninemia (PHP). For each of these specimens there were four control cord-blood specimens from infants born on the same day and, generally, in the same hospital. PKU and PHP groups were similar with respect to cord-blood tyrosine and phenylalanine values. There was no biologically significant deficiency of tyrosine in cord blood of the pooled PKU and PHP groups (54\u00b1 10 \u03bc M, mean \u00b1 SD) compared with controls (61\u00b1 16 \u03bc M, P = 0.13). On the other hand, phenylalanine in cord blood of the pooled PKU and PHP groups was significantly increased (144\u00b1 30 \u03bc M, mean \u00b1 SD) compared with controls (128\u00b1 24, P = 0.004). The magnitude of the differences in cord-blood tyrosine and phenylalanine between control and PKU subjects are so small that it is unlikely that they have any consequences for physical and mental development. The justification hypothesis, as it pertains to blood tyrosine at term, is not upheld.\n      </p>", "The G-box element is a moderately conserved component of the promoter of many inducible genes, including the alcohol dehydrogenase genes of Arabidopsis and maize. We used monoclonal antibodies generated against partially purified G-box binding factor (GBF) activity to characterize maize proteins that are part of the DNA binding complex. Antibodies interacted with partially purified maize GBF complexes to produce a slower migrating complex in the gel retardation assay. Immunoprecipitation experiments suggested that the protein recognized by the antibody is not a DNA binding protein in and of itself, but rather is associated with the DNA binding complex. These monoclonal antibodies were used to isolate cDNA clones encoding a protein that we have designated GF14. Maize GF14 contains a region resembling a leucine zipper and acidic carboxy and amino termini, of which the latter can form an amphipathic \u03b1-helix similar to known transcriptional activators such as VP16 and GAL4. Protein gel blot analysis of cell culture extract showed that a single, major protein of approximately 30 kD is recognized by anti-GF14; the protein is also present predominantly in the kernel and root. The deduced amino acid sequence of maize GF14 is more than 80% identical to Arabidopsis GF14 and Oenothera PHP-O, and is more than 60% identical to a class of mammalian brain proteins described as both protein kinase C inhibitors and activators of tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases. GF14 is found in a variety of monocotyledons and dicotyledons, gymnosperms, and yeast. This suggests a deep evolutionary conservation of a potential regulatory protein associated with a core sequence found in the promoter region of many genes.\n      </p>", "When the goldfish Mauthner cell fires an impulse there is a simultaneous hyperpolarization of adjacent medullary neurons as far as 200 micrometers from its soma. This hyperpolarization is due to an inward transmembrane flow of some of the current generated by the Mauthner cell spike and is sufficiently large to block spikes evoked both directly or transsynaptically.\n      </p>", "Pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia (PHP-Ia) results from the loss of one allele of ${\\rm G}_{{\\rm s}\\alpha}$ , causing resistance to parathyroid hormone and other hormones that transduce signals via ${\\rm G}_{{\\rm s}}$ . Most ${\\rm G}_{{\\rm s}\\alpha}$ mutations cause the complete loss of protein expression, but some cause loss of function only, and these have provided valuable insights into the normal function of G proteins. Here we have analyzed a mutant ${\\rm G}_{{\\rm s}\\alpha}$ (\u03b1s-AVDT) harboring AVDT amino acid repeats within its GDP/GTP binding site, which was identified in unique patients with PHP-Ia accompanied by neonatal diarrhea. Biochemical and intact cell analyses showed that \u03b1s-AVDT is unstable but constitutively active as a result of rapid GDP release and reduced GTP hydrolysis. This instability underlies the PHP-Ia phenotype. \u03b1s-AVDT is predominantly localized in the cytosol, but in rat and mouse small intestine epithelial cells (IEC-6 and DIF-12 cells) \u03b1s-AVDT was found to be localized predominantly in the membrane where adenylyl cyclase is present and constitutive increases in cAMP accumulation occur in parallel. The likely cause of this membrane localization is the inhibition of an activation-dependent decrease in \u03b1s palmitoylation. Upon the overexpression of acyl-protein thioesterase 1, however, \u03b1s-AVDT translocates from the membrane to the cytosol, and the constitutive accumulation of cAMP becomes attenuated. These results suggest that PHP-Ia results from the instability of \u03b1s-AVDT and that the accompanying neonatal diarrhea may result from its enhanced constitutive activity in the intestine. Hence, palmitoylation may control the activity and localization of ${\\rm G}_{{\\rm s}\\alpha}$ in a cell-specific manner.\n      </p>", "This study employed a case study design (Yin, Case study research, design and methods, 2009) to investigate the processes used by 5th graders to design and develop computer games within the context of their environmental science unit, using the theoretical framework of constructionism. Ten fifth graders designed computer games using Scratch software. The results showed students were able to design functional games, following a learning-by-design process of planning, designing, testing, and sharing. Observations revealed that game design led to opportunities for informal knowledge building and sharing among students. This, in turn, encouraged students to test and improve their designs. The findings support the conclusion that elementary students can develop programming concepts and create computer games when using graphical programming software developed for their level of experience. Insights into the iterative process of learning-by-game design are presented.\n      </p>", "The GNAS1 gene encodes the \u03b1 subunit of the guanine nucleotide-binding protein Gs, which couples signaling through peptide hormone receptors to cAMP generation. GNAS1 mutations underlie the hormone resistance syndrome pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia (PHP-Ia), so the maternal inheritance displayed by PHP-Ia has raised suspicions that GNAS1 is imprinted. Despite this suggestion, in most tissues Gs\u03b1 is biallelically encoded. In contrast, the large G protein XL\u03b1 s, also encoded by GNAS1, is paternally derived. Because the inheritance of PHP-Ia predicts the existence of maternally, rather than paternally, expressed transcripts, we have investigated the allelic origin of other mRNAs derived from GNAS1. We find this gene to be remarkable in the complexity of its allele-specific regulation. Two upstream promoters, each associated with a large coding exon, lie only 11 kb apart, yet show opposite patterns of allele-specific methylation and monoallelic transcription. The more 5\u2032 of these exons encodes the neuroendocrine secretory protein NESP55, which is expressed exclusively from the maternal allele. The NESP55 exon is 11 kb 5\u2032 to the paternally expressed XL\u03b1 s exon. The transcripts from these two promoters both splice onto GNAS1 exon 2, yet share no coding sequences. Despite their structural unrelatedness, the encoded proteins, of opposite allelic origin, both have been implicated in regulated secretion in neuroendocrine tissues. Remarkably, maternally (NESP55), paternally (XL\u03b1 s), and biallelically (Gs\u03b1 ) derived proteins all are produced by different patterns of promoter use and alternative splicing of GNAS1, a gene showing simultaneous imprinting in both the paternal and maternal directions.\n      </p>", "The GNAS1 gene encodes the \u03b1 subunit of the G protein Gs, which couples receptor binding by several hormones to activation of adenylate cyclase. Null mutations of GNAS1 cause pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) type Ia, in which hormone resistance occurs in association with a characteristic osteodystrophy. The observation that PHP Ia almost always is inherited maternally has led to the suggestion that GNAS1 may be an imprinted gene. Here, we show that, although Gs\u03b1 expression (directed by the promoter upstream of exon 1) is biallelic, GNAS1 is indeed imprinted in a promoter-specific fashion. We used parthenogenetic lymphocyte DNA to screen by restriction landmark genomic scanning for loci showing differential methylation between paternal and maternal alleles. This screen identified a region that was found to be methylated exclusively on a maternal allele and was located \u2248 35 kb upstream of GNAS1 exon 1. This region contains three novel exons that are spliced into alternative GNAS1 mRNA species, including one exon that encodes the human homologue of the large G protein XL\u03b1 s. Transcription of these novel mRNAs is exclusively from the paternal allele in all tissues examined.

However, in invertebrate embryos other than Drosophila, Hox gene functions remain largely unknown except by inference from sequence similarities and expression patterns. Recent genomic sequencing has shown that Caenorhabditis elegans has three Hox genes of the posterior paralog group [Ruvkun, G. &amp; Hobert, O. (1998) Science 282, 2033-2041]. However, only one has been previously identified genetically, and it is not required for embryonic development [Chisholm, A. (1991) Development (Cambridge, U.K.) 111, 921-932]. Herein, we report identification of the remaining two posterior paralogs as the nob-1 gene and the neighboring php-3 gene. Elimination of nob-1 and php-3 functions causes gross embryonic defects in both posterior patterning and morphogenetic movements of the posterior hypodermis, as well as posterior-to-anterior cell fate transformations and lethality. The only other Hox gene essential for embryogenesis is the labial/Hox1 homolog ceh-13, required for more anterior patterning [Brunschwig, K., Wittmann, C., Schnabel, R., Burglin, T. R., Tobler, H. &amp; Muller, F. (1999) Development (Cambridge, U.K.) 126, 1537-1546].

Underlying assumptions of this approach are that all diversity indices, including those that weight species importance by their relative abundance (e.g., evenness), are correlated positively, and that richness accounts for a large proportion of the variance in diversity. We addressed these assumptions with data from six grassland sites using univariate and multivariate analyses of a variety of indices (species evenness, richness, rarity, dominance, and Simpson's diversity index). Univariate correlations between plant species evenness and richness were weak and negative at each site. Principal-component analyses consistently revealed two significant components of variation in diversity. Richness and evenness were largely orthogonal, with Simpson's diversity loading between them. Thus, measures of species diversity based on relative abundance, as well as richness, may be necessary to capture the full complexity of diversity in conservation studies and in experiments of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. At these and perhaps other sites, species richness was an incomplete surrogate for diversity.\n      </p>", "Although it is accepted that extracellular fields generated by neuronal activity can influence the excitability of neighboring cells, whether this form of neurotransmission has a functional role remains open. In vivo field effects occur in the teleost Mauthner (M)-cell system, where a combination of structural features support the concept of inhibitory electrical synapses. A single spike in one M-cell evoked within as little as 2.2 ms of the onset of an abrupt sound, simulating a predatory strike, initiates a startle-escape behavior [Zottoli SJ (1977) J Exp Biol 66:243-254]. We show that such sounds produce synchronized action potentials in as many as 20 or more interneurons that mediate feed-forward electrical inhibition of the M-cell. The resulting action currents produce an electrical inhibition that coincides with the electrotonic excitatory drive to the M-cell; the amplitude of the peak of the inhibition is \u224840% of that of the excitation. When electrical inhibition is neutralized with an extracellular cathodal current pulse, subthreshold auditory stimuli are converted into ones that produce an M-spike. Because the timing of electrical inhibition is often the same as the latency of M-cell firing in freely swimming fish, we conclude that electrical inhibition participates in regulating the threshold of the acoustic startle-escape behavior. Therefore, a field effect is likely to be essential to the normal functioning of the neural network.\n      </p>", "The Phene Plate system for typing Salmonella serotypes (PhP-S) is a simple automated typing method based on biochemical fingerprinting. It gives a quantitative value of the metabolism of various substrates by measuring the speed and intensity of each reaction. The 'biochemical fingerprint' of each isolate is used to calculate similarities among the tested strains with a personal computer program. We used this system to examine a collection of 86 strains of Salmonella enteritidis isolated from human sporadic cases in Germany between 1980 and 1992. Twenty-three biochemical phenotypes (BPTs) consisting of 9 common (C) and 14 single (S) BPTs were identified. BPTs C2 and C4 containing 20 and 36 strains respectively accounted for 65% of the isolates. Strains of BPT C2 were found over a wide period of time whereas strains of BPT C4 were isolated during the period between 1988 and 1992. With phage typing, 11 discrete phage types (PTs) and 18 strains designated as non-specific type (NST) were identified. PTs 4 and 8 with 39 and 17 strains respectively were the dominant PTs. Strains of PT 8 were isolated over a wide period of time whereas all (except one) strains of PT 4 were isolated between 1988 and 1992. Combination of biochemical fingerprinting and phage typing divided the strains into 25 phenotypes (BPT:PTs). Whilst phenotype C2:8 was found over a number of different years, phenotype C4:4 was isolated only between 1988 and 1992. These findings indicate the presence of one persistent and one recently emerged phenotype among S. enteritidis strains in Germany. Although both methods identified the presence of both major and less common types, biochemical fingerprinting with the PhP-S system also provided information about relationships between the strains.\n      </p>", "Patients who have pseudohypoparathyroidism type I associated with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy commonly have a genetic deficiency of the \u03b1 subunit of the G protein that stimulates adenylyl cyclase (\u03b1 G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) (ATP pyrophosphate-lyase, EC 4.6.1.1). To discover the molecular mechanism that causes \u03b1 G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency in these patients, we examined eight kindreds with one or more members affected with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy or pseudohypoparathyroidism and \u03b1 G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency. In these families, \u03b1 G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency and the Albright hereditary osteodystrophy phenotype were transmitted together in a dominant inheritance pattern. Using a cDNA hybridization probe for \u03b1 G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;, restriction analysis with several endonucleases showed no abnormalities of restriction fragments or gene dosage. RNA blot and dot blot analysis of total RNA from cultured fibroblasts obtained from the patients revealed \u2248 50% reduced mRNA levels for \u03b1 G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; in affected members of six of the pedigrees but normal levels in affected members of the two other pedigrees, compared to mRNA levels in fibroblasts from unaffected individuals. By contrast, mRNA levels encoding the \u03b1 subunit of the G protein that inhibits adenylyl cyclase were not altered. Our findings suggest that several molecular mechanisms produce \u03b1 G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency in patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia and that major gene rearrangements or deletions are not a common cause for \u03b1 G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency in pseudohypoparathyroidism type I.\n      </p>", "The International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) has issued a revised \"Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants\" (IFAC Code). The IFAC Code is intended to be a model code of ethics for national accounting organizations throughout the world. Prior research demonstrates that approximately 50% of IFAC member organizations have adopted the IFAC Code as their organizational code of conduct. There is therefore empirical evidence that international convergence of accounting ethical standards is occurring. We employ Hofstede's (2008, http://www. geert-hofstede. com/hofs tede_ dimensions. php) cultural dimensions in an attempt to empirically explain accounting organizations' decisions about whether to adopt the IFAC Code or to retain their organization-specific code. Our results indicate that accounting organizations in cultures with high levels of Individualism and Uncertainty Avoidance are less likely to adopt the model IFAC Code. Organizations in high Individualism and Uncertainty Avoidance societies are therefore less likely to surrender the setting of ethical standards to an outside, international organization.\n      </p>", "Consistent chromosomal translocations in neoplastic cells may alter the expression of proto-oncogenes that are located near the breakpoints.

Haptoglobin (Hp) is unusual in that it is cleaved in the endoplasmic reticulum before it enters the Golgi. Here, we present evidence that the recently discovered complement C1r-like protein (C1r-LP) mediates this cleavage. C1r-LP has not previously been shown to possess proteolytic activity, despite its homology to trypsin-like Ser proteinases. We demonstrate that coexpression of the proform of Hp (proHp) and C1r-LP in COS-1 cells effected cleavage of proHp in the endoplasmic reticulum. This cleavage depended on proteolytic activity of C1r-LP because mutation of the putative active-site Ser residue abolished the reaction. Furthermore, incubation of affinity-purified C1r-LP and proHp led to the cleavage of the latter protein. ProHp appeared to be cleaved at the expected site because substitution of Gly for Arg-161 blocked the reaction. C1r-LP showed specificity for proHp, in that it did not cleave the proform of complement C1s, a protein similar to Hp particularly around the cleavage site. C1r-LP accounts for at least part of the endogenous proHp-cleavage activity because suppression of the C1r-LP expression by RNA interference reduced the cleavage of proHp by up to 45% in the cells of a human hepatoma cell line (HepG2).\n      </p>", "1. We investigated effects of declining plant species richness (S) on resistance to extremes in grassland communities. 2. Synthesized model ecosystems of different S, grown outdoors in containers, were exposed to a stress peak combining heat and drought. The heat wave was induced experimentally by infrared irradiation in free air conditions. 3. Before the heat wave, the more species-rich communities produced more biomass as a result of a large and positive complementarity effect that outweighed a small negative selection effect. 4. Water use during the heat wave was likewise enhanced by S, which could not be attributed to dominance of 'water-wasting' species. Instead, water consumption at high S exceeded that expected from changes in community biomass and biomass composition. The observed enhancement of resource (water) acquisition under stress with increasing S therefore probably originated from complementarity. 5. Despite enhanced water use in the more diverse communities, plant survival was significantly less, affecting all species alike. Physiological stress, recorded as photochemical efficiency of photosystem II electron transport, was significantly greater. Before the heat wave, the changes in biomass composition that coincided with increasing S did not favour species that would later prove intrinsically sensitive or insensitive. 6. Complementarity in resource use for biomass production had a cost in terms of reduced survival under stress, despite the likelihood of complementarity in water acquisition during exposure. The greater loss of individuals from the more diverse grasslands suggests enhanced risk of local extinction.\n      </p>", "Neoetropus macrops Hilderbrand and Schroeder, 1928, a nominal genus and species of dextral flounder known uniquely from the holotype, has been problematic regarding its identity and taxonomic status since its description. Previous treatments considered this dextral flatfish as a possible member of the dextral flounder family Poecilopsettidae or suggested it as a reversed individual of a sinistral paralichthyid species (either Etropus microstomus or Citharichthys arctifrons). However, its identity and status have never been confidently resolved. Following detailed examination of the holotype of N. macrops and comparison with other taxa, the identity and status of this species is resolved. Except for features determined to be anomalous in this specimen (dextral symmetry and short, ocular-side upper jaw), counts, measurements, and other morphological characters (e.g, arrangement of pelvic fins, position of urogenital papilla, and pattern of caudal skeleton ossification) of N. macrops agree with those of Citharichthys arctifrons Goode, 1880. Thus, N. macrops is identified as a reversed individual of the sinistral C. arctifrons. Accordingly, based on this finding, Neoetropus is relegated to the synonymy of Citharichthys Bleeker, 1862, and N. macrops becomes a junior synonym of C. arctifrons Goode, 1880. The reported capture location for this specimen (off the mouth of the Potomac River in Chesapeake Bay) is suspect because of its extremely unusual occurrence for C. arctifrons and discrepancies in documentation associated with this specimen.\n      </p>", "Two problems are encountered in calculating an oral hygiene index for adults. First, since examination of the surfaces of all teeth requires too much time, the index must be calculated from only a sample of surfaces. Second, the teeth included in the sample on which the index is based are missing in many patients. In this investigation, the best surfaces to include in a sample, as well as statistically equivalent surfaces which could substitute, were determined statistically. The oral hygiene of 80 adult patients was examined by the PHP (patient hygiene performance) method of Podshadley and Haley. Measurements were made of the facial and lingual surfaces of 14 upper and 14 lower teeth. These 56 measurements were then correlated and a cluster analysis performed on the correlations. Eight clusters were thereby identified. In decreasing order of size, they are: 1. Maxillary and mandibular facial surfaces 2. Anterior mandibular lingual surfaces 3. Maxillary lingual surfaces 4. Posterior mandibular lingual surfaces 5. Anterior maxillary lingual surfaces 6. Anterior mandibular facial surfaces 7. Anterior maxillary facial surfaces 8. Posterior maxillary and mandibular facial surfaces. To obtain a complete picture of a person's oral hygiene, one surface from each cluster should be examined.\n      </p>", "r />\n<a href=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1372266851850/PublicationAgreementCopyrightAssignment2013-04-16.pdf\">Publication Agreement</a> (PDF) \n<br />\n<br />\n <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"This link opens in a new window\" href=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1375801381661/PASP_page_charge_form_2012_updated_Jul_2013.pdf\">Page Charges</a> (PDF) \n<br />\n<br />\n <a href=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1290109707760/copy_and_perms.pdf\">Author&#8217;s Permission Guidelines</a> (PDF) \n<br />\n<br />\n <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"This link opens in a new window\" class=\"newWindow\" href=\"http://www.astrosociety.org/membership.html\">ASP Membership</a> \n<br />\n<br />\n <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"This link opens in a new window\" class=\"newWindow\" href=\"http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/PASP.html\">Index of Abstracts</a> \n<br />\n<br />\n <a href=\"/page/journal/publastrsocipaci/confhighindex.html\">Conference Highlights Index</a> \n<br />\n<br />\n <a href=\"/page/journal/publastrsocipaci/reviews.html\">Review Paper Indices</a> \n<br />\n<br />\n <a href=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1294672787522/PASPrecform.pdf\">Library Recommendation Form</a> (PDF) \n<br />\n<br /></p>\n\t\t\t", "r />\n<a href=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1372266851850/PublicationAgreementCopyrightAssignment2013-04-16.pdf\">Publication Agreement</a> (PDF) \n<br />\n<br />\n <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"This link opens in a new window\" href=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1375801381661/PASP_page_charge_form_2012_updated_Jul_2013.pdf\">Page Charges</a> (PDF) \n<br />\n<br />\n <a href=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1290109707760/copy_and_perms.pdf\">Author&#8217;s Permission Guidelines</a> (PDF) \n<br />\n<br />\n <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"This link opens in a new window\" class=\"newWindow\" href=\"http://www.astrosociety.org/membership.html\">ASP Membership</a> \n<br />\n<br />\n <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"This link opens in a new window\" class=\"newWindow\" href=\"http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/PASP.html\">Index of Abstracts</a> \n<br />\n<br />\n <a href=\"/page/journal/publastrsocipaci/confhighindex.html\">Conference Highlights Index</a> \n<br />\n<br />\n <a href=\"/page/journal/publastrsocipaci/reviews.html\">Review Paper Indices</a> \n<br />\n<br />\n <a href=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1294672787522/PASPrecform.pdf\">Library Recommendation Form</a> (PDF) \n<br />\n<br /></p>\n\t\t\t", "", "r />\n<a href=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1372266851850/PublicationAgreementCopyrightAssignment2013-04-16.pdf\">Publication Agreement</a> (PDF) \n<br />\n<br />\n <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"This link opens in a new window\" href=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1375801381661/PASP_page_charge_form_2012_updated_Jul_2013.pdf\">Page Charges</a> (PDF) \n<br />\n<br />\n <a href=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1290109707760/copy_and_perms.pdf\">Author&#8217;s Permission Guidelines</a> (PDF) \n<br />\n<br />\n <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"This link opens in a new window\" class=\"newWindow\" href=\"http://www.astrosociety.org/membership.html\">ASP Membership</a> \n<br />\n<br />\n <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"This link opens in a new window\" class=\"newWindow\" href=\"http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/PASP.html\">Index of Abstracts</a> \n<br />\n<br />\n <a href=\"/page/journal/publastrsocipaci/confhighindex.html\">Conference Highlights Index</a> \n<br />\n<br />\n <a href=\"/page/journal/publastrsocipaci/reviews.html\">Review Paper Indices</a> \n<br />\n<br />\n <a href=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1294672787522/PASPrecform.pdf\">Library Recommendation Form</a> (PDF) \n<br />\n<br /></p>\n\t\t\t", "This paper sought to determine the safety and feasibility of home-based prophylaxis of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) with misoprostol, including assessment of the need for referrals and additional interventions.

Organisms encode for evolutionarily conserved repair machinery, including specific AP endonucleases that cleave the DNA backbone 5' to the AP site to prime further DNA repair synthesis. We report on the DNA polymerase X from the bacterium Bacillus subtilis (PolX Bs ) that, along with polymerization and 3'\u20135'-exonuclease activities, possesses an intrinsic AP-endonuclease activity. Both, AP-endonuclease and 3'\u20135'-exonuclease activities are genetically linked and governed by the same metal ligands located at the C-terminal polymerase and histidinol phosphatase domain of the polymerase. The different catalytic functions of PolX Bs enable it to perform recognition and incision at an AP site and further restoration (repair) of the original nucleotide in a standalone AP-endonuclease-independent way.\n      </p>", "Biochemical reactions, using the PhP-EC system of biochemical fingerprinting, were evaluated in order to group strains into different clusters and to investigate whether a biochemical typing system may be used to distinguish between randomly selected Escherichia coli strains obtained from bacteraemic patients and healthy controls. Fifty epidemiologically unrelated strains isolated from blood of non-diabetic patients and 46 faecal control strains were studied. Separately, 70 E. coli strains from 64 diabetic patients with bacteraemia were investigated. Diversity index was 0\u00b7977, 0\u00b7969 and 0\u00b7941 respectively. The strains were clustered at a similarity level of 0.95. The bacteraemic and control strains were subdivided into 14 different clusters with 2-12 strains each and 40 'outliers'. The largest cluster was dominated by bacteraemic strains (9/12, 75%). Two other clusters were dominated by control strains. In the remaining groups blood and faecal isolates were evenly distributed. No biochemical test was able to distinguish between bacteraemic and faecal control strains. Strains from patients with diabetes mellitus were grouped in 11 clusters containing 2-14 strains and 22 'outliers'. The low diversity index of bacteraemic strains obtained from diabetic patients as compared to other strains indicated a greater homogenicity. However, no correlation was observed between the examined host factors and the clusters.\n      </p>", "The Global Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology Network (GIDEON) (http://www.gideononline.com) consists of 4 modules.

The purpose of the project was to test the utility of a behavior modification approach as an educational model for plaque reduction in a classroom setting. For the project group, 6 second grade classes (169 children) were selected from 15 classes at 3 elementary schools. Four classes for the control group (162 children) were chosen from the three schools that had classes participating in the project and the remaining two from a fourth school that was not otherwise participating in the project. The PHP-M index, a modification of the Personal Oral Hygiene Performance Index, which was used at five unannounced intervals, indicated that the project group's average plaque reduction of 30 percent was significantly different from the average reduction of 15 percent for the control group. The measure of plaque reduction provided an indication of behavioral change relating to plaque removal. Both boys and girls, children having varied intelligence quotients and reading skills, and the children of parents who were involved and not involved in the study improved their brushing skills nearly equally. Children in the control classes in project schools reduced their plaque scores more than children in control classes in nonproject schools.\n      </p>", "Many cooperatively breeding birds exhibit fine-scale spatial genetic structure as a result of restricted dispersal and habitat specialization. Sitta pusilla (Brown-headed Nuthatch) is a cooperatively breeding bird restricted to mature pine-dominated forests of the southeastern United States and has been undergoing population declines across most of its range. We used five polymorphic microsatellite loci developed for this species to examine fine-scale spatial genetic structure within a site in northern Florida as well as broader genetic structure among this site and two other sites (a second in northern Florida and one in southern Georgia). Spatial autocorrelation analyses within the more densely sampled site detected positive spatial genetic autocorrelation up to 1300 m in males when auxiliary males were included, but no autocorrelation was found in females or in males when auxiliary males were excluded. At the broader scale, we found small but significant genetic differentiation among all three populations, including two sites that were separated by less than 40 km of suitable habitat. Our results suggest that both sexes of the Brown-headed Nuthatch exhibit limited dispersal, with philopatric male auxiliaries contributing to more pronounced genetic structure over small geographic distances compared to females.Our sampled populations were in a region where much suitable habitat remains, yet we still observed limited dispersal. This finding suggests that in more fragmented regions, populations may become isolated and at risk of extinction.\n      </p>", "The fungi of genus Neotyphodium are systemic, constitutive, symbionts of grasses of subfamily Pooideae. In the southern hemisphere most of these asexual endophytes are the result of the hybridization between two sexual species, Epichlo\u00eb festucae and E. typhina, from the northern hemisphere. However the ancestral sexual species have not been detected in this region. Several grasses from Argentina are infected by Neotyphodium species. These endophytes are in general very similar macro- and micromorphologically and phylogenetically conform to species N. tembladerae. However the Neotyphodium spp. endophytes of some hosts, Bromus auleticus and Poa spicifomis var. spiciformis, have not been included in this species. In this work we studied the incidence and characterized the diversity of Neotyphodium species in populations of the native grass Bromus auleticus from Argentina. The incidence of endophytes was 100% in all populations investigated. Two groups of endophytes were differentiated by their morphologies, growth rates, conidial ontogenies and by relative resistance to the fungicide benomyl. Phylogenetic trees inferred from tefA and tubB intron sequences indicated that both N. tembladerae and the novel morphotype were hybrids of E. festucae and E. typhina, but the ancestral E. typhina genotype distinguished them. Isolates from plants that inhabit coastal dunes, xerophytic forests, savannahs and hills were similar morphologically and phylogenetically to N. tembladerae, whereas the endophytes from the humid pampa plains conformed to the novel group. We propose the endophyte of Bromus auleticus from humid pampas as a new species, Neotyphodium pampeanum.\n      </p>", "The highly productive coastal Mediterranean fishery off the Nile River delta collapsed after the completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1965. But the fishery has been recovering dramatically since the mid-1980s, coincident with large increases in fertilizer application and sewage discharge in Egypt. We use stable isotopes of nitrogen (\u03b4\u00b9\u2075 N) to demonstrate that 60%-100% of the current fishery production may be from primary production stimulated by nutrients from fertilizer and sewage runoff. Although the establishment of the dam put Egypt in an ideal position to observe the impact of rapid increases in nutrient loading on coastal productivity in an extremely oligotrophic sea, the Egyptian situation is not unique. Such anthropogenically enhanced fisheries also may occur along the northern rim of the Mediterranean and offshore of some rapidly developing tropical countries, where nutrient concentrations in the coastal waters were previously very low.\n      </p>", "The larval development of the sheepshead, Archosargus probatocephalus is similar to that of other perciform fishes. The caudal and the pectoral fins are the first to form and the pelvic the last. The yolk sac disappears at about 4.5 mm SL and adult color patterns begin to appear at about 7 mm and are complete by 15 mm. The development of basic pigmentation pattern is described. The osteological development of the skull, axial skeleton, fin supports and caudal elements is also described.\n      </p>", "Immunization with a phosphonate monoester transition-state analog of cocaine provided monoclonal antibodies capable of catalyzing the hydrolysis of the cocaine benzoyl ester group. An assay for the degradation of radiolabeled cocaine identified active enzymes. Benzoyl esterolysis yields ecgonine methyl ester and benzoic acid, fragments devoid of cocaine's stimulant activity. Passive immunization with such an artificial enzyme could provide a treatment for dependence by blunting reinforcement.\n      </p>", "The minor veins and surrounding chlorophyllous tissue of mature leaves of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) were examined with the electron microscope to determine the ultrastructural characteristics of the various cell types and the distribution and frequency of plasmodesmata between them. The abaxial phloem of the sixth- and seventh-order veins is characterized by a regular arrangement of cells such that each sieve-tube member is in contact with at least two companion cells. The abaxial phloem of the fifth-order veins has a variable cell arrangement, but each sieve-tube member is also in contact with at least two companion cells. The adaxial phloem of the fifth- and sixth-order veins also has a variable cell arrangement, but each sieve-tube member commonly is in contact with only one companion cell. The companion cells and phloem parenchyma cells of the abaxial phloem are quite distinct from one another cytologically; in contrast, these two cell types in the adaxial phloem are often difficult to distinguish from one another. Whereas the abaxial phloem of fifth- and sixth-order veins consists entirely of living cells, the adaxial phloem of the same vein orders commonly contains dead sieve-tube members and companion cells. Plasmodesmata occur along all possible routes from the mesophyll to the sieve-tube members of the minor veins, although the sieve tubes of the adaxial phloem may be more isolated symplastically than those of the abaxial phloem. Statistical analyses of the plasmodesmatal frequencies show that a preferential pathway for photosynthate transport, based on frequency alone, does not exist in the mesophyll, but that significant differences occur between the plasmodesmatal frequencies of cell combinations in the veins, perhaps indicative of an apoplastic step of vein loading.\n      </p>", "Arabic is the most widely spoken language in the Arab World. Most people of the Islamic World understand the Classic Arabic language because it is the language of the Qur'an. Despite the fact that in the last decade the number of Arabic Internet users (Middle East and North and East of Africa) has increased considerably, systems to analyze Arabic digital resources automatically are not as easily available as they are for English. Therefore, in this work, an attempt is made to build a real time Named Entity Recognition system that can be used in web applications to detect the appearance of specific named entities and events in news written in Arabic. Arabic is a highly inflectional language, thus we will try to minimize the impact of Arabic affixes on the quality of the pattern recognition model applied to identify named entities. These patterns are built up by processing and integrating different gazetteers, from DBPedia (http://dbpedia.org/About, 2009) to GATE (A general architecture for text engineering, 2009) and ANERGazet (http://users.dsic.upv.es/grupos/nle/?file=kop4.php).\n      </p>", "Symbolic gestures, such as pantomimes that signify actions (e.g., threading a needle) or emblems that facilitate social transactions (e.g., finger to lips indicating \"be quiet\"), play an important role in human communication. They are autonomous, can fully take the place of words, and function as complete utterances in their own right The relationship between these gestures and spoken language remains unclear. We used functional MRI to investigate whether these two forms of communication are processed by the same system in the human brain. Responses to symbolic gestures, to their spoken glosses (expressing the gestures' meaning in English), and to visually and acoustically matched control stimuli were compared in a randomized block design. General Unear Models (GLM) contrasts identified shared and unique activations and functional connectivity analyses delineated regional interactions associated with each condition. Results support a model in which bilateral modality-specific areas in superior and inferior temporal cortices extract salient features from vocalauditory and gestural-visual stimuli respectively. However, both classes of stimuli activate a common, left-lateralized network of inferior frontal and posterior temporal regions in which symbolic gestures and spoken words may be mapped onto common, corresponding conceptual representations. We suggest that these anterior and posterior perisylvian areas, identified since the mid-19th century as the core of the brain's language system, are not in fact committed to language processing, but may function as a modality-independent semiotic system that plays a broader role in human communication, linking meaning with symbols whether these are words, gestures, images, sounds, or objects.\n      </p>", "Background: The spread of influenza and highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) presents a significant threat to human health. Avian influenza outbreaks in downwind areas of Asian dust storms (ADS) suggest that viruses might be transported by dust storms. Objectives: We developed a technique to measure ambient influenza and avian influenza viruses. We then used this technique to measure concentrations of these viruses on ADS days and background days, and to assess the relationships between ambient influenza and avian influenza viruses, and air pollutants. Methods: A high-volume air sampler was used in parallel with a filter cassette to evaluate spiked samples and unspiked samples. Then, air samples were monitored during ADS seasons using a filter cassette coupled with a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay. Air samples were monitored during ADS season (1 January to 31 May 2006). Results: We successfully quantified ambient influenza virus using the filtration/real-time qPCR method during ADS days and background days. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the concentration of influenza virus in ambient air. In both the spiked and unspiked samples, the concentration of influenza virus sampled using the filter cassette was higher than that using the high-volume sampler. The concentration of ambient influenza A virus was significantly higher during the ADS days than during the background days. Conclusions: Our data imply the possibility of long-range transport of influenza virus.\n      </p>", "Block clustering and sedation reveal the underlying structure of ecological data structures by rearranging the rows and the columns of the data table or data matrix, usually representing species and sample sites, respectively. Classical approaches to this problem rely upon a goodness criterion optimized through an iterative algorithm or utilize a simultaneous classification or ordination of species and sites. The new procedure introduced here does not strive for a single optimal rearrangement. Instead, it generates a series of probability distributions, the Boltzmann distributions, for a large set of solutions that include both the optimal and suboptimal solutions. The procedure is governed by a hypothetical parameter, T, called the \"temperature.\" For the value of zero, only the best rearrangements (if there are many) have nonzero probabilities. As the value of this parameter increases, less optimal rearrangements become more frequent in the associated series of distributions. When T approaches infinity, the distribution becomes uniform over all the possible matrix rearrangements. We propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method which converges reasonably fast to this distribution for any value of T. This chain provides a sample of matrices that can be characterized via several statistics based on the Boltzmann distribution. The relevance of the method is demonstrated using ecological data. We illustrate how much extra information can be gained from suboptimal solutions that may have biological meaning not revealed by the best solution. Although the objective is to give a distribution of solutions rather than a single optimal solution, the new method can actually outperform heuristic searching algorithms in finding the best arrangement. We provide source code for the MCMC method in the C language, which can be compiled under many operating systems (Windows, Linux/Unix, Macintosh OS) and used in command line mode. The Linux/Unix version operates in interactive mode, it gives a graphical output of the results, and is available as a web server interface in PHP 4.3, which can also be installed on personal computers.\n      </p>", "Despite recurrent controversy, class theory remains the major sociological explanation of social inequality. While there are several approaches to class theory, one particular model has achieved dominance in empirical research over the last decades: the EGP (or Goldthorpe) class schema. In this article, the theoretical foundations of this model are tested empirically on the basis of unique Swedish data on employment relations. The outcome of the test is decisively negative for the theory. Reciprocal dependence relations between workers and employers-at the center of attention in current conceptual accounts, but never before explicitly measured-are conspicuously unimportant in a class context. Instead, the main source of class advantage among employees is the skill content of jobs. This accords well with parts of the early theoretical justifications of the EGP class model, elements that have since been abandoned. It is suggested that future theoretical work on class inequality should return to the skill-based roots of the model and proceed from there. Such a return is additionally motivated by a wealth of evidence from the literature on work-life stratification that class research has so far tended to ignore.\n      </p>", "Src homology 3 (SH3) domains are globular protein interaction modules that regulate cell behavior. The classic SH3 ligand-binding site accommodates a hydrophobic PxxP motif and a positively charged specificity-determining residue. We have determined the NMR structure of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate (IRTKS) SH3 domain in complex with a repeat from Escherichia coli-secreted protein F-like protein encoded on prophage U (EspF &lt;sub&gt;U&lt;/sub&gt; ), a translocated effector of enterohemorrhagic E. coli that commandeers the mammalian actin assembly machinery. EspF &lt;sub&gt;U&lt;/sub&gt; -IRTKS interaction is among the highest affinity natural SH3 ligands. Our complex structure reveals a unique type of SH3 interaction based on recognition of tandem PxxP motifs in the ligand. Strikingly, the specificity pocket of IRTKS SH3 has evolved to accommodate a polyproline type II helical peptide analogously to docking of the canonical PxxP by the conserved IRTKS SH3 proline-binding pockets. This cooperative binding explains the high-affinity SH3 interaction and is required for EspF &lt;sub&gt;U&lt;/sub&gt; -IRTKS interaction in mammalian cells as well as the formation of localized actin \"pedestals\" beneath bound bacteria. Importantly, tandem PxxP motifs are also found in mammalian ligands and have been shown to contribute to IRTKS SH3 recognition similarly.\n      </p>", "Vascular bundles and contiguous tissues of leaf blades of sugarcane (Saccharum interspecific hybrid L62\u201496) were examined with light and transmission electron microscopes to determine their cellular composition and the frequency of plasmodesmata between the various cell combinations. The large vascular bundles typically are surrounded by two bundle sheaths, an outer chlorenchymatous bundle sheath and an inner mestome sheath. In addition to a chlorenchymatous bundle sheath, a partial mestome sheath borders the phloem of the intermediate vascular bundles, and at least some mestome-sheath cells border the phloem of the small vascular bundles. Both the walls of the chlorenchymatous bundle-sheath cells and of the mestome-sheath cells possess suberin lamellae. The phloem of all small and intermediate vascular bundles contains both thick- and thin-walled sieve tubes. Only the thin-walled sieve tubes have companion cells, with which they are united symplastically by pore-plasmodesmata connections. Plasmodesmata are abundant at the Kranz mesophyll-cell\u2014bundle-sheath-cell interface associated with all sized bundles. Plasmodesmata are also abundant at the bundle-sheath-cell\u2014vascular-parenchyma-cell, vascular-parenchyma-cell\u2014vascular-parenchyma-cell, and mestome-sheath-cell\u2014vascular-parenchyma-cell interfaces in small and intermediate bundles. The thin-walled sieve tubes and companion cells of the large vascular bundles are symplastically isolated from all other cell types of the leaf. The same condition is essentially present in the sieve-tube\u2014companion-cell complexes of the small and intermediate vascular bundles. Although few plasmodesmata connect either the thin-walled sieve tubes or their companion cells to the mestome sheath of small and intermediate bundles, plasmodesmata are somewhat more numerous between the companion cells and vascular-parenchyma cells. The thick-walled sieve tubes are united with vascular-parenchyma cells by pore-plasmodesmata connections. The vascular-parenchyma cells, in turn, have numerous plasmodesmatal connections with the bundle-sheath cells.\n      </p>", "Although a binomial model gives an adequate description of the release properties of central afferent synapses, slight differences between experimental and predicted probability density functions are observed, with an excess number of responses recorded around the means. These discrepancies can be quantified by comparing experimental and theoretical entropies, which could relate to information transfer at these junctions. A model, based on the experimentally supported assumption that the postsynaptic membrane functions as a nonlinear processor, minimizes the differences between the distributions of the recorded and predicted potentials. According to this model, the nonlinearity is due to a localized interaction between the effects of simultaneously activated adjacent synapses.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Metamorphic and reproductive events in vertebrates and invertebrates are under endocrine control and are often correlated with developmental, behavioral, or reproductive changes in the parasites living in or on these hosts. This paper reviews selected examples of a) host hormone mediated influences on endoparasites in vivo, b) host hormone effects in vitro on protozoan, helminth, and insect endoparasites, and c) identifies possible relationships in hormone effects across parasite taxa. The significance of studies on endoparasites in vitro in relation to the impact of host hormones, antihelminthic, and prophylactic drugs on parasite growth and proliferation will also be addressed. A review of the literature indicates only limited studies have been done in vitro in an attempt to elucidate the bases of reported host hormone influences on endoparasites in vivo. Steroid hormones of hosts seem to stimulate growth, molting or encystment or both of helminth, insect, and protozoan parasites. Vertebrate steroids such as estrogen, testosterone, and progesterone had primarily reproduction- or growth-promoting effects or both on protozoan and nematode parasites. Insect ecdysteroids such as ecdysone, 20-hydroxyecdysone, and makisterone were the most widely studied steroids in vitro and induced growth or molting or both of cestode, nematode, and insect parasite larvae. Although juvenile hormone (JH III) stimulated growth in the protozoan and nematode parasites tested, the analogue methoprene and JH precursors, farnesal, farnesol, and farnesol methyl ether had various effects. Biogenic amines also varied in their effects on the nematode parasites tested, while the peptide hormone, insulin, stimulated growth in the protozoans tested. The evidence for in vitro effects of host hormones on their natural endoparasites is patchy at best. Additional studies are needed to identify the biochemical bases for the numerous host hormone mediated effects on parasites.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Affected members of most kindreds with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy have a partial deficiency of functional Gs, the guanine nucleotide-binding protein that stimulates adenylyl cyclase.

It is taken up by the cotyledons and exported via the sieve tubes to the growing hypocotyl and root. Two parallel pathways of external sucrose to the sieve tubes, directly via the apoplasm and indirectly after transit through the mesophyll, have already been established (G. Orlich and E. Komor, 1992). In this study, we analysed whether a symplasmic flow of sucrose contributes to phloem loading. Uptake of external sucrose into the mesophyll and into the sieve tubes, and export of total sucrose were measured with intact and exuding seedlings in the presence of p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid (PCMBS). Sucrose uptake into the mesophyll and into the sieve tubes was inhibited by 80\u201490%. Consequently, export of total sucrose slowed down. However, after the addition of PCMBS, sucrose was transiently exported in such a high amount that could not be accounted for by the residual uptake activity nor by the amount of sucrose confined to the sieve element-companion cell complex (seccc). From the results, we conclude that most of the sucrose exported transiently had moved to the sieve tubes from a symplasmic domain larger than the seccc, comprising at least all the cells of the bundle including the bundle sheath. We suggest that the symplasmic flow of sucrose observed is a mass flow driven by a turgor pressure. As a structural prerequisite for a symplasmic flow, plasmodesmata interconnect all the cells from the bundle sheath to the sieve tubes and also occur between the bundle sheath and the mesophyll. The phloem loading pathway of Ricinus cotyledons can thus be classified as a combination of three different routes.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The labelled pulse (moving auxin) and the following weakly radioactive zone (auxin and metabolites retained by the tissues) were localized by counting; microautoradiographs were made using cross sections from these two regions. During the second fortnight of April, auxin was transported by nearly all the cells of the young primary shoot, but the label was more concentrated in the vascular bundles. Auxin transport became the more localized: the cortical parenchyma appeared to lose its ability to transport the hormone (end of April), followed in turn by the pith parenchyma (May). Polar auxin movement at that time was limited to the outer part of the bundle (cambial zone and phloem) and to the inner part (protoxylem parenchyma). Later protoxylem parenchyma ceased to carry auxin. During the whole period of cambial activity, auxin was transported and retained mainly by the cambial zone and its recent derivatives. In September, before the onset of dormancy, and in February, at the end of the resting period, the transport pathways and retention sites for auxin were mainly in the phloem, where sieve tubes often completely lacked radiolabel. When cambial reactivation occurred in the one-year shoot, auxin was mainly carried and retained again in the cambial zone and differentiating derivatives.\n      </p>", "A simple and time efficient technique to illustrate specimens is described and demonstrated with Paleogene radiolarians. This method produces Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and composite focal depth Transmitted Light Microscope (TLM) images for single radiolarian specimens. We propose the use of this technique to clarify radiolarian taxonomy. This technique has distinct advantages over previously published time consuming techniques that can also require toxic materials.\n      </p>", "The honey dew of aphids feeding on the horizontally fixed stem of a Vicia faba plant was collected on a turning table. When the leaf below the pierced stem was provided with fluorescein, and the leaf above with a 14C-compound, the honey dew mostly contained both tracers. It could be shown that the attractive force of a single aphid is not strong enough to change the direction of transport. The tracers must have moved bidirectional in the same bundle and joined each other in the sieve tube before it was pierced by the aphid. There exists either a bidirectional movement in the single sieve tube, or the tracers move side by side in a \"homodromous loop-path\".\n      </p>", "Pruned source-sink transport systems from predarkened plants of Amaranthus caudatus L. and Gomphrena globosa L. were used to study the localization of 14C-labeled photosynthate imported into experimentally induced sink leaves by microautoradiography. During a 6-h (Amaranthus) or a 4-h (Gomphrena) transport period, 14C-assimilates were translocated acropetally from a mature source leaf provided with 14CO2, into a younger induced sink leaf (dark/-CO2). In addition, a young still-expanding source leaf exposed to 14CO2 exported 14C-assimilates basipetally into a mature induced sink leaf (dark/-CO2). Microautoradiographs showed that imported 14C-photosynthate was strongly accumulated in the sieve element/companion cell complexes of midveins, secondary veins, and minor veins of both the mature and the expanding sink leaf. Some label was also present in the vascular parenchyma and bundle-sheath cells. In petioles, 14C-label was concentrated in the sieve element/companion cell complexes of all bundles indicating that assimilates were imported and distributed via the phloem. Moreover, a considerable amount of radioactivity unloaded from the sieve element/companion cell complexes of petiolar bundles, was densely located at sites of secondary wall thickenings of differentiating metaxylem vessels, and at sites of chloroplasts of the vascular parenchyma and bundle-sheath cells. These observations were more striking in petioles of Gomphrena than Amaranthus.\n      </p>", "Extraction of natural gas from hard-to-reach reservoirs has expanded around the world and poses multiple environmental threats to surface waters. Improved drilling and extraction technology used to access low permeability natural gas requires millions of liters of water and a suite of chemicals that may be toxic to aquatic biota. There is growing concern among the scientific community and the general public that rapid and extensive natural gas development in the US could lead to degradation of natural resources. Gas wells are often close to surface waters that could be impacted by elevated sediment runoff from pipelines and roads, alteration of streamflow as a result of water extraction, and contamination from introduced chemicals or the resulting wastewater. However, the data required to fully understand these potential threats are currently lacking. Scientists therefore need to study the changes in ecosystem structure and function caused by natural gas extraction and to use such data to inform sound environmental policy.\n      </p>", "We examined the relation between the local density of species and the size of the geographic range for French riverine fishes. As for most other taxonomic groups, a positive interspecific relationship is found for this group. This relationship is robust to the confounding effects of phylogeny and is not a priori a product of other potential mechanistic artefacts. We formally tested two of the principal biological mechanisms already proposed (i.e. the niche breadth hypothesis and the resource availability hypothesis). We found no support for the niche breadth hypothesis. In contrast, we found consistent support for the closely related resource availability hypothesis. Species utilising resources (habitats) that are marginal tend to appear at low density and to have narrow distribution whereas species utilising widespread habitats tend to be more abundant and more widely distributed. Using data on body size and reproductive traits we explored the potential influence of these variables in explaining significant variation around the density-range size relationship. Only body size explains significant variation around the relationship, being negatively correlated with local density and positively correlated with range size.\n      </p>", "Functional genomic technologies are generating vast amounts of data describing the presence of transcripts or proteins in plant cells. Together with classical genetics, these approaches broaden our understanding of the gene products required for specific responses. Looking to the future, the focus of research must shift to the dynamic aspects of biology: molecular mechanisms of function and regulation. Phosphorylation is a key regulatory factor in all aspects of plant biology; but it is difficult, if not impossible, for most researchers to identify in vivo phosphorylation sites within their proteins of interest. We have developed a large-scale strategy for the isolation of phosphopeptides and identification by mass spectrometry (N\u00fchse et al., 2003b). Here, we describe the identification of more than 300 phosphorylation sites from Arabidopsis thaliana plasma membrane proteins. These data will be a valuable resource for many fields of plant biology and overcome a major impediment to the elucidation of signal transduction pathways. We present an analysis of the characteristics of phosphorylation sites, their conservation among orthologs and paralogs, and the existence of putative motifs surrounding the sites. These analyses yield general principles for predicting other phosphorylation sites in plants and provide indications of specificity determinants for responsible kinases. In addition, more than 50 sites were mapped on receptor-like kinases and revealed an unexpected complexity of regulation. Finally, the data also provide empirical evidence on the topology of transmembrane proteins. This information indicates that prediction programs incorrectly identified the cytosolic portion of the protein in 25% of the transmembrane proteins found in this study. All data are deposited in a new searchable database for plant phosphorylation sites maintained by PlantsP (http://plantsp.sdsc.edu) that will be updated as the project expands to encompass additional tissues and organelles.\n      </p>", "A key and diagnoses for 28 genera of Ochlerini are provided.

New species are Barola farfala, Catulona pensa, Catulona apaga, Clypona aerata, Coranda castana, Cromata ornata, Forstona speciosa, Pseudadoxoplatys mendacis, Schaefferella fusca, Stalius trisinuatus and Uvaldus concolor. New synonymy recognized is Melanodermus St\u00e5l, 1867, as a junior synonym of Ochlerus Spinola, 1837, resulting in revival of the combination Ochlerus circummaculatus St\u00e5l, 1867, and new combinations of Coranda picipes (St\u00e5l, 1872) and Stalius tartareus (St\u00e5l, 1862). Typhoeocoris Breddin, 1903, is placed in the synonymy of Caracia St\u00e5l, 1872, and T. fulvifemur Breddin, 1903, in the synonymy of C. sexdens St\u00e5l, 1872. The holotype of Parochlerus latus Breddin, 1904, is redescribed. The male genitalia of this species are described since only the female was known previously. A redescription of Tetrochlerus fissiceps Breddin, 1904, is given, and a voucher specimen is designated inasmuch as type material of this species is unknown. A lectotype and paralectotype are designated for Ochlerus tartareus St\u00e5l, 1862.\n      </p>", "Members of the genus Neotyphodium are asexual, seedborne, protective fungal endophytes of cool season grasses that have likely evolved either directly from sexual Epichlo\u00eb species, or by the interspecific hybridization of distinct lineages of Epichlo\u00eb and Neotyphodium. We investigated the evolutionary origins of Neotyphodium endophytes from several grasses that are indigenous to the Southern Hemisphere using a multiple-gene phylogenetic approach. Intron regions of the genes encoding \u03b2-tubulin (tub2), translation elongation factor 1-\u03b1 (tef1) and actin (act1) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses of these sequences, aligned with homologous sequences from Epichlo\u00eb spp., revealed the evolutionary origins of the Southern Hemisphere endophytes, where one lineage of apparently non-hybrid origin, and three lineages of unique interspecific hybrid origin were identified. On the basis of morphology, host range and evolutionary history, we propose three new species of Neotyphodium. Neotyphodium aotearoae was isolated from Echinopogon ovatus populations from New Zealand and Australia, and comprised a unique, apparently non-hybrid lineage within the Epichlo\u00eb species phylogeny. In contrast, an interspecific hybrid lineage was identified from two Australian Ec. ovatus populations, whose ancestry apparently involved lineages closely related to extant E. festucae and an E. typhina genotype similar to that of isolates from Poa pratensis. Endophytes infecting South African Melica racemosa and M. decumbens (dronkgras) appeared to be hybrids of E. festucae and N. aotearoae or close relatives. The names N. australiense and N. melicicola are proposed for these two hybrid lineages, respectively. The origin of N. tembladerae, an established endophyte species from South American Poa and Festuca spp., was also investigated. Neotyphodium tembladerae appeared to be of hybrid origin, involving E. festucae and an E. typhina genotype similar to that of isolates from Poa nemoralis. The results of this study highlight the widespread occurrence of interspecific hybrid Neotyphodium lineages on a global scale, and the extent of endophyte gene-flow between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.\n      </p>", "Reversible protein phosphorylation, which is catalyzed by functionally coupled protein kinases and protein phosphatases, is a major signaling mechanism in eukaryotic cellular functions. The red and far-red light-absorbing phytochrome photoreceptors are light-regulated Ser/Thr-specific protein kinases that regulate diverse photomorphogenic processes in plants. Here, we demonstrate that the phytochromes functionally interact with the catalytic subunit of a Ser/Thr-specific protein phosphatase 2A designated FyPP. The interactions were influenced by phosphorylation status and spectral conformation of the phytochromes. Recombinant FyPP efficiently dephosphorylated oat phytochrome A in the presence of Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in a spectral form-dependent manner. FyPP was expressed predominantly in floral organs. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants with overexpressed or suppressed FyPP levels exhibited delayed or accelerated flowering, respectively, indicating that FyPP modulates phytochrome-mediated light signals in the timing of flowering. Accordingly, expression patterns of the clock genes in the long-day flowering pathway were altered greatly. These results indicate that a self-regulatory phytochrome kinase-phosphatase coupling is a key signaling component in the photoperiodic control of flowering.\n      </p>", "The definitive mammalian middle ear (DMME) is defined by the loss of embryonic Meckel's cartilage and disconnection of the middle ear from the mandible in adults. It is a major feature distinguishing living mammals from nonmammalian vertebrates. We report a Cretaceous trechnotherian mammal with an ossified Meckel's cartilage in the adult, showing that homoplastic evolution of the DMME occurred in derived therian mammals, besides the known cases of eutriconodonts. The mandible with ossified Meckel's cartilage appears to be paedomorphic. Reabsorption of embryonic Meckel's cartilage to disconnect the ear ossicles from the mandible is patterned by a network of genes and signaling pathways. This fossil suggests that developmental heterochrony and gene patterning are major mechanisms in homplastic evolution of the DMME.\n      </p>", "The evolutionary origins of the chordate central nervous system remain uncertain. Conclusions drawn from classical morphological comparisons and from a broad range of metazoan phyla conflict with the new molecular genetic information from developmental model systems characterized by central nervous systems. This has led to debate as to the nature of the ancestral deuterostome nervous system. Hemichordates as basal deuterostomes occupy a phylogenetically critical position for addressing hypotheses on the evolution of the chordate nervous system. Characterizing the molecular basis of the development of their diffuse nervous system offers insights into the role of conserved body patterning genes in the evolution of specific neural anatomies. We present a description of hox gene expression during the development of the direct-developing hemichordate Saccoglossus kowalevskii. The nested ectodermal expression of these genes in a hemichordate suggest that they play a general patterning role in the anterior/posterior regionalization of the ectoderm of bilaterians rather than being uniquely associated with the development and evolution of central nervous systems.\n      </p>", "Throughout the brief history of nanoscience and nanotechnology, the prominence of digital images and animations is noteworthy. Many appear in online image galleries that provide an important public interface for presenting and promoting scientific research. In this essay, the authors examine a selection of images from image galleries, identify some of their features and functions, and discuss how the artistic and scientific conventions used to present these images define nanotechnology for both researchers and members of the broader public.\n      </p>", "           ", "The heat shock protein Hsp90 is known as an essential component of several signal transduction pathways and has now been identified as an essential host factor for hepatitis B virus replication. Hsp90 interacts with the viral reverse transcriptase to facilitate the formation of a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex between the polymerase and an RNA ligand. This RNP complex is required early in replication for viral assembly and initiation of DNA synthesis through a protein-priming mechanism. These results thus invoke a role for the Hsp90 pathway in the formation of an RNP.\n      </p>", "The Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data Center (fMRIDC) (http://www.fmridc.org) was established in the Autumn of 1999 with the objective of creating a mechanism by which members of the neuroscientific community may more easily share functional neuroimaging data. Examples in other sciences offer proof of the usefulness and benefit that sharing data provides through encouraging growth and development in those fields. By building a publicly accessible repository of raw data from peer-reviewed studies, the Data Center hopes to create a similarly successful environment for the neurosciences. In this article, we discuss the continuum of data-sharing efforts and provide an overview of the scientific and practical difficulties inherent in managing various fMRI data-sharing approaches. Next, we detail the organization, design and foundation of the fMRIDC, ranging from its current capabilities to the issues involved in the submitting and requesting of data. We discuss how a publicly accessible database enables other fields to develop relevant tools that can aid in the growth of understanding of cognitive processes. Information retrieval and meta-analytic techniques can be used to search, sort and categorize study information with a view towards subjecting study data to secondary 'meta-' and 'mega-analyses'. In addition, we detail the technical and policy challenges that have had to be addressed in the formation of the Data Center. Among others, these include: human subject confidentiality issues; ensuring investigator's rights; heterogeneous data description and organization; development of search tools; and data transfer issues. We conclude with comments concerning the future of the fMRIDC effort, its role in promoting the sharing of neuroscientific data, and how this may alter the manner in which studies are published.\n      </p>", "Two maize (Zea mays) genes, designated GRF1 and GRF2, have been isolated and characterized. The proteins encoded by these genes, called GF14 proteins, participate in protein/DNA complexes and show more than 60% identity with a highly conserved, widely distributed protein family, collectively referred to as 14-3-3 proteins. Members of the 14-3-3 protein family have been reported to activate Tyr and Trp hydroxylases, modulate protein kinase C activity, and activate ADP-ribosyltransferase. The mRNAs of the GRF genes are encoded by six exons interrupted by five introns. The transcriptional units of the GRF genes were found to be very similar, with complete conservation of the intron positions. In addition, the length and nucleotide sequences of the two genes' introns were highly conserved. The 5\u2032 flanking sequences of the two GRF genes were compared and regions of homology and divergence identified. This comparison revealed the presence of a conserved G-box element in the 5\u2032 flanking region of both genes. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays of maize protein extract with the GRF G-box indicates that GBF binds to this G-box site in the 5\u2032 upstream region of GRF. Antibody supershifts indicate that GF14 protein is associated with the G-box-binding complex that interacts with the GRF upstream region.\n      </p>", "1. By comparing plant species under the same experimental field conditions, the direct effects of plant traits on ecosystem processes can be studied. We have analyzed the role of leaf traits (leaf lamina dry matter content, LDMC; leaf lamina N content, LNC and specific leaf lamina area, SLA) for the annual above-ground primary productivity (ANPP) and quality (pepsin-cellulase digestibility, crude protein content) for herbivores of 13 perennial C3 pasture grass species. 2. These relationships were investigated over 2 years with monocultures grown in a fully factorial block design crossing the plant species, the cutting frequency and the N supply factors. 3. The within species variation in leaf traits, ANPP, digestibility and protein content was less than between species variation. Species ranks for leaf traits were conserved among N supply and cutting frequency levels. Highly significant (P &lt; 0-001) between species allometric relationships were found for LNC x SLA and SLA x LDMC, with common slopes but differences in intercept and shifts among factor levels. 4. The between species variation in ANPP was strongly (P &lt; 0-001) and negatively correlated with the fresh-matter based leaf N content (i.e. LDMC x LNC) and was not affected by SLA, apparently because of a trade-off between SLA and leaf lamina fraction. Digestibility increased with SLA and declined with LDMC. Protein content increased with both fresh and dry-matter based LNC. 5. N supply increased LNC and SLA but reduced LDMC. Cutting frequency increased LDMC and reduced LNC. In response to cutting frequency, changes in digestibility and in fresh-matter based LNC were positively correlated. 6. We conclude that the between species variation in the annual production of digestible energy and of proteins by pasture grasses is controlled in an additive way by two leaf traits: LNC and LDMC.\n      </p>", "In angiosperms, auxin phytohormones play a crucial regulatory role in fruit initiation. The expression of auxin biosynthesis genes in ovules and placenta results in uncoupling of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fruit development from fertilization with production of parthenocarpic fruits. We have identified two newly described genes, named Aucsia genes, which are differentially expressed in auxin-synthesis (DefH9-iaaM) parthenocarpic tomato flower buds. The two tomato Aucsia genes encode 53-amino-acid-long peptides. We show, by RNA interference-mediated gene suppression, that Aucsia genes are involved in both reproductive and vegetative plant development. Aucsia-silenced tomato plants exhibited auxin-related phenotypes such as parthenocarpic fruit development, leaf fusions, and reflexed leaves. Auxin-induced rhizogenesis in cotyledon explants and polar auxin transport in roots were reduced in Aucsia-silenced plants compared with wild-type plants. In addition, Aucsia-silenced plants showed an increased sensitivity to 1-naphthylphthalamic acid, an inhibitor of polar auxin transport. We further prove that total indole-3-acetic acid content was increased in preanthesis Aucsia-silenced flower buds. Thus, the data presented demonstrate that Aucsia genes encode a novel family of plant peptides that control fruit initiation and affect other auxin-related biological processes in tomato. Aucsia homologous genes are present in both chlorophytes and streptophytes, and the encoded peptides are distinguished by a 16-amino-acid-long (PYSGXSTLALVARXSA) AUCSIA motif, a lysine-rich carboxyl-terminal region, and a conserved tyrosine-based endocytic sorting motif.\n      </p>", "Aim To investigate the phylogeographical structure of the Guinea multimammate mouse, Mastomys erythroleucus (Temminck, 1853), a widespread murid rodent in sub-Saharan (Sahel and Sudan) savannas, for a better understanding of the impacts of geographical and historical factors on the evolutionary history of this species, in the context of the growing database of phylogeographical studies of African savanna mammal species. Location Sahel and Sudan savannas, Africa. Methods We sequenced the whole cytochrome b gene in 211 individuals from 59 localities distributed from Senegal to Ethiopia. Sequence data were analysed using both phylogenetic (several rooted tree-construction methods, median-joining networks) and population genetic methods (spatial analyses of molecular variance, mismatch distributions). Results Haplotypes were distributed into four major monophyletic groups corresponding to distinct geographical regions across a west\u2013east axis. Diversification events were estimated to have occurred between 1.16 and 0.18 Ma. Main conclusions Vicariance events related to the fragmentation of savanna habitats during the Pleistocene era may explain the phylogeographical patterns observed. Genetic structure was consistent with a role of major Sahelian rivers as significant barriers to west\u2013east dispersal. Recent demographic expansions probably occurred during arid phases of the Holocene with the southward expansion of savannas.\n      </p>", "Cheetahs and beetles run, dolphins and salmon swim, and bees and birds fly with grace and economy surpassing our technology. Evolution has shaped the breathtaking abilities of animals, leaving us the challenge of reconstructing their targets of control and mechanisms of dexterity. In this review we explore a corner of this fascinating world. We describe mathematical models for legged animal locomotion, focusing on rapidly running insects and highlighting past achievements and challenges that remain. Newtonian body--limb dynamics are most naturally formulated as piecewise-holonomic rigid body mechanical systems, whose constraints change as legs touch down or lift off. Central pattern generators and proprioceptive sensing require models of spiking neurons and simplified phase oscillator descriptions of ensembles of them. A full neuromechanical model of a running animal requires integration of these elements, along with proprioceptive feedback and models of goal-oriented sensing, planning, and learning. We outline relevant background material from biomechanics and neurobiology, explain key properties of the hybrid dynamical systems that underlie legged locomotion models, and provide numerous examples of such models, from the simplest, completely soluble \"peg-leg walker\" to complex neuromuscular subsystems that are yet to be assembled into models of behaving animals. This final integration in a tractable and illuminating model is an outstanding challenge.\n      </p>", "Induction of cytochrome P$_{1}$-450 has been linked to susceptibility to certain chemically induced cancers in mouse and man. Treatment of the human cell line MCF-7 with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) results in high levels of aryl hydrocarbon (benzo[a]pyrene) hydroxylase (P$_{1}$-450) activity. This cell line was used to isolate a human P$_{1}$-450 full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) clone. The cDNA is 2566 nucleotides in length, encodes a polyadenylated messenger RNA (2.8 kilobases in length), and has a continuous reading frame producing a protein with 512 residues (molecular weight, 58,151). The human P$_{1}$-450 cDNA and protein are 63 percent and 80 percent similar to mouse P$_{1}$-450 cDNA and protein, respectively. Whereas the mouse TCDD-inducible P-450 gene subfamily has two members (P$_{1}$-450 and P$_{3}$-450), the human TCDD-inducible gene subfamily appears to have only one gene (P$_{1}$-450).\n      </p>", "1. Although plant nitrogen (N) strategies may play an important role for community structure and ecosystem functioning, there is not a clear understanding of the link between N acquisition by roots and N utilization by shoots. Particularly, it is unclear how the co-variations between size- and physiology-related traits determine N acquisition and N utilization at the plant scale. 2. We used 13 co-occurring temperate pasture grasses to study inter-specific variations in above-ground N yield and in root N acquisition and shoot N utilization traits. N acquisition traits concerned root influx capacities for $NO_3^ - $ and $NH_4^ + $ , root mass and specific root area in ingrowth cores. N utilization traits concerned leaf life span, leaf N content, leaf N resorption, mean residence time of N and leaf N use efficiency. 3. We found evidence for three trade-offs across species concerning root N acquisition: (i) root mass increased when specific root area declined; (ii) an increase in root area was observed when total N influx capacity decreased; and (iii) $NO_3^ - $ root influx capacity increased when $NH_4^ + $ capacity declined. 4. High total root uptake capacity gave rise to high leaf N content and was associated across species to low leaf N use efficiency. Tall grasses were characterized by high shoot N yield, high root biomass and high leaf N use efficiency. Physiology-related traits and size-related traits were generally found independent. 5. Our study demonstrates how size and N uptake related root traits are associated to major axes of plant specialization ((i) plant size and (ii) conservation vs. exploitation of N) which were previously identified based on shoot traits. Contrasted N strategies were segregated across species according to four combinations along these two axes.\n      </p>", "While a growing scholarship has shed light on the spatial transformations of Tiananmen Square and its environs, not enough attention has been paid to the sacralization of power through symbols, rituals, and mythologies that lend endunng legitimacy to the Chinese Communist Party and the socialist revolution it led. This article examines how the official iconography of Tiananmen Square constructs the charisma of power through what I call the \"military sublime.\" Using the 1985 film The Big Parade as a primary example, I argue that the martyrology and pageantry of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) exemplify the dominant mode of symbolic investment of space which not only constitutes the nation as a militarized body politic but also frames the tradition of dissent associated with the Square, most notably the 1989 protest movement.\n      </p>", "Analysis of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) small RNA data sets revealed the presence of a regulatory cascade affecting disease resistance. The initiators of the cascade are microRNA members of an unusually diverse superfamily in which miR482 and miR2118 are prominent members. Members of this superfamily are variable in sequence and abundance in different species, but all variants target the coding sequence for the P-loop motif in the mRNA sequences for disease resistance proteins with nucleotide binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs. We confirm, using transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana, that miR482 targets mRNAs for NBS-LRR disease resistance proteins with coiled-coil domains at their N terminus. The targeting causes mRNA decay and production of secondary siRNAs in a manner that depends on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6. At least one of these secondary siRNAs targets other mRNAs of a defenserelated protein. The miR482-mediated silencing cascade is suppressed in plants infected with viruses or bacteria so that expression of mRNAs with miR482 or secondary siRNA target sequences is increased. We propose that this process allows pathogen-inducible expression of NBS-LRR proteins and that it contributes to a novel layer of defense against pathogen attack.\n      </p>", "1. Seasonality of rainfall can exert a strong influence on animal condition and on host-parasite interactions. The body condition of ruminants fluctuates seasonally in response to changes in energy requirements, foraging patterns and resource availability, and seasonal variation in parasite infections may further alter ruminant body condition. 2. This study disentangles the effects of rainfall and gastrointestinal parasite infections on springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis) body condition and determines how these factors vary among demographic groups. 3. Using data from four years and three study areas, we investigated (i) the influence of rainfall variation, demographic factors and parasite interactions on parasite prevalence or infection intensity, (ii) whether parasitism or rainfall is a more important predictor of springbok body condition and (iii) how parasitism and condition vary among study areas along a rainfall gradient. 4. We found that increased parasite intensity is associated with reduced body condition only for adult females. For all other demographic groups, body condition was significantly related to prior rainfall and not to parasitism. Rainfall lagged by two months had a positive effect on body condition. 5. Adult females showed evidence of a 'periparturient rise' in parasite intensity and had higher parasite intensity and lower body condition than adult males after parturition and during early lactation. After juveniles were weaned, adult females had lower parasite intensity than adult males. Sex differences in parasitism and condition may be due to differences between adult females and males in the seasonal timing of reproductive effort and its effects on host immunity, as well as documented sex differences in vulnerability to predation. 6. Our results highlight that parasites and the environment can synergistically affect host populations, but that these interactions might be masked by their interwoven relationships, their differential impacts on demographic groups, and the different time-scales at which they operate.\n      </p>", "Outer membrane-specific lipoproteins in Escherichia coli are released from the inner membrane by an ATP-binding cassette transporter, the LolCDE complex, which causes the formation of soluble complex with a periplasmic molecular chaperone, LolA. LolA then transports lipoproteins to the outer membrane where an outer membrane receptor, LolB, incorporates lipoproteins into the outer membrane. The molecular mechanisms underlying the Loldependent lipoprotein sorting have been clarified in detail. However, it remained unclear how Lol factors interact with each other to conduct very efficient lipoprotein transfer in the periplasm where ATP is not available. To address this issue, a photo-reactive phenylalanine analogue, p-benzoyl-phenylalanine, was introduced at various positions of LolA and LolB, of which the overall structures are very similar and comprise an incomplete 0-barrel with a hydrophobic cavity inside. Cells expressing LolA or LolB derivatives containing the above analogue were irradiated with UV for in vivo photo-cross-linking. These analyses revealed a hot area in the same region of LolA and LolB, through which LolA and LolB interact with each other. This area is located at the entrance of the hydrophobic cavity. Moreover, this area in LolA is involved in the interaction with a membrane subunit, LolC, whereas no cross-linking occurs between LolA and the other membrane subunit, LolE, or ATP-binding subunit LolD, despite the structural similarity between LolC and LolE. The hydrophobic cavities of LolA and LolB were both found to bind lipoproteins inside. These results indicate that the transfer of lipoproteins through Lol proteins occurs in a mouth-to-mouth manner.\n      </p>"], "words": {"partial": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06},
