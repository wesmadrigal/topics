{"total_words": 929, "documents": ["This paper reviews the current state of knowledge on illicit drugs as emerging environmental contaminants. Several studies have recently reported that illicit drugs are detectable in wastewater from municipal sewage treatment plants (STPs) and surface waters. These substances are excreted in urine and faeces unchanged or as active metabolites in high percentages after consumption and continuously discharged into domestic wastewaters. Residues of illicit drugs can therefore reach STPs in substantial amounts, escaping degradation, and are then released into surface waters. Environmental concentrations are low, but risks for human health and the environment cannot be excluded. Morphine, cocaine, methamphetamine and ecstasy all have potent pharmacological activities, and their presence as complex mixtures in surface waters may be toxic to aquatic organisms. Levels of residues in untreated wastewater have been used to estimate illicit drug consumption in the population. Given that current epidemiological methods are indirect and possibly biased, this evidence-based approach offers a new tool for estimating drug abuse in real time.\n      </p>", "Context: This article compares the United Kingdom's and the United States' experiences with expensive cancer drugs to illustrate the challenges posed by new, extremely costly, medical technologies. Methods: This article describes British and American coverage, access, and cost-sharing policies with regard to expensive cancer drugs and then compares the costs of eleven such drugs to British patients, American Medicare beneficiaries, and American patients purchasing the drugs in the retail market. Three questions posed by these comparisons are then examined: First, which system is fairer? In which system are cancer patients better off? Assuming that no system can sustainably provide to everyone at least some expensive cancer drugs for some clinical indications, what challenges does each system face in making these difficult determinations? Findings: In both the British and American health care systems, not all patients who might benefit from or desire access to expensive cancer drugs have access to them. The popular characterization of the United States, where all cancer drugs are available for all to access as and when needed, and that of the British NHS, where top-down population rationing poses insurmountable obstacles to British patients' access, are far from the reality in both countries. Conclusions: Key elements of the British system are fairer than the American system, and the British system is better structured to deal with difficult decisions about expensive end-of-life cancer drugs. Both systems face common ethical, financial, organizational, and priority-setting challenges in making these decisions.\n      </p>", "The pace of innovation in psychotropic drugs has been rapid over the past 15 years. There also have been unprecedented increases in spending on prescription drugs generally and psychotropic medications specifically. Psychotropic medications are playing a more central role in treatment. They also are receiving close scrutiny from health insurers, state budget makers, and ordinary citizens. Public policy actions regarding prescription drugs have the potential to significantly affect clinical care for mental disorders, the costs of this care to individuals and society at large, and the prospects for future scientific advances. This article outlines the policy issues related to psychotropic drugs with respect to their role in determining access to mental health treatment and the cost and quality of mental health care.\n      </p>", "Background. Although most of the elderly are covered by Medicare, they potentially face large out-of-pocket costs for their health care because of excluded services. Aside from nursing home care, the exclusion of prescription drugs is one of the most significant. Several earlier policy initiatives have proposed adding prescription drug coverage to the Medicare program. To determine the effects of such an expansion, one must account for the potential increase in the demand for prescription drugs from providing insurance coverage. Methods. The study uses a new data source, the RAND Elderly Health Supplement to the 1990 Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). The endogenity of insurance coverage is tested using instruments that exploit the longitudinal nature of the data. Equations are estimated on 910 persons (\u2265 66 years) using a two-part model. Results. Insurance coverage for prescription drugs significantly increases the probability of use, but not of total expenditures, among those who use prescription drugs. However, insurance coverage significantly lowers out-of-pocket expenditures, thereby decreasing the financial burden on elderly households associated with prescription drug use. Medicaid coverage has effects that are smaller than those for private insurance, but the magnitude is less precisely estimated. These findings imply that if prescription drug coverage were added to Medicare, expected expenditures on drugs would rise by on average $83 for each elderly Medicare beneficiary (in 1990 dollars), although this increase is significant only at the 90% level. If the benefit had been included under Medicare, expected spending on prescription drugs by the elderly would have risen by approximately 20%, or $2.6 billion in 1990.\n      </p>", "Objectives: In February 2002, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) raised medication copayments from $2 to $7 per 30-day supply of medication for certain veteran groups. We examined the impact of the copayment increase on medication acquisition from VA. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study using data from national VA databases from February 2001 through February 2003. We took a random sample of over 5% of male VA users in 2001. Of 149,107 veterans sampled, 19,504 (13%) had copayments for no drugs, 101,410 (68%) had copayments for some drugs, and 28,193 (19%) had copayments for all drugs. We used multivariable count models to examine changes in the number of 30-day medication supplies after the increase. Results: After the copayment increase, veterans subject to copayments for all drugs received 8% fewer 30-day supplies of medication annually relative to veterans with no copayments (P &lt; 0.001). The effect of the copayment increased as the number of different medications veterans received increased. Among veterans subject to copayments for all drugs, acquisition of lower-cost drugs fell by 36%, higher-cost medications fell by 6%, over-the- counter medications fell by 40%, and prescription-only medications fell by 4% relative to veterans with no drug copayments. Conclusions: The number of medications veterans obtained from VA decreased after the copayment increase. There were relatively larger impacts on veterans with higher medication use and on lower-cost and over-the-counter medications.\n      </p>", "Antipsychotic drugs and their clinically impotent congeners were examined as inhibitors of dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1) in cell-free membrane preparations of the caudate-putamen of rat brain. Of 12 neuroleptic drugs with reported antipsychotic efficacy, all inhibit stimulation of adenylate cyclase by 40 \u03bc M dopamine at micromolar concentrations. Among 14 other structurally related drugs that are not clinically effective as antipsychotic agents, 12 were almost ineffective while two drugs were moderate inhibitors of dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase.\n      </p>", "The cost of distribution of drugs in European countries is one of the factors causing differences in prices among countries. Twenty countries are analyzed, to demonstrate the differential impact of margins paid to distributors. In most cases, distribution channels include two intermediaries, a wholesaler-distributor and a pharmacist. Three models can be observed: a fixed margin in percentage, either on the ex factory price, or on the public price; a regressive margin model, with more or less complex formulas; and a loosely regulated model, within which the revenue of each actor is set by market competition under a global cap on the difference between ex factory prices and public prices. The multiplicative coefficient varies between 1.14 and 2.44 according to countries and to models. The prices in different countries of three drugs, omeprazole, setraline and ramipril were studied. The cost of distribution tends to increase the variability of the public price, when compared to the variability of ex factory prices. This may explain a part of the often observed difference in cost-effectiveness of a treatment across countries. The efficiency of distribution is also an important factor of the efficiency in health care services\n      </p>", "Current dogma holds that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) act by inhibition of the synthesis and release of prostaglandins. However, NSAIDs also inhibit the activation of neutrophils, which provoke inflammation by releasing products other than prostaglandins. We now report that NSAIDs (e.g., indomethacin, piroxicam) inhibit activation of neutrophils by inflammatory stimuli, such as C5-derived peptides and leukotriene B4, even when cyclooxygenase products generated in suspensions of stimulated neutrophils (prostaglandin E and thromboxanes) are present. Sodium salicylate (3 mM) greatly inhibited aggregation of neutrophils but had no effect on aggregation of platelets or production of thromboxane induced by arachidonate. Sodium salicylate and other NSAIDs also inhibit calcium movements (45Ca uptake, changes in fluorescence of chlortetracycline and quin-2). Aspirin, sodium salicylate, indomethacin, and piroxicam also enhanced the poststimulation increase in intracellular cyclic AMP. NSAIDs therefore inhibit early steps in neutrophil activation as reflected by their capacity to inhibit movements of Ca and to enhance intracellular levels of cyclic AMP.\n      </p>", "We examined the association of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and breast cancer risk in a case-control study of 511 breast cancer patients and 1,534 population control subjects. The relative risk of breast cancer was reduced in women using these compounds at least 3 times per week for \u22651 year [odds ratio (OR) = 0.66; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.52-0.83]. Odds ratios were similar for use of ibuprofen (0.57) or aspirin per se (0.69). Breast cancer risk declined with increasing exposure, and the greatest risk reduction (40%; odds ratio = 0.60; 95% CI = 0.40-0.91) occurred at the highest level of use (daily intake for \u22655 years). These results indicate that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may have chemopreventive potential against the development of breast cancer.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Using data from general practices in the United Kingdom in 1991 through 1997, we identified three cohorts of individuals 40 to 74 years of age. One cohort comprised 17,219 persons who had received at least one prescription for lipid-lowering drugs in the period; a second cohort consisted of patients with a hyperlipidemia diagnosis who had not been prescribed lipid-lowering drugs (N = 28,974); and a third cohort comprised 50,000 individuals from the general population with no diagnosis of hyperlipidemia. The incidence rate of myopathy in the cohort of users of lipid-lowering drugs was 2.3 per 10,000 person-years [95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.2-4.4], which exceeded the incidence rates observed in the nontreated hyperlipidemia cohort [0 per 10,000 person-years (95% CI = 0.0-0.4)] and the general population [0.2 per 10,000 person-years (95% CI = 0.1-0.4)]. The relative risks of myopathy in current users of fibrates and statins compared with nonusers were 42.4 (95% CI = 11.6-170.5) and 7.6 (95% CI = 1.4-41.3), respectively. Potential risk factors other than drug use could not explain our findings in the nested case-control analysis. We conclude that use of lipid-lowering drugs is associated with a substantially greater risk of myopathy, which is most pronounced for fibrates. The absolute risk of myopathy in users of lipid-lowering drugs is, however, small.\n      </p>", "To curb the heavily increasing drug budgets some Danish counties have introduced voluntary agreements between general practitioners (GPs) and health authorities. We extend the models of generic prescription by Hellerstein (Rand J Econ 29(1):108\u2013136, 1998) and Lundin (J Health Econ 19:639\u2013662, 2000) to allow for substitution between analogues and use difference-indifference models to assess the effect on two drug groups (lipid-lowering and rheumatism drugs). For both drug groups we find evidence of a significant effect of the intervention. In the case of lipid-lowering drugs, we found a significant larger impact on GPs with low loyalty to the insurer and with indication of low prescription quality. In contrast we found that the intervention had a significantly lower impact on this group of GPs in the case of rheumatism drugs. We conclude that the effectiveness of the voluntary approach may partly be due to its indirect effect on GPs' altruistic motivation, which makes the GPs and the authorities collude in a common agency role.\n      </p>", "Objective The aim was to examine the effects of fertility drugs on malignant melanoma risk using data from the largest cohort of infertile women to date. Methods A cohort of 54,362 women with infertility problems referred to Danish fertility clinics in the period 1963\u20131998 was established. A detailed data collection including information about type and amount of treatment was conducted. Using case-cohort techniques, we calculated rate ratios (RRs) of malignant melanoma associated with different fertility drugs after adjustment for parity status. Results 112 malignant melanomas were identified during follow-up through 2000. Use of clomiphene, gonadotrophins, hCG or GnRH did not affect risk of malignant melanoma significantly. When stratifying for parity, however, use of gonadotrophins (RR = 2.29; CI: 1.16\u20134.52) or GnRH (RR = 3.26; 95% CI: 1.50\u20137.09) among parous women was associated with a significant increased risk. For all groups of fertility drugs, we found no association with number of cycles of use or years since first use (latency). Conclusions Our findings showed no strong association between malignant melanoma risk and use of fertility drugs, although the results indicated that use of gonadotrophins or GnRH might increase risk in parous women. Longer follow-up is needed to confirm our findings.\n      </p>", "In 1984 the Wisconsin Division of Health showed interest in patients' receipt of verbal consultation for prescription drugs and included relevant questions in the Wisconsin Health Status survey to: 1) investigate the receipt of verbal consultation for new and refill prescriptions, 2) allow a comparison of state results with those of a national study that used similar sampling and data collection procedures, and 3) more closely examine the relationships between receipt of verbal consultation and such variables as prescription status (new or refill), age, sex, race, and education. Data were collected from 2,135 randomly selected respondents using Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing with random digit dialing. After controlling for elapsed time since last prescription, log-linear analyses showed the importance of prescription status (new and refill) and respondent's age as correlates of consultation by pharmacy personnel, while prescription status, age, and sex were significant for prescribers. For both prescribers and pharmacy personnel, the authors found no association between client education and receipt of verbal consultation. The absence of verbal consultation cannot be entirely accounted for by client characteristics or prescription status. Based upon their experience, the authors encourage continued monitoring of prescribers' and pharmacists' provision of verbal consultation through questions contained in state and national health status surveys.\n      </p>", "Earlier reports of associations between panic disorder, depression, and ischemic heart disease have not evaluated the role of the drugs used to treat these conditions. As part of a larger study on reducing cardiovascular disease in an entire community, we estimated the association between psychotropic drugs and ischemic heart disease in a large community-based population using a cohort study design. We defined exposure as current use of psychotropic medications at the time of the health interview. We determined ischemic heart disease by International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification, codes and by an epidemiologic algorithm using clinical diagnostic criteria. An elevated risk for clinically significant ischemic cardiac events was moderately associated with benzodiazepine use [relative risk (RR) = 2.0; 90% confidence interval (CI) = 1.1-3.9] and strongly associated with antidepressant use (RR = 5.7; 90% CI = 2.6-12.8), although the latter estimate was based on only six antidepressant users who had an ischemic event.\n      </p>", "It is often assumed that women received more prescribed drugs because they have different attitudes towards illness and medical care, higher anxiety and more time to visit physicians, or because physicians are biased. This study examines an alternative explanation, that is, much of the excess is associated with women's reproductive role. The study involved a detailed audit of the medical and pharmacy records of 862 men and women. Results showed that women received more prescribed drugs during the 2-year study period. However, the differences between men and women were not the same for all age groups. As expected, the differences were most apparent during the peak child-bearing years. Further analysis showed that the gender differences were virtually eliminated after excluding women with female-specific diagnoses and excluding the drug categories used to prevent or treat female-specific conditions. Previous studies based on gross measures of self-reported drug use seem to have underestimated the importance of factors that relate to women's reproductive role.\n      </p>", "The relations among sociodemographic factors, health status, and use of prescribed sleeping pills and tranquilizers are examined. The data are from the Rand Health Insurance Experiment, which has a random sample of the nonaged, noninstitutionalized, civilian population in six U.S. sites. Information on sociodemographic factors, health status, and the use of prescribed psychotropic drugs during the previous 3 months was obtained from self-report questionnaires collected at enrollment. Mental and physical health status have large independent and significant effects on the probability of use of both prescribed tranquilizers (P &lt; 0.0001) and sleeping pills (P &lt; 0.0001), whether or not we remove the effects of sociodemographic factors. For the probability of tranquilizer use, there is no significant interaction between gender and mental health or between mental health and physical health. Age and gender have large and significant effects on the use of prescribed psychotropic drugs even after controlling for differences in health status and other demographic factors. The effects of site and socioeconomic status are modest compared with the effects of health, age, and gender.\n      </p>", "During the process of in vitro fertilization (IVF), hormonal drugs are used to stimulate the woman's ovaries to produce multiple eggs. The injecting of the drugs is often performed by the women themselves outside of the clinical context, constituting a gendered burden of work that is rendered invisible by the dominant representations of treatment as undergone by couples and performed by doctors. Based on a series of interviews with women and couples who have undergone IVF unsuccessfully and who have ended treatment at least two years previously, this paper focuses on two aspects of the self-injection of hormonal drugs that emerged from the participants accounts: firstly, the gendered ways in which the drug regimen was experienced as compromising privacy and secondly, the strategic use of images of both illicit and medical drug use in the accounts. The paper argues that in spite of the dominant representation of IVF as a couples' technology, the IVF process is profoundly gendered, both in terms of bodily intervention and in the distribution of labour in the implementation of treatment; that the invisibility of the drug regimens from dominant representations of IVF can leave those undergoing treatment unprepared for some of the problems that the self-administration of the drugs can raise, particularly in terms of maintaining privacy; and finally, that images of the drug injection are mobilized strategically in the accounts to locate themselves within normative social reproductive standards. This highlights the extent to which the enduring ideological construction of proper womanhood as defined by motherhood continues to pose a dilemma for those who are involuntarily childless.\n      </p>", "As part of the basic characterization of Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale, the minimal inhibitory concentrations of 10 antimicrobial drugs were determined for reference strains and Mexican isolates by a broth microdilution method. For optimal growth of the organisms, a supplemented brain-heart infusion broth was used. The susceptibility of O. rhinotracheale to amoxicillin, enrofloxacin, and oxytetracycline was variable. However, consistent higher minimal inhibitory concentrations values were obtained for gentamicin, fosfomycin, trimethoprim, sulfamethazine, sulfamerazine, sulfaquinoxaline, and sulfachloropyridazine. Obtained results among Mexican isolates indicate a marked antimicrobial drug resistance trend. /// Como parte de la caracterizaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica de Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale, las concentraciones m\u00ednimas inhibitorias de 10 antimicrobianos fueron determinadas para cepas de referencia y aislamientos de M\u00e9xico mediante el m\u00e9todo de microdiluci\u00f3n en caldo.

The antineoplastics, radiopharmaceuticals, and a few other agents account for most of the known drug-induced cancer. A number of other agents are under suspicion, usually due to studies in laboratory animals or to preliminary clinical or epidemiologic observations. This group includes some drugs in widespread use such as clofibrate and cimetidine. For a few drugs that are carcinogenic in animals, such as dapsone and isoniazid, epidemiologic studies have shown little to no evidence of carcinogenicity. Recent experimental studies have shown tumor promotion by the commonly used antidepressants amitriptyline and fluoxetine and some antihistamines, which deserve epidemiologic investigation of cancer risk. Some drugs may also protect against cancer, as suggested by the lower risk of colorectal cancer among regular users of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Pharmacoepidemiologic studies must take into account possible confounding by the original conditions for which drugs were taken and the typically long latency period of drug-induced cancer. Improved postmarketing surveillance, continued routine case-control surveillance, and ad hoc case-control and cohort studies are needed to evaluate drugs already in use as well as newly introduced agents.\n      </p>", "The atypical antipsychotic drugs (AAPDs) have markedly enhanced the treatment of schizophrenias but their use has been hindered by the major weight gain elicited by some AAPDs. We report that orexigenic AAPDs potently and selectively activate hypothalamic AMP-kinase, an action abolished in mice with deletion of histamine H1 receptors. These findings may afford a means of developing more effective therapeutic agents and provide insight into the hypothalamic regulation of food intake.\n      </p>", "This communication discusses the relevance of a basic inequality for bivariate probability distributions for general nonparametric modelling of independent action of two drugs.

Prescription of new drugs contributes to substantial increases in annual drug expenditures. A small proportion of physicians appear to be early users of new prescription drugs and little is known about their characteristics. Objective. To estimate the initial utilization rate of new prescription drugs among physicians, and the physician and practice characteristics associated with early use. Design. Cumulative prospective assessment over a 5 year period (1989-1994) of new drug utilization rates in a randomly selected cohort of Quebec physicians. Participants. 1661 physicians and 669,867 elderly patients. Outcome. Prescribing rate of 20 new drugs, in 6 therapeutic categories, to elderly patients in the first 6 months after inclusion in the Quebec formulary. Results. The 20 new drugs were prescribed by 1.3-22.3% of physicians, and there was an 8 to 17-fold difference in new drug utilization rates among prescribers. Characteristics associated with higher rates of utilization differed for general practitioners and specialists. Male general practitioners, and physicians graduating from the most recently established medical school in the province, had higher rates of new drug utilization, whereas recent graduation was only associated with higher utilization rates among specialists. Practice volume was associated with higher rates of utilization among GPs. For both GPs and specialists, having a high proportion of elderly in one's practice and a rural or remote practice location was associated with lower utilization rates. Conclusions. Physician sex, specialty, medical school, years since graduation, practice location, volume, and relative proportion of elderly in the physician's practice influence the utilization of new drugs.\n      </p>", "Lens changes and ocular disturbances have been reported in conjunction with the use of antipsychotic drugs. We estimated the incidence rate of a clinical diagnosis of cataract in patients with a psychotic disorder, schizophrenia, and compared it with the rate in the general population. Among the schizophrenic patients, we also examined the role of dose and duration of antipsychotic drugs on the risk of cataract development. We followed up two cohorts of patients 30-85 years of age who were included in the United Kingdom General Practice Research Database. Patients in one group had a diagnosis of schizophrenia (N = 4,209). The other group was an age- and sex-matched cohort of 10,000 patients sampled from the source population. The incidence of cataracts was 4.5 per 1,000 person-years among the general population and 3.5 in the schizophrenia population. Overall, antipsychotic drug use was not associated with the occurrence of cataracts. Nevertheless, among long-term users of chlorpromazine at daily doses of 300 mg or greater, and among users of prochlorperazine, the relative risks were 8.8 (95% confidence interval = 3.1-25.1) and 4.0 (95% confidence interval = 0.8-20.7), respectively. There is no indication that schizophrenia per se is associated with an increased risk of developing cataracts.\n      </p>", "Objective: Biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are efficacious for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, measurements of relative effectiveness, including treatment adherence and persistence, are lacking. We evaluated adherence and persistence during new episodes of use of traditional and biologic DMARDs. Methods: Using Tennessee Medicaid databases (1995-2004), we assembled a retrospective cohort of patients diagnosed with RA, and identified new episodes of use for 12 DMARD regimens. We evaluated persistence through survival analyses, and adherence within episodes through the medication possession ratio. A risk score was included in the analyses to account for measured confounders. Results: We identified 14,932 patients with RA; 6018 patients had 10,547 episodes of new use of DMARDs. Considering methotrexate as the reference and after adjustment for measured confounders, episodes of new use of sulfasalazine [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.59; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.47-1.72] and infliximab alone (aHR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.09-1.73) were more likely to be discontinued; and new episodes of etanercept (aHR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.73-0.92) and methotrexate + adalimumab (aHR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.48-0.84) were less likely to be discontinued. Compared with methotrexate, adherence was higher for leflunomide, infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab and lower for sulfasalazine and all combined therapies. Conclusions: We developed an approach to assess persistence on and adherence to the most common DMARD therapies. In this large cohort, persistence and adherence to leflunomide and most biologic DMARD therapies were at least comparable to methotrexate. Adherence was lower for sulfasalazine and all combined therapies.\n      </p>", "Earlier studies have established substantial gender differences in the likelihood of obtaining a psychotropic drug prescription, and a correlation, especially among women, with such family characteristics as family responsibilities, marital separation, divorce or widowhood, and the presence of family stressors such as an ill spouse. However, the pathways to psychotropic drug use are not clearly understood. Data from the National Medical Care Expenditure Survey show that gender differences in obtaining a psychotropic drug can be accounted for by the greater likelihood of women to perceive illness, particularly mental illness and musculoskeletal conditions, diagnostic conditions that together account for roughly half of all psychotropic drug prescriptions. In relation to family responsibilities, employment significantly decreases the likelihood of a psychotropic drug prescription for both men and women. The greater likelihood of divorced, separated, or widowed women to obtain psychotropic drugs can be explained by their greater likelihood of episodes of illness, particularly those involving mental illness, and by their greater number of physician visits. The presence of an ill spouse is associated with psychotropic drug use only indirectly by increasing the likelihood of Medicaid coverage. Thus, differences between men and women in the likelihood of obtaining prescriptions for psychotropic drugs do not appear to result from different physician-patient interactions or from gender-determined treatment norms by physicians.\n      </p>", "Objectives. Releasing prescription drugs over-the-counter (OTC) has been a trend in many Western countries. The purpose of this study was to find out about Finnish physicians' attitudes towards OTC switches and to find out whether transfer of drugs that are used in a doctor's own area of specialty increases negative attitudes toward release. For the latter purpose, gynecologists' perceptions about the availability of vaginal antifungal OTC drugs was studied. Methods. Postal questionnaire to a representative random sample of gynecologists (n = 169) and general practitioners (GPs) (n = 288) in six counties in Finland in 1996. After a reminder, the response rate was 77% (n = 341). Multivariate logistic regression models were used to explore the relationship of factors to attitudes toward OTC drugs. Results. The overall attitude toward the availability of OTC drugs was moderately positive but was more reserved toward those drugs only recently given OTC status. However, physicians were judged in many cases to be the most suitable source of information on OTC drugs. GPs working in health centers, more often than other physicians, found drugs suitable for self medication. Our hypothesis about gynecologists being against the release of vaginal antifungal drugs was not supported. Conclusions. Physicians' views about OTC drugs are influenced by the current OTC status of the drug and by public discussion. The place of work has an important influence on these opinions, most likely reflecting the effect of case mix and patient load.\n      </p>", "The purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence of multiuse of prescription drugs and its major determinants among Finnish adults. The data were based on three nationally representative and intercomparable health surveys in 1976, 1978-80, and 1987. The study populations were 16,413 in 1976, 13,138 in 1987, and 7,217 in 1978-80. The simultaneous use of at least five prescription drugs was the main outcome measure. In 1976, 4.7% of the study population, and 6.3% in 1987 were multiusers. Of all users of prescription drugs, the proportion of multiusers was 14% both in 1976 and 1987. In 1987, the elderly comprised 55% of all multiusers, whereas their share in 1976 was 44%. The strongest predictor of the multiuse was, as expected, chronic morbidity. Of the various diagnostic groups, the main determinants were cardiac insufficiency, hypertension, asthma, mental disorders, and coronary heart disease. Even allowing for chronic morbidity, age was significantly associated with multiuse, but sex was not. The number of visits to a primary care physician correlated also independently with the multiuse. These findings indicate that the elderly may in part get prescriptions indiscriminately.\n      </p>", "Background. Two recent studies estimated that users of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have a two-fold increase in risk of hospitalization for congestive heart failure and that this effect is larger among patients with preexisting cardiovascular diseases. Methods. To evaluate the association between NSAID use and the risk of first-diagnosed episode of heart failure, we conducted a case-control study nested in a population-based cohort of individuals 40-84 years of age and registered in the U.K. General Practice Research Database at 1 January 1996. We excluded patients with a diagnosis of heart failure or cancer before that time and followed source members until a first-time recorded diagnosis of heart failure or cancer, or until 31 December 1996 if no disease occurred. The analysis included 857 confirmed cases and 5000 controls frequency-matched to cases by age (interval of 1 year) and sex. Results. The estimated adjusted relative risk of heart failure associated with prescription of NSAIDs was 1.6 (95% confidence interval = 1.2-2.1). The relative risk was greater during the first month of therapy and was independent of treatment indication. The relative risk was 1.9 (1.3-2.8) among patients with prior history of hypertension, diabetes or renal failure and 1.3 (0.9-1.9) among individuals without these conditions. Conclusions. Initiation of NSAID therapy may double the risk of developing heart failure in susceptible individuals. Patients with renal failure, diabetes or hypertension when taking NSAIDs might be at a greater risk of developing heart failure than patients without those conditions.\n      </p>", "The developmental neurotoxicity of phenytoin, isotretinoin, and methamphetamine has been reviewed to illustrate effects from both therapeutic and illicit drugs to which people are exposed and which either induce or show the potential for inducing learning disabilities following in utero exposure. In each case both human and experimental animal data are presented and compared where possible. The findings point to several conclusions. First, some drugs in current use induce developmental neurotoxicity, and it cannot safely be assumed that there are not more as yet unidentified. Second, of the types of neurotoxicity induced by drugs, learning disabilities figure prominently. Third, the effects observed are dependent on both the drug's mechanism of action and the period of brain development during which exposure occurs. Fourth, with the exception of CNS teratogens, it is not yet possible to predict which periods of brain development are the most vulnerable for the induction of learning disabilities, as seen by the different patterns of critical periods for phenytoin and isotretinoin compared to methamphetamine. Fifth, as seen with isotretinoin, existing drugs that cause developmental neurotoxicity are not the only problem; new drugs with such effects are still being introduced. Sixth, only a small fraction of the drugs currently in use have ever been examined for developmental neurotoxicity; hence, the full scope of the problem cannot even be accurately estimated based on current information. It is concluded that prevention of new cases caused by drugs such as isotretinoin should be a high priority for future regulatory action.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "We examine whether U.S. states can use their market power to reduce the costs of supplying prescription drugs to uninsured and underinsured persons with HIV through a public program, the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP).

The study encompassed 207 cases and 409 controls matched to cases on age, sex, and general practice. Compared with beta-blocker users, the matched relative risk estimates for fatal myocardial infarction, adjusted for recent blood pressure, body mass index, smoking, duration of hypertension, and prior use of other antihypertensive drugs, were 0.7 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.4-1.2] for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor users, 0.9 (95% CI = 0.5-1.5) for calcium channel blocker users, and 0.7 (95% CI = 0.4-1.2) for diuretic users.\n      </p>", "Prohibition has failed-again.

This article presents findings from a pilot research project conducted at a rural mental health clinic in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. The research was aimed at understanding chronically mentally ill patients' knowledge and uses of prescribed psychotropic drugs.

Understanding the impact of the MMA requires knowledge of the process by which drugs are prescribed to residents and the effect of coverage on medication use. Objectives: We sought to characterize sources of drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries residing in nursing facilities and to provide empirical estimates of the relationship between coverage and use. Research Design: We used bivariate and multivariate analyses to assess the relationship between coverage and drug use in a sample of nursing home residents drawn from the 2001 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey augmented with monthly institutional drug administration data. Subjects: A total of 789 residents with a mean nursing home stay of 8.7 months in 2001 were studied. Measures: We measured the proportions of residents with drug coverage from Medicaid, other sources, or none at all, and mean number of unique prescription drugs administered per resident per month by source of coverage. Results: We found that 20% of the sample had no drug coverage, 56% had drug coverage under Medicaid, 9% had coverage from other sources, and for 15% drug coverage status could not be determined. There were no statistically significant differences in drug utilization by drug coverage status. Conclusions: When drug coverage becomes a Medicare benefit in 2006, it is unlikely to spur additional medication use among nursing home residents but may redirect utilization as a result of health plan formulary restrictions.\n      </p>", "The Brazilian Institute for Defense of Consumers' (IDEC) health and legal professionals gathered with partner associations and researchers from the University of Bras\u00edlia shaped this study to develop and apply simple methods for community and consumer organizations to monitor the availability of essential drugs for primary care in their local public health services. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 11 Brazilian cities. The instrument gave priority to the feasibility of use by community organizations over statistically representative designs. It also worked from the assumption that all Health Centers should stock the drugs recommended for ambulatory care on Brazil's national list of essential drugs, in agreement to federal legislation. The instrument was found to be feasible for use by the participating organizations, and its utilization revealed a picture of severe deficiency of essential medicines in the Brazilian public health system, expressed as an overall availability of only 55.4% of the 61 drugs investigated. Models for legal action in support of individual and community access to essential drugs were developed by IDEC's legal staff to assist community organization in following up the results with an action program. These models were made available on the organization's web-site and widely disseminated nationally.\n      </p>", "Background. Adequate risk-adjustment is critical to the success of market-oriented health care reforms in many countries. A common element of these reforms is that consumers may choose among competing health insurers, which are largely financed through premium-replacing capitation payments mostly based on demographic variables. These very crude health indicators do not reflect expected costs accurately. Objective. This study examines whether the demographic capitation model can be improved by incorporating information on the presence of chronic conditions deduced from the use of prescribed drugs. The revised Chronic Disease Score was used to incorporate this information in the model. Methods. A panel data set comprising annual costs and information on prescribed drugs for 3 successive years from Dutch sickness fund members of all ages, is used for the empirical analyses (N = 55,907). The predictive performance of the demographic model is compared with that of a chronic conditions and a Pharmacy Costs Groups (PCG) model, which is a demographic model extended with information on clustered chronic conditions. Results. The predictive accuracy of the demographic model substantially improved when the model was extended with dummy variables for chronic conditions. The 23 chronic conditions could be clustered into six PCGs without affecting the predictive accuracy. Based on these PCGs 17% of the members were bad risks with a mean predictable loss that exceeds the overall average expenditures. Conclusions. The use of information on chronic conditions derived from claims for prescribed drugs is a promising option for improving the system of risk-adjusted capitation payments.\n      </p>", "Nifurtimox and benznidazole are the front-line drugs used to treat Chagas disease, the most important parasitic infection in the Americas. These agents function as prodrugs and must be activated within the parasite to have trypanocidal effects. Despite &amp;gt;40 years of research, the mechanism(s) of action and resistance have remained elusive. Here, we report that in trypanosomes, both drugs are activated by a NADH-dependent, mitochondrially localized, bacterial-like, type I nitroreductase (NTR), and that down-regulation of this explains how resistance may emerge. Loss of a single copy of this gene in Trypanosoma cruzi, either through in vitro drug selection or by targeted gene deletion, is sufficient to cause significant cross-resistance to a wide range of nitroheterocyclic drugs. In Trypanosoma brucei, loss of a single NTR allele confers similar cross-resistance without affecting growth rate or the ability to establish an infection. This potential for drug resistance by a simple mechanism has important implications, because nifurtimox is currently undergoing phase III clinical trials against African trypanosomiasis.\n      </p>", "The p53 protein activates cellular death programs through multiple pathways. Because the high frequency of p53 mutations in human tumors is believed to contribute to resistance to commonly used chemotherapeutic agents, it is important to identify drugs that induce p53-independent cell death and to define the mechanisms of action of such drugs. Here we screened a drug library (the National Cancer Institute mechanistic set; 879 compounds with diverse mechanisms of actions) and identified 175 compounds that induced caspase cleavage of cytokeratin-18 in cultured HCT116 colon cancer cells at \u22645 \u03bcM. Interestingly, whereas most compounds elicited a stronger apoptotic response in cells with functional p53, significant apoptosis was observed also in p53-null cells. A subset of 15 compounds showing weak or no dependence on p53 for induction of apoptosis was examined in detail. Of these compounds, 11 were capable of activating caspase-3 in enucleated cells. Seven such compounds with nonnuclear targets were found to induce lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP). Translocation of the lysosomal proteases cathepsin B and cathepsin D into the cytosol was observed after treatment with these drugs, and apoptosis was inhibited by pepstatin A, an inhibitor of cathepsin D. Apoptosis depended on Bax, suggesting that LMP induced a mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. We conclude that a large number of potential anticancer drugs induce p53-independent apoptosis and that LMP is a mediator of many such responses.\n      </p>", "Constitutive cyclooxygenase (COX-1; prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase, EC 1.14.99.1) is present in cells under physiological conditions, whereas COX-2 is induced by some cytokines, mitogens, and endotoxin presumably in pathological conditions, such as inflammation. Therefore, we have assessed the relative inhibitory effects of some nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs on the activities of COX-1 (in bovine aortic endothelial cells) and COX-2 (in endotoxin-activated J774.2 macrophages) in intact cells, broken cells, and purified enzyme preparations (COX-1 in sheep seminal vesicles; COX-2 in sheep placenta). Similar potencies of aspirin, indomethacin, and ibuprofen against the broken cell and purified enzyme preparations indicated no influence of species. Aspirin, indomethacin, and ibuprofen were more potent inhibitors of COX-1 than COX-2 in all models used. The relative potencies of aspirin and indomethacin varied only slightly between models, although the IC50 values were different. Ibuprofen was more potent as an inhibitor of COX-2 in intact cells than in either broken cells or purified enzymes. Sodium salicylate was a weak inhibitor of both COX isoforms in intact cells and was inactive against COX in either broken cells or purified enzyme preparations. Diclofenac, BW755C, acetaminophen, and naproxen were approximately equipotent inhibitors of COX-1 and COX-2 in intact cells. BF 389, an experimental drug currently being tested in humans, was the most potent and most selective inhibitor of COX-2 in intact cells. Thus, there are clear pharmacological differences between the two enzymes. The use of such models of COX-1 and COX-2 activity will lead to the identification of selective inhibitors of COX-2 with presumably less side effects than present therapies. Some inhibitors had higher activity in intact cells than against purified enzymes, suggesting that pure enzyme preparations may not be predictive of therapeutic action.\n      </p>", "Background: Elderly Medicare beneficiaries can reduce out-of-pocket spending and increase their options for low-cost Medicare Part D plans by using generic drugs. Physicians play a key role in determining use of generics and specialty may be a particularly influential factor. Objectives: We sought to compare generic cardiovascular drug use by older adults receiving cardiologist and generalist care. Research Design: We undertook a cross-sectional analysis of data from the nationally representative Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey. Included were community-dwelling adults 66 years of age o. older with hypertension, coronary disease, or congestive heart failure, one or more Medicare Part B claims for outpatient visits with generalists (internist or family practitioner) or cardiologists, using one or more cardiovascular drug available in both brand-name and generic formulations (n = 1828). Measures: The primary outcome was use of one or more generic medication aggregated across 5 drug classes: beta-blockers, thiazides, calcium channel blockers (CCB), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and ${\\rm{alpha}}_{\\rm{1}} $ -adrenergic receptor antagonists. Within-class generic use also was examined. The main independent variable was cardiologist (20.7%) versus generalist-only care (79.3%). Results: In the aggregate, fewer individuals under cardiologist care used generics compared with generalist-only care (75% vs. 81%, P = 0.03; adjusted relative risk 0.89, 95% confidence interval = 0.79-0.99). Overall use of generic beta-blockers was 86.6%; thiazides, 92.0%; ACE inhibitors, 59.0%; CCB, 55.5%; alpha-blockers 47.7%. In adjusted analysis, generic CCB use occurred 34% less often among cardiologist versus generalist-only patients. Conclusions: Older patients of generalists and, to a greater extent, cardiologists, often use brand-name drugs when generic equivalents are available. Promoting generic prescribing among specialists and generalists may increase opportunities for patients and third-party payers to reduce spending on prescription drugs.\n      </p>", "Recent studies have reported an association between acid-suppressing drugs (histamine H2 receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) and development of infectious gastroenteritis. We conducted a case-control study nested in a cohort of more than 170,000 ever-users of acid-suppressing drugs to examine the association between acid-suppressing drugs and bacterial gastroenteritis, using data from the General Practice Research Database in the United Kingdom. We identified 374 confirmed cases of bacterial gastroenteritis and 2,000 randomly sampled controls from the study cohort. There was little increased risk of bacterial gastroenteritis among users of acid-suppressing drugs [relative risk (RR) = 1.1; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.8-1.4]. Omeprazole \"single users\" had an RR of 1.6 (95% CI = 1.0-2.4), but this effect was not observed among those using only omeprazole during the last year (RR = 1.1; 95% CI = 0.7-1.9). We did not find any dose or treatment duration response. These data do not support a major role for acid reduction in the development of bacterial gastroenteritis.\n      </p>", "Expression of the RB tumor suppressor gene, whose function is putatively in controlling cell growth, may be regulated by S-phase specific inhibitors of DNA synthesis that are commonly used in cell synchronization and cancer chemotherapy. Relatively low concentrations of the agents, cytosine arabinoside, bromodeoxyuridine, 5-fluorouracil, hydroxyurea, methotrexate and retinoic acid, were tested. At low concentrations still permitting submaximal cell growth, these drugs all changed RB gene expression, causing either up or down regulation of RB expression to varying degrees. Despite their potential similarity as a class, the nucleotide analogues elicited differential effects. The drug-induced up or down regulation of RB expression did not correlate with changes in c-myc expression indicating that the changes are not a manifestation of general metabolic changes potentially associated with altered proliferation. Amongst the agents considered, retinoic acid was the only one that caused a significant parallel reduction in RB and c-myc expression in the HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells tested. The results thus show that even low concentrations of DNA synthesis inhibitors can have unpredictable affects on expression of growth regulatory genes.\n      </p>", "This paper is concerned with a system of mathematical models for the action of drugs when applied singly or jointly. The models are based upon the concepts of \"sites of dosage\" and \"sites of action\" of drugs and of \"physiological systems\" which may be affected by drugs at sites of action. A drug may have one or more sites of action and at each such site may affect one or more physiological systems. Two or more drugs may have common sites of action. The action of a drug at any particular site is assumed to take place as a result of the \"occupation of receptor\", an occupied receptor behaving differently from an unoccupied receptor. The occupation of receptors is governed by the \"law of mass action\" and depends upon the concentration of the drugs at the site of action. If two or more drugs act the same site, they compete for receptors at that site. The effect of occupying receptors at a site is to change the \"activity\" of the corresponding physiological system. This change may not be capable of direct assessment, but may be revealed by a change in the state of the system, which is assumed to be a monotonic function of the change of activity. The action of a drug when applied alone is considered in the light of this conceptual framework. It is shown that if the state of a system is a monotonic function of the concentration of the drug, a model involving a single site of action of the drug is appropriate. If, as is sometimes observed, the relationship is nonmonotonic, with a single extremum, a two site representation is required. The extension of the basic models to the joint action of two drugs is then discussed, in terms of the number of sites of action of each drug separately and whether or not certain sites of action are common to each drug. A feature of this approach is that the joint action is completely determined by the action of the separate drugs and the existence or otherwise of common sites. The classification of models for the joint action of drugs is then considered. It is shown that if the transfer of the drugs from sites of dosage to sites of action is regarded as a separate phenomenon, a classification in terms of the concentrations of drugs at their sites of action can be formulated in very simple terms. This classification embraces all the major distinctions which are present in alternative systems and enables some further light to be thrown on concepts such as synergism and antagonism. The application of the models is illustrated by an analysis of data concerning the effect of alcohol and meprobamate on human subjects.\n      </p>", "Objectives\u2014To investigate whether DNA damage increased in subjects possibly exposed to high amounts of antineoplastic agents. Methods\u2014The level of genetic damage was determined in peripheral mononuclear blood cells with the sister chromatid exchange test, the alkaline elution technique, and the cytokinesis block micronucleus test. Results\u2014The supposed increased exposure of the study subjects was caused by a malfunction of a safety hood resulting in leakage of air during preparation of an infusion of an antineoplastic drug. Two months after a new safety hood was installed, the frequencies of micronuclei and sister chromatid exchanges of exposed nurses (n=10) were still significantly increased when compared with a matched control group (p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.05, one sided Wilcoxon test, respectively). In a second examination seven months later, the frequency of micronuclei had significantly decreased to control values (p&lt;0.05, one sided Wilcoxon test, n=6). Moreover, the study subjects who smoked (n=8) had significantly increased frequencies of micronuclei and sister chromatid exchanges (p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.05, one sided U test, respectively). No differences in the rate of DNA damage could be detected with the alkaline elution technique. Conclusions\u2014Control measures on the level of biological effect should be performed regularly to ensure maximum safety precautions for workers potentially exposed to genotoxic agents.\n      </p>", "This study describes the differences between male and female children in the receipt of prescriptions for psychotropic and controlled-analgesic drugs in office practice. The study encompassed 341,422 children of ages 0 through 17 years enrolled in the Tennessee Medicaid program during the 5 years 1977-1981. These children made 1,342,573 office visits and received 1,636,127 prescriptions during the study. There were 18,023 (5.3%) children who received prescriptions for psychotropic drugs and 18,744 (5.5%) who received prescriptions for combination products containing psychotropic drugs. There were 26,071 (7.6%) children who were prescribed controlled analgesics and 50,240 (14.7%) who received prescriptions for these substances as fixed combination medications. In this population, proportions of male and female children who received prescriptions for psychotropic and controlled-analgesic drugs were similar through age 11. After age 11, females were increasingly more likely to receive prescriptions for drugs from both categories than were males of the same age. By age 17, the rate of psychotropic drug prescription receipt for female children (6.3%) was nearly twice that for males (3.3%), a ratio consistent with numerous studies in adults. These differences were consistent over diagnostic categories and were only partially explained by differences in office-visit rates. These findings suggest that the known greater rates of psychotropic drug use among adult females are the result of factors whose influence begins at puberty, not before.\n      </p>", "In a survey of adverse drug reactions in wards of two Belfast hospitals for 52 weeks in 1965-6, 2\u00b79% of 1,268 patients seen were admitted to hospital because of adverse reactions to drugs taken for therapeutic reasons and 2\u00b71% were admitted because of self-poisoning. Patients admitted because of adverse drug reactions were older than those admitted because of self-poisoning and stayed in hospital longer. Among the drugs which caused the adverse reactions were digitalis preparations, antibiotics, corticosteroids, anticoagulants, analgesics, and tranquillizers. Hypersensitivity and side-effect types of reactions were the most common. Barbiturates were the most frequently used drugs in suicidal attempts.\n      </p>", "This paper is concerned with the construction of mathematical models to represent the action of drugs or other stimuli on biological organisms or other complex systems. A framework for a general system of models is set up on the basis of three main concepts: the system and its subsystems, the sites of action, and the components of the stimulus. The classification of joint action in terms of this framework is then considered and a clarification of the standard nomenclature in relation to dependent joint action is put forward. A more specific set of models, based upon a simplified representation of drug-receptor action, is developed within the general framework. Some practical examples of joint action in the context of the models are described.\n      </p>", "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been associated with an increase in upper gastrointestinal complications. There is no agreement, however, on whether all conventional NSAIDs have a similar relative risk (RR), and epidemiologic data are limited on acetaminophen. We studied the association between these medications and the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleed/perforation in a population-based cohort of 958,397 persons in the United Kingdom between 1993 and 1998. Our nested case-control analysis included 2,105 cases and 11,500 controls. RR estimates were adjusted for several factors known to be associated with upper gastrointestinal bleed/perforation. Compared with non-users, users of acetaminophen at doses less than 2 gm did not have an increased risk of upper gastrointestinal complications. The adjusted RR for acetaminophen at doses greater than 2 gm was 3.6 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 2.6-5.1]. The corresponding RRs for low/medium and high doses of NSAIDs were 2.4 (95% CI = 1.9-3.1) and 4.9 (95% CI = 4.1-5.8). The RR was 3.1 (95% CI = 2.5, 3.8) for short plasma half-life, 4.5 (95% CI = 3.5-5.9) for long half-life, and 5.4 (95% CI = 4.0-7.1) for slow-release formulations of NSAIDs. After adjusting for daily dose, the differences in RR between individual NSAIDs tended to diminish except for apazone. Users of H2 receptor antagonists, omeprazole, and misoprostol had RRs of 1.4 (95% CI = 1.2-1.8), 0.6 (95% CI = 0.4-0.9), and 0.6 (95% CI = 0.4-1.0), respectively. Among NSAID users, use of nitrates was associated with an RR of 0.6 (95% CI = 0.4-1.0).\n      </p>", "Use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer, but limited information is available on the effect of individual nonaspirin NSAIDs. In addition, the dose-response relation of aspirin in reducing the risk of colorectal cancer has not been described. We carried out a population-based cohort study with secondary case-control analysis to determine the association between the risk of colorectal cancer and use of aspirin and individual NSAIDs, including the role of dose and duration. The General Practice Research Database in the U.K. was the source population. We traced 943,903 persons 40-79 years of age and free of cancer and colorectal adenoma between January 1994 and September 1997. A total of 2,002 incident cases of colorectal cancer were ascertained. The incidence rate of colorectal cancer per 10,000 person-years was 7.3. The risk of colorectal cancer was reduced in users of nonaspirin NSAIDs and became evident after 6 months of continuous treatment. The adjusted relative risk was 0.5 (95% confidence interval = 0.4-0.7). The reduction in risk disappeared completely 1 year after stopping NSAID treatment. The risk of developing colorectal cancer was reduced in long-term users of aspirin at doses of 300 mg daily (relative risk = 0.6; 95% confidence interval = 0.4-0.9). Daily doses of 75 and 150 mg aspirin were not associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer. Our data support the existence of an important protective effect of nonaspirin NSAID continuous intake against colorectal cancer and point to a similar reduction in risk for aspirin at doses of at least 300 mg daily. One-year treatment with NSAIDs would prevent one case of colorectal cancer in a population of 1,000 persons 70-79 years of age.\n      </p>", "Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) and drugs of abuse (DAs) are two important groups of emerging environmental contaminants that have raised an increasing interest in the scientific community. A number of studies revealed their presence in the environment. This is mainly due to the fact that some compounds are not efficiently removed during wastewater treatment processes, being able to reach surface and groundwater and subsequently, drinking waters. This paper reviews the data regarding the levels of Pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs detected in wastewaters and gives an overview of their removal by conventional treatment technologies (applying activated sludge) as well as advanced treatments such as membrane bioreactor.

Because of the large number of patients required, no more than 3 drugs can be compared for efficacy in human studies. However, the experimental animal model for P. carinii pneumonitis is remarkably similar to the human disease and was used to compare 10 drugs for the relative potency against this infection. All drugs were compared at doses known to prevent the pneumonitis in &gt;80% of animals and at one-tenth of this dose. Drugs effective at the lowest dose were further tested at one-hundredth the original doses, and drugs ineffective were retested at 10 and 100 times the original dose. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was the most effective drug, with azithromycin-sulfamethoxazole and clarithromycin-sulfamethoxazole next most effective. Intravenous pentamidine and clindamycin-primaquine were the least effective.

To address these potential functional roles of LTP and LTD, we have taken advantage of the powerful in vivo effects of drugs of abuse that exert their behavioural effects in large part by acting in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA); the two major components of the mesolimbic dopamine system. Our studies suggest that in vivo drugs of abuse such as cocaine cause long-lasting changes at excitatory synapses in the NAc and VTA owing to activation of the mechanisms that underlie LTP and LTD in these structures. Thus, administration of drugs of abuse provides a distinctive model for further investigating the mechanisms and functions of synaptic plasticity in brain regions that play important roles in the control of motivated behaviour, and one with considerable practical implications.\n      </p>", "The antiplatelet effect of aspirin reduces the risk of clinical manifestations of atherothrombosis by approximately 25% in secondary prevention settings. Data are limited in primary prevention of coronary heart disease, and even more in women. Here, we estimate the effects of aspirin and non-aspirin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in the primary prevention of myocardial infarction in postmenopausal women. We followed a cohort of 164,769 women, 50-74 years of age, registered in the General Practice Research Database in the United Kingdom, from January 1991 through December 1995. For aspirin and non-aspirin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, the risk of myocardial infarction associated with current use was compared with risk in non-users, using a nested case-control analysis. Overall, the relative risk of myocardial infarction associated with current use of aspirin of more than 1 month's duration was 0.56 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.26-1.21], and that of nonfatal myocardial infarction was 0.28 (95% CI = 0.08-0.91). Chronic use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs was not associated with a protective effect (relative risk = 1.32; 95% CI = 0.97-1.81). These findings indicate that incomplete and reversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase by non-aspirin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs is not sufficient to produce clinically detectable cardiovascular protection comparable with that achieved by low-dose aspirin through irreversible inactivation of platelet cyclooxygenase.\n      </p>", "Isoproterenol, corticotropin (ACTH), and triiodothyronine immobilized on glass and Sepharose beads by diazotization procedures have been shown to interact with cultured tumor cells of ``target tissue'' origin. Cells used were rat glioma cells (C6), rat adrenal tumor cells (Y-1), and rat pituitary tumor cells (GH3). The rat glioma cells bound principally to immobilized isoproterenol, whereas the rat adrenal tumor cells bound to immobilized corticotropin, and rat pituitary tumor cells bound to immobilized triiodothyronine. Binding was inhibited by preincubation of the cells in soluble drug or hormone. With C6 cells there was a positive correlation between adenylate cyclase [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4.6.1.1] stimulation and the degree of binding to the immobilized isoproterenol. Norepinephrine, bound through the ethanolamine side chain via an amide linkage, did not bind cells, demonstrating specific structural requirements for drug-cell interactions. HeLa cells were shown to bind tightly to diphtheria toxin coupled to Sepharose beads via an amide bond. This binding was inhibited by prior incubation of the Sepharose toxin with purified antitoxin. Toxin bound to Sepharose via an azo bond did not bind cells. These data suggest that the cell affinities are due to cell surface receptors interacting with the immobilized drugs and hormones, and that the observed affinities possibly reflect the relative receptor complement of these cells.\n      </p>", "We conducted a nested case-control study to estimate and compare the relative risks for hospitalizations for newly diagnosed acute liver injury associated with the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and other hepatotoxic drugs and their interaction. The source population comprised 228,392 members of the Saskatchewan Health Plan from 1982 to 1986. We used hospital records and the databases of the Department of Health. Thirty-four cases with confirmed liver injury were hospitalized. We randomly selected 500 controls from the source population. Crude risks ranged from 1 case per 100,000 prescriptions in current users of methyldopa, ampicillin, or NSAIDs to 14 cases per 100,000 prescriptions in current users of erythromycin estolate. The age-adjusted odds ratios for current users of NSAIDs was 1.8 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.8-3.7] and for other hepatotoxic drugs 5.9 (95% CI = 2.8-12.4). The adjusted relative excess risk due to the interaction between current exposure to both categories of drugs was 3.6, accounting for 31% of the cases of acute liver injury among those with exposure to both types of drugs. We conclude that the risk of hospitalization for acute noninfectious liver injury is different among users of various individual potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Concomitant current exposure to two or more drugs increases this risk above what would merely be expected from the sum of the individual risks.\n      </p>", "Chronic treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer, but less information is available on the relationship between NSAIDs and colorectal adenoma. We carried out a population-based cohort study with nested case-control analysis to determine the association between the use of aspirin and individual NSAIDs and the risk of colorectal adenoma. The General Practice Research Database in the United Kingdom was the source population. We followed 943,903 persons who were 40-79 years of age and free of colorectal adenoma or other cancer at baseline, which varied between January 1994 and September 1997. There were 1,864 incident cases of colorectal adenoma, for an incidence rate of 6.8 per 10,000 person-years. Compared with non-users, long-term users (1 year and more) of nonaspirin NSAIDs had a 40% decreased risk of colorectal adenoma (relative risk = 0.6; 95% confidence interval = 0.4-0.9). Long-term NSAID use was still associated with a reduced risk 1 year after stopping NSAID treatment. Use of most individual NSAIDs conferred a reduced risk. The risk of developing colorectal adenoma was reduced in long-term users of aspirin at doses of 300 mg daily (relative risk = 0.6; 95% confidence interval = 0.4-1.0), but reduced risk was not evident with daily doses of 75 and 150 mg aspirin. These results add further support to the value of NSAIDs as a candidate for primary prevention of colorectal tumors.\n      </p>", "Lead intoxication in adults without occupational exposure is a rare and unexpected event. The case of a western European is reported who had severe anaemia after ingestion of several ayurvedic drugs, obtained during a trip to India. Laboratory findings showed high blood lead concentrations, an increased urinary lead concentration, and an increased urinary excretion of \u03b4-aminolaevulinic acid. Also, slightly increased urinary concentrations of arsenic and silver were found. Physicians should be aware that with growing international travel and rising self medication with drugs from uncontrolled sources the risk of drug induced poisoning could increase in the future.\n      </p>", "One hundred eighty-three independently living elderly residents of two federally subsidized, urban high-rise apartment buildings were interviewed in their homes to determine the numbers and types of medications they used and stored and their utilization of pharmacy services. From these interviews and observations, the frequencies of use of medications and pharmacy services and the prevalence of potential problems were determined. Results showed that 75% of interviewees used a prescription drug regularly, and 82% used a nonprescription drug regularly. Fifty-one percent had stored noncurrent prescription drugs, while 67% had noncurrent nonprescription drugs in their homes. The most common problems encountered were discrepancies between labeled dosage and dosage actually used, potential drug interactions, and underuse of medication. Findings that may contribute to the risk of future medication problems were the prevalence of noncurrent medications stored in homes, the respondents' lack of knowledge about recognition and management of adverse drug reactions, and the underutilization of pharmacists as drug therapy consultants.\n      </p>", "Background: Many state Medicaid programs use prior authorization programs to limit spending on cyclooxygenase-2 selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (coxibs). However, the evidence base for the prior authorization criteria has not been examined previously. Methods: We determined whether prior authorization was required for coxibs in state Medicaid programs and collected data on what precise criteria needed to be met for a coxib prescription to be authorized. Prior authorization criteria were compared to clinical evidence regarding which patients are most likely to benefit from coxibs. Results: By mid-2004, 35 states had implemented prior authorization requirements for coxibs. Of 5 major clinical factors that identify patients likely to benefit from coxibs, 18 states (51%) included all 5 factors and 9 states (26%) included 2 or fewer. Most states (33/35; 94%) required a previous trial of nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs before a coxib would be authorized. Several prior authorization programs included factors that had no connection to the clinical evidence. Conclusions: State Medicaid prior authorization policies for coxibs are heterogeneous in terms both of the criteria required to obtain a coxib and of the relationship of those criteria to clinical evidence. Development of clinically rational prescription drug policies should be a goal for all health insurers and represents an important priority for Medicare's prescription drug benefit program.\n      </p>", "Objective\u2014To compare the relative risks of serious gastrointestinal complications reported with individual non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Design\u2014Systematic review of controlled epidemiological studies that found a relation between use of the drugs and admission to hospital for haemorrhage haemorrhage or perforation. Setting\u2014Hospital and community based case-control and cohort studies. Main outcome measures\u2014(a) Estimated relative risks of gastrointestinal complications with use of individual drugs, exposure to ibuprofen being used as reference; (b) a ranking that best summarised the sequence of relative risks observed in the studies. Results\u201412 studies met the inclusion criteria. 11 provided comparative data on ibuprofen and other drugs. Ibuprofen ranked lowest or equal lowest for risk in 10 of the 11 studies. Pooled relative risks calculated with exposure to ibuprofen used as reference were all significantly greater than 1.0 (interval of point estimates 1.6 to 9.2). Overall, ibuprofen was associated with the lowest relative risk, followed by diclofenac. Azapropazone, tolmetin, ketoprofen, and piroxicam ranked highest for risk and indomethacin, naproxen, sulindac, and aspirin occupied intermediate positions. Higher doses of ibuprofen were associated with relative risks similar to those with naproxen and indomethacin. Conclusions\u2014The low risk of serious gastrointestinal complications with ibuprofen seems to be attributable mainly to the low doses of the drug used in clinical practice. In higher doses ibuprofen is associated with a similar risk to other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Use of low risk drugs in low dosage as first line treatment would substantially reduce the morbidity and mortality due to serious gastrointestinal toxicity from these drugs.\n      </p>", "A comparative study, using 5 antifungal drugs for the treatment of an experimental model of murine cryptococcosis, was carried out. One hundred and eighty Balb C mice, divided in 18 groups of 10 animals each, were intraperitoneally inoculated with 107 cells of Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans. Twelve groups were treated with different schedules beginning 5 days after inoculation, for 2 or 4 weeks. The treatments were the following: amphotericin B (6 mg/kg/every other day, intraperitoneally); 5-fluorocytosine (300 mg/kg/day, by gavage); amphotericin B (6 mg/kg/every other day, intraperitoneally) in association with 5-fluorocytosine (300 mg/kg/day, by gavage); fluconazole, itraconazole and Sch 39.304 (all at the daily dose of 16 mg/kg, by gavage). The six remaining groups were used as controls and received the solvent for the drugs. The evaluation of the efficacy of the different treatments was based on: survival time; macroscopy of brain, lungs, liver and spleen at autopsies; presence of encapsulated yeasts in microscopic examination of wet preparations of these organs; and cultures of a concentrated suspension of brain and lungs. In the animals treated for 2 weeks, the combination of amphotericin B + 5-fluorocytosine was the most useful; it negativized the micro and macroscopic findings as well as 90% of the cultures, and prolonged the survival time up to 60 days. Sixty per cent of the mice which received amphotericin B exhibited the same survival time and macroscopic findings as those treated with the association of amphotericin B + 5-fluorocytosine. Among the azolic compounds, Sch 39.304 proved to be the most effective in the prolongation of survival time. None of the azoles showed differences with the control groups in the other parameters. In the mice treated for 4 weeks, the only treatment that achieved the negativization of brain and lung cultures, was the combination of amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine. Amphotericin B alone was better than the azolic compounds, improving the macro and microscopic results and prolonging the survival time. Sch 39.304 produced the same survival time as amphotericin B, but did not determine the biological cure. The other azoles as well as 5-fluorocytosine showed a minor increase in survival time, with no modifications of the other parameters when compared with the controls. All the drugs applied showed better results when they were administered for 4 weeks.\n      </p>", "This essay examines the conflicting approaches towards marvelous cures in sixteenth-century Germany. As pharmaceutical substances flooded in from both east and west, they brought with them a market for \"wonder drugs\" that would cure any ailment. In this climate, university-trained physicians felt threatened by the rising popularity of cures hawked by empirical practitioners, while at the same time endorsing certain wonder drugs. Using the example of one particularly controversial empiric, Georg am Wald, and his wonder drug, the \"Panacea Amwaldina\", this article parses the various factors that made the medical elite embrace certain cures while deriding others.\n      </p>", "Background: The social and medical problems of drug abuse are a matter of increasing global concern. To tackle drug abuse in changing scenarios, international drug agencies need fresh methods to monitor trends and patterns of illicit drug consumption. Objective: We tested a sewage epidemiology approach, using levels of excreted drug residues in wastewater, to monitor collective use of the major drugs of abuse in near real time. Methods: Selected drug target residues derived from use of cocaine, opiates, cannabis, and amphetamines were measured by mass spectrometry in wastewater collected at major sewage treatment plants in Milan (Italy), Lugano (Switzerland), and London (United Kingdom). The amounts of drug residues conveyed to the treatment plants, reflecting the amounts collectively excreted with urine, were used to estimate consumption of the active parent drugs. Results: Reproducible and characteristic profiles of illicit drug use were obtained in the three cities, thus for the first time quickly revealing changes in local consumption (e.g., cocaine consumption rose significantly on weekends in Milan). Profiles of local drug consumption based on wastewater measurements are in line with national annual prevalence estimates. Conclusions: Patterns and trends of drug abuse in local communities can be promptly monitored by this too, a convenient new complement to more complex, lengthy survey methods. In principle, searching the sewage for excreted compounds relevant to public health issues appears to have the potential to become a convenient source of real-time epidemiologic information.\n      </p>", "Objectives. The authors assess (1) the effects of first-dollar prescription drug insurance coverage provided by the Ontario Drug Benefit plan at age 65 on prescription drug use by seniors, and (2) the differential effects of this coverage on prescription drug use by seniors with varying levels of health status. Methods. The authors modeled self-reported prescription drug use contained in the 1990 Ontario Health Survey as a function of eligibility for coverage, controlling for health status and other factors. The two-part model was used and was estimated by maximum likelihood. Results. The provision of first-dollar prescription drug insurance coverage at age 65 is associated with an increase in drug use. Increases in drug use are, however, concentrated primarily among individuals with lower levels of health status. Most of the increased use occurs among individuals already under physician supervision, ie, an increase in the level of use among drug users rather than an increase in the probability of use. Conclusions. As Ontarians turn age 65 and become eligible for publicly subsidized prescription drugs, their use increases but the effect appears to be restricted mainly to persons with lower levels of health status. Given a growing trend toward reduction of public subsidy and increased reliance on patient cost sharing, more research is needed to quantify the use and health effects of such initiatives.\n      </p>", "As a result of the availability of new and exotic drugs and a diversifying medical profession to serve burgeoning towns, some late thirteenth-century physicians began to inquire more explicitly about the difference between a medicine and a poison. Were some substances simply too dangerous to be used in general medical practice? That medical authorities had never agreed on a single definition of poison complicated progress on this front. Fifteenth-century physicians brought significantly new energy to bear on this question through a rigorous examination of the properties of poison and the extent to which it was defined and thought to operate by some kind of occult virtue. Fifteenth-century writing about poison thus provides an important new and early site for examining the historical development of occult influence, because the notion of specific form had become integral to poison's definition and its ontological status as a category of substance. These discussions were instrumental to the development of modern toxicology as well, as it helped further distinguish between the classical notion of pharmaka, in which no substance was singled out as uniquely different in kind from other substances, and that of venenum, which was increasingly defined as fundamentally harmful to the human body.\n      </p>", "The current testing of anti-HIV drugs is hampered by the lack of a small animal that is readily available and easy to handle; can be infected systemically with HIV type 1 (HIV-1); harbors the major HIV-1 target cells in a physiological frequency, organ distribution, and activation state; and is established as a pharmacological model. Here, we explored the potential of outbred Sprague-Dawley rats that transgenically express the HIV-1 receptor complex on CD4 T cells and macrophages as a model for the preclinical evaluation of inhibitors targeting virus entry or reverse transcription. The concentrations of the peptidic fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide or the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor efavirenz required to inhibit HIV-1 infection of cultured primary CD4 T cells and macrophages from human CD4 and CCR5-transgenic rats differed by no more than 3-fold from those required for human reference cultures. Prophylactic treatment of double-transgenic rats with a weight-adapted pediatric dosing regimen for either enfuvirtide (s.c., twice-daily) or efavirenz (oral, once-daily) achieved a 92.5% or 98.8% reduction, respectively, of the HIV-1 cDNA load in the spleen 4 days after i.v. HIV-1 challenge. Notably, a once-daily dosing regimen for enfuvirtide resulted in a \u22485-fold weaker inhibition of infection, unmasking the unfavorable pharmacokinetic characteristics of the synthetic peptide in the context of an efficacy trial. This work provides proof of principle that HIV-susceptible transgenic rats can allow a rapid and predictive preclinical evaluation of the inhibitory potency and of the pharmacokinetic properties of antiviral compounds targeting early steps in the HIV replication cycle.\n      </p>", "A total of 1,268 patients admitted to hospital wards were kept under surveillance by one observer throughout their stay in hospital. All drugs given to them and the occurrence of adverse reactions were recorded. Drug reactions were found in 10\u00b72% of the 1,160 patients who received drug therapy. Most reactions were due to known pharmacological actions of the drugs. Though only four reactions were of life-threatening seriousness, 80% of the 129 reactions observed were of moderate severity. Digitalis preparations, bronchodilator drugs, and ampicillin had the highest reaction rates. It is suggested that larger surveys of adverse reactions in relation to drug usage would make a useful contribution to the problem.\n      </p>", "Objective\u2014To determine whether present methods of international transport of essential drugs by sea adversely affect their quality. Design\u2014Controlled longitudinal study of drug shipments sent by sea from Unicef in Copenhagen to Lagos; to Mombasa and by land to Kampala; and to Bangkok. 11 essential drugs were stored in four locations on board the ships. Setting\u2014Main shipping routes from Unicef, Copenhagen, to tropical countries. Main outcome measures\u2014Temperature and relative humidity in the test packs during the journey. Amount of active ingredient in the drugs before and after shipment. Results\u2014Temperatures recorded within the test packs range from \u22123.5\u00b0C to 42.4\u00b0C and were 3-12\u00b0C higher than the ambient temperature. Relative humidity within the packs ranged from 20% to 88%. Differences between the locations on board were negligible. Ergometrine injection, methylergometrine injection, and retinol capsules lost 1.5-5.8% of their activity. Ampoules of ergometrine showed a large variation in the amount of active ingredient after shipment, with three of 80 samples having concentrations 60% below those stated. Ampicillin, benzylpenicillin, phenoxymethylpenicillin, and tetracycline were not affected by transport. Conclusions\u2014Drugs were exposed to a much higher temperature and humidity than is recommended by the manufacturer, especially in tropical harbours and during inland transport. Except for ergometrine and methylergometrine the transport would not affect clinical effectiveness.\n      </p>", "Many new drugs in the future will be very expensive and have major resource implications. Given current structures and legislation covering the prescribing of drugs, there are no clear means of controlling the use of these drugs to avoid diverting money away from other health care services and into drug treatment. This paper considers what mechanisms might be used by a purchaser to manage the introduction of an expensive new drug and uses interferon beta-1b for treating multiple sclerosis as an example. The most likely mechanism is the prescribing of the drug by a general practitioner on the advice of a neurologist. This would achieve a good benefit for the resources invested but would not control total expenditure. Devolving a limited budget for the drug to a specialist centre so that neurologists may prescribe it directly would be preferable, as this would link clinical, prescribing, and budgetary responsibility. These issues need to be addressed urgently by purchasers if major disruptions of services are to be avoided.\n      </p>", "The potential role of new drugs in reducing expenditures for non-drug health services has received considerable attention in recent policy debates. We estimate expenditure models to determine whether the use of newer drugs to treat cardiovascular conditions is associated with lower (or higher) non-drug expenditures for these conditions. We fail to substantiate the findings of previous research that newer drugs are associated with reductions in non-drug expenditures. We find, however, that increases in the number of drugs used, or the mix of drugs of different ages, are associated with increased non-drug expenditures and find that the number or mix of drugs used are important confounders in the estimated association between drug age and non-drug expenditures.\n      </p>", "The Danish health care system is decentralized and tax financed. Reimbursable drugs are financed by the national health insurance, which despite its official name, is a taxfunded system for paying for drugs, practicing physicians outside hospitals, dentists, etc. Most issues related to pricing and reimbursement of drugs are placed centrally, however, with the Danish Medicines Agency, and in contrast to most of the health care system reimbursement is thoroughly grounded in legislation. Pricing in principle is free. In the 1990s a number of agreements between industry and government in practice introduced regulated price competition. Generic substitution at the pharmacy level and the agreements between government and industry have led to a decline in the overall price level for drugs from 1995 and onwards. The still increasing drug expenditures hence must be attributed to increasing volume and the introduction of new drugs. Reimbursement is divided into two: general reimbursement meaning unconditional reimbursement for a given drug or single reimbursement based on an application from the patient's physician on behalf of individual patients. The criteria for granting general reimbursement are relatively clear. Economic evaluations on a voluntary basis can be used to support documentation of a reasonable relationship between price and therapeutic effects. Reimbursement is calculated on the basis of an average European price level.\n      </p>", "Variability in the response to drugs is due to three principal components--the disease, the responsiveness of tissues, and the concentration of the drug at its site of action (as reflected by its plasma concentration). The relative contributions of these components will differ not only for different drugs but also for different effects of the same drug. Rational drug therapy depends on knowledge of all three factors.\n      </p>", "More than 1.5 billion prescriptions were dispensed from retail pharmacies in 1984 at a consumer cost of $18.4 billion. The number of prescriptions dispensed in 1984 equaled the previous record set in 1973. Over 40% of 1984 prescriptions were for four therapeutic classes: cardiovascular drugs, anti-infectives, psychotherapeutic drugs, and diuretics. Prescriptions for cardiovascular drugs and diuretics increased substantially from 1975 to 1984, while prescriptions for psychotherapeutic drugs decreased. Outpatient use of systemic antiinfectives remained fairly stable over the 10-year period. Trends in the use of specific drug categories within these broad therapeutic classes were variable, as were patient age and sex distributions.\n      </p>", "The effect of various drugs on urate binding to plasma proteins was investigated in normal subjects. Whereas allopurinol, aspirin, phenylbutazone, probenecid, and sulphinpyrazone all significantly reduced plasma urate concentrations, only aspirin, phenylbutazone, and probenecid significantly impaired urate binding. Colchicine and indomethacin in the doses administered had no significant effect on plasma urate concentrations or binding. In the case of aspirin, urate binding was reduced to 25% of normal, and this effect was quickly abolished after cessation of therapy. Phenylbutazone reduced urate binding to 56% and probenecid to 46% of normal; this impairment was still detected four days after cessation of therapy. Drugs may impair urate binding by competition for plasma protein binding sites, with displacement of bound urate. Impairment of urate binding in vivo by administration of certain drugs may be relevant to the precipitation of acute gouty arthritis, to the formation of gouty tophi, and to the augmentation of uricosuria. Furthermore, the role of drugs must be seriously considered during all studies on urate binding in patients with gout.\n      </p>", "This paper describes the use of drugs among middle-aged Massachusetts women from 1982 to 1986. Data were obtained from follow-up interviews of women (n = 2565) who were permenopausal in a baseline survey of a representative sample of women with an age range of 45-55. In the first follow-up interview, 92% of women had used nonprescribed drugs (\"current use\"), but most only sporadically, while 47% had used prescribed drugs. The use of different types of drugs was concentrated in the same women, and women who had used prescribed drugs had also used nonprescribed drugs more often than the other women. In the first follow-up, women were classified as nonusers (includes sporadic nonprescribed drug use), nonprescribed medicine users, prescribed drug users, and mixed users; 43% of the women were in a different class three years later. Comparison of individual drug groups also showed changes in the user status between the two surveys. With the exception of poorer health, users of nonprescribed and prescribed drugs were similar to nonusers. Because use of drugs is common, further research on both its determinants and appropriateness is needed.\n      </p>", "This paper studies the contribution of sulfa drugs, a groundbreaking medical innovation in the 1930s, to declines in US mortality. For several infectious diseases, sulfa drugs represented the first effective treatment. Using time-series and difference-in-differences methods, we find that sulfa drugs led to a 24 to 36 percent decline in maternal mortality, 17 to 32 percent decline in pneumonia mortality, and 52 to 65 percent decline in scarlet fever mortality between 1937 and 1943. Altogether, sulfa drugs reduced mortality by 2 to 3 percent and increased life expectancy by 0.4 to 0.7 years. We also find that sulfa drugs benefited whites more than blacks.\n      </p>", "The over-the-counter drug market is expected to nearly double in sales from 1990 to 2000, attributed primarily to a growing product class: prescription drugs that are \"switched\" to over-the-counter status. The author presents a framework in which to compare and contrast switch drugs with prescription and over-the-counter drugs by evaluating them in light of health and safety, economic, consumer behavior, and marketing considerations. She also addresses the general policy implications and marketing communications considerations for switch drugs in light of their relationship to consumer choice and vulnerable market segments such as the elderly and children. Finally, given the limited attention to switch drugs in previous marketing literature, the author provides research directions in which academicians could contribute to policy related to this product category.\n      </p>", "Background: Nurses and other hospital workers are exposed to antineoplastic drugs during daily activities. Previous studies suggest that antineoplastic drugs at occupational exposure levels may be toxic to reproduction, but these studies are not consistent or conclusive. Methods: Self-administered questionnaires were completed by 4393 exposed and nonexposed nurses employed between 1990 and 1997 (79% response). Questions were asked about pregnancy outcome, work-related exposures, and lifestyle. Exposure to antineoplastic drugs was estimated using task-based dermal exposure measurements and self-reported task frequencies. Time to pregnancy was modeled using survival analysis, and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for other reproductive outcomes using multiple logistic regression analysis. Associations were further explored by nonparametric regression modeling. Results: Nurses highly exposed to antineoplastic drugs took longer to conceive than referent nurses (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.8; CI = 0.6-0.9). Exposure to antineoplastic drugs was associated with premature delivery (OR per unit increase in ln[exposure] = 1.08; CI = 1.00-1.17) and low birth weight (OR per unit increase in ln [exposure] = 1.11; 1.01-1.21). Penalized smoothed spline plots corroborated these log-linear relations. Spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, and sex of offspring appeared not to be related to exposure to antineoplastic drugs. Conclusion: Antineoplastic drugs may reduce fertility and increase poor neonatal outcomes among occupationally exposed oncology nurses.\n      </p>", "Objective: To determine the effect of adjunctive antithyroid drugs on the risk of treatment failure, hypothyroidism, and adverse events after radioiodine treatment. Design: Meta-analysis. Data sources: Electronic databases (Cochrane central register of controlled trials, Medline, Embase) searched to August 2006 and contact with experts. Review methods: Three reviewers independently assessed trial eligibility and quality. Pooled relative risks for treatment failure and hypothyroidism after radioiodine treatment with and without adjunctive antithyroid drugs were calculated with a random effects model. Results: We identified 14 relevant randomised controlled trials with a total of 1306 participants. Adjunctive antithyroid medication was associated with an increased risk of treatment failure (relative risk 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.07 to 1.52; P=0.006) and a reduced risk for hypothyroidism (0.68, 0.53 to 0.87; P=0.006) after radioiodine treatment. We found no difference in summary estimates for the different antithyroid drugs or for whether antithyroid drugs were given before or after radioiodine treatment. Conclusions: Antithyroid drugs potentially increase rates of failure and reduce rates of hypothyroidism if they are given in the week before or after radioiodine treatment, respectively.\n      </p>", "Ambient ionization methods for MS enable direct, high-throughput measurements of samples in the open air. Here, we report on one such method, desorption electrospray ionization (DESI), which is coupled to a linear ion trap mass spectrometer and used to record the spatial intensity distribution of a drug directly from histological sections of brain, lung, kidney, and testis without prior chemical treatment. DESI imaging provided identification and distribution of clozapine after an oral dose of 50 mg/kg by: i) measuring the abundance of the intact ion at m/z 327.1, and ii) monitoring the dissociation of the protonated drug compound at m/z 327.1 to its dominant product ion at m/z 270.1. In lung tissues, DESI imaging was performed in the full-scan mode over an m/z range of 200-1100, providing an opportunity for relative quantitation by using an endogenous lipid to normalize the signal response of clozapine. The presence of clozapine was detected in all tissue types, whereas the presence of the N-desmethyl metabolite was detected only in the lung sections. Quantitation of clozapine from the brain, lung, kidney, and testis, by using LC-MS/MS, revealed concentrations ranging from 0.05 \u03bcg/g (brain) to a high of 10.6 \u03bcg/g (lung). Comparisons of the results recorded by DESI with those by LC-MS/MS show good agreement and are favorable for the use of DESI imaging in drug and metabolite detection directly from biological tissues.\n      </p>", "Whether it's phony Viagra or knockoff cancer meds, fake drugs kill thousands of people each day, thanks to counterfeiters in China and India who mix chalk, dust, and dirty water into pills sold around the world.

The pharmacokinetic disposition of a drug depends on the anatomy and physiology of the patient as well as specific properties of the drug itself. Many drugs or drug metabolites are excreted by the kidneys of mammals. Although these compounds are presumed to be excreted by the kidneys of birds as well, few investigations have attempted to confirm this. In addition to understanding the morphology and physiology of avian and mammalian kidneys, the clinician must understand the physicochemical properties of renally excreted drugs to determine the validity of extrapolating drug dosages between the two classes of animals. The purpose of this report is to review plasma and tissue pharmacokinetic studies of drugs currently used in birds. These studies indicate that laboratory and clinical investigations are needed to define the mechanisms and rates of drug elimination in the many avian species veterinarians may treat. Consistent with the diverse anatomic and physiologic characteristics, plasma and tissue concentrations and elimination rates differ between different species of birds. We speculate that drug pharmacokinetics are closely correlated to physiologic differences between species of birds. These differences may represent adaptations to environmental niches. Further studies are needed to confirm this.\n      </p>", "Background. The extent to which pharmaceutical companies promote the economic advantages of their products in advertisements in medical journals, and whether such claims are supported by evidence, has not been quantified. Our objectives were to examine how often prescription drug advertisements in leading medical journals contain economic messages, and to determine the types of promotional claims made and whether supporting evidence is provided. Methods. All prescription drug advertisements appearing in six leading general medical and specialty journals in 3 selected months annually from 1990 to 1999 were reviewed. Using a standard data collection form, two reviewers examined each ad for economic content-including mention of the drug's price, value, cost saving, or cost-effectiveness. Results. Economic messages appeared in 237 (11.1%) of the 2144 advertisements examined. Proportion of ads with economic content has increased over time (P = 0.003). Most frequently, economic ads contained statements that drugs were \"less expensive\" or \"cost less\" than alternative treatments (50.6% of economic ads). Supporting evidence for economic claims was clearly reported in 63.7% of cases, and typically referred to published drug prices rather than more detailed economic analysis. Ads for calcium channel blocking agents and ACE inhibitors frequently contained economic messages. Conclusions. Economic messages about prescription drugs are used in advertisements in leading medical journals and their frequency may be rising. Physicians should be aware of this phenomenon, and its potential impact on their prescribing decisions. More scrutiny of the supporting evidence underlying economic claims by the medical community and regulators may be needed.\n      </p>", "A procedure is described for evaluating the radical curative action of antimalarial drugs against established infections of Plasmodium lophurae in chicks. Infections are induced by the injection of parasitized blood. Treatment is initiated after the acute phase of the blood infection. Appraisal of cure is based on the results of subinoculations into clean chicks and susceptibility of the treated hosts to reinoculation. Forty-nine agents, selected from 23 chemical series of antimalarial drugs, were tested, alone or in conjunction with each other. Cures were obtained with the naphthoquinones SN 12,320 and lapinone, and with the 8-aminoquinolines pamaquine, pentaquine, isopentaquine, prmaquine, D R 15,311 and D R 15,322. No cures occurred with 9 other 8-aminoquinolines or with other drugs including such compounds as quinine, quinacrine, Camoquin, chlorguanide, sulf adiazine and chloramphenicol. The curative efficacy of 8-aminoquinolines was not enhanced by simultaneous treatment with quinine. Evidence of synergism in curative action was observed with SN 12,320 and pamaquine. Estimates are included of the suppressive activity of each drug on the parasitemia of P. lophurae in chicks.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Data from a hospital-based drug surveillance programme were used to determine how often benzodiazepine drugs were used in general medical wards. Benzodiazepines were the drugs most commonly used as hypnotics and were given to 32% of these patients. Concomitant use of more than one benzodiazepine drug or of benzodiazepines with other psychoactive drugs was common and often irrational. A series of double-blind patient-preference studies comparing various benzodiazepines and a benzodiazepine with an antihistamine showed that for short-term hypnotic effect there were no differences between three common benzodiazepines but elderly patients preferred benzodiazepines to the antihistamine, which produced more undesired effects. These results suggest that currently diazepam is the hypnotic of choice for medical ward inpatients.\n      </p>", "This study investigates the returns to R&amp;D for 100 new drugs introduced into the United States during the decade of the 1970s. In contrast to prior studies, it incorporates several significant structural changes that have occurred in the pharmaceutical industry during the 1980s. These include higher real drug prices and a greater degree of generic competition. A major finding is that the return on R&amp;D for the average new drug is approximately equal to the 9 percent industry cost of capital. However, the performance of new drugs introduced during the latter half of the 1970s was markedly better than that of early 1970s introductions. This latter finding is consistent with the more rapid rate of industry growth in real R&amp;D expenditures. The study also finds that the variation in returns is highly skewed, with only the top 30 drugs covering mean R&amp;D costs on a fully allocated basis. Finally, it is shown that real drug price increases in the 1980s were necessary for the average new drug introduction to recover its R&amp;D costs.\n      </p>", "The antiviral drugs amantadine hydrochloride and rimantadine hydrochloride were tested as to their oncogenic potential using a serial line of Fischer rat embryo cells that previously had been shown to be an accurate indicator of chemicals known to be oncogenic in animal studies.

Methods: Prescription data were extracted from 1941 case histories of patients over 15 years old from four health care centers in the Valencian Community (Spain). Dosage and treatment duration were evaluated, along with the way in which morbidity, self-evaluated health, the demographic pattern and lifestyle characteristics influence drug prescription. Results: The proportion of drug prescriptions increased with age in both sexes (p &lt; 0.01). Drug use depended mainly on chronic diseases. In prescribing antacids, the most influential diagnosis was gastritis (ICD 534, OR: 157), followed by duodenal ulcer (ICD 532, OR: 152) and gastric ulcer (ICD 531, OR: 122), other gastrointestinal disorders (ICD 66, OR: 54) and undefined diagnoses (OR: 15). In the prescription of antiulcer drugs, the most influential diagnoses were gastric and duodenal ulcer (OR: 380 and 342, respectively), and a significant relation was observed with the diagnosis of osteomuscular diseases (OR: 6). Lifestyle and demographic pattern were of marginal importance. The estimated duration of treatment was 85 days. No significant differences were observed in either treatment duration or administered doses of almagate, ranitidine and omeprazole with respect to sex, age or diagnosis. Conclusions: Prolonged treatment is common for acid suppression. The widespread use of peptic ulcer drugs is mostly due to excessive prescription for non-ulcer dyspepsia. At the same time, many patients consume these drugs on a long-term basis in the absence of a clear diagnosis. This observation supports the need for appropiate diagnostic and prescription protocols to secure increased economical savings and management results.\n      </p>", "Eight anti-coccidial drugs were examined for their efficacies in preventing development of Neospora caninum in bovine monocyte cell cultures.

This article argues that this new pattern of women's incarceration has been forged by three overlapping phenomena. The first is the fundamental shift in the role of the state that has occurred as a result of neo-liberal globalization. The second and related phenomenon is the emergence and subsequent global expansion of what has been labelled a 'prison industrial complex' made up of an intricate web of relations between state penal institutions, politicians and profit-driven prison corporations. The third is the emergence of a US-led global war on drugs which is symbiotically related and mutually constituted by the transnational trade in criminalized drugs. These new regimes of accumulation and discipline, I argue, build on older systems of racist and patriarchal exploitation to ensure the super-exploitation of black women within the global prison industrial complex.

Fenoprofen and naproxen were slightly more effective than the other two drugs but there were striking individual variations in response. Groups of patients could be identified who preferred each of the four drugs. The commonest side effects were those related to the upper gastrointestinal tract; these showed individual variation and seldom occurred with more than one or two of the drugs. Side effects were least common with ibuprofen and naproxen. Since naproxen combined greater effectiveness with a lower incidence of side effects it must be regarded as the first choice among these drugs.
