An alternative explanation is that the extreme values in a large sample are likely to be greater than those in a small one. Although the performance of the 100 best German male chess players is better than that of the 100 best German women, we show that 96 per cent of the observed difference would be expected given the much greater number of men who play chess. There is little left for biological or cultural explanations to account for. In science, where there are many more male than female participants, this statistical sampling explanation, rather than differences in intellectual ability, may also be the main reason why women are under-represented at the top end.\n      </p>", "In many chess tournaments, e.g. when the Swiss system is used, the number of players is much larger than the number of rounds to be played. In such tournaments the pairing for a round depends on the results in earlier rounds, and the pairing process can be very complicated. In these pairing systems the main goals are to let players with equal scores play together, and that each player should alternately play white and black, with the restriction that no player may face the same opponent more than once. The paper describes how a weighted matching algorithm is used to find `the best pairing' by converting the pairing rules into penalty points.\n      </p>", "Chess and chance are seemingly strange bedfellows. Luck and/or randomness have no apparent role in move selection when the game is played at the highest levels. However, when competition is at the ultimate level, that of the World Chess Championship (WCC), chess and conspiracy are not strange bedfellows, there being a long and colorful history of accusations levied between participants. One such accusation, frequently repeated, was that all the games in the 1985 WCC (Karpov vs Kasparov) were fixed and prearranged move by move. That this claim was advanced by a former World Champion, Bobby Fischer, argues that it ought be investigated. That the only published, concrete basis for this claim consists of an observed run of particular moves, allows this investigation to be performed using probabilistic and statistical methods. In particular, we employ imbedded finite Markov chains to evaluate run statistic distributions. Further, we demonstrate how both chess computers and game data bases can be brought to bear on the problem.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "By performing a series of five experiments with two subjects, several aspects of one of the subject's behavior in solving chess problems were found to be predictable, and a model was developed to explain this predictability.

The ACT measures chess playing proficiency through 5 tasks: a choose-a-move task (comprising two parallel tests), a motivation questionnaire, a predict-a-move task, a verbal knowledge questionnaire, and a recall task. The validity of these tasks was established using external criteria based on the Elo chess rating system. Results from a representative sample of active chess players showed that the ACT is a very reliable test for chess expertise and that ACT has high predictive validity. Several hypotheses about the relationships between chess expertise, chess knowledge, motivation, and memory were tested. Incorporating response latencies in test scores is shown to lead to an increase in criterion validity, particularly for easy items.\n      </p>", "Only 1% of the world's chess grandmasters are women. This underrepresentation is unlikely to be caused by discrimination, because chess ratings objectively reflect competitive results. Using data on the ratings of more than 250,000 tournament players over 13 years, we investigated several potential explanations for the male domination of elite chess. We found that (a) the ratings of men are higher on average than those of women, but no more variable; (b) matched boys and girls improve and drop out at equal rates, but boys begin chess competition in greater numbers and at higher performance levels than girls; and (c) in locales where at least 50% of the new young players are girls, their initial ratings are not lower than those of boys. We conclude that the greater number of men at the highest levels in chess can be explained by the greater number of boys who enter chess at the lowest levels.\n      </p>", "In historical perspective, Sussman considers the evolution of \"automatons\"-mechanical and electrical performing objects.

When the population of objects being compared is large, likelihood-based analyses can be too computationally cumbersome to carry out regularly. This presents a problem for rating populations of chess players and other large groups which often consist of tens of thousands of competitors. This problem is overcome through a computationally simple non-iterative algorithm for fitting a particular dynamic paired comparison model. The algorithm, which improves over the commonly used algorithm of Elo by incorporating the variability in parameter estimates, can be performed regularly even for large populations of competitors. The method is evaluated on simulated data and is applied to ranking the best chess players of all time, and to ranking the top current tennis-players.\n      </p>", "We extend work by Holding and Reynolds (1982) on recall and problem solving with quasirandom chess positions. We tested 17 chess players on both quasirandom and structured chess positions. Consistent with the earlier study, initial recall of quasirandom chess positions is unrelated to chess skill level, and quality of the move selected in subsequent problem solving is related to skill level. However, recall following problem solving is related to chess skill level. These results support the view that pattern recognition processes underlie superior performance by skilled chess players, contrary to the conclusions of Holding and Reynolds (1982). Mechanisms such as long-term working memory retrieval structures (Ericsson &amp; Kintsch, 1995) or templates (Gobet &amp; Simon, 1996a) could explain the effective encoding of quasirandom positions during problem solving.\n      </p>", "Since the mid 1960s, researchers in computer science have famously referred to chess as the 'drosophila' of artificial intelligence (AI). What they seem to mean by this is that chess, like the common fruit fly, is an accessible, familiar, and relatively simple experimental technology that nonetheless can be used productively to produce valid knowledge about other, more complex systems. But for historians of science and technology, the analogy between chess and drosophila assumes a larger significance. As Robert Kohler has ably described, the decision to adopt drosophila as the organism of choice for genetics research had far-reaching implications for the development of 20th century biology. In a similar manner, the decision to focus on chess as the measure of both human and computer intelligence had important and unintended consequences for AI research. This paper explores the emergence of chess as an experimental technology, its significance in the developing research practices of the AI community, and the unique ways in which the decision to focus on chess shaped the program of AI research in the decade of the 1970s.

If variation in fast processes accounts for substantial variation in chess skill, performance in blitz chess should correlate highly with a player's overall skill. In addition, restricting search processes should tend to equalize skill difference between players, but this effect should decrease as overall skill level increases.

It has been methodologically convenient to test the hypothesized T mechanism in physically taxing athletic contests, where results have been supportive, although their generalizability to normal social competition is questionable. Competition among chess players is a step closer to normal social competition because it does not require physical struggle, and it is the arena for tests of the T mechanism which are reported here. We find that winners of chess tournaments show higher T levels than do losers. Also, in certain circumstances, competitors show rises in T before their games, as if in preparation for the contests.

However, these theories neglect the role of high-level knowledge that is more abstract than the perceptual chunk. We investigated the role of high-level information in skilled chess memory in three experiments. In the first two experiments, experienced chess players were presented with a high-level verbal description of the position either before or after its presentation. If this type of knowledge facilitates the perception and subsequent recall of chess positions, then recall performance should be better in the description-before condition in which the information is available at the time of perception. In these two experiments, subjects performed better when given the description prior to viewing the position, supporting the proposal that a level of knowledge, beyond that of a set of chunks, is used to perceive a chess position. In the third experiment, subjects reconstructed multiple positions (between 1 and 9) immediately after seeing the entire set. Results indicated that experienced players could reconstruct multiple positions at a level beyond chance or guessing. Again, these results can be better explained in terms of high-level conceptual knowledge associated with each position than in terms of perceptual chunks.\n      </p>", "Information-processing models of chess-playing ability have distinguished between players of different calibers solely in terms of perceptual encoding and recognition of chess configurations. A reanalysis of deGroot's verbal protocols of 1965 indicates that players of different calibers direct their attention toward different areas of the board. Grandmasters and masters consider squares that are affected by many pieces, while lesser players direct their attention toward squares on which the pieces are located. In a recall experiment, chess positions were presented that had been randomly generated so as to differ only in the degree to which the pieces converge on the same squares. Masters showed superior recall for briefly presented positions only when the material affects a highly centralized area of the board.\n      </p>", "Two experiments using a levels-of-processing paradigm were performed to demonstrate the existence and usefulness of a semantic component in chess knowledge. Experiment I compared forced-choice recognition of chess positions after a structural task (piece counting) as opposed to a semantic task (choosing a move). Recognition accuracy, confidence, and familiarity ratings all showed a facilitation effect in the semantic condition. By including an orienting task that did not encourage semantic processing but still allowed pattern-matching operations to occur (copying a board), Experiment II demonstrated that this task effect was a genuine enhancement of memory due to meaningful processing. Once again, the processing of meaningful relations in the semantic task (positional evaluation) produced a higher level of recognition performance than did the more structural processing. These results suggest that aspects of meaning have some input into the processes that generate the memory representation of a chess position.\n      </p>", "Two important variables affecting recall of chess positions, chess skill and meaningfulness of the material, were investigated in the context of a forced-choice recognition task. A strict interpretation of Chase and Simon's 1973 model (in Chase, Ed., \"Visual Information Processing\"), it is argued, would predict no skill effects. In their model, skill-level differences result from differences in the amount of information encoded, which in turn reflects differences in the characteristic size of units used in encoding. A recognition task does not require complete encoding of the stimulus, and hence should show little skill effect. Nevertheless, recognition accuracy was strongly influenced by chess experience in two different experiments. Analysis of protocols and patterns of recognition for random positions suggested that dynamic features generated during analysis of a position formed a component of the memory representation of that position, especially for better players.\n      </p>", "The Thurstone-Mosteller model for paired comparisons has been modified to take account of ties (draws in the case of chess) by Batchelder &amp; Bershad (1979, Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 19, 39-60).

The model is applied to some data of Keene &amp; Divinsky (1989, Warriors of the Mind) relating to games between 64 of the greatest chess players. In addition, some more recent chess data is examined, and it is shown that the length of a chess game has an important bearing on the proportion of wins and draws.\n      </p>", "In a previous study (Unterrainer, Kaller, Halsband, and Rahm, 2006), chess players outperformed non-chess players in the Tower of London planning task but exhibited disproportionately longer processing times. This pattern of results raises the question of whether chess players\u2019 planning capabilities are superior or whether the results reflect differences in the speed\u2013accuracy trade-off between the groups, possibly attributable to sports motivation. The present study was designed to disambiguate these alternative suggestions by implementing various constraints on planning time and by assessing self-reported motivation. In contrast to the previous study,chess players\u2019 performance was not superior, independently of whether problems had to be solved with (Experiment 1) or without (Experiment 2) time limits. As expected, chess players reported higher overall trait and state motivation scores across both experiments. These findings revise the notion of superior planning performance in chess players. In consequence, they do not conform with the assumption of a general transfer of chess-related planning expertise to other cognitive domains, instead suggesting that superior performance may be possible only under specific circumstances such as receiving competitive instructions.\n      </p>", "A new species of ampithoid amphipod has been found which bores into and occupies the interior of abraded stipes of kelps on the Pacific coast of North America.

The present study employed a time-pressure manipulation as a possible source of converging evidence, based on assumed differences in the temporal requirements of recognitional versus calculational modes of processing. The rated quality of moves for very strong (master) and weaker (class B) players was compared in tournament games played under regulation and blitz time rules. The findings supported the predicted interaction between skill level and game type wherein the decrement in move quality for blitz games compared with regulation games was greater for the class B players than for the masters. These results were interpreted as supporting the view that the more highly skilled players are able to rely more extensively on rapid recognitional processes than less-skilled players.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "This paper examines, from a biopolitical perspective, the methodologies by which Supreme Court justices have interpreted the Constitution, assessing their decisional algorithms against models owing an intellectual debt to evolutionary theory. The models themselves are drawn from the chess literature, itself the most viable game theoretic context for \"living constitutional\" play. A proper appreciation of chess mastery yields the salient conclusion that a functionalist algorithm of data characterization is optimally adaptive for these purposes, usually proving more robust than competing structuralist and heuristic algorithms in resolving complex constitutional issues.\n      </p>", "Linear paired comparison models are studied when ties or draws are allowed, where the probability of a win plus half the probability of a draw is modelled as a symmetric cumulative function evaluated at the difference of strength parameters. These models are extended to make use of covariate information and used for ranking 64 top chess players since 1800 with information on career periods. The Davidson model which allows for draws does not fit chess data well because of the large variability in draw percentages from player to player. Some new methodology including an analysis of an appropriate goodness-of-fit test is given for this extended use of the linear model.\n      </p>", "We have expanded the field of \"DNA computers\" to RNA and present a general approach for the solution of satisfiability problems. As an example, we consider a variant of the \"Knight problem,\" which asks generally what configurations of knights can one place on an n\u00d7 n chess board such that no knight is attacking any other knight on the board. Using specific ribonuclease digestion to manipulate strands of a 10-bit binary RNA library, we developed a molecular algorithm and applied it to a 3\u00d7 3 chessboard as a 9-bit instance of this problem. Here, the nine spaces on the board correspond to nine \"bits\" or placeholders in a combinatorial RNA library. We recovered a set of \"winning\" molecules that describe solutions to this problem.\n      </p>", "This commentary on the article by Thomas, Chess, and Korn (Merrill-Palmer Quarterly, 1982 28, 1\u201320) puts the current controversy concerning the adequacy of parental ratings of temperament into the larger perspective of personality issues which have been hotly debated for the past two decades.

To further examine the relationship between herbage production and rainfall pattern, 3 soil water regimes (-1, -7, -15 bars) simulating expected rainfall and drought events in annual rangelands were applied in seminatural annual grassland communities. Soft chess (Bromus mollis) tillers grew longest under the -7 bar water regime treatments while total plant growth was greatest under the -1 bar treatment. Tiller length and total growth of slender oat (Avena barbata) were greatest under the -1 bar treatment. Vegetative growth of slender oat was less sensitive to season-long soil water regimes than soft chess. The two species required different soil water conditions for maximum spring growth; soft chess put on spring growth most rapidly in the -7 bar treatment while slender oat grew fastest in the -1 bar treatment. Periodic water stress during the growing season did not reduce spring herbage production. Maximum growth and herbage production occurred only when soil water was available after March 15. Withholding water after March 15 reduced herbage production by 46%.\n      </p>", "This reply to Thomas, Chess, and Korn (Merrill-Palmer Quarterly, 1982, 28, 1\u201320) examines some of the methodological issues in the assessment of temperament.
