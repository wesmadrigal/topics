{"total_words": 351, "documents": ["On the basis of data gathered during a series of Pre-Olympic Trials and the World Championships, both held at Cagliari (Italy) in 1983 and 1986, respectively, the somatotypes of athletes practicing windsurfing were studied. The sample is composed of 79 male athletes: 22 Sardinians, 31 mainland Italians, and 26 Europeans. The Heath-Carter anthropometric method (1967) was used to somatotype the individuals under study. Both the total sample as well as the three subsamples are characterized by almost identical average values of the three components. A subsample of athletes was formed, who had obtained important performances in their carriers (victories in World, European and Italian championships, participation in the Olympic Games etc.). In this group of top athletes it was seen that the best results in windsurfing are obtained when there is an even development of the three components (2.57 - 2.68 - 2.97) or a slight ectomorphic predominance. Anhand der Daten, die w\u00e4hrend einer Serie von vorolympischen Ausscheidungsk\u00e4mpfen und den Weltmeisterschaften in Cagliari (Italien) 1983 und 1986 gewonnen worden sind, wurden die Somatotypen der Windsurfer untersucht. Die Stichprobe besteht aus insgesamt 79 m\u00e4nnlichen Athleten, davon 22 aus Sardinien, 31 vom italienischen Festland und 26 aus dem \u00fcbrigen Europa. Die Bestimmung der Somtatotypen erfolgte mit Hilfe der Heath-Carter-Methode (1967). Sowohl in der Gesamtstichprobe als auch in den drei Einzelstichproben fanden sich nahezu identische Durchschnittswerte f\u00fcr die drei Komponenten. Es wurde weiterhin eine Gruppe von Athleten gebildet, die w\u00e4hrend ihrer sportlichen Laufbahn erhebliche Erfolge erzielt haben (Siege bei Weltmeisterschaften, Europameisterschaften und italienischen Meisterschaften, Teilnahme an Olympischen Spielen etc.). An dieser Gruppe von Spitzenathleten wurde beobachtet, da\u00df die besten Windsurfing-Ergebnisse mit einer ann\u00e4hernd gleichm\u00e4\u00dfigen Auspr\u00e4gung der drei Komponenten (2.57 - 2.68 - 2.97) bzw. einem leichten \u00dcberwiegen der Ektomorphie-Komponente verbunden sind.\n      </p>", "1. Potential human sources of disturbance, including fishing, sailing, windsurfing and different types of waterfowl hunting, are described and their effects on autumn-staging waterbirds, including mute swan, wigeon and coot, were examined at a coastal wetland in Denmark from 1985 to 1988. 2. Bird and human distributions were superimposed on the distribution of submerged vegetation and water depths to identify the extent of spatial overlap; likewise, seasonal and diurnal temporal overlap in bird abundance, and human activities were defined. Behavioural and distributional reactions of waterbirds to different human activities, in terms of escape distances, disruption of activity patterns and redistribution, were assessed to establish their relative effects. 3. Sailing and windsurfing showed little spatial overlap, and fishing partial spatial overlap with bird distributions; these activities almost ceased before the peak in autumn bird numbers. Hunting showed a high degree of spatial and temporal overlap with bird presence. 4. Birds responded to windsurfing at greatest distances, whereas hunting (especially from mobile punts) caused the longest disruptions to activities of waterfowl. In terms of behaviour and redistribution, wigeon was more affected by shooting than was mute swan or coot. One or two mobile shooting punts reduced wigeon numbers, whereas numbers were unaffected by the presence of up to 4-6 stationary punts; fishing boats had no effect on wigeon abundance. 5. Hunting, especially shooting from mobile punts, was identified as the most disturbing human activity in relation to staging waterfowl in this area. Similar results and conclusions were reached in another comparable study area. The results have implications for refuge designs and zoning of disturbing recreational activities.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "This research examined the enduring nature of involvement with three recreational activities (golf, downhill skiing, windsurfing) and associated products using a panel survey approach. Over 280 participants completed in-season questionnaires that assessed involvement using Laurent and Kapferer's (1985) Consumer Involvement Profile scale. Respondents were contacted with follow-up instruments in the off-season and preseason. The data suggested that activity involvement scores on the attraction (importance, pleasure) and risk probability dimensions were stable between seasons but sign (symbolic value) and risk consequence scores fluctuated. Product involvement scores for all four dimensions were stable both across seasons and based on length of participation. Positive relations were found between activity involvement and length of participation. Six distinct activity involvement-based clusters were found. Discriminant analyses suggested that cluster memberships were generally stable across seasons.\n      </p>", "Leisure activities such as mountain biking, rock climbing, snow boarding, windsurfing, or bungee jumping are developments of the last three decades. Their evolution and diversification is mainly restricted to western-industrialized societies, i.e. societies differentiated by their functions. The appearance and the progression in the diversification of modern outdoor sports as well as the strongly increasing demand for these kinds of activities is analyzed and interpreted based on system theory as developed by Niklas Luhmann. The two important elements of these leisure activities \u2013 recourse on the body and risky conduct \u2013 is interpreted with respect to their social meaning. By this means, modern outdoor sports can play an important role in the search for identity of individuals in functionally differentiated societies.\n      </p>", "           ", "           ", "           ", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

In this paper I argue that this position, what I call the hedonistic model, rests on a misunderstanding of aesthetic appreciation. To support this claim I put forward an alternative model based on disinterestedness, and I defend disinterestedness against mistaken interpretations of it. Properly understood, disinterestedness defines a standpoint which precludes self-interest and utility, and it does not entail a passive subject abstracted from who they are. This standpoint is compatible with a 'situated aesthetic' in which appreciation of aesthetic qualities is grounded in an embedded subject who is sensitive to the context and narrative of the object. The alternative model provides a conception of aesthetic value which distinguishes it from amenity value, and it also defines a non-instrumental approach that offers the opportunity for enhanced appreciation and attention to nature's value.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

On the basis of ethnographic interviews of Salvadoran and U.S. aid managers, I examine the articulation of these U.S.-sponsored reforms with changing relations of domination in El Salvador. The interaction of notions of Salvadoran sovereignty and national identity with U.S.-promoted notions of modernity shaped the U.S. management and Salvadoran adoption of aid.

In the post-war years recreation planning passed through similar phases in the two countries, concentrating on the provision of major facilities for outdoor recreation. Now the emphasis has moved to public access over private land with attempts to revive the rights of way network in England and Wales, although this has no counterpart in the Netherlands. Yet public access is unlikely to increase to match the growing demands for informal recreation and outdoor pursuits in both countries. The recreation lobbies are unlikely to overcome current political trends towards market solutions--commercial recreation, tourism, privatisation and the erosion of public welfare--backed by the opposition of local amenity and conservation interests.\n      </p>", "Drawing on (auto)ethnographic research\u2014on the process of becoming a marathon swimmer, this paper argues that conventional characterisations of marathon swimming as being '80 per cent mental and 20 per cent physical' reprise a mind\u2014body split that at worst excludes women and at best holds them to a masculine standard. This in turn draws the focus towards sensory deprivation, bodily suffering and overcoming, to the exclusion of the pleasures of swimming, beyond the expected ones such as the challenge of swim completion. By exploring instead the 'shifted sensorium' of marathon swimming, and examples of the autotelic pleasures of swimming, this paper argues that training changes the way swimming body feels, and that it is these changes that enable a swimmer to feel 'at home' in an environment to which it does not naturally belong. This focus on the sensory aspects of swimming, and its unexpected pleasures, both highlights the ways in which those pleasures do not flow unproblematically to women, and brings to light alternative and politically provocative ways of experiencing the gendered sporting body. This highlights the contingency, however constrained, of even the most entrenched ways of thinking about bodies, both within and outside sport.\n      </p>", "Computer-Assisted Argument Mapping (CAAM) is a new way of understanding arguments. While still embryonic in its development and application, CAAM is being used increasingly as a training and development tool in the professions and government. Inroads are also being made in its application within education. CAAM claims to be helpful in an educational context, as a tool for students in responding to assessment tasks. However, to date there is little evidence from students that this is the case. This paper outlines the use of CAAM as an educational tool within an Economics and Commerce Faculty in a major Australian research university. Evaluation results are provided from students from a CAAM pilot within an upper-level Economics subject. Results indicate promising support for the use of CAAM and its potential for transferability within the disciplines. If shown to be valuable with further studies, CAAM could be included in capstone subjects, allowing computer technology to be utilised in the service of generic skill development.\n      </p>", "Surfing is increasingly capturing the minds and emotions of people, especially youth, all over the world.

Genre has been described as a property of texts which allows them to be described as a sequence of segments, or \"moves,\" with each move accomplishing some part of the overall communicative purpose of the text, while register can be thought of as the language and linguistic patterns of one particular genre. The purpose of this study was to find out whether the registers of different moves of one genre can be very different from each other. A corpus of 44 typical examples of the genre, \"Brief Tourist Information,\" was created. A computerized concordancing program was used to analyze the three moves, \"Location,\" \"Facilities/Activities,\" and \"Description\" in terms of discourse functions, length, reader address, modality, idioms, lexical phrases, and common lexical items. A comparison of the structures and lexical items of the three moves showed clearly that while they shared a few functions, for the most part they differed substantially. The results suggest that language educators should consider 1) basing instructional materials on corpora of texts in use, 2) teaching the move structure of genres and the concomitant move registers rather than the general register of the genre as a whole, 3) integrating the teaching of reading and writing, and 4) adopting a \"purpose approach\" to the teaching of writing.\n      </p>", "Divers may run a higher risk of infection with waterborne pathogens than bathers because of more frequent and intense contact with water that may not comply with microbiologic water quality standards for bathing water. In this study we aimed to estimate the volume of water swallowed during diving as a key factor for infection risk assessment associated with diving. Using questionnaires, occupational and sport divers in the Netherlands were asked about number of dives, volume of swallowed water, and health complaints (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and ear, skin, eye, and respiratory complaints). Occupational divers, on average, swallowed 9.8 mL marine water and 5.7 mL fresh surface water per dive. Sport divers swallowed, on average, 9.0 mL marine water; 13 mL fresh recreational water; 3.2 mL river, canal, or city canal water; and 20 mL water in circulation pools. Divers swallowed less water when wearing a full face mask instead of an ordinary diving mask and even less when wearing a diving helmet. A full face mask or a diving helmet is recommended when diving in fecally contaminated water. From the volumes of swallowed water and concentrations of pathogens in fecally contaminated water, we estimated the infection risks per dive and per year to be as high as a few to up to tens of percents. This may explain why only 20% of the divers reported having none of the inquired health complaints within a period of 1 year. It is highly recommended that divers be informed about fecal contamination of the diving water.\n      </p>", "Bird disturbance by human activities is one of the impacts related to human presence at conservation sites in Brittany (France). This paper is an attempt at reviewing this relatively unknown problem through the results of an international bibliographical review and of a regional inquiry conducted in close collaboration with managers of the conservation areas in Brittany. These two approaches will help to demonstrate the extent and complexity of the human / fauna interactions, as well as to take stock of the state of research in this field and, last but not least, to highlight the difficulties managers of conservation sites are facing to deal with this new issue. For the managers, bird disturbance is indeed the most important impact related to human attendance on conservation sites in Brittany.\n      </p>", "Infection with Schistosoma species is acquired by exposure to fresh water that harbors cercariae released by infected snails. Although the route of infection is clear, clinical presentation of the established infection in the nonimmune tourist typically differs from that in the local population of areas of endemicity. For the health care practitioner, the traveler's syndrome presents distinctive management problems: water-transmitted bacterial and viral infections may coexist, and identification of the stage of disease at presentation, along with identification of the causative species, will maximize treatment options. Travel medicine clinics serve as epidemiological antennae, helping to identify the dynamics of species transmission in geographically distinct areas. Education of persons traveling to areas of endemicity and the development of mechanical protection against exposure are needed.\n      </p>", "The empirical evidence concerning the quantitative relations between energy intake and expenditure on the one hand and body mass index (BMI) on the other is inconclusive. We have used a large database of 14,281 individuals, for whom habitual dietary intake and expenditure have been ascertained with adequate methodology, to examine the mutually adjusted associations of these variables with BMI. Study subjects were adult participants in the Greek component of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. After adjustment for age and gender and exclusion of dieting individuals and energy underreporters, an increment of about 500 kcal intake was found to correspond to an increment of about $0.33\\ {\\rm kg}/{\\rm m}^{2}$ of BMI, whereas an increment of about 5 MET-hours of energy expenditure was associated with a decrease of about $0.18\\ {\\rm kg}/{\\rm m}^{2}$ of BMI, where MET is the ratio of the metabolic rate associated with a given activity to the resting metabolic rate. Our results indicate that increasing physical activity is about half as effective as decreasing energy intake in reducing BMI.\n      </p>", "Reading Broken Embraces as Almod\u00f3var's 8\u00bd, this essay explores its celebration of cinema's resilience at an historic moment when the medium has gone digital and its distribution is being redefined.

These people have abandoned the conventional lifestyle anchored in security, continuity, and tradition and embarked upon a lifestyle of transience. Drawing on four years of participant observation and depth interviews in a luxury Hawaiian resort as well as supplemental interviews with resort workers around the United States, we articulate the four dimensions of these workers' lives that primarily engage their transience: work, ideology, family, and friendships. From these patterns we draw conclusions about the nature of the global postmodern workforce and community, and about the social psychological nature of the postmodern self.\n      </p>", "Certain health risks have been associated with recreational exposure to faecally polluted water. Canoeing in certain South African waters is considered to be a high risk activity with regard to schistosomiasis, gastroenteritis and possibly hepatitis.
