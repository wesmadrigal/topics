{"total_words": 722, "documents": ["Adenosine and its endogenous precursor ATP are main components of the purinergic system that modulates cellular and tissue functions via specific adenosine and ATP receptors (P1 and P2 receptors), respectively. Although adenosine inhibits excitability and ATP functions as an excitatory transmitter in the central nervous system, little is known about the ability of P1 and P2 receptors to form new functional structures such as a heteromer to control the complex purinergic cascade. Here we have shown that Gi/o protein-coupled A1 adenosine receptor (A1R) and Gq protein-coupled P2Y1 receptor (P2Y1R) coimmunoprecipitate in cotransfected HEK293T cells, suggesting the oligomeric association between distinct G protein-coupled P1 and P2 receptors. A1R and P2Y2 receptor, but not A1R and dopamine D2 receptor, also were found to coimmunoprecipitate in cotransfected cells. A1R agonist and antagonist binding to cell membranes were reduced by coexpression of A1R and P2Y1R, whereas a potent P2Y1R agonist adenosine 5\u2032-O-(2-thiotriphosphate) (ADP\u03b2S) revealed a significant potency to A1R binding only in the cotransfected cell membranes. Moreover, the A1R/P2Y1R coexpressed cells showed an ADP\u03b2S-dependent reduction of forskolin-evoked cAMP accumulation that was sensitive to pertussis toxin and A1R antagonist, indicating that ADP\u03b2S binds A1R and inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity via Gi/o proteins. Also, a high degree of A1R and P2Y1R colocalization was demonstrated in cotransfected cells by double immunofluorescence experiments with confocal laser microscopy. These results suggest that oligomeric association of A1R with P2Y1R generates A1R with P2Y1R-like agonistic pharmacology and provides a molecular mechanism for an increased diversity of purine signaling.\n      </p>", "Prostaglandins (PG) are synthesized by two isoforms of the enzyme PG G/H synthase [cyclooxygenase (COX)]. To examine selectivity of tolerated doses of an inhibitor of the inducible COX-2 in humans, we examined the effects of celecoxib on indices of COX-1-dependent platelet thromboxane (Tx) A2 and on systemic biosynthesis of prostacyclin in vivo. Volunteers received doses of 100, 400, or 800 mg of celecoxib or 800 mg of a nonselective inhibitor, ibuprofen. Ibuprofen, but not celecoxib, significantly inhibited TxA2- dependent aggregation, induced ex vivo by arachidonic acid (83 \u00b1 11% vs. 11.9\u00b1 2.2%; $P&lt;0.005)$ and by collagen. Neither agent altered aggregation induced by thromboxane mimetic, U46619. Ibuprofen reduced serum TxB2 (-95 \u00b1 2% vs. -6.9 \u00b1 4.2%; $P&lt;0.001)$ and urinary excretion of the major Tx metabolite, 11-dehydro TxB2 (-70 \u00b1 9.9% vs. -20.3 \u00b1 5.3%; $P&lt;0.05)$ when compared with placebo. Despite a failure to suppress TxA2-dependant platelet aggregation, celecoxib had a modest but significant inhibitory effect on serum TxB2 4 hr after dosing. By contrast, both ibuprofen and celecoxib suppressed a biochemical index of COX-2 activity (endotoxin induced PGE2 in whole blood ex vivo) to a comparable degree (-93.3 \u00b1 2% vs. -83\u00b1 6.1%). There was no significant difference between the doses of celecoxib on COX-2 inhibition. Celecoxib and ibuprofen suppressed urinary excretion of the prostacyclin metabolite 2,3 dinor 6-keto PGF1\u03b1. These data suggest that (i) platelet COX-1-dependent aggregation is not inhibited by up to 800 mg of celecoxib; (ii) comparable COX-2 inhibition is attained by celecoxib (100-800 mg) and ibuprofen (800 mg) after acute dosing; and (iii) COX-2 is a major source of systemic prostacyclin biosynthesis in healthy humans.\n      </p>", "Using the mouse \u03b4-opioid receptor cDNA as a probe, we have isolated genomic clones encoding the human \u03bc- and \u03ba-opioid receptor genes. Their organization appears similar to that of the human \u03b4 receptor gene, with exon-intron boundaries located after putative transmembrane domains 1 and 4. The \u03ba gene was mapped at position q11-12 in human chromosome 8. A full-length cDNA encoding the human \u03ba-opioid receptor has been isolated. The cloned receptor expressed in COS cells presents a typical \u03ba1 pharmacological profile and is negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase. The expression of \u03ba-opioid receptor mRNA in human brain, as estimated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, is consistent with the involvement of \u03ba-opioid receptors in pain perception, neuroendocrine physiology, affective behavior, and cognition. In situ hybridization studies performed on human fetal spinal cord demonstrate the presence of the transcript specifically in lamina II of the dorsal horn. Some divergences in structural, pharmacological, and anatomical properties are noted between the cloned human and rodent receptors.\n      </p>", "A cDNA encoding a functional \u03b3-aminobutyric (GABA)-activated Cl- channel has been isolated from an adult Drosophila head cDNA library. When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, the subunit functions efficiently, presumably as a homooligomeric complex and is activated by GABA or muscimol. GABA-evoked currents are highly sensitive to antagonism by picrotoxin but are insensitive to bicuculline, RU 5135, or zinc. Pentobarbitone greatly enhances GABA-evoked currents, whereas the neurosteroid 5\u03b1-pregnan-3\u03b1-ol-20-one demonstrates a large reduction in both the potency and maximal effect when compared with its actions upon vertebrate GABA type A receptors. Although zinc-insensitive, the subunit is also insensitive to flunitrazepam. Hence, the GABA receptors formed by this subunit exhibit a unique pharmacology when compared with vertebrate GABA type A receptors or those composed of \u03c1 subunits. Because the receptor-channel complex functions as a homooligomer, this subunit may be of value in mutagenesis studies aiming to define drug-binding sites.\n      </p>", "A full-length cDNA encoding the guinea pig \u03ba opioid (dynorphin) receptor has been isolated. The deduced protein contains 380 aa and seven hydrophobic \u03b1-helices characteristic of the G protein-coupled receptors. This receptor is 90% identical to the mouse and rat \u03ba receptors, with the greatest level of divergence in the N-terminal region. When expressed in COS-7 cells, the receptor displays high affinity and stereospecificity toward dynorphin peptides and other \u03ba-selective opioid ligands such as U50,488. It does not bind the \u03bc- and \u03b4-selective opioid ligands. The expressed receptor is functionally coupled to G protein(s) to inhibit adenylyl cyclase and Ca2+ channels. The guinea pig \u03ba receptor mRNA is expressed in many brain areas, including the cerebellum, a pattern that agrees well with autoradiographic maps of classical guinea pig \u03ba binding sites. Species differences in the pharmacology and mRNA distribution between the cloned guinea pig and rat \u03ba receptors may be worthy of further examination.\n      </p>", "Previously, we have shown that agonists and antagonists interact with distinct, though overlapping regions within the human progesterone receptor (hPR) resulting in the formation of structurally different complexes. Thus, a link was established between the structure of a ligand-receptor complex and biological activity. In this study, we have utilized a series of in vitro assays with which to study hPR pharmacology and have identified a third class of hPR ligands that induce a receptor conformation which is distinct from that induced by agonists or antagonists. Importantly, when assayed on PR-responsive target genes these compounds were shown to exhibit partial agonist activity; an activity that was influenced by cell context. Thus, as has been shown previously for estrogen receptor, the overall structure of the ligand-receptor complex is influenced by the nature of the ligand. It appears, therefore, that the observed differences in the activity of some PR and estrogen receptor ligands reflect the ability of the cellular transcription machinery to discriminate between the structurally different complexes that result following ligand interaction. These data support the increasingly favored hypothesis that different ligands can interact with different regions within the hormone binding domains of steroid hormone receptors resulting in different biologies.\n      </p>", "The constitutive activation of G-protein-coupled receptors is a major new approach to investigating their physiopathology and pharmacology. A large number of spontaneous and site-directed mutations resulting in constitutive activity have been identified, but systematic mapping of the amino acids involved for a given receptor would be extremely useful for complete elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying its activation. We carried out such mapping for the angiotensin II type 1A (AT1A) receptor by screening a randomly mutated cDNA library after expressing the mutated clones in eukaryotic cells. To test the AT1A mutants generated, we developed an original, specific, and highly sensitive assay based on the properties of CGP42112A. This classical AT2 agonist is a weak partial agonist of the wild-type AT1A receptor and becomes a full agonist for constitutively active AT1A mutants, as shown experimentally and in allostery-based theoretical models. Activation of the mutated receptors by CGP42112A was monitored by using the bioluminescent protein aequorin, a very sensitive and specific sensor of intracellular calcium mobilization. The screening of 4,800 clones, providing an exhaustive coverage of all of the mutations generated, led to the identification of 16 mutations in sequences encoding the transmembrane domains that were responsible for high sensitivity to CGP42112A. The constitutive activity was confirmed by agonist-independent production of inositol phosphates, which showed that at least half of the clones had significantly increased basal activity. These data demonstrate that this new type of approach is very efficient for the systematic identification of constitutively active mutants of G-protein-coupled receptors.\n      </p>", "At least three distinct beta-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2 -AR) subtypes exist in mammals. These receptors modulate a wide variety of processes, from development and behavior, to cardiac function, metabolism, and smooth muscle tone. To understand the roles that individual \u03b2 -AR subtypes play in these processes, we have used the technique of gene targeting to create homozygous \u03b2 1-AR null mutants (\u03b2 1-AR -/-) in mice. The majority of \u03b2 1-AR -/- mice die prenatally, and the penetrance of lethality shows strain dependence. \u03b2 1-AR -/- mice that do survive to adulthood appear normal, but lack the chronotropic and inotropic responses seen in wild-type mice when \u03b2 -AR agonists such as isoproterenol are administered. Moreover, this lack of responsiveness is accompanied by markedly reduced stimulation of adenylate cyclase in cardiac membranes from \u03b2 1-AR -/- mice. These findings occur despite persistent cardiac \u03b2 2-AR expression, demonstrating the importance of \u03b2 1-ARs for proper mouse development and cardiac function, while highlighting functional differences between \u03b2 -AR subtypes.\n      </p>", "GPR7 and GPR8 are orphan G protein-coupled receptors that are highly similar to each other. These receptors are expressed predominantly in brain, suggesting roles in central nervous system function. We have purified an endogenous peptide ligand for GPR7 from bovine hypothalamus extracts. This peptide, termed neuropeptide B (NPB), has a C-6-brominated tryptophan residue at the N terminus. It binds and activates human GPR7 or GPR8 with median effective concentrations (EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.23 nM and 15.8 nM, respectively. In situ hybridization shows distinct localizations of the prepro-NPB mRNA in mouse brain, i.e., in paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, hippocampus, and several nuclei in midbrain and brainstem. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of NPB in mice induces hyperphagia during the first 2 h, followed by hypophagia. Intracerebroventricular injection of NPB produces analgesia to s.c. formalin injection in rats. Through EST database searches, we identified a putative paralogous peptide. This peptide, termed neuropeptide W (NPW), also has an N-terminal tryptophan residue. Synthetic human NPW binds and activates human GPR7 or GPR8 with EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 0.56 nM and 0.51 nM, respectively. The expression of NPW mRNA in mouse brain is confined to specific nuclei in midbrain and brainstem. These findings suggest diverse physiological functions of NPB and NPW in the central nervous system, acting as endogenous ligands on GPR7 and/or GPR8.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

In turn, specific conformations of the receptor-ligand complex have been postulated to influence unique subsets of estrogen-responsive genes resulting in differential modulation and, ultimately, tissue-selective outcomes. The estrogen receptor ligands raloxifene and tamoxifen have demonstrated such tissue-specific estrogen agonist/antagonist effects. Both agents antagonize the effects of estrogen on mammary tissue while mimicking the actions of estrogen on bone. However, tamoxifen induces significant stimulation of uterine tissue whereas raloxifene does not. We postulate that structural differences between raloxifene and tamoxifen may influence the conformations of their respective receptor/ligand complexes, thereby affecting which estrogen-responsive genes are modulated in various tissues. These structural differences are 4-fold: (A) the presence of phenolic hydroxyls, (B) different substituents on the basic amine, (C) incorporation of the stilbene moiety into a cyclic benzothiophene framework, and (D) the imposition of a carbonyl ``hinge'' between the basic amine-containing side chain and the olefin. A series of raloxifene analogs that separately exemplify each of these differences have been prepared and evaluated in a series of in vitro and in vivo assays. This strategy has resulted in the development of a pharmacophore model that attributes the differences in effects on the uterus between raloxifene and tamoxifen to a low-energy conformational preference imparting an orthogonal orientation of the basic side chain with respect to the stilbene plane. This three-dimensional array is dictated by a single carbon atom in the hinge region of raloxifene. These data indicate that differences in tissue selective actions among benzothiophene and triarylethylene estrogen receptor modulators can be ascribed to discrete ligand conformations.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Little is known about the effector-interaction regions of G\u03b2 \u03b3 . We had used molecular modeling to dock a peptide encoding the region of residues 956-982 of adenylyl cyclase (AC) 2 onto G\u03b2 to identify residues on G\u03b2 that may interact with effectors. Based on predictions from the model, we synthesized peptides encoding sequences of residues 86-105 (G\u03b2 86-105) and 115-135 (G\u03b2 115-135) from G\u03b2 . The G\u03b2 86-105 peptide inhibited G\u03b2 \u03b3 stimulation of AC2 and blocked G\u03b2 \u03b3 inhibition of AC1 and by itself inhibited calmodulin-stimulated AC1, thus displaying partial agonist activity. Substitution of Met-101 with Asn in this peptide resulted in the loss of both the inhibitory and partial agonist activities. Most activities of the G\u03b2 115-135 peptide were similar to those of G\u03b2 86-105 but G\u03b2 115-135 was less efficacious in blocking G\u03b2 \u03b3 inhibition of AC1. Substitution of Tyr-124 with Val in the G\u03b2 115-135 peptide diminished all of its activities. These results identify the region encoded by amino acids 84-143 of G\u03b2 as a surface that is involved in transmitting signals to effectors.\n      </p>", "Eosinophil migration in vivo is markedly attenuated in rats treated chronically with the NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor N\u03c9-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). In this study, we investigated the existence of a NOS system in eosinophils. Our results demonstrated that rat peritoneal eosinophils strongly express both type II (30.2 \u00b1 11.6% of counted cells) and type III (24.7 \u00b1 7.4% of counted cells) NOS, as detected by immunohistochemistry using affinity purified mouse mAbs. Eosinophil migration in vitro was evaluated by using 48-well microchemotaxis chambers and the chemotactic agents used were N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP, 5 \u00d7 10-8 M) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4, 10-8 M). L-NAME (but not D-NAME) significantly inhibited the eosinophil migration induced by both fMLP (54% reduction for 1.0 mM; P &lt; 0.05) and LTB4 (61% reduction for 1.0 mM; P &lt; 0.05). In addition, the type II NOS inhibitor 2-amino-5,6-dihydro-6-methyl-4H-1,3-thiazine and the type I/II NOS inhibitor 1-(2-trifluoromethylphenyl) imidazole also markedly (P &lt; 0.05) attenuated fMLP- (52% and 38% reduction for 1.0 mM, respectively) and LTB4- (52% and 51% reduction for 1.0 mM, respectively) induced migration. The inhibition of eosinophil migration by L-NAME was mimicked by the soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4] oxadiazolo [4,3,-a] quinoxalin-1-one (0.01 and 0.1 mM) and reversed by either sodium nitroprusside (0.1 mM) or dibutyryl cyclic GMP (1 mM). We conclude that eosinophils do express NO synthase(s) and that nitric oxide plays an essential role in eosinophil locomotion by acting through a cyclic GMP transduction mechanism.\n      </p>", "We report the synthesis and in vitro biological activity of the nonpeptide bradykinin receptor antagonist WIN 64338, [[4-[[2-[[bis(cyclohexylamino)methylene] amino]-3-(2-naphthyl)-1-oxopropyl]amino]phenyl]methyl]tributylphosphonium chloride monohydrochloride. WIN 64338 inhibits [3H]-bradykinin binding to the bradykinin B2 receptor on human IMR-90 cells with a binding inhibition constant (Ki) of 64 \u00b1 8 nM and demonstrates competitive inhibition of bradykinin-stimulated 45Ca2+ efflux from IMR-90 cells (pA2 = 7.1). The antagonist inhibits bradykinin-mediated guinea pig ileum contractility (pA2 = 8.2) and has significantly weaker activity against acetylcholine-induced contractility in the same preparation. WIN 64338 is not active in a rabbit aorta bradykinin B1 receptor assay, demonstrating that it is a selective bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist. The compound inhibits [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding to the rat brain muscarinic receptor (Ki = 350 nM) but is 25- to 100-fold more selective for the bradykinin receptor compared with other receptors against which it has been tested.

Although it was considered originally that these agents manifested their mitogenic actions through separate pathways, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that the EGF and estrogen-mediated signaling pathways are intertwined. Indeed, it has been demonstrated recently that 17\u03b2 -estradiol (E2) can induce a rapid activation of mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) in mammalian cells, an event that is independent of both transcription and protein synthesis. In this study, we have used a pharmacological approach to dissect this novel pathway in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and have determined that in the presence of endogenous estrogen receptor, activation of MAPK by E2 is preceded by a rapid increase in cytosolic calcium. The involvement of intracellular calcium in this process was supported by the finding that the presence of EGTA and Ca2+-free medium did not affect the activation of MAPK by E2 and, additionally, that this response was blocked by the addition of the intracellular calcium chelator $\\text{1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-}N,N,N^{\\prime},N^{\\prime}\\text {-tetraacetate}$ . Cumulatively, these data indicate that the estrogen receptor, in addition to functioning as a transcription factor, is also involved, through a nongenomic mechanism, in the regulation of both intracellular calcium homeostasis and MAPK-signaling pathways. Although nongenomic actions of estrogens have been suggested by numerous studies in the past, the ability to link estradiol and the estrogen receptor to a well defined signaling pathway strongly supports a physiological role for this activity.\n      </p>", "The epothilones are naturally occurring, cytotoxic macrolides that function through a paclitaxel (Taxol)-like mechanism. Although structurally dissimilar, both classes of molecules lead to the arrest of cell division and eventual cell death by stabilizing cellular microtubule assemblies. The epothilones differ in their ability to retain activity against multidrug-resistant (MDR) cell lines and tumors where paclitaxel fails. In the current account, we focus on the relationship between epothilone and paclitaxel in the context of tumors with multiple drug resistance. The epothilone analogue Z-12,13-desoxyepothilone B (dEpoB) is &gt;35,000-fold more potent than paclitaxel in inhibiting cell growth in the MDR DC-3F/ADX cell line. Various formulations, routes, and schedules of i.v. administration of dEpoB have been tested in nude mice. Slow infusion with a Cremophor-ethanol vehicle proved to be the most beneficial in increasing efficacy and decreasing toxicity. Although dEpoB performed similarly to paclitaxel in sensitive tumors xenografts (MX-1 human mammary and HT-29 colon tumor), its effects were clearly superior against MDR tumors. When dEpoB was administered to nude mice bearing our MDR human lymphoblastic T cell leukemia (CCRF-CEM/paclitaxel), dEpoB demonstrated a full curative effect. For human mammary adenocarcinoma MCF-7/Adr cells refractory to paclitaxel, dEpoB reduced the established tumors, markedly suppressed tumor growth, and surpassed other commonly used chemotherapy drugs such as adriamycin, vinblastine, and etoposide in beneficial effects.\n      </p>", "We have characterized a G-protein-coupled glutamate receptor in primary cultures of striatal neurons. Glutamate, quisqualate, or trans-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylate inhibited by 30-40% either forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in intact cells or forskolin plus vasoactive intestinal peptide-activated adenylyl cyclase assayed in neuronal membrane preparations. These inhibitory effects were suppressed after treatment of striatal neurons with Bordetella pertussis toxin, suggesting the involvement of a heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) of the Gi/Go subtype. The pharmacological profile of this glutamate receptor negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase was different from that of the metabotropic Qp glutamate receptor coupled to phospholipase C in striatal neurons and from that of the recently cloned \"mGluR2\" glutamate receptor, which is negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase when expressed in non-neuronal cells.\n      </p>", "To identify the binding domain for dihydropyridine Ca2+ antagonists, skeletal muscle Ca2+ channels were photolabeled with [3H](+)-PN200- 110 and [3H] Azidopine. Regions of \u03b11 photolabeled by these ligands were then identified by antibody mapping of proteolytic fragments. Approximately 50% of the specific labeling by both ligands was incorporated in domain III. [3H] Azidopine labeled peptide Gln-989-Arg-1022, which contains a portion of the connecting loop between transmembrane segments IIIS5 and IIIS6 (IIIS5/S6), and peptide Ala-1023-Lys-1077, which contains IIIS6 itself and some adjacent amino acid residues. In contrast, [3H](+)-PN200-110 labeling occurred almost exclusively in the fragment containing IIIS6. A second site labeled by both ligands was identified in transmembrane segment S6 of domain IV and adjacent residues. In contrast to azidopine, the photoreactive benzofurazane group of (+)-PN200-110 is located in close proximity to the essential dihydropyridine ring. Therefore, the regions photolabeled by [3H](+)-PN200-110 within or adjacent to transmembrane segments IIIS6 and IVS6 must participate in the formation of the dihydropyridine binding site. As IIIS5/S6 is preferentially labeled by [3H] azidopine, it may contribute to drug binding by interaction with the long side chain of some dihydropyridines like azidopine. It is proposed, based on physiological studies, that these three peptide segments interact to form a receptor site accessible from the extracellular surface of the Ca2+ channel.\n      </p>", "The human A3 adenosine receptor was cloned from a striatal cDNA library using a probe derived from the homologous rat sequence. The cDNA encodes a protein of 318 amino acids and exhibits 72% and 85% overall identity with the rat and sheep A3 adenosine receptor sequences, respectively. Specific and saturable binding of the adenosine receptor agonist N6-(4-amino-3-[125I]iodobenzyl)adenosine [125I]ABA was measured on the human A3 receptor stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells with a Kd = 10 nM. The potency order for adenosine receptor agonists was N-ethylcarboxami-doadenosine (NECA) \u2265 (R)-N6-phenyl-2-propyladenosine [(R)-PIA] &gt; N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA) &gt; (S)-N6-phenyl-2-propyladenosine [(S)-PIA]. The human receptor was blocked by xanthine antagonists, most potently by 3-(3-iodo-4-aminobenzyl)-8-(4-oxyacetate)phenyl-1-propylxanthine (I-ABOPX) with a potency order of I-ABOPX &gt; 1,3-dipropyl-8-(4-acrylate)phenylxanthine \u2265 xanthine amino congener &gt;&gt; 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine. Adenosine, NECA, (R)- and (S)-PIA, and CPA inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation by 30-40% in stably transfected cells; I-ABA is a partial agonist. When measured in the presence of antagonists, the dose-response curves of NECA-induced inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation were right-shifted. Antagonist potencies determined by Schild analyses correlated well with those established by competition for radioligand binding. The A3 adenosine receptor transcript is widespread and, in contrast to the A1, A2a, and A2b transcripts, the most abundant expression is found in the lung and liver. The tissue distribution of A3 mRNA is more similar to the widespread profile found in sheep than to the restricted profile found in the rat. This raises the possibility that numerous physiological effects of adenosine may be mediated by A3 adenosine receptors.\n      </p>", "The papain superfamily member bleomycin hydrolase (Blmh) is a neutral cysteine protease with structural similarity to a 20S proteasome. Bleomycin (BLM), a clinically used glycopeptide anticancer agent, is deaminated in vitro by Blmh. We used gene targeting to generate mice that lack Blmh and demonstrated that Blmh is the sole enzyme required for BLM deamination. Although some Blmh null mice were viable and reproduced, only about 65% of the expected number survived the neonatal period, revealing an important role for Blmh in neonatal survival. Mice lacking Blmh exhibited variably penetrant tail dermatitis that resembled rodent ringtail. The histopathology of the tail dermatitis was similar to skin lesions in humans with pellagra, necrolytic migratory erythema, and acrodermatitis enteropathica. Compared with controls, Blmh null mice were more sensitive to acute BLM lethality and developed pulmonary fibrosis more readily following BLM treatment. Thus, we have established that Blmh is an essential protectant against BLM-induced death and has an important role in neonatal survival and in maintaining epidermal integrity.\n      </p>", "Nitric oxide (NO), a mediator involved in penile erection, is synthesized by the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) family of enzymes. It has been shown that NOS activity decreases with age. To determine whether adenoviral-mediated overexpression of endothelial NOS (eNOS) could enhance erectile responses, we administered a recombinant adenovirus containing the eNOS gene (AdCMVeNOS) into the corpora cavernosum of the aged rat. Adenoviral expression of the \u03b2 -galactosidase reporter gene was observed in cavernosal tissue 1 day after intracavernosal administration of AdCMV\u03b2 gal; 1 day after administration of AdCMVeNOS, transgene expression was confirmed by immunoblot staining of eNOS protein, and cGMP levels were increased. The increase in cavernosal pressure in response to cavernosal nerve stimulation was enhanced in animals transfected with eNOS, and erectile responses to acetylcholine and zaprinast were enhanced at a time when the erectile response to the NO donor sodium 1-(N,N-diethylamino)diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate was not altered. These results suggest that in vivo gene transfer of eNOS, alone or in combination with a type V phosphodiesterase inhibitor, may constitute a new therapeutic intervention for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.\n      </p>", "An extremely potent and highly specific non-peptide, subnanomolar endothelin (ET) receptor antagonist, SB 209670, has been synthesized and characterized. SB 209670, which was rationally designed using conformational models of ET-1, selectively inhibits binding of 125I-labeled ET-1 to cloned human ET receptor subtypes ETA and ETB (Ki = 0.2 and 18 nM, respectively). SB 209670 produces concentration-dependent inhibition of ET-1-mediated vasoconstriction in isolated vascular tissues and in vivo following either intravenous or intraduodenal administration. SB 209670 produces a dose-dependent reduction in blood pressure in hypertensive rats, protects from ischemia-induced neuronal degeneration in a gerbil stroke model, and attenuates neointima formation following rat carotid artery balloon angioplasty. SB 209670 will be useful in characterizing and classifying the physiological and pathophysiological effects of ET\n      </p>", "The signaling pathway initiated by factor Xa on vascular endothelial cells was investigated. Factor Xa stimulated a 5- to 10-fold increased release of nitric oxide (NO) in a dose-dependent reaction (0.1-2.5 \u03bc g/ml) unaffected by the thrombin inhibitor hirudin but abolished by active site inhibitors, tick anticoagulant peptide, or Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethyl ketone. In contrast, the homologous clotting protease factor IXa or another endothelial cell ligand, fibrinogen, was ineffective. A factor Xa inter-epidermal growth factor synthetic peptide L83FTRKL88(G) blocking ligand binding to effector cell protease receptor-1 inhibited NO release by factor Xa in a dose-dependent manner, whereas a control scrambled peptide KFTGRLL was ineffective. Catalytically active factor Xa induced hypotension in rats and vasorelaxation in the isolated rat mesentery, which was blocked by the NO synthase inhibitor L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME) but not by D-NAME. Factor Xa/NO signaling also produced a dose-dependent endothelial cell release of interleukin 6 (range 0.55-3.1 ng/ml) in a reaction inhibited by L-NAME and by the inter-epidermal growth factor peptide Leu83-Leu88 but unaffected by hirudin. Maximal induction of interleukin 6 mRNA required a brief, 30-min stimulation with factor Xa, unaffected by subsequent addition of tissue factor pathway inhibitor. These data suggest that factor Xa-induced NO release modulates endothelial cell-dependent vasorelaxation and cytokine gene expression. This pathway requiring factor Xa binding to effector cell protease receptor-1 and a secondary step of ligand-dependent proteolysis may preserve an anti-thrombotic phenotype of endothelium but also trigger acute phase responses during activation of coagulation in vivo.\n      </p>", "Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins act as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) toward the \u03b1 subunits of heterotrimeric, signal-transducing G proteins. RGS11 contains a G protein \u03b3 subunit-like (GGL) domain between its Dishevelled/Egl-10/Pleckstrin and RGS domains. GGL domains are also found in RGS6, RGS7, RGS9, and the Caenorhabditis elegans protein EGL-10. Coexpression of RGS11 with different G\u03b2 subunits reveals specific interaction between RGS11 and G\u03b2 5. The expression of mRNA for RGS11 and G\u03b2 5 in human tissues overlaps. The G\u03b2 5/RGS11 heterodimer acts as a GAP on G\u03b1 o, apparently selectively. RGS proteins that contain GGL domains appear to act as GAPs for G\u03b1 proteins and form complexes with specific G\u03b2 subunits, adding to the combinatorial complexity of G protein-mediated signaling pathways.\n      </p>", "Cardiac myocytes have been shown to express constitutively endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) (nitric oxide synthase 3), the activation of which has been implicated in the regulation of myocyte L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channel current (ICa-L) and myocyte contractile responsiveness to parasympathetic nervous system signaling, although this implication remains controversial. Therefore, we examined the effect of the muscarinic cholinergic agonist carbachol (CCh) on ICa-L and contractile amplitude in isoproterenol (ISO)-prestimulated ventricular myocytes isolated from adult mice, designated eNOSnull mice, with targeted disruption of the eNOS gene. Although both eNOSnull and wild-type (WT) ventricular myocytes exhibited similar increases in ICa-L in response to ISO, there was no measurable suppression of ICa-L by CCh in cells from eNOSnull mice, in contrast to cells from WT mice. These results were reflected in the absence of an effect of CCh on the positive inotropic effect of ISO in eNOSnull myocytes. Also, unlike myocytes from WT animals, eNOSnull myocytes failed to exhibit an increase in cGMP content in response to CCh. Nevertheless, the pharmacologic nitric oxide donors 3-morpholino-sydnonimine and S-nitroso-acetyl-cystein increased cGMP generation and suppressed ISO-augmented ICa-L in eNOSnull cells, suggesting that the signal transduction pathway(s) downstream of eNOS remained intact. Of importance, activation of the acetylcholine-activated K+ channel by CCh was unaffected in atrial and ventricular eNOSnull myocytes. These results confirm the obligatory role of eNOS in coupling muscarinic receptor activation to cGMP-dependent control of ICa-L in cardiac myocytes.\n      </p>", "Prostaglandin E2 receptors (EP) were detected by radioligand binding in nuclear fractions isolated from porcine brain and myometrium. Intracellular localization by immunocytofluorescence revealed perinuclear localization of EPs in porcine cerebral microvascular endothelial cells. Nuclear association of EP1 was also found in fibroblast Swiss 3T3 cells stably overexpressing EP1 and in human embryonic kidney 293 (Epstein-Barr virus-encoded nuclear antigen) cells expressing EP1 fused to green fluorescent protein. High-resolution immunostaining of EP1 revealed their presence in the nuclear envelope of isolated (cultured) endothelial cells and in situ in brain (cortex) endothelial cells and neurons. Stimulation of these nuclear receptors modulate nuclear calcium and gene transcription.\n      </p>", "We have previously reported the selective amplification of several rat striatal cDNA sequences that encode guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G protein)-coupled receptors. One of these sequences (R226) exhibited high sequence identity (58%) with the two previously cloned adenosine receptors. A full-length cDNA clone for R226 has been isolated from a rat brain cDNA library. The cDNA clone encodes a protein of 320 amino acids that can be organized into seven transmembrane stretches. R226 has been expressed in COS-7 and CHO cells and membranes from the transfected cells were screened with adenosine receptor radioligands. R226 could bind the nonselective adenosine agonist tritiated N-ethyladenosine 5'-uronic acid ([3H]NECA) and A1-selective agonist radioiodinated N6-2-(4-amino-3-iodophenyl)-ethyladenosine ([125I]APNEA) but not A1-selective antagonists tritiated 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine ([3H]DPCPX) and 8-{4-[({[(2-aminoethyl)amino]carbonyl}methyl)oxy]-phenyl}-1,3- dipropylxanthine ([3H]XAC) or the A2-selective agonist ligands tritiated 2-[4-(2-carboxyethyl)phenyl]ethylamino 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine ([3H]CGS21680) and radioiodinated 2-[4-({2-[ (4- aminophenyl)methylcarbonylamino]ethylaminocarbonyl}ethyl) phenyl]ethylamino 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine. Extensive characterization with [125I]APNEA showed that R226 binds [125I]APNEA with high affinity (Kd = 15.5 \u00b1 2.4 nM) and the specific [125I]APNEA binding could be inhibited by adenosine ligands with a potency order of (R)-N6-phenyl-2-propyladenosine (R-PIA) = NECA &gt; S-PIA &gt; adenosine &gt; ATP = ADP but not by antagonists XAC, sobutylmethylxanthine, and DPCPX. In R226 stably transfected CHO cells, adenosine agonists R-PIA, NECA, and CGS21680 inhibited by 40-50% the forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation through a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein with an EC50 of 18 \u00b1 5.6 nM, 23 \u00b1 3.5 nM, and 144 \u00b1 34 nM, respectively. Based on these observations we conclude that R226 encodes an adenosine receptor with non-A1 and non-A2 specificity, and we thus name it the A3 adenosine receptor. mRNA analyses revealed that the highest expression of R226 was in the testis and low-level mRNAs were also found in the lung, kidneys, heart, and some parts of the central nervous system such as cortex, striatum, and olfactory bulb. The high-expression level of the A3 receptor in the testis suggests a possible role for adenosine in reproduction.\n      </p>", "Amide derivatives of fatty acids were recently isolated from cerebrospinal fluid of sleep-deprived animals and found to induce sleep in rats. To determine which brain receptors might be sensitive to these novel neuromodulators, we tested them on a range of receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes. cis-9,10-Octadecenamide (ODA) markedly potentiated the action of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) on 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; and 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2C&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, but this action was not shared by related compounds such as oleic acid and trans-9,10-octacenamide. ODA was active at concentrations as low as 1 nM. The saturated analog, octadecanamide, inhibited rather than potentiated 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2C&lt;/sub&gt; responses. ODA had either no effect or only weak effects on other receptors, including muscarinic cholinergic, metabotropic glutamate, GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, N-methyl-D-asparate, or \u03b1 -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxozolepropionic acid receptors. Modulation of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors by ODA and related lipids may represent a novel mechanism for regulation of receptors that activate G proteins and thereby play a role in alertness, sleep, and mood as well as disturbances of these states.\n      </p>", "The effects of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) and three of its intracellular metabolites, azido- thymidine mono-, di-, and triphosphates, on the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 integrase have been determined. AZT mono-, di-, and triphosphate have an IC50 for integration between 110 and 150 \u03bcM, whereas AZT does not inhibit the integrase. The inhibition by AZT monophosphate can be partially reversed by coincubation with either thymidine monophosphate or 2',3'-dideoxythymidine monophosphate, suggesting that either of these monophosphates can bind to the integrase but that the azido group at the 3' position could be responsible for the inhibition. Integrase inhibition is associated with reduced enzyme-DNA binding but does not appear to be competitive with respect to the DNA substrate. Inhibition of an integrase deletion mutant containing only amino acids 50-212 suggests that these nucleotides bind in the catalytic core. Concentrations up to 1 mM AZT monophosphate can accumulate in vivo, indicating that integrase inhibition may contribute to the antiviral effects of AZT. The increasing incidence of AZT-resistant virus strains may, therefore, be associated with mutations not only in the reverse transcriptase but also in the human immunodeficiency virus integrase. Finally, these observations suggest that additional strategies for antiviral drug development could be based upon nucleotide analogs as inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus integrase.\n      </p>", "There is controversy as to the molecular nature of volatile anesthetic target sites. One proposal is that volatile anesthetics bind directly to hydrophobic binding sites on certain sensitive target proteins. Consistent with this hypothesis, we have previously shown that a fluorinated volatile anesthetic, isoflurane, binds saturably [Kd (dissociation constant) = 1.4 \u00b1 0.2 mM, Bmax = 4.2 \u00b1 0.3 sites] to fatty acid-displaceable domains on serum albumin. In the current study, we used 19F-NMR T2 relaxation to examine whether other volatile anesthetics bind to the same sites on albumin and, if so, whether they vary in their affinity for these sites. We show that three other fluorinated volatile anesthetics bind with varying affinity to fatty acid-displaceable domains on serum albumin: halothane, Kd = 1.3 \u00b1 0.2 mM; methoxyflurane, Kd = 2.6 \u00b1 0.3 mM; and sevoflurane, Kd = 4.5 \u00b1 0.6 mM. These three anesthetics inhibit isoflurane binding in a competitive manner: halothane, Ki (inhibition constant) = 1.3 \u00b1 0.2 mM; methoxyflurane, Ki = 2.5 \u00b1 0.4 mM; and sevoflurane, Ki = 5.4 \u00b1 0.7 mM-similar to each anesthetic's respective Kd of binding to fatty acid displaceable sites. These results illustrate that a variety of volatile anesthetics can compete for binding to specific sites on a protein.\n      </p>", "Extracellular ATP activates cell-surface metabotropic and ionotropic nucleotide (P2) receptors in vascular, neural, connective, and immune tissues. These P2 receptors mediate a wealth of physiological processes, including nitric oxide-dependent vasodilation of vascular smooth muscle and fast excitatory neurotransmission in sensory afferents. Although ATP is now recognized as a signaling molecule, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying its actions have been difficult to study due to the absence of selective P2 receptor antagonists and cloned receptor genes. Nonetheless, five mammalian P2 receptor subtypes have been tentatively assigned based solely on agonist specificity and signaling properties. Here we report the cloning of a mouse cDNA encoding a P2 receptor that shares striking homology with several G protein-coupled peptide receptors. When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, the cloned receptor resembles a metabotropic P2U receptor; activation by either ATP or UTP elicits the mobilization of intracellular calcium. mRNA encoding the P2U purinergic receptor is found in neural and nonneural tissues.\n      </p>", "The most effective therapy of human prolactinomas is represented by dopamine D-2 receptor agonists; there is, however, a population of nonresponder patients who require surgical intervention. In the present study, we report that prolactinomas totally resistant to pharmacological therapy have a high potential of both growing in soft agar and forming tumors in nude mice and lack D-2 receptors for dopamine. These tumors express the receptors for nerve growth factor (NGF) and are sensitive to its differentiating activity. After exposure to NGF for 4 days, prolactinoma cells decreased their proliferation rate, lost their capability to form colonies in soft agar, lost their tumorigenic activity in nude mice, and reexpressed the lactotroph-specific D-2 receptor protein inhibiting prolactin release. These effects were permanent after NGF withdrawal and were reproducible in vivo in nude mice transplanted with the tumors. NGF in fact remarkably and lastingly depressed tumor growth and induced expression of D-2 receptors when injected intravenously once a day for 5 days into prolactinoma-bearing nude mice. These data suggest that NGF may induce a long-lasting switch of gene expression in human prolactinomas, modifying their transforming phenotype and reverting them to more differentiated, less malignant, dopamine-sensitive lactotroph-like cells. The possibility thus arises that short-term treatment with NGF may restore the refractory patients to conventional pharmacological therapy with D-2 agonists.\n      </p>", "Several regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins contain a G protein \u03b3 -subunit-like (GGL) domain, which, as we have shown, binds to G&lt;sub&gt;\u03b2 5&lt;/sub&gt; subunits. Here, we extend our original findings by describing another GGL-domain-containing RGS, human RGS6. When RGS6 is coexpressed with different G&lt;sub&gt;\u03b2&lt;/sub&gt; subunits, only RGS6 and G&lt;sub&gt;\u03b2 5&lt;/sub&gt; interact. The expression of mRNA for RGS6 and G&lt;sub&gt;\u03b2 5&lt;/sub&gt; in human tissues overlaps. Predictions of \u03b1 -helical and coiled-coil character within GGL domains, coupled with measurements of G&lt;sub&gt;\u03b2&lt;/sub&gt; binding by GGL domain mutants, support the contention that G&lt;sub&gt;\u03b3&lt;/sub&gt;-like regions within RGS proteins interact with G&lt;sub&gt;\u03b2 5&lt;/sub&gt; subunits in a fashion comparable to conventional G&lt;sub&gt;\u03b2&lt;/sub&gt;/G&lt;sub&gt;\u03b3&lt;/sub&gt; pairings. Mutation of the highly conserved Phe-61 residue of G&lt;sub&gt;\u03b3 2&lt;/sub&gt; to tryptophan, the residue present in all GGL domains, increases the stability of the G&lt;sub&gt;\u03b2 3&lt;/sub&gt;/G&lt;sub&gt;\u03b3 2&lt;/sub&gt; heterodimer, highlighting the importance of this residue to GGL/G&lt;sub&gt;\u03b2 5&lt;/sub&gt; association.\n      </p>", "The biological actions of anandamide (arachidonylethanolamide), an endogenous cannabinoid lipid, are terminated by a two-step inactivation process consisting of carrier-mediated uptake and intracellular hydrolysis. Anandamide uptake in neurons and astrocytes is mediated by a high-affinity, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-independent transporter that is selectively inhibited by N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-arachidonamide (AM404). In the present study, we examined the structural determinants governing recognition and translocation of substrates by the anandamide transporter constitutively expressed in a human astrocytoma cell line. Competition experiments with a select group of analogs suggest that substrate recognition by the transporter is favored by a polar nonionizable head group of defined stereochemical configuration containing a hydroxyl moiety at its distal end. The secondary carboxamide group interacts favorably with the transporter, but may be replaced with either a tertiary amide or an ester, suggesting that it may serve as hydrogen acceptor. Thus, 2-arachidonylglycerol, a putative endogenous cannabinoid ester, also may serve as a substrate for the transporter. Substrate recognition requires the presence of at least one cis double bond situated at the middle of the fatty acid carbon chain, indicating a preference for ligands whose hydrophobic tail can adopt a bent U-shaped conformation. On the other hand, uptake experiments with radioactively labeled substrates show that no fewer than four cis nonconjugated double bonds are required for optimal translocation across the cell membrane, suggesting that substrates are transported in a folded hairpin conformation. These results outline the general structural requisites for anandamide transport and may assist in the development of selective inhibitors with potential clinical applications.\n      </p>", "Receptors activate adenylyl cyclases through the G\u03b1 s subunit. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown in certain cell types that express adenylyl cyclase 6 (AC6), heterologous desensitization included reduction of the capability of adenylyl cyclases to be stimulated by G\u03b1 s. Here we further analyze protein kinase A (PKA) effects on adenylyl cyclases. PKA treatment of recombinant AC6 in insect cell membranes results in a selective loss of stimulation by high (&gt;10 nM) concentrations of G\u03b1 s. Similar treatment of AC1 or AC2 did not affect G\u03b1 s stimulation. Conversion of Ser-674 in AC6 to an Ala blocks PKA phosphorylation and PKA-mediated loss of G\u03b1 s stimulation. A peptide encoding the region 660-682 of AC6 blocks stimulation of AC6 and AC2 by high concentrations of G\u03b1 s. Substitution of Ser-674 to Asp in the peptide renders the peptide ineffective, indicating that the region 660-682 of AC6 is involved in regulation of signal transfer from G\u03b1 s. This region contains a conserved motif present in most adenylyl cyclases; however, the PKA phosphorylation site is unique to members of the AC6 family. These observations suggest a mechanism of how isoform selective regulatory diversity can be obtained within conserved regions involved in signal communication.\n      </p>", "Evidence suggests that cholinergic input to the hippocampus plays an important role in learning and memory and that degeneration of cholinergic terminals in the hippocampus may contribute to the memory loss associated with Alzheimer's disease. One of the more prominent effects of cholinergic agonists on hippocampal physiology is the potentiation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor currents by muscarinic agonists. Here, we employ traditional pharmacological reagents as well as m1-toxin, an m1 antagonist with unprecedented selectivity, to demonstrate that this potentiation of NMDA-receptor currents in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells is mediated by the genetically defined m1 muscarinic receptor. Furthermore, we demonstrate the colocalization of the m1 muscarinic receptor and the NR1a NMDA receptor subunit at the electron microscopic level, indicating a spatial relationship that would allow for physiological interactions between these two receptors. This work demonstrates that the m1-muscarinic receptor gene product modulates excitatory synaptic transmission, and it has important implications in the study of learning and memory as well as the design of drugs to treat neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.\n      </p>", "Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) regulate intracellular levels of cAMP and cGMP by hydrolyzing them to their corresponding 5\u2032 monophosphates. We report here the cloning and characterization of a novel cAMP-specific PDE from mouse testis. This unique phosphodiesterase contains a catalytic domain that overall shares &lt;40% sequence identity to the catalytic domain of all other known PDEs. Based on this limited homology, this new PDE clearly represents a previously unknown PDE gene family designated as PDE8. The cDNA for PDE8 is 3,678 nucleotides in length and is predicted to encode an 823 amino acid enzyme. The cDNA includes a full ORF as it contains an in-frame stop codon before the start methionine. PDE8 is specific for the hydrolysis of cAMP and has a Km of 0.15 \u03bc M. Most common PDE inhibitors are ineffective antagonists of PDE8, including the nonspecific PDE inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. Dipyridamole, however, an inhibitor that is generally considered to be relatively specific for the cGMP selective PDEs, does inhibit PDE8 with an IC50 of 4.5 \u03bc M. Tissue distribution studies of 22 different mouse tissues indicates that PDE8 has highest expression in testis, followed by eye, liver, skeletal muscle, heart, 7-day embryo, kidney, ovary, and brain in decreasing order. In situ hybridization in testis, the tissue of highest expression, shows that PDE8 is expressed in the seminiferous epithelium in a stage-specific manner. Highest levels of expression are seen in stages 7-12, with little or no expression in stages 1-6.\n      </p>", "Alcohols in the homologous series of n-alcohols increase in central nervous system depressant potency with increasing chain length until a ``cutoff'' is reached, after which further increases in molecular size no longer increase alcohol potency. A similar phenomenon has been observed in the regulation of ligand-gated ion channels by alcohols. Different ligand-gated ion channels exhibit radically different cutoff points, suggesting the existence of discrete alcohol binding pockets of variable size on these membrane proteins. The identification of amino acid residues that determine the alcohol cutoff may, therefore, provide information about the location of alcohol binding sites. Alcohol regulation of the glycine receptor is critically dependent on specific amino acid residues in transmembrane domains 2 and 3 of the \u03b1 subunit. We now demonstrate that these residues in the glycine \u03b1 1 and the \u03b3 -aminobutyric acid \u03c1 1 receptors also control alcohol cutoff. By mutation of Ser-267 to Gln, it was possible to decrease the cutoff in the glycine \u03b1 1 receptor, whereas mutation of Ile-307 and/or Trp-328 in the \u03b3 -aminobutyric acid \u03c1 1 receptor to smaller residues increased the cutoff. These results support the existence of alcohol binding pockets in these membrane proteins and suggest that the amino acid residues present at these positions can control the size of the alcohol binding cavity.\n      </p>", "Guanylin and uroguanylin are intestinal peptides that stimulate chloride secretion by activating a common set of receptor--guanylate cyclase signaling molecules located on the mucosal surface of enterocytes. High mucosal acidity, similar to the pH occurring within the fluid microclimate domain at the mucosal surface of the intestine, markedly enhances the cGMP accumulation responses of T84 human intestinal cells to uroguanylin. In contrast, a mucosal acidity of pH 5.0 renders guanylin essentially inactive. T84 cells were used as a model epithelium to further explore the concept that mucosal acidity imposes agonist selectivity for activation of the intestinal receptors for uroguanylin and guanylin, thus providing a rational for the evolution of these related peptides. At an acidic mucosal pH of 5.0, uroguanylin is 100-fold more potent than guanylin, but at an alkaline pH of 8.0 guanylin is more potent than uroguanylin in stimulating intracellular cGMP accumulation and transepithelial chloride secretion. The relative affinities of uroguanylin and guanylin for binding to receptors on the mucosal surface of T84 cells is influenced dramatically by mucosal acidity, which explains the strong pH dependency of the cGMP and chloride secretion responses to these peptides. The guanylin-binding affinities for peptide-receptor interaction were reduced by 100-fold at pH 5 versus pH 8, whereas the affinities of uroguanylin for these receptors were increased 10-fold by acidic pH conditions. Deletion of the N-terminal acidic amino acids in uroguanylin demonstrated that these residues are responsible for the increase in binding affinities that are observed for uroguanylin at acidic pH. We conclude that guanylin and uroguanylin evolved distinctly different structures, which enables both peptides to regulate, in a pH-dependent fashion, the activity of receptors that control intestinal salt and water transport via cGMP.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

In the present study we sought to determine whether mesolimbic dopamine neurons are involved in the neurobiologic mechanisms underlying withdrawal from chronic cannabinoid exposure. Rats were treated chronically with the major psychoactive ingredient of hashish and marijuana, \u0394 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u0394 9-THC). Administration of the cannabinoid antagonist SR 141716A precipitated an intense behavioral withdrawal syndrome, whereas abrupt \u0394 9-THC suspension failed to produce overt signs of abstinence. In contrast, both groups showed a reduction in dopamine cells activity as indicated by extracellular single unit recordings from antidromically identified mesoaccumbens dopamine neurons. The administration of \u0394 9-THC to spontaneously withdrawn rats restored neuronal activity. Conversely, SR 141716A produced a further decrease of spontaneous activity in cannabinoid-treated although it was ineffective in control rats. These data indicate that withdrawal from chronic cannabinoid administration is associated with reduced dopaminergic transmission in the limbic system, similar to that observed with other addictive drugs; these changes in neuronal plasticity may play a role in drug craving and relapse into drug addiction.\n      </p>", "A frog used for \"hunting magic\" by several groups of Panoan-speaking Indians in the borderline between Brazil and Peru is identified as Phyllomedusa bicolor. This frog's skin secretion, which the Indians introduce into the body through fresh burns, is rich in peptides. These include vasoactive peptides, opioid peptides, and a peptide that we have named adenoregulin, with the sequence GLWSKIKEVGKEAAKAAAKAAGKAALGAVSEAV as determined from mass spectrometry and Edman degradation. The natural peptide may contain a D amino acid residue, since it is not identical in chromatographic properties to the synthetic peptide. Adenoregulin enhances binding of agonists to A1 adenosine receptors; it is accompanied in the skin secretion by peptides that inhibit binding. The vasoactive peptide sauvagine, the opioid peptides, and adenoregulin and related peptides affect behavior in mice and presumably contribute to the behavioral sequelae observed in humans.\n      </p>", "The temperature dependence of the dissociation constant for the interaction of an opioid \u03b4 selective ligand and its receptor was evaluated in three tissues. The change in free energy of this interaction was similar in mouse brain, mouse spinal cord, and NG 108-15 mouse neuroblastoma-rat glioma hybrid cells (\u0394Go' = -13.44, -13.34, and -13.66 kcal\u00b7mol-1, respectively). However, the reaction was endothermic and occurred with an increase in entropy in mouse brain and NG 108-15 cells, but it was exothermic and occurred with a negligible change in entropy in mouse spinal cord. These data are consistent with the existence of multiple subtypes of opioid \u03b4 receptor, and they further suggest that the opioid \u03b4 receptor recently cloned from the NG 108-15 cell line is of the brain subtype. Subtypes of opioid \u03b4 receptors may mediate analgesia, but not side-effects, of opiates and thus could be targets for future drug design.\n      </p>", "Acyl glucuronide metabolites of bilirubin and many drugs can react with serum albumin in vivo to form covalent adducts. Such adducts may be responsible for some toxic effects of carboxylic nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents. The mechanism of formation of the adducts and their chemical structures are unknown. In this paper we describe the use of tandem mass spectrometry to locate binding sites and elucidate the binding mechanism involved in the formation of covalent adducts from tolmetin glucuronide and albumin in vitro. Human serum albumin and excess tolmetin glucuronide were coincubated in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride to trap imine intermediates. The total protein product was reduced, carboxymethylated, and digested with trypsin. Six tolmetin-containing peptides (indicated by absorbance at 313 nm) were isolated by high-pressure liquid chromatography and analyzed by liquid secondary-ion mass spectrometry and collision-induced dissociation, using a four-sector tandem mass spectrometer. All six peptides contained tolmetin linked covalently via a glucuronic acid to protein lysine groups. Major attachment sites on the protein were Lys-195, -199, and -525; minor sites were identified as Lys-137, -351, and -541. Our results show unambiguously that the glucuronic acid moiety of acyl glucuronides can be retained within the structure when these reactive metabolites bind covalently to proteins, and they suggest that acyl migration followed by Schiff base (imine) formation is a credible mechanism for the generation of covalent adducts in vivo.\n      </p>", "Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy with cupping of the optic disk, degeneration of retinal ganglion cells, and characteristic visual field loss. Because elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor for progression of glaucoma, treatment has been based on lowering IOP. We previously demonstrated inducible nitric-oxide synthase (NOS-2) in the optic nerve heads from human glaucomatous eyes and from rat eyes with chronic, moderately elevated IOP. Using this rat model of unilateral glaucoma, we treated a group of animals for 6 months with aminoguanidine, a relatively specific inhibitor of NOS-2, and compared them with an untreated group. At 6 months, untreated animals had pallor and cupping of the optic disks in the eyes with elevated IOP. Eyes of aminoguanidine-treated animals with similar elevations of IOP appeared normal. We quantitated retinal ganglion cell loss by retrograde labeling with Fluoro-Gold. When compared with their contralateral control eyes with normal IOP, eyes with elevated IOP in the untreated group lost 36% of their retinal ganglion cells; the eyes with similarly elevated IOP in the aminoguanidine-treated group lost less than 10% of their retinal ganglion cells. Pharmacological neuroprotection by inhibition of NOS-2 may prove useful for the treatment of patients with glaucoma.\n      </p>", "Mice infected with the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei brucei and treated subcuratively with the trypanocidal drug diminazene aceturate develop an acute inflammatory meningoencephalitis with associated astrocytic proliferation. This reaction is very similar to that seen in the fatal posttreatment reactive encephalopathies that can occur in human African trypanosomiasis. The 11-amino acid neuropeptide substance P (SP) has recently been identified as a mediator in many inflammatory responses, and the development of potent, highly specific, nonpeptide SP antagonists has provided a new opportunity to investigate the possible involvement of SP in a variety of pathological conditions. We therefore postulated that SP may play a role in the development of the posttreatment inflammatory encephalopathy found in this experimental mouse model of African trypanosomiasis. In the present study RP-67,580, a SP antagonist that binds specifically to NK-1 receptors, was given intraperitoneally at a dose of 2 mg/kg twice daily to mice in which a severe meningoencephalitis had been produced. A significant reduction in both the severity of the inflammatory response (P = 0.0001) as well as the degree of astrocyte activation (P &lt; 0.001) was found in the brains of these animals as compared with control mice that had not received RP-67,580. An inactive enantiomer of this SP antagonist, RP-68,651, had no effect on the central nervous system inflammatory reaction. We conclude from these findings that the neuropeptide SP plays a key role in the development of the severe central nervous system inflammatory response associated with African trypanosomiasis.\n      </p>", "We have studied the in vivo signaling mechanisms involved in nociceptin/orphanin FQ (Noci)-induced pain responses by using a flexor-reflex paradigm. Noci was 10,000 times more potent than substance P (SP) in eliciting flexor responses after intraplantar injection into the hind limb of mice, but the action of Noci seems to be mediated by SP. Mice pretreated with an NK1 tachykinin receptor antagonist or capsaicin, or mice with a targeted disruption of the tachykinin 1 gene no longer respond to Noci. The action of Noci appears to be mediated by the Noci receptor, a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein-coupled receptor that stimulates inositol trisphosphate receptor and Ca2+ influx. These findings suggest that Noci indirectly stimulates nerve endings of nociceptive primary afferent neurons through a local SP release.\n      </p>", "Although activation of one seven-transmembrane receptor can influence the response of a separate seven-transmembrane receptor, e.g., the phenomenon of synergism, the underlying mechanism(s) for this signaling process is unclear. The present study investigated communication between two receptors that exhibit classical synergism, e.g., human platelet thrombin and thromboxane A2 receptors. Activation of thrombin receptors caused an increase in ligand affinity of thromboxane A2 receptors. This effect (i) was shown to be specific, since a similar increase in ligand affinity was not caused by ADP or A23187; (ii) did not require cytosolic components, e.g., kinases, proteases, phosphatases, etc., because it occurred in isolated platelet membranes; (iii) was G protein-mediated because it was blocked by an G\u03b1 q C terminus antibody; and (iv) was associated with a net increase in G\u03b1 q coupling to thromboxane A2 receptors. Collectively, these data provide evidence that seven-transmembrane receptors that share a common G\u03b1 subunit can communicate with each other via a redistribution of their G proteins. Thus, activation of thrombin receptors increases G\u03b1 q association with thromboxane A2 receptors thereby shifting them to a higher affinity state. This signaling phenomenon, which modulates receptor-ligand affinity, may serve as a molecular mechanism for cellular adaptive processes such as synergism.\n      </p>", "Inflamed tissue is often characterized by the production of NO and superoxide. These radicals react at diffusion-limited rates to form the powerful oxidant peroxynitrite (PN). When protonated, PN decomposes into either nitrate or reactive intermediates capable of mediating tissue damage by oxidation of protein, lipid, and nucleic acid. We recently have identified porphyrin derivatives capable of catalyzing an increase in nitrate formation with a concomitant decrease in the HO\u00b7 -like and NO2 \u00b7-like reactivity of PN. Here, we present evidence for the efficacy of these PN decomposition catalysts both in vitro and in vivo. Cells in culture were protected from exogenously added PN by the catalyst 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(2,4,6-trimethyl-3,5-disulfonatophenyl)-porphyrinato iron (III), whereas free iron and the structurally related compound without iron 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(2,4,6-trimethyl-3,5-disulfonatophenyl)porphyrin did not protect. Cytoprotection correlated well with a reduction in the nitrotyrosine content of released cytosolic proteins, a biochemical marker for PN formation. Carrageenan-induced paw edema is a model of acute inflammation in which PN may play a major role. When tested in this system, both 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(2,4,6-trimethyl-3,5-disulfonatophenyl)porphyrinato iron (III) and 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(N-methyl-4\u2032-pyridyl) porphyrinato iron (III) caused a dose-dependent reduction in swelling and lactate dehydrogenase release as well as a detectable shift to nitrate formation in paw tissue. In addition, the catalysts did not elevate mean arterial pressure, suggesting a lack of interaction with NO. Taken together, our data provide compelling evidence supporting the therapeutic value of manipulating PN pharmacologically. Thus, PN decomposition catalysts may represent a unique class of antiinflammatory agents.\n      </p>", "The effects of expression of mutant (Q227L)-activated G\u03b1 s and elevation of cAMP on mitogen-activating protein kinase (MAPK) activity and the transformed phenotype were studied in the MCF-7 human mammary epithelial cell line. Elevation of cAMP partially inhibited the epidermal growth factor-stimulated DNA synthesis and the intrinsic MAPK (ERK-1 and ERK-2) of serum-starved MCF-7 cells. Addition of 8Br-cAMP or expression of mutant (Q227L)-activated G\u03b1 s in MCF-7 cells blocked the ability of these cells to grow in an anchorage-independent manner, as assessed by colony formation in soft agar. 8Br-cAMP in the culture medium also blocked estrogen stimulation of MCF-7 cell proliferation in vitro. MCF-7 cells expressing Q227L-G\u03b1 s grew very slowly in vitro, and when these cells were injected s.c. into athymic mice implanted with estrogen pellets, the frequency of tumor formation was reduced greatly and the sizes of the tumors formed were much smaller than those in mice injected with MCF-7 cells that had been transfected with the empty vector. These results indicate that the intracellular levels of cAMP in transformed mammary epithelial cells can be a crucial factor in determining the expression of the transformed phenotype. Interactions between the Gs/adenylyl cyclase and MAPK-1,2 signaling pathways could be one mechanism by which expression of the transformed phenotype in mammary epithelial cells are regulated.\n      </p>", "DNA topoisomerase I (top1) is a ubiquitous nuclear enzyme. It is specifically inhibited by camptothecin, a natural product derived from the bark of the tree Camptotheca acuminata. Camptothecin and several of its derivatives are presently in clinical trial and exhibit remarkable anticancer activity. The present study is a further investigation of the molecular interactions between the drug and the enzyme-DNA complex. We utilized an alkylating camptothecin derivative, 7-chloromethyl-10,11-methylenedioxycamptothecin (7-ClMe-MDO-CPT), and compared its activity against calf thymus top1 in a DNA oligonucleotide containing a single top1 cleavage site with the activity of its nonalkylating analog, 7-ethyl-10,11-methylenedioxycamptothecin (7-Et-MDO-CPT). In the presence of top1, 7-ClMe-MDO-CPT produced a DNA fragment that migrated more slowly than the top1-cleaved DNA fragment observed with 7-Et-MDO-CPT. Top1 was unable to religate this fragment in the presence of high NaCl concentration or proteinase K at 50\u26acC. This fragment was resistant to piperidine treatment and was also formed with an oligonucleotide containing a 7-deazaguanine at the 5' terminus of the top1-cleaved DNA (base +1). It was however cleaved by formic acid treatment followed by piperidine. These observations are consistent with alkylation of the +1 base (adenine or guanine) by 7-ClMe-MDO-CPT in the presence of top1 covalent complexes and provide direct evidence that camptothecins inhibit top1 by binding at the enzyme-DNA interface.\n      </p>", "Gold(I) salts and selenite, which have diverse therapeutic and biological effects, are noted for their reactivity with thiols. Since the binding of Jun-Jun and Jun-Fos dimers to the AP-1 DNA binding site is regulated in vitro by a redox process involving conserved cysteine residues, we hypothesized that some of the biological actions of gold and selenium are mediated via these residues. In electrophoretic mobility-shift analyses, AP-1 DNA binding was inhibited by gold(I) thiolates and selenite, with 50% inhibition occurring at approximately 5 \u03bcM and 1 \u03bcM, respectively. Thiomalic acid had no effect in the absence of gold(I), and other metal ions inhibited at higher concentrations, in a rank order correlating with their thiol binding affinities. Cysteine-to-serine mutants demonstrated that these effects of gold(I) and selenite require Cys272 and Cys154 in the DNA-binding domains of Jun and Fos, respectively. Gold(I) thiolates and selenite did not inhibit nonspecific protein binding to the AP-1 site and were at least an order of magnitude less potent as inhibitors of sequence-specific binding to the AP-2, TFIID, or NF1 sites compared with the AP-1 site. In addition, 10 \u03bcM gold(I) or 10 \u03bcM selenite inhibited expression of an AP-1-dependent reporter gene, but not an AP-2-dependent reporter gene. These data suggest a mechanism regulating transcription factor activity by inorganic ions which may contribute to the known antiarthritic action of gold and cancer chemoprevention by selenium.\n      </p>", "In inflammatory states, nitric oxide (\u00b7NO) may be synthesized from precursor L-arginine via inducible \u00b7NO synthase (iNOS) in large amounts for prolonged periods of time. When \u00b7NO acts as an effector molecule under these conditions, it may be toxic to cells by inhibition of iron-containing enzymes or initiation of DNA single-strand breaks. In contrast to molecular targets of \u00b7NO, considerably less is known regarding mechanisms by which cells become resistant to \u00b7NO. Metallothionein (MT), the major protein thiol induced in cells exposed to cytokines and bacterial products, is capable of forming iron-dinitrosyl thiolates in vitro. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that overexpression of MT reduces the sensitivity of NIH 3T3 cells to the \u00b7NO donor, S-nitrosoacetylpenicillamine (SNAP), and to \u00b7NO released from cells (NIH 3T3-DFG-iNOS) after infection with a retroviral vector expressing human iNOS gene. There was a 4-fold increase in MT in cells transfected with the mouse MT-I gene (NIH 3T3/MT) compared to cells transfected with the promoter-free inverted gene (NIH 3T3/TM). NIH 3T3/MT cells were more resistant than NIH 3T3/TM cells to the cytotoxic effects of SNAP (0.1-1.0 mM) or \u00b7NO released from NIH 3T3-DFG-iNOS cells. A brief (1 h) exposure to 10 mM SNAP caused DNA single-strand breaks that were 9-fold greater in NIH 3T3/TM compared to NIH 3T3/MT cells. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy of NIH 3T3 cells revealed a greater peak at g = 2.04 (e.g., iron-dinitrosyl complex) in NIH 3T3/MT than NIH 3T3/TM cells. These data are consistent with a role for cytoplasmic MT in interacting with \u00b7NO and reducing \u00b7NO-induced cyto- and nuclear toxicity.\n      </p>", "Nitric oxide (NO) produces rapid osteoclast detachment and contraction in vitro, and this effect is accompanied by a profound inhibition of bone resorption. Work by others has confirmed these findings in vivo: inhibition of NO synthase [NOS; L-arginine, NADPH: oxygen oxidoreductase (NO-forming), EC 1.14.13.39] in normal rats is followed by increased bone resorption reflected by a marked loss in bone mineral density. In our present study, immunocytochemistry and Northern blotting show the presence of the constitutive calcium-sensitive NOS isoform (cNOS) in normal rat osteoclasts and in the human preosteoclast cell line (FLG 29.1). The inducible NOS isoform (iNOS) was also clearly demonstrable in the rat cells especially after treatment with \u03b3 interferon (IFN-\u03b3) and bacterial wall products [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)], while a basal level of transcript was detected in the untreated human preosteoclast line. However NADPH-diaphorase activity was intense only in neonatal rat osteoclasts attached to bone, perhaps reflecting either enhancement of cNOS activity by calcium or increased amounts of the inducible isoform in activated osteoclasts in situ compared with isolated neonatal rat osteoclasts. These actively resorb devitalized bone but the untreated cells contain relatively low levels of NOS; they are extremely sensitive to inhibition by NO. The iNOS inhibitor aminoguanidine markedly enhances in vitro resorption by activated NOS-rich chick osteoclasts and by normal rat osteoclasts treated with LPS or IFN-\u03b3. In contrast, the nonselective NOS inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine inhibits resorption by untreated neonatal rat osteoclasts. Thus, osteoclast function may require intermittent calcium-stimulated increases in NO production by cNOS against a basal inhibitory background activity of the iNOS isoform. However, bone resorption depends on precursor replication and on the activity of the mature cells, and we found that the NO donor 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1) (50 \u03bc M) profoundly depressed replication in the human preosteoclast line. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that NO maintains a central control of bone resorption in both avian and mammalian species by exerting a powerful tonic restraint of osteoclast numbers and activity. The presence of NOS in human cells implies a similar function in man and that conventional views of calcium homoeostasis and skeletal metabolism will need substantial revision. Since NO also influences behavior of the osteoblast, the bone-forming cell, in vitro, a similar effect in vivo might imply a general influence on bone remodeling.\n      </p>", "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is one of the most abundant peptide transmitters in the mammalian brain. In the periphery it is costored and coreleased with norepinephrine from sympathetic nerve terminals. However, the physiological functions of this peptide remain unclear because of the absence of specific high-affinity receptor antagonists. Three potent NPY receptor antagonists were synthesized and tested for their biological activity in in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo functional assays. We describe here the effects of these antagonists inhibiting specific radiolabeled NPY binding at Y1 and Y2 receptors and antagonizing the effects of NPY in human erythroleukmia cell intracellular calcium mobilization, perfusion pressure in the isolated rat kidney, and mean arterial blood pressure in anesthetized rats.\n      </p>", "Mutational analysis based on the pharmacological differences between mammalian and amphibian angiotensin II receptors (AT receptors) previously identified 7 aa residues located in transmembrane domains (TMs) III (Val-108), IV (Ala-163), V (Pro-192, Thr-198), VI (Ser-252), and VII (Leu-300, Phe-301) of the rat AT receptor type 1b (rAT1b receptor) that significantly influenced binding of the nonpeptide antagonist Losartan. Further studies have shown that an additional 6 residues in the rAT1b receptor TMs II (Ala-73), III (Ser-109, Ala-114, Ser-115), VI (Phe-248), and VII (Asn-295) are important in Losartan binding. The 13 residues required for Losartan binding in the mammalian receptor were exchanged for the corresponding amino acids in the Xenopus AT receptor type a (xATa receptor) to generate a mutant amphibian receptor that bound Losartan with the same affinity as the rAT1b receptor (Losartan IC50 values: rAT1b, 2.2 \u00b1 0.2 nM: xATa, &gt;50 \u03bcM; mutant, 2.0 \u00b1 0.1 nM). To our knowledge, this is the first report of a gain-of-function mutant in which the residues crucial to formation of a ligand binding site in a mammalian peptide hormone receptor were transferred to a previously unresponsive receptor by site-directed mutagenesis. Ala substitutions and comparison of mammalian and amphibian combinatorial mutants indicated that TM III in the rAT1b receptor plays a key role in Losartan binding. Identification of residues involved in nonpeptide ligand binding will facilitate studies aimed at elucidating the chemical basis for ligand recognition in the AT receptor and peptide hormone receptors in general.\n      </p>", "Predictive methods, physicochemical measurements, and structure activity relationship studies suggest that corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF; corticoliberin), its family members, and competitive antagonists (resulting from N-terminal deletions) usually assume an \u03b1-helical conformation when interacting with the CRF receptor(s). To test this hypothesis further, we have scanned the whole sequence of the CRF antagonist [D-Phe12,Nle21,38]/hCRF-(12-41) (r/hCRF, rat/human CRF; Nle, norleucine) with an i-(i + 3) bridge consisting of the Glu-Xaa-Xaa-Lys scaffold. We have found astressin cyclo(30-33)D-Phe12, Nle21,38,Glu30,Lys33]/hCRF(12-41) to be approximately 30 times more potent than [D-Phe12,Nle21,38]r/hCRF-(12-41), our present standard, and 300 times more potent than the corresponding linear analog in an in vitro pituitary cell culture assay. Astressin has low affinity for the CRF binding protein and high affinity (Ki = 2 nM) for the cloned pituitary receptor. Radioiodinated [D-125I- Tyr12]astressin was found to be a reliable ligand for binding assays. In vivo, astressin is significantly more potent than any previously tested antagonist in reducing hypophyseal corticotropin (ACTH) secretion in stressed or adrenalectomized rats. The cyclo(30-33)[Ac-Pro4,D -Phe12,Nle21,38,Glu30,Lys33]r/hCRF-(4-41) agonist and its linear analog are nearly equipotent, while the antagonist astressin and its linear form vary greatly in their potencies. This suggests that the lactam cyclization reinstates a structural constraint in the antagonists that is normally induced by the N terminus of the agonist.\n      </p>", "The involvement of a conserved serine (Ser&lt;sup&gt;196&lt;/sup&gt; at the \u03bc -, Ser&lt;sup&gt;177&lt;/sup&gt; at the \u03b4 -, and Ser&lt;sup&gt;187&lt;/sup&gt; at the \u03ba -opioid receptor) in receptor activation is demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis. It was initially observed during our functional screening of a \u03bc /\u03b4 -opioid chimeric receptor, \u03bc \u03b4 &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, that classical opioid antagonists such as naloxone, naltrexone, naltriben, and H-Tyr-Tic[\u03c8 ,CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH]Phe-Phe-OH (TIPP\u03c8 ; Tic = 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid) could inhibit forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in CHO cells stably expressing the chimeric receptor. Antagonists also activated the G protein-coupled inward rectifying potassium channel (GIRK1) in Xenopus oocytes coexpressing the \u03bc \u03b4 2 opioid receptor and the GIRK1 channel. By sequence analysis and back mutation, it was determined that the observed antagonist activity was due to the mutation of a conserved serine to leucine in the fourth transmembrane domain (S196L). The importance of this serine was further demonstrated by analogous mutations created in the \u03bc -opioid receptor (MORS196L) and \u03b4 -opioid receptor (DORS177L), in which classical opioid antagonists could inhibit forskolinstimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in CHO cells stably expressing either MORS196L or DORS177L. Again, antagonists could activate the GIRK1 channel coexpressed with either MORS196L or DORS177L in Xenopus oocytes. These data taken together suggest a crucial role for this serine residue in opioid receptor activation.\n      </p>", "Substance P (SP) is a neuropeptide that mediates multiple physiological responses including transmission of painful stimuli and inflammation via an interaction with a receptor of known primary sequence. To identify the regions of the SP receptor, also termed the NK-1 receptor, involved in peptide recognition, we are using analogues of SP containing the photoreactive amino acid p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (Bpa). In the present study, we used radioiodinated BPa8-SP to covalently label with high efficiency the rat SP receptor expressed in a transfected mammalian cell line. To identify the amino acid residue that serves as the site of covalent attachment, a membrane preparation of labeled receptor was subjected to partial enzymatic cleavage by trypsin. A major digestion product of 22 kDa was identified. Upon reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol the mass of this product decreased to 14 kDa. The 22-kDa tryptic fragment was purified in excellent yield by preparative SDS/PAGE under nonreducing conditions. Subcleavage with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease and endoproteinase ArgC yielded fragments of 8.2 and 9.0 kDa, respectively. Upon reductive cleavage, the V8 protease fragment decreased to 3.0 kDa while the endoproteinase ArgC fragment decreased to 3.2 kDa. Taking into consideration enzyme specificity, molecular size, determination of the presence or absence of N-glycosylation sites, and recognition by antibodies to specific sequences of the SP receptor, the V8 protease fragment is Thr-173 to Glu-183, while the endoproteinase ArgC fragment is Val-178 to Arg-190. These two fragments share the common sequence Val-Val-Cys-Met-Ile-Glu (residues 178-183). The site of covalent attachment of radioiodinated BPa8-SP is thus restricted to a residue within this overlap sequence. The data presented here also establish that the cysteine residue in this sequence Cys-180, which is positioned in the middle of the second extracellular loop, participates in a disulfide bond that links the first and second extracellular loops of the receptor.\n      </p>", "A method has been devised for predicting the ability of drugs to cross the blood-brain barrier. The criteria depend on the amphiphilic properties of a drug as reflected in its surface activity. The assessment was made with various drugs that either penetrate or do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier. The surface activity of these drugs was quantified by their Gibbs adsorption isotherms in terms of three parameters: (i) the onset of surface activity, (ii) the critical micelle concentration, and (iii) the surface area requirement of the drug at the air/water interface. A calibration diagram is proposed in which the critical micelle concentration is plotted against the concentration required for the onset of surface activity. Three different regions are easily distinguished in this diagram: a region of very hydrophobic drugs which fail to enter the central nervous system because they remain adsorbed to the membrane, a central area of less hydrophobic drugs which can cross the blood-brain barrier, and a region of relatively hydrophilic drugs which do not cross the blood-brain barrier unless applied at high concentrations. This diagram can be used to predict reliably the central nervous system permeability of an unknown compound from a simple measurement of its Gibbs adsorption isotherm.\n      </p>", "We have isolated mouse \u03bc opioid receptor genomic clones (termed MOR) containing the entire amino acid coding sequence corresponding to rat MOR-1 cDNA, including additional 5' flanking sequence. The mouse MOR gene is &gt;53 kb long, and the coding sequence is divided by three introns, with exon junctions in codons 95 and 213 and between codons 386 and 387. The first intron is &gt;26 kb, the second is 0.8 kb, and the third is &gt;12 kb. Multiple transcription initiation sites were observed, with four major sites confirmed by 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends and RNase protection located between 291 and 268 bp upstream of the translation start codon. Comparison of the 5' flanking sequence with a transcription factor database revealed putative cis-acting regulatory elements for transcription factors affected by cAMP, as well as those involved in the action of gluco-and mineralocorticoids, cytokines, and immune-cell-specific factors.\n      </p>", "This study demonstrates the stable expression of a functional ionotropic glutamate receptor in a mammalian cell line of non-neuronal origin. The kainate-selective glutamate receptor GluR6 was constitutively expressed under the control of a metallothionein promoter. Clones were isolated expressing \u22483 pmol of receptor per mg of protein. Functionality of the recombinant GluR6 was demonstrated both by electrophysiology and by Ca2+ imaging. Application of kainate to the GluR6-transfected cells activated an inward current response at a holding potential of -60 mV. The kainate concentration needed to evoke 50% of the maximal response (EC50) was calculated to be 0.82 \u00b1 0.39 \u03bcM. The currentvoltage relationship was found to be almost linear, with a reversal potential of -2.5 \u00b1 4.8 mV. Application of kainate also resulted in an increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration measured by Ca2+ imaging. The pharmacological profile of [3H]kainate binding to the recombinant GluR6 resembled the high-affinity [3H]kainate binding sites in rat brain, showing high affinity for domoate (Ki = 5.1 \u00b1 3.0 nM) and kainate (Kd = 12.9 \u00b1 2.4 nM). No decrease in GluR6 expression level was observed over &gt;75 passages of the transfected cells. When domoate, a slowly desensitizing GluR6 agonist, was included in the growth medium for 3 weeks, the number of GluR6 binding sites decreased by 30%, indicating the importance of complete channel closure for stable expression.\n      </p>", "Gene expression in mammalian cells can be suppressed by oligonucleotides complementary to the target mRNA. This strategy was explored as a means of arresting translation of the prohormone precursor proopiomelanocortin (POMC), used as a model system of peptide messengers that are synthesized and released from endocrine and neuronal cells. The synthesis of the POMC-derived peptides adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and \u03b2-endorphin (\u03b2-END) was markedly reduced by an oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) complementary to a region of \u03b2-END mRNA in AtT-20 cells, which retain many of the differentiated phenotypes of corticotrophs; this treatment did not affect the steady-state levels of POMC mRNA. Antisense ODN was stable in cell culture medium for 24 h, and cellular uptake was low (\u2248 2.5% of the added ODN); however, the intracellular levels of the ODN were sufficient to form a ribonuclease-resistant duplex with complementary cellular mRNA. Addition of ODN to the cell culture did not affect the cellular levels of chromogranin A-(264-314)/pancreastatin or cell viability and proliferation, as evidenced by bromodeoxy-uridine incorporation and ornithine decarboxylase activity. Microinfusion of the antisense ODN in the rat hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, where the majority of POMC-positive brain perikarya are located, significantly reduced ACTH- and \u03b2-END-immunopositive neurons, and antisense ODN-treated rats showed substantially less of the grooming behavior usually observed in a novel environment.\n      </p>", "Peroxynitrite (ONOO-), which is formed from the reaction of nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide (O- 2), has been suggested to be responsible for some of the cytotoxic effects of these molecules. When protonated, ONOO- gives rise to hydroxyl (OH.) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) radicals, which are capable of inducing tissue damage. We have investigated the effects of ONOO- on human platelets in vitro in order to explore the potential of this oxidant to contribute to tissue damage. ONOO- caused aggregation of washed platelets and reversed the inhibition of aggregation induced by S-nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine (SNAP), prostacyclin, and indomethacin. However, in platelet-rich plasma, ONOO- not only did not possess proaggregatory properties but acted as an inhibitor of platelet aggregation. This reversal of the aggregatory effect of ONOO- could also be achieved in washed platelets by adding low concentrations of plasma, human serum albumin, or glutathione and was inhibited by hemoglobin. An analysis of the reaction products of ONOO- and glutathione revealed the presence of both NO and S-nitrosoglutathione in quantities sufficient to account for the antiaggregatory effects observed. Thus the fate and therefore the actions of ONOO- in biological systems are critically dependent on the biological environment in which this oxidant is present.\n      </p>", "Monkey kidney COS1 cells transiently transfected with plasmids pMT2-cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), pMT2-cytochrome P450 reductase (P450 reductase), and pMT2-NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase1 (NQO1 or DT diaphorase), individually or in combination, expressed significantly elevated levels of the respective enzyme(s). The transfected cells were homogenized to break cell membranes without affecting the nuclei and incubated with benzo[a]pyrene (BP) to determine the role of cDNA-encoded enzymes in metabolic activation and/or detoxification of BP. These studies were performed by measuring the capacity of the transfected cells to form DNA adducts as determined by 32P postlabeling and protein adduct detection. Cotransfection of the COS1 cells with cDNAs encoding CYP1A1 and P450 reductase resulted in eight distinct BP-DNA adducts. Inclusion of cDNA encoding NQO1 along with CYP1A1 and P450 reductase in transfection reduced the number of DNA adducts to six. The two lost DNA adducts were specifically eliminated due to the presence of cDNA-derived NQO1 activity. Subsequent experiments with BP-1,6-quinone, BP-3,6-quinone, and BP-6,12-quinone identified these two adducts as those of BP quinones. In an in vitro system, BP-3,6-quinone produced two adducts with deoxyguanosine (dG) but not with dA, dC, and dT. Furthermore, the positions of BP-3,6-quinone-dG adducts on TLC plate correspond to those that are prevented by cDNA-derived NQO1, thus identifying these adducts as BP quinones of dG. In addition, NQO1 reduced the amount of protein-BP adducts generated by CYP1A1 and P450 reductase into transfected COS1 cells. These results show that semiquinones can directly bind to DNA and demonstrate that NQO1 activity can specifically reduce the binding of quinone metabolites of BP generated by CYP1A1 and P450 reductase to DNA and protein.\n      </p>", "Cryptococcus neoformans is a major cause of systemic fungal infection in immunocompromised patients. Myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (Nmt) catalyzes the transfer of myristate (C14:0) from myristoyl-CoA to the N-terminal glycine of a subset of cellular proteins produced during vegetative growth of C. neoformans. A Gly487 \u2192 Asp mutation was introduced into C. neoformans NMT by targeted gene replacement. The resulting strains are temperature-sensitive myristic acid auxotrophs. They are killed at 37\u26acC when placed in medium lacking myristate and, in an immunosuppressed animal model of cryptococcal meningitis, are completely eliminated from the subarachnoid space within 12 days of initial infection. C. neoformans and human Nmts exhibit differences in their peptide substrate specificities. These differences can be exploited to develop a new class of fungicidal drugs.\n      </p>", "The inflammatory cytokine interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) induces both cyclooxygenase (COX) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) with increases in the release of prostaglandin (PG) and nitric oxide (NO) by mesangial cells. Recently, activation of the COX enzyme by NO has been described. However, the effects of COX products (PGs) on the NO pathway have not been fully clarified. Thus we determined the effect of COX inhibition and exogenous PGs on NO production and NOS induction in rat mesangial cells. A COX inhibitor, indomethacin, enhanced IL-1\u03b2-induced steady-state level of the inducible NOS (iNOS) mRNA and nitrite production. The effect of indomethacin was dose dependently reversed by the replacement of endogenous PGE2 with exogenous PGE2, which is the predominant product of the COX pathway in rat mesangial cells. In contrast to PGE2, a stable analog of PGI2, carba prostacyclin, enhanced IL-1\u03b2-induced iNOS mRNA levels and nitrite production. Forskolin, an activator of the adenylate cyclase, mimicked the effect of carba prostacyclin but not PGE2. These data suggest that (i) endogenous PGE2 downregulates iNOS induction, (ii) this inhibitory effect of PGE2 on iNOS induction is not mediated by activation of adenylate cyclase, and (iii) exogenous PGI2 stimulates COX induction possibly by activation of adenylate cyclase.\n      </p>", "A 20-mer phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide designed to hybridize to the AUG translation initiation codon of mRNA encoding murine protein kinase C-\u03b1 (PKC-\u03b1) inhibits the expression of PKC-\u03b1 both in vitro and in vivo. In mouse C127 mammary epithelial cells, the reduction in PKC-\u03b1 mRNA expression was both dose and time dependent. The oligodeoxynucleotide exhibited an IC50 value of 100-200 nM and reduced PKC-\u03b1 mRNA expression for up to 48 hr. This reduction was specific for PKC-\u03b1 versus other PKC isozymes (\u03b4, \u03b5, and \u03b6) and completely dependent upon oligodeoxynucleotide sequence. When administered intraperitoneally in mice, the same oligodeoxynucleotide caused a dose-dependent, oligodeoxynucleotide sequence-dependent reduction of PKC-\u03b1 mRNA in liver, with an IC50 value of 30-50 mg/kg of body weight. Inhibition of expression was 64 \u00b1 11% after a single 50-mg/kg dose. The expression of PKC-\u03b4, \u03b5, and \u03b6 mRNA was unaffected by this treatment. The oligodeoxynucleotide activity in vivo did not require the presence of cationic liposomes or any other delivery systems, although in vitro, the oligodeoxynucleotide required cationic liposomes for inhibition of PKC-\u03b1 expression. This study demonstrates the utility of phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides as specific inhibitors of gene expression in vivo after systemic administration.\n      </p>", "We have evaluated the role of nitric oxide (NO) on the activity of the constitutive and induced forms of cyclooxygenase (COX; COX-1 and COX-2, respectively). Induction of NO synthase (NOS) and COX (COX-2) in the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 by Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (1 \u03bc g/ml, 18 h) caused an increase in the release of nitrite (NO- 2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), products of NOS and COX, respectively. Production of both NO- 2 and PGE2 was blocked by the NOS inhibitors NG-monomethyl-L-arginine or aminoguanidine. The effects of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine or aminoguanidine were reversed by coincubation with L-Arg, the precursor for NO synthesis, but not by D-Arg. RAW264.7 cells stimulated for 18 h with lipopolysaccharide in L-Arg-free medium (to reduce NO generation by the endogenous NOS pathway) failed to release NO- 2 and accumulated at least 4-fold less PGE2 when compared to cells in the presence of L-Arg. PGE2 production elicited by a 15-min arachidonic acid treatment of lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW264.7 cells in L-Arg-deficient medium was decreased 3-fold when compared to the release obtained with cells induced in medium containing L-Arg. To examine the NO activation of the induced form of COX in the absence of an endogenous L-Arg, human fetal fibroblasts were first stimulated for 18 h with interleukin 1\u03b2. These cells released PGE2 but not NO- 2, consistent with the induction of COX but not NOS in the fibroblast. Exogenous NO either as a gaseous solution or released by a NO donor, sodium nitroprusside or glyceryl trinitrate, increased COX activity in the interleukin 1\u03b2-stimulated fibroblasts by 5-fold; these effects were abolished by coincubation with hemoglobin (10 \u03bc M), which binds and inactivates NO, but not by methylene blue, an inhibitor of the soluble guanylate cyclase. Furthermore, sodium nitroprusside (0.25-1 mM) increased arachidonic acid-stimulated PGE2 production by murine recombinant COX-1 and COX-2. These results demonstrate that NO enhances COX activity through a mechanism independent of cGMP and suggest that, in conditions in which both the NOS and COX systems are present, there is an NO-mediated increase in the production of proinflammatory prostaglandins that may result in an exacerbated inflammatory response. The data suggest that NO directly interacts with COX to cause an increase in the enzymatic activity.\n      </p>", "A number of DNA minor groove-binding ligands (MGBLs) are known to exhibit antitumor and antimicrobial activities. We show that DNA topoisomerase (Topo) I may be a pharmacological target of MGBLs. In the presence of calf thymus Topo I, MGBLs induced limited but highly specific single-strand DNA breaks. The 3' ends of the broken DNA strands are covalently linked to Topo I polypeptides. Protein-linked DNA breaks are readily reversed by a brief heating to 65\u26acC or the addition of 0.5 M NaCl. These results suggest that MGBLs, like camptothecin, abort Topo I reactions by trapping reversible cleavable complexes. The sites of cleavage induced by MGBLs are distinctly different from those induced by camptothecin. Two of the major cleavage sites have been sequenced and shown to be highly A+T-rich, suggesting the possible involvement of a Topo I-drug-DNA ternary complex at the sites of cleavage. Different MGBLs also exhibit varying efficiency in inducing Topo I-cleavable complexes, and the order of efficiency is as follows: Hoechst 33342 and 33258 &gt; &gt; distamycin A &gt; berenil &gt; netropsin. The lack of correlation between DNA binding and cleavage efficiency suggests that, in addition to binding to the minor grooves of DNA, MGBLs must also interact with Topo I in trapping Topo I-cleavable complexes.\n      </p>", "Carvedilol is a cardiovascular drug currently used for the treatment of hypertension. Clinical studies have recently demonstrated efficacy in angina and congestive heart failure. Recently, carvedilol has been shown to attenuate oxygen free radical-initiated lipid peroxidation and to inhibit vascular smooth muscle mitogenesis induced by a wide variety of growth factors. These findings are of interest since smooth muscle proliferation and abnormal lipid metabolism are proposed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic plaque formation and in development of stenotic lesions following vascular injury by balloon angioplasty and coronary artery bypass grafting. On the basis of these observations, the antiproliferative actions of carvedilol have been explored in detail. In human cultured pulmonary artery vascular smooth muscle cells, carvedilol (0.1-10 \u03bc M) produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the mitogenesis stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, thrombin, and serum, with IC50 values ranging from 0.3 to 2.0 \u03bc M. Carvedilol also produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell migration induced by platelet-derived growth factor, with an IC50 value of 3 \u03bc M. The extensive neointimal formation that occurs following balloon angioplasty of rat carotid arteries was markedly attenuated by carvedilol (1 mg/kg, i.p.; twice daily starting 3 days before angioplasty and continuing until 14 days after angioplasty). Quantitative image analysis demonstrated that carvedilol reduced the neointimal growth following angioplasty by 84% without altering either medial or adventitial cross-sectional areas. These observations indicate that carvedilol may also be effective in the treatment of pathological disorders principally associated with abnormal vascular smooth muscle growth, such as atherosclerosis and acute vascular wall injury induced by angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting.\n      </p>", "Applying a homology search method previously described, we identified a sequence in the extracellular dimerization site of the erythropoietin receptor, distant from the hormone binding site. A peptide identical to that sequence was synthesized. Remarkably, it activated receptor signaling in the absence of erythropoietin. Neither the peptide nor the hormone altered the affinity of the other for the receptor; thus, the peptide does not bind to the hormone binding site. The combined activation of signal transduction by hormone and peptide was strongly synergistic. In mice, the peptide acted like the hormone, protecting against the decrease in hematocrit caused by carboplatin.\n      </p>", "The pharmacological action of salicylate cannot be explained by its inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity. In this report, the effects of aspirin and sodium salicylate on COX-2 expressions in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and foreskin fibroblasts were evaluated. Aspirin and sodium salicylate at therapeutic concentrations equipotently blocked COX-2 mRNA and protein levels induced by interleukin-1\u03b2 and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The suppressing effect was more pronounced in cultured cells deprived of fetal bovine serum for 24 h, suggesting that it may be cell cycle related. Salicylate inhibited nascent COX-2 transcript synthesis but had no effect on COX-2 mRNA stability. It inhibited COX-2 promoter activity in a concentration-dependent manner. In mice pretreated with aspirin (10 and 30 mg/kg), followed by challenge with lipopolysaccharide, COX-2 mRNA expression in peritoneal macrophages was markedly suppressed. These findings suggest that salicylate exerts its antiinflammatory action in part by suppressing COX-2 induction, thereby reducing the synthesis of proinflammatory prostaglandins.\n      </p>", "Stimulation of cardiac \u03b2 &lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-adrenergic receptors is the main mechanism that increases heart rate and contractility. Consequently, several pharmacological and gene transfer strategies for the prevention of heart failure aim at improving the function of the cardiac \u03b2 -adrenergic receptor system, whereas current clinical treatment favors a reduction of cardiac stimulation. To address this controversy, we have generated mice with heart-specific overexpression of \u03b2 &lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-adrenergic receptors. Their cardiac function was investigated in organ bath experiments as well as in vivo by cardiac catheterization and by time-resolved NMR imaging. The transgenic mice had increased cardiac contractility at a young age but also developed marked myocyte hypertrophy (3.5-fold increase in myocyte area). This increase was followed by progressive heart failure with functional and histological deficits typical for humans with heart failure. Contractility was reduced by \u2248 50% in 35-week-old mice, and ejection fraction was reduced down to a minimum of \u2248 20%. We conclude that overexpression of \u03b2 &lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-adrenergic receptors in the heart may lead to a short-lived improvement of cardiac function, but that increased \u03b2 &lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-adrenergic receptor signalling is ultimately detrimental.\n      </p>", "In the central nervous system, release of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; from intracellular stores contributes to numerous functions, including neurotransmitter release and long-term potentiation and depression. We have investigated the developmental profile and the regulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) and ryanodine receptor (RyR) in primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells. The expression of both receptor types increases during development. Whereas the expression of type 1 IP3R appears to be regulated by Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx through L type channels or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, RyR levels increase independently of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. The main target of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-influx-regulating IP3R expression is the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin, because pharmacological blockade of this protein abolishes IP3R expression. Although calcineurin has been shown to regulate the phosphorylation state of the IP3R, the effect described here is at the transcriptional level because IP3R mRNA changes in parallel with protein levels. Thus, calcineurin plays a dual role in IP3R-mediated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling: it regulates IP3R function by dephosphorylation in the short-term time scale and IP3R expression over more extended periods.\n      </p>", "The brain cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptor (CCK-BR) is a major target for drug development because of its postulated role in modulating anxiety, memory, and the perception of pain. Drug discovery efforts have resulted in the identification of small synthetic molecules that can selectively activate this receptor subtype. These drugs include the peptide-derived compound PD135,158 as well as the nonpeptide benzodiazepine-based ligand, L-740,093 (S enantiomer). We now report that the maximal level of receptor-mediated second messenger signaling that can be achieved by these compounds (drug efficacy) markedly differs among species homologs of the CCK-BR. Further analysis reveals that the observed differences in drug efficacy are in large part explained by single or double aliphatic amino acid substitutions between respective species homologs. This interspecies variability in ligand efficacy introduces the possibility of species differences in receptor-mediated function, an important consideration when selecting animal models for preclinical drug testing. The finding that even single amino acid substitutions can significantly affect drug efficacy prompted us to examine ligand-induced signaling by a known naturally occurring human CCK-BR variant (glutamic acid replaced by lysine in position 288; 288E \u2192 K). When examined using the 288E \u2192 K receptor, the efficacies of both PD135,158 and L-740,093 (S) were markedly increased compared with values obtained with the wild-type human protein. These observations suggest that functional variability resulting from human receptor polymorphisms may contribute to interindividual differences in drug effects.\n      </p>", "Release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and the excessive stimulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors is thought to be responsible for much of the neuronal death that occurs following focal hypoxia-ischemia in the central nervous system. Our laboratory has identified endogenous sulfated steroids that potentiate or inhibit NMDA-induced currents. Here we report that 3\u03b1 -ol-5\u03b2 -pregnan-20-one hemisuccinate (3\u03b1 5\u03b2 HS), a synthetic homologue of naturally occurring pregnanolone sulfate, inhibits NMDA-induced currents and cell death in primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons. 3\u03b1 5\u03b2 HS exhibits sedative, anticonvulsant, and analgesic properties consistent with an action at NMDA-type glutamate receptors. Intravenous administration of 3\u03b1 5\u03b2 HS to rats (at a nonsedating dose) following focal cerebral ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion significantly reduces cortical and subcortical infarct size. The in vitro and in vivo neuroprotective effects of 3\u03b1 5\u03b2 HS demonstrate that this steroid represents a new class of potentially useful therapeutic agents for the treatment of stroke and certain neurodegenerative diseases that involve over activation of NMDA receptors.\n      </p>", "Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides offer potential as therapeutic agents to inhibit gene expression. Recent evidence indicates that oligodeoxynucleotides designed to target specific nucleic acid sequences can interact nonspecifically with proteins. This report describes the interactive capabilities of phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides of defined sequence and length with two essential protein tyrosine receptors, flk-1 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and their effects on receptor signaling in a transfected and tumor cell line, respectively. Phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides bound to the cell surface, as demonstrated by fluorescence-activated cell-sorter analyses (FACS), and perturbed receptor activation in the presence and absence of cognate ligands, EGF (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor (flk-1), in phosphorylation assays. Certain phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides interacted relatively selectively with flk-1 and partially blocked the binding of specific anti-receptor monoclonal antibodies to target sites. They stimulated EGFR phosphorylation in the absence of EGF but antagonized ligand-mediated activation of EGFR and flk-1. In vivo studies showed that a nonspecific phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide suppressed the growth of glioblastoma in a mouse model of tumorigenesis. These results emphasize the capacity of phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides to interact with cells in a sequence-selective nonantisense manner, while associating with cellular membrane proteins in ways that can inhibit cellular metabolic activities.\n      </p>", "A new class of 16-membered macrolides, the epothilones (Epos), has been synthesized and evaluated for antitumor potential in vitro and in vivo. Recent studies in these and other laboratories showed that epothilones and paclitaxel (paclitaxel) share similar mechanisms of action in stabilizing microtubule arrays as indicated by binding-displacement studies, substitution for paclitaxel in paclitaxel-dependent cell growth, and electron microscopic examinations. The present study examined cell growth-inhibitory effects in two rodent and three human tumor cell lines and their drug-resistant sublines. Although paclitaxel showed as much as 1,970-fold cross-resistance to the sublines resistant to paclitaxel, adriamycin, vinblastine, or actinomycin D, most epothilones exhibit little or no cross-resistance. In multidrug-resistant CCRF-CEM/VBL100 cells, IC50 values for EpoA (1), EpoB (2), desoxyEpoA (3) (dEpoA), desoxyEpoB (4) (dEpoB), and paclitaxel were 0.02, 0.002, 0.012, 0.017, and 4.14 \u03bc M, respectively. In vivo studies, using i.p. administration, indicated that the parent, EpoB, was highly toxic to mice and showed little therapeutic effect when compared with a lead compound, dEpoB. More significantly, dEpoB (25-40 mg/kg, Q2Dx5, i.p.) showed far superior therapeutic effects and lower toxicity than paclitaxel, doxorubicin, camptothecin, or vinblastine (at maximal tolerated doses) in parallel experiments. For mammary adenocarcinoma xenografts resistant to adriamycin, MCF-7/Adr, superior therapeutic effects were obtained with dEpoB compared with paclitaxel when i.p. regimens were used. For ovarian adenocarcinoma xenografts, SK-OV-3, dEpoB (i.p.), and paclitaxel (i.v.) gave similar therapeutic effects. In nude mice bearing a human mammary carcinoma xenograft (MX-1), marked tumor regression and cures were obtained with dEpoB.\n      </p>", "The effects of insulin on the mammalian target of rapamycin, mTOR, were investigated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. mTOR protein kinase activity was measured in immune complex assays with recombinant PHAS-I as substrate. Insulin-stimulated kinase activity was clearly observed when immunoprecipitations were conducted with the mTOR antibody, mTAb2. Insulin also increased by severalfold the 32P content of mTOR that was determined after purifying the protein from 32P-labeled adipocytes with rapamycin\u00b7 FKBP12 agarose beads. Insulin affected neither the amount of mTOR immunoprecipitated nor the amount of mTOR detected by immunoblotting with mTAb2. However, the hormone markedly decreased the reactivity of mTOR with mTAb1, an antibody that activates the mTOR protein kinase. The effects of insulin on increasing mTOR protein kinase activity and on decreasing mTAb1 reactivity were abolished by incubating mTOR with protein phosphatase 1. Interestingly, the epitope for mTAb1 is located near the COOH terminus of mTOR in a 20-amino acid region that includes consensus sites for phosphorylation by protein kinase B (PKB). Experiments were performed in MER-Akt cells to investigate the role of PKB in controlling mTOR. These cells express a PKB-mutant estrogen receptor fusion protein that is activated when the cells are exposed to 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Activating PKB with 4-hydroxytamoxifen mimicked insulin by decreasing mTOR reactivity with mTAb1 and by increasing the PHAS-I kinase activity of mTOR. Our findings support the conclusion that insulin activates mTOR by promoting phosphorylation of the protein via a signaling pathway that contains PKB.\n      </p>", "Cell cycle progression is regulated by cAMP in several cell types. Cellular cAMP levels depend on the activity of different adenylyl cyclases (ACs), which have varied signal-receiving capabilities. The role of individual ACs in regulating proliferative responses was investigated. Native NIH 3T3 cells contain AC6, an isoform that is inhibited by a variety of signals. Proliferation of exogenous AC6-expressing cells was the same as in control cells. In contrast, expression of AC2, an isoform stimulated by protein kinase C (PKC), resulted in inhibition of cell cycle progression and increased doubling time. In AC2-expressing cells, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) elevated cAMP levels in a PKC-dependent manner. PDGF stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases 1 and 2 (MAPK 1,2), DNA synthesis, and cyclin D1 expression was reduced in AC2-expressing cells as compared with control cells. Dominant negative protein kinase A relieved the AC2 inhibition of PDGF-induced DNA synthesis. Expression of AC2 also blocked H-ras-induced transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. These observations indicate that, because AC2 is stimulated by PKC, it can be activated by PDGF concurrently with the stimulation of MAPK 1,2. The elevation in cAMP results in inhibition of signal flow from the PDGF receptor to MAPK 1,2 and a significant reduction in the proliferative response to PDGF. Thus, the molecular identity and signal receiving capability of the AC isoforms in a cell could be important for proliferative homeostasis.\n      </p>", "In 1992, Xie et al. identified a cDNA sequence in the expression cloning search for the \u03ba opioid receptor. When the cDNA was expressed in Cos-7 cells, binding of opioid compounds was observed to be of low affinity and without \u03ba , \u03bc , or \u03b4 selectivity [Xie, G.-X., Miyajima, A. and Goldstein, A. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89, 4124-4128]. This cDNA was highly homologous to the human neurokinin-3 (NK-3) receptor sequence, and displayed lower homology to NK-1 and NK-2 sequences. This sequence was stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, which do not express neurokinin receptors naturally, and ligand binding and second messenger characteristics were compared with a human NK-3 receptor. The NK-3 receptor homolog bound [&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H] senktide with a K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; of 39 nM, similar to that of the NK-3 receptor. The rank order of tachykinin peptides competing for [&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H] senktide binding at the NK-3 receptor homolog was [MePhe&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;] neurokinin B &gt; senktide &gt; substance P = neurokinin A &gt; neurokinin B. This cell line also bound [&lt;sup&gt;125&lt;/sup&gt;I-MePhe&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;] neurokinin B; however, neurokinin B was an effective competitor. Tachykinin peptides stimulated both inositol phospholipid hydrolysis and arachidonic acid release at NK-3 and NK-3 receptor homolog cell lines, with similar rank orders of potency of [MePhe&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;] neurokinin B = neurokinin B = senktide &gt; NKA = substance P. These results indicate that expression of the NK-3 receptor homolog cDNA in the Chinese hamster ovary cell system induces the expression of a receptor site with many similarities but certain key differences from that of the human NK-3 receptor. The results are discussed with reference to the existence of a novel human tachykinin receptor.\n      </p>"], "words": {"fungal": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "excessive": {"number":
