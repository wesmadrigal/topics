{"total_words": 510, "documents": ["This article underscores the importance of online research in illuminating the social processes underlying Internet effects on politics. It is an empirical study of the effect of blogs on the 2008 general election in Malaysia. Using the population of electoral candidates in the 2008 general election (N = 471), the author estimates a logistic model predicting the effects of having a blog on winning a Parliamentary seat. The results show that opposition candidates benefit significantly more from having a blog than do non-opposition candidates, as blogging provides opportunities denied to them by Malaysia's state-controlled media. Bloggers are more than seven times as likely to win an election compared to non-bloggers, controlling for incumbency, party membership, and race. In addition to being an alternative avenue of information distribution, blogs' potential for building interpersonal relationships and their role as mobilization tools in media-controlling states are discussed using qualitative examples.\n      </p>", "This article is an ethnographic study of Persian-language weblogs (blogs), focusing on a divisive argument among Iranian bloggers that came to be known as the \"vulgarity debate.\" Sparked by a controversial blogger who ridiculed assertions that Islam was compatible with human rights, the debate revolved around the claim that blogging had a \"vulgar spirit\" that made it easy for everything from standards of writing to principles of logical reasoning to be undermined. My study focuses primarily on the linguistic side of the controversy: I analyze blogging as an emergent speech genre and identify the structural features and social interactions that make this genre seem \"vulgar.\" I also examine the controversy as a confrontation between bloggers with unequal access to cultural capital and a struggle over \"intellectualist\" hegemony. In the conclusion, I use the construct of \"deep play\" to weave together multiple layers of structure, explanation, and meaning in the debate.\n      </p>", "Though best known as a documentary filmmaker, Errol Morris's recent use of other mediums including books, a blog, Twitter and short films demonstrates a willingness to rethink old questions in new terms.

By analyzing the structural embeddedness of a prototypical blog in a virtual community, we show the potential of online platforms to document corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities and to engage with an increasingly socially and ecologically aware stakeholder base. The results of this study show that stakeholder involvement via sustainability blogs is a valuable new practice for CSR communications and stakeholder engagement. It also opens new horizons for communicating CSR issues to key constituencies online.\n      </p>", "Biogeography is a vibrant academic discipline that plays an important role in framing and directing debates on some of the most important environmental issues of our time, such as the impacts of climate change on biodiversity, biotic homogenization and the effectiveness of global conservation policy. Despite this, biogeography suffers from a low public profile and may consequently be poorly understood by the public. Here I review the representation of the term biogeography, and a selection of biogeographers in the public sphere (newspapers, websites, blogs) and the academic sphere (journals and reports) to understand more fully the public perception of the discipline. As anticipated, the survey suggests that the term 'biogeography' has little public currency, and that the public still largely associate the subject area with either eminent Victorians such as A.R. Wallace or modern greats such as E.O. Wilson. I conclude by discussing the potential consequences of the virtual absence of biogeography from public discourse for education and professional biogeographers.\n      </p>", "There are no bodies on the internet and yet, there are bodies on the internet. This article deals with representations of the 'virtually physical' in personal weblogs. To examine the data drawn from 14 weblogs, a qualitative content analysis is made. The results show that the virtual body is widely present in these particular internet settings and that it is most commonly described as female. Moreover, the virtual body is to a large extent a fragmented body that one either takes control over or is controlled by.\n      </p>", "This paper investigates the transformation of blogs from online 'filters' into a 'format' for sharing a variety of content on the Web. To account for this process of partial stabilization, this study draws on a mixed-methods research design and on an interdisciplinary framework that combines scholarship in science and technology studies (STS) and communication studies. The article analyzes how different communities of users emerged, and how they created three types of websites in the second half of 1990s: online diaries, personal publishing journals, and weblogs. Next, it examines the process of technological stabilization through which weblogs came to crystallize the practices of Web appropriation of these communities. Three dynamics are explored. First, users appropriated weblogs by expanding their types of content. Second, a Web application (Blogger) helped the weblog stabilize and standardize as a site suitable for the purposes of these user communities. Third, software developers and users redefined it as the Web's 'native format'. This paper broadens our understanding of technological stabilization by showing that its investigation requires the consideration of how artifacts and content are variously articulated.\n      </p>", "The rise of bloggers raises the vexing question of why blogs have any influence at all, given their relatively low readership and lack of central organization. We argue that to answer this question we need to focus on two key factors\u2014the unequal distribution of readers across weblogs, and the relatively high readership of blogs among journalists and other political elites. The unequal distribution of readership, combined with internal norms and linking practices allows interesting news and opinions to rise to the \"top\" of the blogosphere, and thus to the attention of elite actors, whose understanding of politics may be changed by frames adopted from the blogosphere.\n      </p>", "During the 2004 election campaign, millions of political enthusiasts downloaded poll data on the Internet, while \"Weblogs\" provided a new forum for commentary on survey methodology. At the same time, traditional public opinion surveys came under pressure from declining cooperation, contact, and coverage rates, and many automated and Internet surveys began to proliferate. This article provides some examples of \"blog\" commentary on automated and Internet polls and then explores the lessons to be learned from the spirit of innovation and openness of the Internet in evaluating new survey methods such as automated polls and those conducted over the Internet.\n      </p>", "This essay analyses two sorts of texts published daily on the World-Wide Web: more traditional forms of Internet literature such as hypertext and collaborative writing -and the recently developed genre of weblogs, i. e. diaries or open source journalism on the net. Starting with a brief historical and typological survey of those two forms, a new method of reconstructing the individual heuristics of an author is introduced, referring to Eugene T. Gendlins psychological-phenomenological theory of a bodily felt sense.Finally, this new research method in the field of cultural studies is applied to two examples of daily texts: the first German weblog www. schockwellenreiter. de and the German collaborative literary writing project www. ampool. de.\n      </p>", "At the University of Maryland, an interdisciplinary team of researchers from information studies, computer science, education, art, and psychology worked with seven children (ages seven to eleven) to design a new digital library for children. This partnership led to new approaches for collection development, cataloging (metadata standards), and new technologies for information access and use. The team validated the importance of working with children by analyzing the results of Weblogs, surveys, and lab user studies. This article presents a discussion of the interdisciplinary research landscape that contributes to an understanding of digital libraries for children, examines a case study on the development of the International Children\u2019s Digital Library, and discusses the implications from this research as they relate to new technology design methods with children and new directions for future digital libraries.\n      </p>", "Weblogs (or blogs), as a form of communication on the Internet, have recently risen in prominence but may be poorly understood by both faculty and students. This article explains how blogs differ from other online communication tools and how political science faculty can make use of blogs in their classes. The focus is on using blogs as part of class assignments to reinforce important skills, including critical thinking, political engagement, and essay writing. We also discuss existing academic and professional blogs that may be models for student blogging in political science.\n      </p>", "The United Nations climate talks in Copenhagen during December of 2009 were surrounded by numerous side events. Some anthropologists and other social scientists at these events used the web as a technology for reporting on activities as they occurred. The success of alternate publishing fora is difficult to gauge, but these weblogs reflect some of the difficulties faced by lone researchers in observing and reporting on large-scale meetings. Some geographers, in contrast came to Copenhagen as part of an effort organized through the Association of American Geographers. Such a planned and collaborative process may be useful for anthropologists at future meetings.\n      </p>", "This paper explored how the use of weblogs within the portfolio framework affected portfolio production and development for student teachers, and how the weblogbased electronic portfolio (WBEP) shaped student teachers' reflective practice during the student teaching practicum. The individuals participating in this study consisted of 31 elementary school student teachers from a national university's teacher education program in Taiwan. Qualitative data analysis revealed that about half the participants' WBEP maturation level were at Level 2, the Curriculum Vitae WBEP. The two most prominent features of the WBEP platform on participants' reflective practice were personal editorship and dialogues with others. Additionally, blog publicity promoted mandated dossier-like portfolios with which to evaluate performance with respect to external evaluation requirements. Thus, the reflective themes of most WBEP contents were rather uniform in the study.\n      </p>", "This study investigates the forms and networks of civic activism on the Russian-language segment of the internet through the data of anti-military web pages and weblogs in 2007. The results of the web page analysis are complemented by interviews with Russian activists and discussed in the context of the role of the internet in Russian democratisation. Although the state of anti-military activism on the Russian internet currently seems fragmented, the role of the internet and one particular weblog platform, \"LiveJournal\", are considered to contain important potential for future forms of Russian activism.\n      </p>", "In this article, which is based on twenty four months of combined online and off-line ethnographic research, I show the way that some Iranian diasporic bloggers use their weblogs as entrepreneurship resources during the 'war on terror'. Through a discourse analysis of a documentary film about Weblogistan and interviews with diasporic Iranian bloggers in Toronto, I argue that Weblogistan is implicated in discourses of militarism and neoliberalism that interpellate the representable Iranian blogger as a gendered neoliberal homo oeconomicus. The production of knowledge about Iran in transnational encounters between the media, think tanks, policy institutions and the Iranian diasporic self-entrepreneurs, relies on gendered civilizational discourses that are inherently tied to the 'war on terror'. Following feminist scholars who have theorized militarism and gender, I argue that dominant representations of Weblogistan produce different gendered subject positions for Iranian bloggers. Although the masculine blogger soldier takes freedom to Iran through his active participation in proper politics (enabled by his freedom of speech in North America and Europe), the woman blogger finds freedom of expression in writing about sex and telling the truth of her sex in a confessional mode. It is in this war of representation that women bloggers negotiate their subjectivity while shuttling in and out of local and global politics, as subjects of politics (markers of freedom and oppression) and political abjects (not worthy of political participation).\n      </p>", "This paper examines the key causes and social consequences of the much debated UK 'housing bubble' and its aftermath from a multidimensional sociological approach, as opposed to the economic perspective of many popular discussions. This is a phenomenon that has affected numerous economies in the first decade of the new millennium. The discussion is based on a comprehensive study that includes exhaustive analysis of secondary data, content and debate in the mass media and academia, primary data gathered from the monitoring of weblogs and forums debating housing issues, and case histories of individuals experiencing housing difficulties during this period. This paper is intended to provide a broad overview of the key findings and preliminary analysis of this ongoing study, and is informed by a perspective which considers secure and affordable housing to be an essential foundation of stable and cohesive societies, with its absence contributing to a range of social ills that negatively impact on both individual and collective well being. Overall, it is argued that we must return to viewing decent, affordable housing as an essential social resource, that provides the bedrock of stable individual, family and community life, while recognizing that its increasing treatment as a purely economic asset is a key contributor to our so-called 'broken society'.\n      </p>", "           ", "For many years opposition to US foreign policy has frequently been interpreted by cultural commentators and the wider media as \"anti-Americanism. \"Such \"anti-Americanism \"has been situated as dangerous, irrational and violent, and this apparent link has been reinforced continuously since 9/11. However, by making a reading of two Iraqi weblogs which have gained significant recognition in Iraq and the West, this article challenges such a simplified definition of alternative perspectives on foreign policy as \"anti-Americanism. \"This article focusses on the blog entries of two Iraqis, Salam Pax and \"Riverbend,\" who lived in Baghdad throughout the Iraq War (2003\u2014 9) and during the subsequent years of civil unrest. It explores how their online responses to the US action in Iraq illustrate the complexity of perceived \"anti-Americanism.\" The bloggers do not situate themselves as \"anti-American.\" Instead they draw a clear distinction between opposition to US foreign policy and hostility towards America and its people, thus problematizing previous definitions of \"anti-Americanism. \"However, this article also recognizes that whilst these texts highlight this distinction, the negative impact of US foreign policy on Iraq since the occupation, coupled with the militarized image that America projects of itself, has caused the distinction between a disapproval of US foreign policy and an objection to US culture in broader terms to become increasingly blurred. Indeed, these narratives indicate that rather than situating 9/11 as the first move in a campaign of \"anti-Americanism, \"it could be argued that it is the American government's reaction to the attacks, and the impact of the subsequent occupation of Iraq, which acted as a catalyst for the growth of opposition to US foreign policy, and to some extent a rejection of US culture, in Iraq.\n      </p>", "Prevailing attempts to reconcile paradigmatic differences in human and economic geography have tended to occur at the methodological level. Methodological concerns, however, do not adequately address the chasm that divides constructivist and positivist geographers in their understanding of the first-person subject and third-person object. Separability of the first- and third-person positions perpetuates a Cartesian world of subjects and objects. A relational economic geography coordinates subjective and objective relations intersubjectively through the second-person position. This intersubjective approach highlights knowledge construction as an interrelated phenomenon arising from the social interactions and communication of economic agents. Subjects and objects change positions while interacting, so that objective facts and judgment become subjectivized, and subjective experiences also become objectivized. We illustrate the role of interpersonal and reciprocal knowledge construction using the case example of computer vendor Dell, which recently launched a business Weblog to interact directly with its customers. Weblog discourses reveal communicative behavior directed both at seeking objective information and at locating subjective experiences, transforming objects and subjects in the context of socially situated intersubjective relationships. /// \u5728\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u7684\u5c42\u6b21, \u4e00\u76f4\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u79cd\u8bd5\u56fe\u8c03\u548c\u4eba\u6587\u5730\u7406\u5b66\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5730\u7406\u5b66\u8303\u5f0f\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u52aa\u529b. \u5efa\u6784\u5730\u7406\u5b66\u8005\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5730\u7406\u5b66 \u8005\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u548c\u7b2c\u4e09\u4eba\u79f0\u4e3b\u9898\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u6b67, \u5730\u7406\u5b66\u754c\u5728\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e0a\u5bf9\u6b64\u8868\u793a\u5173\u5fc3, \u4f46\u662f, \u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u5145\u5206\u89e3 \u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u88c2\u75d5. \u53ef\u5206\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u548c\u7b2c\u4e09\u4eba\u79f0\u7684\u7acb\u573a\u4f7f\u5f97\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u4e3b\u4f11\u548c\u5ba2\u4f53\u6c38\u8fdc\u5b58\u5728. \u5173\u8054\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5730\u7406\u901a\u8fc7\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4eba\u79f0 \u7684\u7acb\u573a, \u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e3b\u89c2\u548c\u5ba2\u89c2\u5173\u7cfb\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e3b\u4f53\u95f4\u6027\u7684\u5750\u6807\u4f53\u7cfb. \u8fd9\u79cd\u4e3b\u4f53\u95f4\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u5efa\u8bbe, \u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u76f8\u4e92 \u5173\u8054\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u4ea7\u751f\u4e8e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u4ea4\u5f80\u548c\u6c9f\u901a. \u4e3b\u4f53\u548c\u5ba2\u4f53\u5728\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e2d\u6539\u53d8\u7acb\u573a, \u56e0\u6b64, \u5ba2\u89c2\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u548c\u5224\u65ad \u53d8\u5f97\u4e3b\u89c2\u5316, \u4e3b\u89c2\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e5f\u53d8\u5f97\u5ba2\u89c2\u5316. \u6211\u4eec\u4ee5\u7535\u8111\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u6234\u5c14\u516c\u53f8\u4e3a\u4e2a\u4f8b, \u8bf4\u660e\u4eba\u9645\u4e4b\u95f4\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u6784\u5efa\u7684 \u89d2\u8272\u4f5c\u7528, \u6234\u5c14\u516c\u53f8\u6700\u8fd1\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86\u4f01\u4e1a\u535a\u5ba2, \u76f4\u63a5\u4e0e\u5b83\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u8fdb\u884c\u6c9f\u901a. \u535a\u5ba2\u6587\u7ae0\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6c9f\u901a\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u6027, \u5373\u540c \u65f6\u8ffd\u6c42\u5ba2\u89c2\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u4e3b\u89c2\u7ecf\u9a8c, \u5728\u4e3b\u4f53\u95f4\u6027\u8fd9\u4e00\u793e\u4f1a\u80cc\u666f\u4e0a\u8f6c\u5316\u4e86\u4e3b\u4f53\u548c\u5ba2\u4f53. /// Los intentos m\u00e1s importantes por conciliar las diferencias paradigm\u00e1ticas entre la geograf\u00eda humana y la econ\u00f3mica ocurren de preferencia a nivel metodol\u00f3gico.

Nor do we know whether the normative consequences of blogs for politics are likely to be good or bad. In this special issue, we and our co-authors undertake the first sustained effort to map the empirical and normative consequences of blogs for politics. We begin by setting out basic information about blogs, and some anecdotal evidence suggesting that they are indeed politically important. We go on to identify the key empirical and normative questions that blogs raise, and discuss the dearth of relevant data in the existing literature. We conclude by summarizing how the authors of the articles gathered in this special issue help fill this gap.\n      </p>", "This article examines the ways in which a group of London webloggers or on-line journal keepers constitute their city.

An important field of superposition and contradiction among these standards is the gender issue and how to control women and their sexuality in the private and the public spheres. In the past two decades, gradual transgressions of urf and sharia have become a sign of modernity and resistance for many women and young people who wish to generate changes in their situation. Since 2001, the trend of willfully neglected veiling (bad-hejabi) in physical space has been accompanied by the virtual unveiling of women bloggers in cyberspace. Through their personal narration, women bloggers transgress several sociocultural boundaries. The strategy of women in both spaces is the same: to become more visible, to speak out, and to create a new identity closer to their \u201cinner self.\u201d\n      </p>", "Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's controversial decision to introduce casinos as part of the \u201cremaking\u201d of Singapore's economy was accompanied by officially tolerated public criticism of that decision.

The specific case of celebu- reveals much about these conditions\u2014the need for semantic economy, the saliency of humor, the function of nominalization, as well as the role of critique and sometimes cruelty. Additionally, celebu- coinages illustrate how blogs have emerged as sites of linguistic innovation.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Authorship and book market are central issues in Elfriede Jelinek's novels Gier and Neid, both published in the noughties. These texts must not be considered in isolation but as part of a wider tendency of critical depictions of the author-fixation in literary marketing in German and Austrian novels of the time. They also express worries for the future of the book and literature itself as they seem to be under threat through the rise of the internet and digital audiovisual media. The article analyzes the two novels with a view to understanding Jelinek's attempts to deconstruct the \u2018brand Jelinek\u2019. The new genre of the online novel is interpreted as providing new opportunities to manipulate the author's media image.\n         In den von Elfriede Jelinek in den Nullerjahren ver\u00f6ffentlichten Romanen Gier und Neid ist die Auseinandersetzung mit den Themen Autorschaft und Buchmarkt von zentraler Bedeutung. Diese Texte sind nicht als Einzelph\u00e4nomen zu sehen, sondern als Teil einer Reihe von \u00f6sterreichischen und deutschen Romanen, die die Medialisierung und zunehmende Autorfixierung der Literaturvermittlung reflektieren. Sie k\u00f6nnen als Ausdruck einer Sorge um die Zukunft des Buches und der Literatur gelten, die mit dem Aufstieg des Internet und der digitalen Medien begann. Der Artikel analysiert die Romane im Hinblick darauf, wie Jelinek die Lenkung des Lesers dazu nutzt, um eine literarische Demontage und Destruktion der \u2018Marke Jelinek\u2019 zu erreichen. Die mediale Form des Onlineromans wird als eine M\u00f6glichkeit der \u00e4sthetischen Manipulation des medialen Autorbildes gedeutet, die wiederum neue Perspektiven auf die Interpretation der Texte er\u00f6ffnet.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Grassroots responses were spontaneous, improvised, and ubiquitous. Every surface was blanketed with candles, flowers, flags, and missing persons' posters that became the focal point of shrines memorializing the missing and presumed deceased. The catastrophe produced a series of equivocal situations: Kodak moment or surrogate body? Crime scene or tourist attraction? Missing person notice or obituary? Cheap souvenir or involuntary memento? Voyeurism or mourning? Above all, the question of documentation: When, where, and how should documentation of memorials be exhibited?\n      </p>", "In the sense of an \"Open Access\" movement this article is an appeal for making scientific publications accessible in Internet free-of-charge and worldwide without any restrictive \"permission barriers.\" It presents projects and initiatives in both the United States and Germany and advocates a stronger reception of American approaches here in Germany. According to this article, \"Open Access\" is the answer to the crisis scientific literature is facing, which is not only reflected in the professional journal prices, but also means that an anthology is maybe subsidized four times by local authorities, and the state then has to buy back its own research findings from commercial publishing houses. There are also thoughts about providing \"Open Access\" not only for books and articles. The article closes by dealing with the resistance and barriers to this idea and deliberating possible solutions, with an emphasis on the legal framework.\n      </p>"], "words": {"essay": {"number":
