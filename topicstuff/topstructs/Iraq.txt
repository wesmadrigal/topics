Modern military operations consist of a linear progression of activities that include detailed planning, deployment of forces, preparation for combat, combat, reconsolidation, declaring victory, and then redeployment back to home station. The problem of rebuilding that society--Phase IV in Operation Iraqi Freedom--requires a nonlinear approach to building the institutions of society with multiple simultaneous actions among diplomatic, informational, military, and economic realms. This paper examines a case study of \"stability operations\" in Northern Iraq by the 101st Airborne Division after major combat operations in Operation Iraqi Freedom. An analysis of the actions of the U.S. Army to develop societal institutions while maintaining security in Iraq focuses on the identification of ends, ways, and means of disparate simultaneous objectives. A key focus of the paper is the implementation of plans to develop a societal structure within political constraints, in which actions in one realm (e.g., economic development) have unanticipated second and third order effects in other realms (e.g., diplomatic, informational, and military). Finally, I conclude with an assessment of the planning and implementation of stability operations in regard to linear planning, Charles Lindbolm's (1959) \"muddling through,\" Herbert Simon's (1976) \"bounded rationality,\" and complexity theory.\n      </p>", "Data from two parallel household surveys conducted in Iraq by UNICEF in 1999 show that under-5 mortality declined steadily from 1974 to 1990, reaching about 63 per 1,000 live births in the period 1986-90. It then rose dramatically to 118 per 1,000 in 1991, the year of the Gulf War. The number of 'excess' under-5 deaths (i.e., the number in excess of the number predicted from past trends) in Iraq between 1991 and 1998 was calculated assuming that, instead of the rates measured by the 1999 survey for this period, either (a) average mortality rates for the period 1986-90 had been maintained, or (b) mortality had continued to decline at the rate observed between 1974 and 1990. According to these calculations, the estimated number of excess deaths resulting from the Gulf War and its aftermath up to 1998 was between 400,000 (assumption a) and 500,000 (assumption b).\n      </p>", "A conventional view of contemporary Iraq suggests that there were two short wars in 1991 and 2003 between Iraq and a US led cohort of countries separated by an interval of relative peace.

An expanded concept of violence bridging two divergent literatures\u2014the anthropology of war and the ethnography of violence\u2014is used as a lens to see the war with greater definition. The concept of violence put forward identifies the substance of war and is comprised of three conceptual constellations: direct/physical violence, structural/economic violence and cultural/symbolic violence.

Over the Bush presidency, that gap has disappeared. The authors explore the causes and consequences of this loss and suggest several new avenues for research on issue ownership. Findings indicate that Bush's handling of the Iraq war has played a decisive role in diminishing the Republican Party's reputational advantage on national security. This has had significant electoral repercussions both for the president and his copartisans in Congress.\n      </p>", "This article argues that the problems facing Iraq could have tremendous consequences for the broader \"war on terror,\" particularly if they return to or exceed levels seen at the height of the violence in 2006. Salafi militants, followers of an extreme interpretation of Islam who want to use violence to unite Muslims under religious rule, have been fighting in Iraq and may use the country as a base for operations and attacks elsewhere in the region. In addition, refugees from Iraq might spread terrorism, radicalize neighboring populations, and contribute to strife and instability throughout the region. While a U.S. troop withdrawal may inspire fewer young men to take up terrorism against the United States, it would also increase militants' operational freedom in Iraq itself, allowing terrorist groups to recruit, train, and plan with relative impunity. As a result, if the United States withdraws from Iraq without leaving behind a stable Iraqi government, it should still maintain a regional military presence and help bolster other regimes in the Middle East from the threat of terrorism from Iraq.\n      </p>", "The authors estimate a model of the job approval ratings of President George W. Bush that includes five sets of variables: a \"honeymoon\" effect, an autoregressive function that tracks a decline in approval, measures of economic performance, measures of important \"rally events,\" and a measure of the costs of war\u2014in this case, the U.S. death toll in the Iraq War. Several significant effects are found, including the rally that followed the attacks of September 11, 2001; the commencement of the war in Iraq; and the capture of Baghdad in April 2003. Since the beginning of the war in Iraq, however, the casualties of war have had a significant negative impact on Bush's approval ratings. Although the effects of additional battle deaths in Iraq will decrease approval only marginally, results suggest that there is also little prospect for sustained improvement so long as casualties continue to accumulate.\n      </p>", "How do citizens hold their leader accountable during an ongoing war? The authors distinguish between two models of accountability\u2014the \"decision maker\" and \"managerial\" models\u2014and investigate their implications in the context of the current war in Iraq. They employ a novel measurement model and a database of survey marginals to estimate weekly time series of aggregate beliefs about various aspects of the war. Consistent with the \"decision \"decision maker\" model, they find that shifts in aggregate support for the war have a greater impact on presidential approval than do equivalent shifts in perceptions of war success or approval of the president's handling of the war. Conversely, aggregate perceptions of success are more responsive to casualties and key events than are aggregate beliefs about the war's merits. This suggests that the link from casualties and events to presidential approval is less direct than previously assumed.\n      </p>", "The war in Iraq has spanned the full spectrum of military operations: intense combat, stability-and-support operations, and peacetime activities. Regardless of their nature and relative intensity, military operations are shaped by the characteristics of the military operating environment. Consequently, the scale, tempo, and complexity of any type of military endeavor are linked to the physical and cultural landscapes of the region in which it is conducted. Military geographers use geographical information, tools, and techniques to examine those links. Iraq's operating environment is studied to identify the relevant components of its physical and human geography. This military geographical examination of Iraq tells us a great deal about how the physical and cultural environment have influenced the war, as well as how the complexity of its human landscape continues to affect the postwar rebuilding of the country.\n      </p>", "The authors examine the role of Iraq as a campaign issue in the 2006 midterm elections, analyzing more than 400 television advertisements produced by ninety-four candidates in forty-seven competitive races for the U.S. House of Representatives. Generally, the authors find that the issue of the war was not as central an element of candidate appeals as the conventional wisdom and media storyline leading up to Election Day implied. On the issue of Iraq, as well as other issues central to 2006, the authors find evidence that challengers pursued different issue strategies than either incumbents or open-seat candidates of the same party.\n      </p>", "This paper investigates why the Iraq issue did not become decisive enough to topple Japan's LDP-Komeit\u014d coalition government in the November 2003 lower house election, even though the majority of the public opposed the Iraq war and the dispatch of the Self-Defense Forces to Iraq.\n      </p>", "In the United States, rhetoric in support of the Iraq War often focuses on discourses of patriotism and supporting the troops. These discourses hold enormous sway over the American public because of the discursive legacies of the Vietnam War and the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. In response, members of the peace movement who are veterans, soldiers, and military families stress their military identities during activism. These individuals have organized as an important branch of the U.S. antiwar movement that challenges the pro-war framing of patriotism and troop support by strategically deploying \u201coppositional identities.\u201d The oppositional identity strategy involves highlighting the activism of individuals who many would assume would be part of the movement's opposition. In an effort to assert credibility and support their frames, activists assert this novel and seemingly contradictory identity through organizational affiliation, rhetoric, clothing, mannerisms, and symbols.\n      </p>", "What explains variation in domestic political instability in polities imposed by foreign powers? We formulate a framework grounded in four sources of political instability in imposed polities: (1) the initial conditions under which a polity is imposed, (2) policy choices made by the imposer, (3) the prevailing domestic conditions within states hosting the imposed polity, and (4) the international environment within which the host state is embedded. Employing a sample of ninety-four imposed polities during the period 1816-1994 to test expectations from the framework, we find, in part, that ethnoreligious heterogeneity coupled with democratic institutions, preimposition military defeat, colonial experience, dissimilarity of neighboring political institutions, hostility from neighboring states, and the presence of the imposing state each stimulate political instability. The analysis suggests a bleak prognosis for domestic peace in postinvasion Afghanistan and Iraq as the causal factors that militate against domestic stability are manifold and likely reinforcing.\n      </p>", "\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n         For individual subscriptions, please contact the <a href=\"https://aibs.site-ym.com/?page=IndMem\">AIBS</a>\r\n         .\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p />    \r\n         To buy individual copies, please contact <a\thref=\"http://www.ucpressjournals.com/journalBuy.asp?j=bio\">University of California Press</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n         .\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n         For individual subscriptions, please contact the <a href=\"https://aibs.site-ym.com/?page=IndMem\">AIBS</a>\r\n         .\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p />    \r\n         To buy individual copies, please contact <a\thref=\"http://www.ucpressjournals.com/journalBuy.asp?j=bio\">University of California Press</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n         .\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n         For individual subscriptions, please contact the <a href=\"https://aibs.site-ym.com/?page=IndMem\">AIBS</a>\r\n         .\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p />    \r\n         To buy individual copies, please contact <a\thref=\"http://www.ucpressjournals.com/journalBuy.asp?j=bio\">University of California Press</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n         .\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "A web-based study of 393 undergraduates at a public university in the United States was conducted to examine the relationship between moral emotions (i.e., emotions that motivate prosocial tendencies) and support for political actions to assist Iraqi citizens after the Second Gulf War (2003-2004). Previous work on emotions and prosocial tendencies has focused on empathy. In the context of post-war Iraq, we found that while empathy predicted support for a number of different political actions that have the potential to advance the welfare of the Iraqi people (humanitarian action in particular), guilt over the U.S. invasion was an important predictor of support for reparative actions (i.e., restoring damage created by the U.S. military), and moral outrage toward Saddam Hussein and his regime was the best predictor of support for political actions to prevent future harm to the Iraqi people and to punish the perpetrators. Our findings demonstrate the utility of an emotion-specific framework for understanding why and what type of political actions individuals will support. And in contrast to the traditional view that emotions are an impediment to rationality, our findings suggest that they can serve as a potentially powerful vehicle for motivating political engagement among the citizenry.\n      </p>", "Since the end of the Cold War, the suspension of state sovereignty as a means of encouraging democracy has become a common policy instrument for hegemonic state actors. Deploying discourses of democratization, such interventions have promoted a singular narrative of state building, combining neo-liberal economic norms with a vocabulary of democratic participation. Drawing on the central comparison between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Iraq, this paper argues that such technical narrations of intervention depoliticize both the planning and execution of democratization initiatives. This argument is made at two levels of analysis. At the policy level, the geopolitical contexts of intervention in Bosnia and Iraq are used to illustrate the normative nature of declarations of state competence. At the agency level, I examine processes of democratic reconstruction following conflict. In the cases of both Bosnia and Iraq, international administrations have equated the development of civil society with 'democratization.' Using detailed empirical evidence from Br\u010dko District, Bosnia, the paper explores how these surrogate state agencies have used legal instruments to shape the conduct and institutions of civil society. Consequently, the examples of Bosnia and Iraq highlight the fraught moral and political questions prompted by contemporary practices of state building.\n      </p>", "The Iran-Iraq war, which took place from 1980 to 1988, was one of the longest and bloodiest conventional wars in the history of the last century. The war was also the largest mobilization of the Iranian population and was achieved primarily by producing and promoting a culture of martyrdom based on religious themes found in Shi'i Islam. It was the war that created and consolidated what we know today as the Islamic republic of Iran. For years there have been two popular public discourses in post-war Iran: the secular discourse, which is to evade, to ignore, to escape to the Caspian; and then the state's discourse, of the strong, mourning women and the heroic martyrs. It is the group of women who exist betwixt the dominant discourses of the secular versus the religious and the idea of womanhood versus motherhood that I am interested in exploring here by looking at the most recent work of a secular female filmmaker, Rakhshan Bani-Etemad.\n      </p>", "The application of power cycle theory to Iraq's war decisions reveals the dynamics of an increasingly competitive Middle East system. Iraq's power share rose sharply from 1975 to an abrupt inflection by 1980, just after Iran's inflected decline, an explosive mix that provided the context for Saddam Hussein's decision to invade Iran. Although Iraq gained slowly in relative power during the war with Iran, by 1987 Iraq had entered a period of decline relative to its Gulf rivals that continued through its invasion of Kuwait. The relative power winners, at Iraq's expense, were Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. That Iraq was in relative decline before invading Kuwait reconciles the seeming contradiction of Iraq as both an expansive potential hegemon and a desperate war-exhausted economy. /// La th\u00e9orie de cycle du pouvoir invite \u00e0 expliquer les actions guerri\u00e8res de l'Iraq en fonction de la dynamique d'un Moyen Orient de plus en plus tiraill\u00e9 par la comp\u00e9tition.

These estimates have since been held to be implausibly high by a working group set up by an Independent Inquiry Committee appointed by the United Nations Secretary-General. We believe the working group's own estimates are seriously flawed and cannot be regarded as a credible challenge to our own. To obtain their estimates, they reject as unreliable the evidence of the 1999 Iraq Child and Maternal Mortality Survey\u2014despite clear evidence of its internal coherence and supporting evidence from another, independent survey. They prefer to rely on the 1987 and 1997 censuses and on data obtained in a format that had elsewhere been rejected as unreliable 30 years earlier.\n      </p>", "In the early stages of the counterinsurgency campaign in Iraq, military leaders resisted the release of body count and \"casualty ratio\" data. However, in the spring of 2004, the U.S. military (and American media) began to focus on the \"limited\" American casualties in specific operations versus the \"significant\" number of insurgents killed. This article examines the extent to which body count/casualty ratio \"frames\" and individual casualty tolerance influence public perceptions about the war and the success or failure of U.S. military operations. Two experiments were conducted pitting alternative casualty frames against one another to measure their relative impact. The results demonstrate the influence of framing effects on public perceptions and clarify understanding of the determinants and impact of casualty tolerance.\n      </p>", "Presidential election outcomes are well explained by just two objectively measured fundamental determinants: (1) weighted-average growth of per capita real personal disposable income over the term, and (2) cumulative US military fatalities owing to unprovoked, hostile deployments of American armed forces in foreign conflicts. The US economy weakened at the beginning of 2008 and average per capita real income growth probably will be only around 0.75% at Election Day. Moreover cumulative US military fatalities in Iraq will reach 4,300 or more. Given those fundamental conditions, the Bread and Peace model predicts a Republican two-party vote share centered on 48.2%.\n      </p>", "During Operation Iraqi Freedom, the Pentagon introduced a program \"embedding\" journalists in military units. Embedded reporters have been widely criticized for allegedly failing to adequately cover effects of the war on Iraqi civilians, while over-emphasizing the personal lives of troops. Proponents of the embedding program argue that the program provides journalists with a detailed understanding of military culture and life on the frontline. In addition to the embedded reporters, some journalists were stationed in Baghdad and others were independent and free to roam. I argue that these three journalistic vantage points channeled reporters toward particular news content, while limiting their access to others. I hypothesize that while embedded reporters effectively presented the military experience of the war and the Baghdad-stationed reporters successfully covered the Iraqi experience of the war, the independent reporters were able to provide the most balanced coverage of the war. I demonstrate that despite the largely one-sided story presented, articles by embedded journalists were both more prominent and more widely available than coverage from other vantage points. Due to the dominance of embedded reporting, I conclude by noting that the majority of war coverage in print media heavily emphasized the soldier's experience of the war, while downplaying the effects of the invasion on the Iraqi people. By conducting a content analysis of 742 print news articles by 156 journalists from the major combat period of the war, this study offers one of the first systematic documentations of the substantive content of Iraq war coverage.\n      </p>", "Since 2003 several Web sites have appeared that track the number of deaths of coalition personnel in the current Iraq conflict. The paper proposes the use of a recently developed multiscale variance stabilization method (the data-driven Haar-Fisz transform) to obtain good estimates of the mean intensity of deaths and demonstrates its statistical advantages over both the running mean (which is currently used on some Web sites) and also the Box-Cox transformation. The paper analyses both the number of deaths due to all causes and also due to hostile actions between June 2003 and March 2006. In both cases it appears that the marginal variance of both time series is an increasing function of the marginal mean. Further, although our estimates exhibit peaks that are related to local increases in intensity of conflict there appears to be a clear underlying increase in intensity of conflict during the conflict but with a decline and levelling off since June 2005. The paper also proposes a tentative inverse relationship between deaths due to non-hostile actions and deaths due to hostile actions.\n      </p>", "In the Vietnam and Iraq conflicts, British Prime Ministers were asked to contribute forces to an American-led war that was deeply unpopular in the United Kingdom. This presented Harold Wilson and Tony Blair with conflicting incentives and constraints: to support their senior ally or to make policy based upon domestic considerations. Why did Harold Wilson decline to commit British forces while Tony Blair agreed to do so? With situational factors generating conflicting predictions, I argue that investigation of individual-level variables is necessary. In particular, I suggest that leaders vary systematically in their willingness to subordinate the concerns of constituents to strategic imperatives, and that introducing the leadership style categories of \"constraint challenger\" and \"constraint respecter\" can make more determinate the linkage between domestic politics and strategic concerns.\n      </p>", "This article examines the development of a women's movement in Iraq since the invasion in 2003. It describes the types of activities and the strategies of different women activists, as well as highlighting the main divisions among them.

Communal and sectarian tensions had been fostered by the previous regime as well as by the political opposition in exile prior to 2003, but the systematic destruction of national institutions, such as the army and the police, by the occupation forces, has led to a flare-up of the sectarian conflict.

Disputes have arisen over Syrian closure of Iraqi oil pipelines, the allocation of water flowing from the Euphrates and Syrian support of Iran during the Iraq-Iran war.

Research has revealed the proliferation of such discourse among soldiers, military strategists, reporters, and World Wide Web users to refer to hostile, unsecured, and dangerous territory in Iraq and Afghanistan. The salience of this symbol in 21st-century U.S. armed conflicts attests to its staying power in national narratives of colonialism at home and abroad. Summoning the \"Indian wars\" of the 19th century in the U.S. West as malleable symbolic parallels to the current war in Iraq serves to offer combat lessons in guerilla warfare while reinscribing epic stories of U.S. military imperialism and renarrating uncritically the struggles and conflicts of Native Americans, past and present, through the lens of contemporary perspectives on terrorism.\n      </p>", "After the invasion, America was supposed to help Iraq become a model democracy.

Ironically, many women's gains obtained under Saddam's Ba'athist regime were subsequently lost under the same regime. The end of Saddam's government in 2003 likewise led to contradictory outcomes for Iraqi women, empowering them in some ways and making them more vulnerable in others. Iraqi women themselves displayed a variety of dispositions, from the pre-2003 Ba'athist-controlled General Federation of Iraqi Women, to Shiite religious conservative women's groups, secular progressive Kurdish women's associations operating in autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan, and American-sponsored progressive women's organizations based in Baghdad.

We examine how messages of party conflict and cooperation affect public opinion regarding national security, as well as whether and how the reputations of media outlets matter. We develop a typology of partisan messages in the news, determining their likely effects based on the characteristics of the speaker, listener, news outlet, and message content. We hypothesize that criticism of a Republican president by his fellow partisan elites should be exceptionally damaging (especially on a conservative media outlet), while opposition party praise of the president should be the most helpful (especially on a liberal outlet). We test our hypotheses through an experiment and a national survey on attitudes regarding the Iraq War. The results show that credible communication (i.e., \"costly\" rhetoric harmful to a party) is more influential than \"cheap talk\" in moving public opinion. Ironically, news media outlets perceived as ideologically hostile can actually enhance the credibility of certain messages relative to \"friendly\" news sources.\n      </p>", "Over 70 years ago, the United Kingdom's occupation of Iraq proved so unpopular at home that London has to declare success and head for the exit.

In another category, women's images and roles in the conflict are re-constructed.

A social tie to a conflict's casualty transforms abstract costs into a vivid personal experience that increases the likelihood an individual disapproves of the president.

We identify the cultural and political evolution of the discursive legacy of \"support the troops\" from the Vietnam War through the Iraq War. Using longitudinal and comparative organizational analyses, we analyze how this discursive legacy was engaged by U.S. peace movement organizations (PMOs).\n         PMOs frequently made positive references to U.S. troops during both the Gulf War and Iraq War, creating a stable discourse centered around supporting the troops. Moreover, during the Gulf War the movement expanded the web of support by asking who else should be cared about beyond the troops, thus de-coupling the support discourse from the nation and the state. During the Iraq War, PMOs also developed an elaborated \"discourse of betrayal\" by redefining what it means to support the troops. Here they deployed proactive, anticipatory discourses, turning the tables on the Bush administration. PMOs also increasingly criticized the troops during the Iraq War due to well publicized human rights abuses.\n         The findings demonstrate that movement discourses are both stable and flexible, influenced by past rounds of discursive contention as well as contemporary political events. We highlight the cultural constraints imposed on movements by dominant discursive legacies, and the strategic responses made by movements in response to emerging discursive opportunities.\n      </p>", "This article examines between-group differences in support for military action in the period since the Vietnam War. During the Vietnam War, support for military action was stronger among men, whites, the more educated, the more affluent, and younger persons. In the post-Vietnam era, men have remained consistently more supportive of military action, despite recent changes in gender roles and gender politics. Racial differences have remained strong, but not uniformly so. The gap between whites and nonwhites has been most pronounced in periods of intense partisanship or when military events have sparked a \"rally-'round-the-flag\" response that affected whites more than nonwhites. Education and income differences have generally followed a similar pattern, although there are signs of a weakening (or even reversal) of differences in attitudes to war on the education variable. Another change in the post-Vietnam era has been the relative decline in support for military action among younger persons. These data are used to explore the diverse causes and meanings of attitudes toward the use of military force and to assess the implications of the social distribution of pro- and antiwar opinion for the conduct of U.S foreign policy and political mobilization on issues of war and peace.\n      </p>", "We consider and explore structural breaks in a day-by-day time series of civilian casualties for the current Iraq conflict: an undertaking of potential interest to scholars of international relations, comparative politics, and American politics.

There was overwhelming agreement among Americans that the only way to disarm Iraq was to remove Saddam Hussein. Nevertheless, despite this general consensus, responses to the removal of Hussein still clearly were colored by religious factors. Religious factors also shaped support for invading Iraq and views of Islam as a violent religion. The important effects of religion on such issues hold even in light of multivariate analyses, as religious variables tended to rival political variables and usually exceeded socio-demographic variables in explaining differences on such issues.\n      </p>", "This paper examines the impact of financial repression policies from 1970 to 2002, and the results of the financial liberalization polices between the years 2003-2007 on the financial development of Iraq. By using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model, the paper argues that neither the financial repression policies nor the financial liberalization polices promoted the financial development of Iraq. This fact suggests that Iraq's policy-makers have to launch multi-pronged measures, such as promoting private sector enterprises, reducing informal activities in the economy, stabilizing macroeconomic variables (reduction of fiscal deficit and inflation rate), and, most importantly, restore political and social security, in order to ensure the economic prosperity of the country.

It provides a different perspective with regard to the significance of sanctions in general, and against Iraq in particular. In contrast to the traditional use of the \"punitive model\" of sanctions, which mandated full compliance without reciprocating, this study offers a \"bargaining model\" framework that focuses on the process of negotiation and concessions for partial compliance. It claims that a decade of multilateral punitive sanctions against Iraq has led to some Iraqi compliance and the partial fulfillment of many of the UN's cease-fire objectives. But the failure of the UN to use the bargaining model to reciprocate Iraq squandered opportunities for additional Iraqi cooperation, and generated dynamics of deepening distrust and animosity made a negotiated solution more difficult and war a reality.\n      </p>", "Many contend that President Bush's reelection and increased vote share in 2004 prove that the Iraq War was either electorally irrelevant or aided him. We present contrary evidence. Focusing on the change in Bush's 2004 showing compared to 2000, we discover that Iraq casualties from a state significantly depressed the President's vote share there. We infer that were it not for the approximately 10,000 U.S. dead and wounded by Election Day, Bush would have won nearly 2% more of the national popular vote, carrying several additional states and winning decisively. Such a result would have been close to forecasts based on models that did not include war impacts. Casualty effects are largest in \"blue\" states. In contrast, National Guard/Reservist call-ups had no impact beyond the main casualty effect.

Until recently, it has generally been thought that there was a sharp rise in the level of child mortality in the country during the early 1990s as a result of the first Gulf war and the accompanying United Nations economic sanctions. The main basis for this view was a survey conducted in 1999. However, estimates of the level and trend in child mortality are now available from two additional surveys. Neither of the new sets of estimates show any sign of a sharp increase in child mortality in the early 1990s.

In this paper, we examine the implications of these election results for the design of Iraq's federal system. Our focus is on the character of the subunits in any future system, specifically on whether Iraq should adopt a form of territorial federalism based on the country's existing eighteen provinces (as most scholars argue) or whether a form of ethnic, or \"plurinational,\" federalism based on five regions would be better able to address the very significant problems created by the election results.

While al Qaeda is not strong enough to launch an attack inside the United States in the next five years, it will continue to train militants for successful attacks in Europe. Al Qaeda s leadership is likely to remain in place for years, and it is unlikely to lose its safe haven on the Afghan-Pakistan border in the near term, although it has suffered real reverses in Iraq. Al Qaeda and its affiliated groups will, in the long term, implode because of their unrestrained violence against fellow Muslims and lack of a real plan for governance, both of which make it difficult for them to transform into a genuine, political mass movement.\n      </p>", "Red and blue flowered pimpernels commonly referred to Anagallis arvensis s. l. were studied in Egypt, Iraq, and adjacent territories.

It assesses the occupational factors and deployment experiences associated with heavy drinking in regular UK servicemen deployed to Iraq in the first phase of the 2003 Iraq War (Operation TELIC 1, the military codename for the conflict in Iraq). Methods: A random representative sample of 3578 regular male UK Armed Forces personnel who were deployed to Iraq during Operation TELIC 1 participated in a cross-sectional postal questionnaire study (response rate 61%). Participants completed a questionnaire, between June 2004 and March 2006 (ie, after deployment), about their health, including a measure of alcohol use (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, AUDIT) and questions about their experiences on deployment to Iraq. Heavy drinkers were identified as those scoring 16 or above on the AUDIT. Results: After adjustment for sociodemographic and military factors, and the presence of psychological distress, heavy drinkers were more likely to have had major problems at home during (odds ratio (OR) 1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 1.70) and following their deployment (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.14). Being deployed with their parent unit (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.61), medium to high in-theatre unit comradeship (medium: OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.77; high: OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.79) and poor unit leadership (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.31) were also associated with heavy drinking. Conclusions: Deployment experiences and problems at home during and following deployment, as well as the occupational milieu of the unit, influence personnel's risk of heavy drinking.\n      </p>", "Thirty years after the Israeli attack on the Osirak reactor in June 1981 the consequences for Iraq's nuclear weapons program remain hotly debated. A new history of this program, based on several new Iraqi sources, yields a net assessment of the impact of the Israeli attack that differs from prevailing accounts. The attack had mixed effects: it triggered a covert nuclear weapons program that did not previously exist, while necessitating a more difficult and timeconsuming technical route to developing nuclear weapons. Notwithstanding gross inefficiencies in the ensuing program, a decade later Iraq stood on the threshold of a nuclear weapons capability. This case suggests that preventive attacks can increase the long-term proliferation risk posed by the targeted state.\n      </p>", "Scholars assume that citizens perform better when they know pertinent facts. Factual beliefs, however, become relevant for political judgments only when people interpret them. Interpretations provide opportunities for partisans to rationalize their existing opinions. Using panel studies, we examine whether and how partisans updated factual beliefs, interpretations of beliefs, and opinions about the handling of the Iraq war as real-world conditions changed. Most respondents held similar, fairly accurate beliefs about facts. But interpretations varied across partisan groups in predictable ways. In turn, interpretations, not beliefs, drove opinions. Perversely, the better informed more effectively used interpretations to buttress their existing partisan views.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

We propose that the current structure of policy and critique is now institutionalized and formatted as War Programming, which connects criticism within a narrative sequence, including critiques and reflections about journalistic failings. The scope of the action is so immense that it precludes and preempts its critique. The second objective is to show how the rationale for the invasion was developed as a \"public conspiracy\" over a decade by the members of the Project for a New American Century (PNAC).

Qualitative content analysis of news materials suggests that the news sources and media shared a logic and perspective about \"timely and entertaining news.\" The PNAC plan was not publicized by the major news media because it fell outside the focus of the Bush administration's propaganda campaign to demonize Iraq and its leader Saddam Hussein, who was held to be responsible for attacks on the United States.

The first, from 1958 til 1970, was characterized by expropriation of large land holdings without changes in land use organization. The second period from 1970 til 1975 saw many pragmatic regulations brought about by the Baath regime, while the third period from 1975 til 1981 led to considerable changes in the agrarian structure based on the availability of large sums of money derived from the oil revenues. A large number of publications and documents are available about the first two periods, the developments during the third period however, are largely unknown until today. The following paper is therefore mainly concerned with these developments. Since about 1975 the government of Iraq has been able to undertake expensive projects in the agricultural field. The revenue from the crude oil not only has permitted to pay for extensive reforms in land cultivation, it has also allowed to improve the living standard of the rural population through high investments in infrastructure and the payment of subsidies for consumer goods. To achieve this the population of many areas in northern Iraq has been resettled sometimes by force from their small villages into rural towns. The cultivation of the fields has been done through cooperatives aided by large state owned machine and tractor parks. Parallel to this development in the state and cooperative sector runs an interesting form of land use by private enterprise which is not only tolerated by the socialist Baath regime but also supported by it through favourable loans. Obviously the political leaders of Iraq have realized that generous support of private initiative will advance the economic development of the country more than central planning. This contributes to the general contentment and thus to the stabilisation of political power, and social mobility and diversity are being promoted.\n      </p>", "The 'information gap' regarding Iraq's weapons programme has been effectively used by the US to continue enforcement of sanctions against Iraq.\n      </p>", "A large body of research by political scientists, psychologists and historians suggests that \"existential security\"--the feeling that survival can be taken for granted--is conducive to tolerance of foreigners, openness to social change and a pro-democratic political culture. Conversely, existential insecurity leads to 1) xenophobia and 2) strong in-group solidarity. This article tests these hypotheses against evidence from a recent survey of Iraq--a society where one would expect to find exceptionally high levels of insecurity. We find that the Iraqi public today shows the highest level of xenophobia found in any of the 85 societies for which data are available--together with extremely high levels of solidarity with one's own ethnic group.\n      </p>", "This study compares attitudes toward the war in Iraq and President Bush's handling of the war among service members by race, gender and class using data from the 2003 Military Times Poll, examining similarities and differences to trends found in civilian data. Overall, at the time of the poll, most service members reported that they believe that the U.S. should have gone to war in Iraq and approved of the President's handling of Iraq. However, initial analysis shows that Whites, men, officers, and Marines show the greatest support, following trends found in civilian polls addressing issues of race and gender. Advanced analysis shows that some of these findings continue while controlling for political ideology and other background characteristics. Specifically, being African American continues to be negatively associated with war support controlling for all other factors. The impacts of gender and class, as measured by rank, are reduced substantially when controlling for political ideology. These findings partially support the idea that minorities in society have less vested in the use of force in foreign policy and thus should report less support for such endeavors.\n      </p>", "Fifteen species, one of which is new, of the genera Hedbergella Br\u00f6nnimann and Brown, 1958, Loeblichella Pessagno, 1967, Abathomphalus Bolli, Loeblich, and Tappan, 1957, Globotruncanella Reiss, 1957, emend.
