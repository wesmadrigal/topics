Elements of their history and sociocultural background in the countries of origin are discussed in order to explain the emergence and status of ethnic identity in a complex new society with a shared background ideology of integration (Zionism). An assessment is made of the (perceived) initial religious and social marginality of the two groups as it may have interacted with their social \"careers\" and group status. The socioeconomic structure of Israeli society has contributed to \"reproducing ethnicity.\" The analysis suggests that the \"Indian\" and \"Ethiopian\" Jewish subidentities are now well-established in Israel, illustrating that the cultural content of \"Jewishness\" or Jewish identity is quite diverse.\n      </p>", "Arkia Israel Airlines was established in 1949 by El Al, Israel's national airline, and the Histadrut Labor Federation, the biggest employees' union in Israel. The move was encouraged by the Israeli government to establish an air link between central Israel and the then southern outpost, Eilat. Initially, the company served as a domestic airline only, and engaged solely in aviation. In 1980, Arkia became the first state company in Israel to be privatized, its new owners being Kanaf Arkia and the company's employees. Arkia is presently owned by Knafaim--Arkia Holdings Ltd.

In this paper, we document changes in their attainment of various educational levels across cohorts born from the mid-1920s to the 1970s. We make comparisons among different Arab religious groups, between men and women, and between Arabs and the majority Jewish populations in Israel. We find that over consecutive birth cohorts, substantial ethnic differences in educational attainment have narrowed at the lower levels of schooling, but have increased at higher levels. Moreover, the results indicate that the disadvantage of Muslim Arabs in terms of entry into and completion of high school can be accounted for only partially by differences in the social status of their parents and characteristics of their neighbourhoods. The findings suggest that long-term historical differences among groups and discriminatory practices towards Arabs are important factors in explanations of disparities in educational attainment.\n      </p>", "Early Cretaceous fossil tadpoles from Isreal are referred to Shomronella jordanica gen. et sp. nov. and assigned to the frog family Pipidae. The fossils are well preserved, many bones are uncrushed, and a number of features of soft anatomy are preserved, including body outline, choroid cup of eye, thymus gland, cephalic blood vessels, and spinal nerves. The fossils are compared with the normal tables of development for living Xenopus laevis, and the majority correspond approximately to stage 57-59; a small specimen (the only one lacking both fore- and hindlimbs) appears to be at about stage 52-53 and the most mature specimen at about stage 60-61. Shomronella jordanica, although clearly pipid, has few derived character states in common with other pipid species, either fossil or Holocene, and in some respects seems to be the most primitive known member of the group. It shares some primitive character states with other Cretaceous pipids from Israel and some with a morphologically primitive living genus (Xenopus); outside of the Pipidae there are some resemblances to the extinct pipoid family Palaeobatrachidae. Shomronella jordanica is distinctive in the shape of its parasphenoid and cleithrum. These fossil tadpoles are of interest in demonstrating the extremely ancient development of the pipid tadpole and its midwater filter-feeding adaptation.\n      </p>", "Allium tel-avivense Eig (Liliaceae), endemic to Israel, is lectotypified.\n      </p>", "We describe how Israel effected new tuberculosis programs and policies beginning in the early 1990s.

Previous studies of these statuettes have focussed around the issues of antiquity and authenticity. Those who have erroneously accepted the antiquity of the statuettes have ignored the issue of relations between the Falasha and external forces, and seen these works as a valuable clue concerning their past. Those who have recognized that such statuettes are a form of 'tourist art' and date back no later than the 1960s have tended to dismiss them as inauthentic. This article argues that these statuettes provide valuable insights concerning changing forms of 'Ethiopian Jewish' identity and relations with outsiders. In particular, emphasis is placed on the evolution of the statuettes from Jewish ethnic art in Ethiopia to Ethiopian ethnic art in Israel. /// Cet article est consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9tude des statuettes produites par les Beta Isra\u00ebl tant en \u00c9thiopie qu'en Isra\u00ebl.

The research in this article shines a different, statistical light on this question: based on a survey of 500 citizens in each of 10 European countries, the authors ask whether those individuals with extreme anti-Israel views are more likely to be anti-Semitic. Even after controlling for numerous potentially confounding factors, they find that anti-Israel sentiment consistently predicts the probability that an individual is anti-Semitic, with the likelihood of measured anti-Semitism increasing with the extent of anti-Israel sentiment observed.\n      </p>", "Maximum altitudes of soaring migration for White Pelicans (Pelecanus onocrotalus), White Storks (Ciconia ciconia), Lesser Spotted Eagles (Aquila pomarina), and Honey Buzzards (Pernis apivorus) were measured in central west Israel and compared to the upper boundary of thermal convection and thermal intensity as predicted by the convection model ALPTHERM. The model predictions of upper boundary of convection explained at least 20% of the variance in maximum altitudes of migration for each species studied. Each species used thermal convection differently. White Pelicans, with the largest wing loading, used 54% of the thermal boundary layer, as calculated by dividing the maximum flight altitude by the modeled thermal depth. White Storks and Lesser Spotted Eagles used 69% and 65%, respectively; Honey Buzzards, with the lowest wing loading, used 95% of the thermal boundary layer. Mean lift rate of convection had a stronger effect on maximum altitudes of flight or the proportion of the thermal boundary layer used by Lesser Spotted Eagles and Honey Buzzards, than it did on storks and pelicans. Honey Buzzards, which combine flapping with soaring flight, were not confined to the thermal boundary layer. Changes in migration altitudes within a species and differential use of thermal convection between species were related to a combination of upper boundary of thermal convection, average lift rate, migratory behavior, wing loading, topography, and additional local meteorological conditions. /// Se midieron las alturas m\u00e1ximas de planeo elevado durante la migraci\u00f3n al oeste de Israel central para Pelecanus onocrotalus, Ciconia ciconia, Aquila pomarina y Pernis apivorus, y se compararon con el l\u00edmite superior de la convecci\u00f3n y la intensidad t\u00e9rmica predicho por el modelo de convecci\u00f3n ALPTHERM.

Consequently, Israeli women are the world's most intensive consumers of IVF. This 2006 study explored the perceptions of Israeli IVF patients about the treatment and their experiences, probing possible links between state policy and women's choices and health. Israeli women (n=137), all currently undergoing IVF, were invited to fill out questionnaires. The questionnaires were delivered in five IVF centres by university nursing students or by the clinics' nurses. Most women were optimistic they would become pregnant, and described the treatment as having modest or no negative effects on their lives. They expressed a sweeping commitment to IVF, which they were willing to repeat \"as many times as needed\". At the same time, the majority appeared to have very partial treatment-related knowledge and marginalised side effects, even though they had experienced some themselves. We interpret the observed favourable image of IVF as closely related to the encouragement implied in the extensive state funding of IVF and in the Jewish Israeli tradition of pronatalism, which may account for the virtual absence of critical public debate on the subject. /// Isra\u00ebl prend presque totalement en charge le financement de la f\u00e9condation in vitro (FIV) pour toute Isra\u00e9lienne, quel que soit son \u00e9tat civil ou son orientation sexuelle, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'elle ait deux enfants avec son partenaire actuel.

Based on a largely qualitative assessment of initiatives to change municipal boundaries of Arab localities in Israel between the 1960s and 2001, we aim to demonstrate the tension between geographical-administrative considerations and political, particularly geopolitical, issues at two levels: Arab claims and central government decisions. We emphasize that municipal boundary conflicts provide broader insights on societal transformations and dilemmas, as well as influencing them. Growing activism of Arabs and trends of political decentralization led not only to class-based demands, but also to ethno-national-based demands. In addition to development needs with an emphasis on equality, claims of Arab municipalities also reflect aspirations to reverse consequences of the 1948 war and to redefine the Jewish essence of the state. A major dilemma among Arabs is whether to emphasize geographic-administrative justifications or to explicitly take the ethno-national path. Among central government decision-makers, an explicitly political discourse has apparently given way to a professional one, which faces dilemmas of incorporating unique political-cultural attributes of Arabs in professional assessments, and balancing them with concerns of security and state identity. Whereas professional jargon is not value free and can mask political agendas, dialogues based on a professional jargon could lead to solutions in otherwise dead-end political disputes, although such dialogues could gain momentum only if showing results.\n      </p>", "Diabetes mellitus is an important chronic disease with a growing prevalence that absorbs an ever increasing investment of resources. This population-based study evaluated the direct medical costs of diabetes mellitus in an HMO setting. We evaluated both the total cost of diabetic patients and their added cost in comparison to other HMO members (diabetes-related costs). Data were obtained for the years 1999-2001 in a cohort of 24,632 diabetic patients followed up for 3 years drawn from the computerized medical administrative database of a large HMO in Israel, insuring around 25% of the population. The mean direct cost of the medical treatment of a diabetic patient rose 29% from US $2,017 in 1999 to $2,601 in 2001 (in 2001 terms) in comparison to a 19.7% rise (from $1,246 to $1,492). Hospitalizations, medication, and physician visits account for 39%, 29%, and 21% of the total diabetic patient costs, respectively. Dialysis, insulin intake, impaired creatinine, and elevated HbA1c were associated with increased expenditures. According to our results, the total national medical cost of diabetes alone in 2001 was $317 million and that of diabetic patients was $564 million, 6.9% and 12.4% of the total Israeli HMO budget, respectively. The study presents the use of a population-based computerized database to comprehensively assess the economic burden of disease and the potential savings from prevention. The study data suggest a rise in the cost of diabetes which has implications for prevention and treatment policies.\n      </p>", "This paper discusses the relations between secularism, religion and nationalism in Israel and offers a thesis about the failure of secularism there. The papers adopts Michael Mann's view of \"religion\" as a private case of ideological network of power and suggests a typology of four possible heuristic modules of political legitimacy, which are composed of different blends of nationalism and religionism (the suffix \"ism\" is added to underline Mann's view of religion as an ideology). These modules are constructed by the crosscutting of two axes: the axis of nationalism, which taps \"weak\" to \"strong\" nationalism, and the axis of religionism, which taps \"weak\" to \"strong\" religion (wherein the ultimate case of \"weak religion\" means secularism). The four modules are the following: strong nationalism/weak religionism: this is the case of a dominant and energetic secular nationalism. Strong nationalism/strong religionism: this is the case of a fusion between strong nationalism and strong religionism, which creates a kind of indissoluble mesh of \"religious nationalism\". Weak nationalism/ weak religionism: this module represents a polity which is not founded upon strong pre-political \"primordial\" or ascriptive, national or religious, communal identity, but is rather constitutionally or \"contractually\" oriented. Weak nationalism/strong religionism: historically, this combination represents pre-modern and thus pre-national cultures, in which religion was pervasive as a communal identity. Presently, this combination can represent a type of communal \"post- nationalism\" or a transnational fundamentalism. The paper explains how Israeli political culture had moved from the type of strong nationalism/weak religionism to the type of strong nationalism/strong religionism, which is inimical to secularism.\n      </p>", "The purpose of this study was to explore the weekly cycle of mortality among Jews in Israel. Drawing on previous research on the association between holy-days and the timing of death, we hypothesized that mortality of Jews declines on Sabbath (Saturday), and rises to a peak on Sundays. We analysed daily numbers of deaths of Jewish men and women aged 5 and above in Israel from 1983 to 1992, and found a clear and significant dip-peak pattern in the number of deaths around the Sabbath. This pattern was found for all causes of death, was stronger for men than for women, and was not found among young Jewish children, or among the non-Jewish population.\n      </p>", "We examined hypertension control during the Israel doctors' strike in a defined insured population of known hypertensives enrolled in a nurse-based hypertension control program. The strike was associated with a measurable increase in the prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension which was limited to males of relatively higher social class. No strike-related changes in hypertension control were seen for women or lower social class males. We infer from this finding that the presence of a physician is a necessary component of good hypertension control in the sub-group of males of higher socioeconomic status. The incidence of hypertension-related complications in this relatively non-compliant subpopulation needs further investigation.\n      </p>", "From its inception, modern Zionism offered a Jewish identity of strength and courage as an alternative to what was seen as weakness and helplessness. Following the Holocaust, death anxiety was deflected into aggressive energy when combating the invading Arab armies during Israel's War of Independence. The balance between aggression and fear of annihilation was severely upset by the threat of trauma repetition prior to the Six-Day War and the resulting release of strength, power, and aggression, which threw the country into a position of fear-denying omnipotence. The illusion of this grandiose position burst in the Yom Kippur War of 1973, and the Lebanon War of 1982 was, in part, a futile attempt to reinstate it. In encounters with the intifada, fear and aggression have been fused internally (as when firearms are used mistakenly out of fear) as well as vis-\u00e0-vis the enemy, while simultaneously the borders of the state of Israel are being psychologically re-established. Because of the intimate relationship between the individual and collective processes, the latter influence, and are in turn reflected in, the former. The individual thus reflects the severance of the balance between strength/aggression and fear of annihilation, which can be observed in cases where the person feels invaded by anxiety or, differently, expresses himself by power, aggression and heroism, disconnected from and denying fear.\n      </p>", "Intelligence work is based on the gathering of information, including cartographic material for preparing new maps.

Since 1995 thousands of Chinese workers have been recruited, mainly from villages across Fujian, for construction work in Israel, in 1998 an evangelical church was established in Tel Aviv, and its personnel evangelize with considerable success among Chinese workers. The work visa of Chinese workers in Israel is limited to a maximum of five years. Consequently , their church membership is limited in duration, and the church plays no role in the facilitation of migrants' seulement. The constricted role of the church forcefully raises the question of why Chinese workers convert to Christianity. This article draws attention to the impact of conversion on the life of Chinese workers upon their return to China. The article argues that a conversion to Christianity in Israel permits Chinese temporary migrants to accumulate cultural, symbolic, and social capital, which can be effectively deployed in China.\n      </p>", "Data on localities from which insectivorous bats were collected or sighted in Israel were compiled into a Geographical Information System (GIS) in order to analyse patterns of species distribution. By intersecting precipitation and temperature data with spatially-referenced data on species observations stored in the GIS we determined the `climatic envelope' of each species and constructed predictive maps which show the potential distribution of each species. Using cluster analysis, the bats were classified into three main biogeographic groups according to their distribution, namely desert, Mediterranean, and widespread in Israel. The potential distribution maps of all the species indicate that there are areas which have suitable bat habitats but from which bats have never been collected or observed. In the Mediterranean region of Israel, this is attributed to a large reduction in population size due to fumigation of caves, cave visitation and secondary poisoning.\n      </p>", "The paper shows that characteristics of immigrants at the time of immigration affect both long-term occupational achievements and income at the end of the labor force career, after age 59. Data representing 174,000 Jewish males 60 and older from a 1985 survey by the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics are analyzed to show how the timing of immigration, the number of years in the country, age at immigration, country of origin, and educational resources at time of immigration are related to years in the labor force in the host country, occupational achievement, pension entitlement and income after age 59. Both direct and indirect effects are analyzed. The results show the importance of immigration characteristics on long-term socio-economic adjustment, and the necessity of considering social status over the life course as an indicator of long-term immigrant adjustment. Decomposition of the effect of country of origin pinpoints what characteristics at time of immigration influence social status differences in ethnic groups at older ages.

A more detailed analysis of the rates among different Jewish ethnic groups also showed low rates. While Jewish males born in Europe-America (EA) had an 11% increase in rates between 1962-66 and 1977-82, Jewish males from Asian-African (AA) origin had a 45% increase resulting in current higher rates among North African than among East European Jews (the two dominant ethnic groups in Israel). In Jewish females, rates have been relatively stable from 1972 to 1982 and were almost twice as high for females born in EA than females born in AA with less prominent differences between countries. While smoking patterns probably explain the increase in rates among Asian-African Jewish males, other possible risk factors as well as the overall smoking prevalence cannot explain the low incidence in the major ethnic Jewish groups.

Nonetheless, having reformulated their claims in terms of Jewish cultural pluralism instead of race, the Black Hebrews continue to demand full Israeli citizenship. Rejecting postnational splits among identity, legal status, and territory, their soulful claims suggest a model of citizenship that opens new space for misplaced people(s) to gain membership in the states that meet their cultural aspirations and nourish their souls.\n      </p>", "Settlement frontiers may bring about the production of political settlement myths leading future settlers to frontier settlements. Such myths may develop through three phases of geographical interpretation: (i) the realization or consumption of previous myths, (ii) ideological loading of the landscape and (iii) the emergence of mythical space. These phases, notably the latter, are expressed in various outlets of the collective memory and civil religion. Zionist political settlement myths may be interpreted as dealing with environmental struggles, social development and security. These myths are interrelated with several chains of local or regional settlement processes and events: produced myth comes to be consumed by later settlers. But the creation of such myths emanates from the urban cores of Jaffa, Tel-Aviv and Jerusalem.\n      </p>", "Lung cancer rates in Israel are lower than in other Western countries, not explainable by smoking habits. Due to the different relation of Squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) and Adenocarcinoma (AC) with smoking it was of interest to study the histologic distribution in Israel. A total of 7508 histologically confirmed lung cancer cases among Jews were studied in the period 1962-82. SqCC was the leading tumor-type in Jewish men and AC in Jewish women. European-American born males in the last study period showed a decrease in SqCC rate while Asian-African born males showed a steep increase in SqCC rate, most prominent among the younger age-groups. Rates of AC increased in both, European-American and Asian-African males, but more steeply in the latter in most age-groups. Only for Large cell carcinoma were the overall rates higher in Asian-African than in European-American born males. SqCC increased in European-American born females and also steeply increased in the over 55 year old Asian-African born females. AC increased in European-American born females (both young and old), but only in the young Asian-African born females (decreasing in the older). European-American born Jews still have higher rates of both, more and less smoking related lung cancer histological types, than Asian-African born Jews. The steep increase in rates of some of the histological types in the latter with the pronounced increase in the younger age-groups is expected to cause a change in teh ethnic rate-ratio which has already been demonstrated for the overall lung cancer rates. This probably reflects the acquisition of Western habits (mainly smoking) by the Jews from less developed countries.\n      </p>", "Israeli political psychology has been preoccupied with the particular problems of the Israeli society. The Israeli-Arab conflict, Jewish-Palestinian relations, and intrasocietal conflicts draw special attention. In addition, Israeli researchers contribute to various general areas of political psychology not related to specific problems of Israel.\n      </p>", "Background: Measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine replaced monovalent measles vaccine in the routine childhood vaccination schedule in Israel in December 1988, primarily to achieve the elimination of the congenital rubella syndrome. In this observational study, we report on changes in reported mumps incidence in Israel from the time of the introduction of MMR vaccine until the end of 1998. Methods: The report is based upon passive national surveillance of mumps incidence, which has been notifiable in Israel since 1977. Results: Reported mumps incidence in Israel is now less than 2% the pre-vaccine incidence. Conclusions: In the decade since the introduction of routine mumps vaccination in 1-year-olds in Israel, mumps control has been achieved. Although small outbreaks occur and may continue to occur in future years, because of under-vaccination of children, primary vaccine failure and waning immunity, it can tentatively be said that mumps is no longer a public health problem in Israel.\n      </p>", "Always probing, always challenging, Professor Finkelstein offers here his latest re-evaluation of the pace and process of state development in the Iron Age Levant. Setting the argument within the \"Low Chronology\" he advocates for the early first millennium BCE, strong contrasts between the evolution of complex polities in Israel, Judah and the Transjordanian states are linked to environmental, topographic, demographic, and cultural variables. Certain to invite critical response, this recasting of the process bases itself on archaeological data and warily engages the biblical record.\n      </p>", "In 1955, an outcry broke out in Israel in the wake of Egypt's decision to tighten its blockade of Israeli navigation through the Straits of Tiran. At the same time, Egypt closed the entire airspace over the Straits - then Israel's sole route to Africa - to air traffic to or from Israel. The research community has treated the two respective Israeli 'rights' (freedom of navigation and freedom of overflight) as inseparable. The prevailing view was that both freedoms had been enjoyed unhindered following the 1956 Suez War, when Israel defined the freedom of navigation as a casus belli. However, recently declassified documents have exposed the full story of Israel's freedom of overflight: no civil aviation was renewed over the Straits in this period, despite cabinet meetings, secret negotiations with Egypt and clandestine military flights. In late 1966, Israel's Foreign Ministry decided to take a risk and renew the flights, only to discover that legally no 'freedom' had ever existed.\n      </p>", "A consideration of how identity and knowledge are shaped and played out within the Black Hebrew Israelite Community in Dimona, Israel, this article focuses on the Black Hebrews' redrawn map of Africa as their key legitimating and motivational symbol. It presents the \"Divine Geography\" of this map as a powerful counter-hegemonic strategy for bringing what Foucault has called \"subjugated knowledge\" out into the open and converting an idea into practical action. Based on participant-observation, as well as life-history and focused interviews with Community members, the analysis intertwines narratives and observations to show how the Black Hebrews have moved beyond resisting racism and an unsatisfying identity in America to building their own culture in Israel-as-Africa.\n      </p>", "Using data from a large national representative survey of Palestinian high school students in Israel, this study examines the effect of the local labour market and the internal ethnic/religious segregation between Muslims, Christians and Druze, on students' occupational expectations. The data, which were collected in spring 1997, consisted of two types, these being data regarding students, and data regarding schools. The findings show that despite the disadvantages of the Palestinian minority as a whole within Israeli society, students tend to develop high occupational expectations. While the general level of their expectations can be explained by their educational and residential segregation from the Jewish majority, the multi-level analyses suggests that the internal segregation facilitates differential access to socio-economic resources, which generate different levels of occupational expectations between students from various ethnic/religious groups. More specifically, the findings demonstrate that the social and economic differences between Muslims, Christians and Druze are playing a central role in determining students' expectations, acting as a mechanism to preserve social inequality. The gender dimension of the occupational expectations and the influence of the segregation between Palestinian and Jewish students, are also discussed.\n      </p>", "The magnitude and dynamics of lung cancer incidence in Jews and Arabs in Israel between the years 1962 and 1982 were studied. In general, age-standardized incidence rates increased consistently between the years 1962 and 1976 among Jewish (24% increase) and Arab (39%) males, and to a lesser degree among Jewish females (15%). Arab females had the highest (77%) increase. From 1977 to 1982 a general decrease in incidence rates, which was largest among Arab males (19%) and females (15%), was noted. Rates among Jewish males are currently 26% higher than among Arab males, and are 162% higher among Jewish females than in Arab females. Lung cancer rates in both males and females in Istrael (Jews and Arabs) are lower than in most developed countries in the world. Among the possible reasons are differences in the population risk factors profile, availability of health care and the level of diagnosis and ascertainment of cases.\n      </p>", "This paper uses the 1983 Census of Israel to analyze Hebrew speaking skills and the effects of Hebrew fluency on the earnings of adult male immigrants. Hebrew fluency increases with a longer duration in Israel, the presence of children in the household, marrying after immigration, living in an area in which a smaller proportion speak one's mother tongue, a younger age at migration, a higher level of schooling and varies by country of birth. Earnings increase monotonically with the use of Hebrew. Speaking English as a second language is associated with higher earnings, even when country of origin is held constant.\n      </p>", "During the Gulf War Israel experienced an unexpected population mass-escape of about 100 000 residents from the Tel Aviv area to the peripheral regions of the country. This paper provides a geographical interpretation of the directions, routes and destinations of that flow. The Jerusalem area and the Negev were the most favoured areas of refuge. The escapers chose their destinations according to their mental map of the country and their assumptions about regions of danger based on speculation concerning the range of the Iraqi missiles. This event exposed, for the first time, the relative weakness of the execution of Israel's population distribution policy which has existed as a national security issue since 1948.\n      </p>", "Who settled in the hundreds of small villages that dotted the hill country of Iron I Canaan? In last December's issue of \"BA\" devoted to ceramics and ethnicity, William Dever identified these highlanders as a new ethnic entity, as the people Israel. In a challenge to Dever's identification, Israel Finkelstein argues that Dever is too conservative archaeologically; Dever has valued ceramics over settlement patterns. Moreover, Dever's historical reconstruction clings too tightly to the biblical story. Instead, Finkelstein depicts the rise of an ethnically distinct Israel as the latest phase in long-term, cyclic processes of settlement oscillations in the highlands. Archaeological data first place this \"real Israel\" on the historical stage only in the ninth-eighth centuries BCE.\n      </p>", "This article focuses on the relationships between the Jewish majority and the Palestinian minority in Israel. Opening with a historical perspective that emphasizes the marginality of the minority, the article proceeds to describe empirically that minority's inferior and subservient condition. The third section proposes an elaborate conceptual framework for analyzing politics in deeply divided societies and then applies it to the Israeli case. The final part addresses the possibility of transforming Israel's political system from one that is ethnically hegemonic and democratically flawed into a polity that is open, inclusive, and genuinely democratic. The article identifies ways for effecting such a systemic transformation through individual-based approaches (especially liberal democracy) and group-based designs (consociationalism, multinationalism, federalism, cantonization, and autonomy).\n      </p>", "Israel is a country whose nationalism arguably hinges on a military conflict routine. In this paper I illustrate how national identity is inscribed in the Israeli body, and how \"the body of the nation\" arises following critical events such as terrorist bombings. Building on a discursive analysis of \"body Talk\" in the media representation of terrorist attacks, the article focuses on the non-discursive management of concrete bodies following such attacks. I focus on practices that can be subsumed under \"body identification\" and take place in the National Institute of Forensic Medicine. The data is based on interviews and observations conducted in the Institute during 1996-2000, and supplemented by narrative analysis of media texts. \"Body Identification\" and \"body Talk\" are thus presented as complementary aspects of the discourse of collective, national identity in contemporary Israel. It is argued that Israeli and Jewish identities, although sometimes discursively (politically) separated, are still closely tied in more fundamental, non-verbal practices of body identification\n      </p>", "This article aims to explain the causes and meaning of the formal split of the Islamic Movement in Israel into two factions--following the decision to participate in the elections to the fourteenth Knesset (Israeli parliament) on May 29, 1996--while locating these in a larger theoretical framework. This split resulted from a delicate combination of doctrinal-ideological controversies relating to secular electoral competition and historical-political-tactical controversies that are rooted in the Israeli-Palestinian context. Specifically, the split of the Islamic Movement in Israel derived from two interpretations of the Islamic belief: a more literal or concrete interpretation and a more abstract one.\n      </p>", "The aim of this study was to explore the incidence and differences in the epidemiology of murine typhus between Jews and Arabs in Israel. Between 1991 and 2001, 406 cases of murine typhus were diagnosed; 57% of cases occurred between August and November. Differences between Arabs vs. Jews regarding mean yearly incidence (1.84 vs. 0.35/100,000 people; p = 0.003), median age (35 vs. 44 years; p &lt; 0.001), and male:female ratio (1:1 vs. 1.3:1; p = 0.009), were found.

While there are compelling reasons that population growth should be a prominent topic for local environmental research and discussion, it is rarely considered in environmental campaigns or in the academic literature. I attribute this to the embeddedness of the Israeli environmental community within wider Israeli society.

For digestive system cancers, there is evidence of a marked reduction in the risk of stomach cancer among the migrants with time since migration, and an increase in the proportion of colon cancer, although little change in cancer of the rectum. For most of the smoking-related cancers, there is little evidence of any meaningful change in proportions with time since immigration. For multiple myeloma, proportions decreased substantially in both men and women over the 20-year period. Among women, there is a small, statistically significant increase in breast cancer, and a marked decrease in cancer of the cervix. Among younger immigrants, the proportion of malignant melanoma has increased substantially since migration. A number of the changes in cancer patterns are consistent with various etiologic hypotheses including those based on possible dietary and other lifestyle changes among the migrants.\n      </p>", "Sediments were collected just offshore at approximately lm water depth at eighteen locations along the coast of Israel. Submerged sediments were placed directly into opaque bags to protect them from direct sunlight exposure. Quartz and feldspar sand grains were separated in low-level orange lighting and studied with a thermoluminescence (TL) emission detection system in order to determine the size of the natural residual TL (NRTL) in grains which were in transport in the nearshore. Patterns of NRTL in both quartz and feldspar sand grains show a trend of decreasing itensity with increasing northerly distances from their primary source at the Nile Data. A departure from this trend, characterized by a strong increase in the NRTL at Herzliyya located just north of Tel Aviv, seems to suggest the addition of sediment with high NRTL into the littoral bedload between Jaffa and Herzliyya, demonstrating the likelihood that NRTL can be used to trace the transport and distribution of sediments carrying larger NRTL. Possible sources for this sand are dredged sediments which are removed from older sediment deposits which have not been exposed to significantly long solar exposures or natural erosion of similar older deposits into the littoral bedload. In contrast the strong increase of NRTL at Herzliyya could also be the result of blockage of the northerly longshore transport of Nile sand due to the construction of the beach parallel stone piles just offshore at Tel Aviv.\n      </p>", "We analyze various effects of generational status on marriage patterns of Jewish immigrants and their descendants in Israel over the last 4 decades. We report the following findings: (a) important, independent effects of generational endogamy on marriage patterns in all periods; (b) steady declines in ethnic endogamy among the native born, along with stability in levels of ethnic endogamy among first-generation immigrants over the past 3 decades; (c) effects of generational status on the propensity to marry in all periods. Our results suggest an increase over time in the relative importance of generational factors in marriage patterns. This conclusion contrasts with previous research documenting general declines in the importance of ascriptive characteristics in marriage behavior.\n      </p>", "Blanford's fox, Vulpes cana, was discovered in Israel in 1981, and has not been studied systematically in the wild. Herein we document diet and related aspects of its ecology at two study sites, 300 km apart.

In Eilat Mountains Nature Reserve (by the Red Sea) 98.1% and in Ein Gedi (by the Dead Sea) 92.5% of all samples contained remains of invertebrates. Frequencies of occurrence of plant material in the feces ranged between 60-70%, and in Eilat Mountains Nature Reserve 50% of those samples contained seeds of the caperbush, Capparis cartilaginea. Remains of vertebrates averaged 12%. No differences in diet composition were detected between seasons or sexes within each location, but significant differences were found between the two locations. Diet did not differ significantly between neighboring pairs.\n      </p>", "This article addresses the treatment practices of traditional Palestinian women healers in Israel. It begins with a presentation of the treatment practices utilized by women healers and continues with a description of the changes such practices are currently undergoing. The research indicates that some women healers\u2014in particular, those residing in mixed Jewish-Arab cities in the country's center\u2014are slowly adopting treatment practices identified as masculine: they are abandoning the treatment of problems attributed to natural causes and taking up the treatment of problems attributed to supernatural causes, incorporating treatment practices of a magical or even a religious nature. These tendencies reflect their desire to attain the power and prestige ascribed to their male counterparts. Thus, in this community, the boundaries between feminine and masculine traditional healing, as well as the polarization between the little tradition and the great tradition (sensu Redfield) are not clear-cut, binary, or occurring in a vacuum, but rather contextual, dynamic, hazy, and elusive.\n      </p>", "In this article, I draw on anthropological and feminist scholarship on the body and the nature/culture divide as a framework for understanding the place of surrogate mothers in a conceptual ideology that connects motherhood with nature. I explore links between the medicalization of childbirth in Israel and the personal agency of surrogate mothers as relayed through interviews. Taking the patriarchal context of the Israeli surrogacy law of 1996 into consideration, I underscore surrogates' imaginative use of medical metaphors as tools for the subversion of surrogacy's threatening social connotations. By redefining the surrogate body as \"artificial\" and locating \"nature\" in the commissioning mother's body, surrogates adopt medical rhetoric to transform surrogacy from a transgressive act into an alternative route toward achieving normative Israeli national reproductive goals.\n      </p>", "Two additional sites, Y13 and Y18, of the Yiron Plateau, Upper Galilee, Israel, are here analyzed and compared to the previously studied Avivim sites and the \"sister sites 9 ' Y27 and Y28 on the Plateau. Through a detailed series of attribute analysis and testing, incorporating local environmental factors, the following is suggested. While Y18 was a home-base settlement, highly reminiscent of Y27/28, Y13 served as a transitional camping locale, inhabited by Acheulean groups during relatively short intervals of the year. This suggestion is mainly engendered from the intermediate position occupied by Y13 both topo-geographically and technologically between the Plateau and the Avivim sites. In a methodological sense, this presentation attempts to demonstrate one way by which the careful analysis of similar and diversif\u00eced variables can help in better reconstructing technological concepts and practices as well as settlement patterns and their interrelationships.\n      </p>", "In ethnically non-neutral states, why do some disadvantaged minorities protest their status, while others acquiesce? Given the difficult circumstances in many cases, why do they not protest more than they do, or turn to violence? This article argues that the key to ethnic protest is the identity that one holds: state-bound identities weaken the grievance-protest relationship. The closer one identifies with the state, the less likely one is to protest, even when significant grievances exist. The case of Israel and its Arab citizens is used to illustrate this relationship. When Arabs identify themselves as more \"Israeli,\" they are less protest-prone than other Arabs with more anti-establishment identities. This article provides empirical evidence that fostering state-friendly identities may be a desirable goal for many ethnically tense states. /// Dans les \u00c9tats non neutres sur le plan ethnique, pourquoi quelques minorit\u00e9s d\u00e9savantag\u00e9es contestent-elles leur statut, alors que d'autres l'acceptent? \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 leur situation souvent d\u00e9favorable, pourquoi ne protestent-elles pas davantage ou ne se tournent-elles pas vers la violence?

Six portions of 300 kg each were tagged with various fluorescent colors, and distributed at six different locations in the vicinity of the Herzliya Marina. The tagged sand was scattered at the end of autumn, and sampled three times during the winter. Sampling was interrupted in mid-January because of unexpected dredging at the marina canal entrance. The samples were analyzed at the Yigal Allon Kinneret Limnological Laboratory. The wave climate during that time was analyzed using wave data from Ashdod (40 km south). Wave directions measured in Ashdod were corrected to make them applicable to the Herzliya coast, in accordance with suggested directional shift values. Seven wave storms with significant wave heights of over 2.5 m were observed. Two of them clearly indicate a dominant direction from the southwest and two others from the northwest. However, the time durations and the relative angles between the wave directions and the orthogonal to the coast of the storms propagating from the southwest are essentially larger than those arriving from the northwest. The following results were noted: (i) The drift of tagged sand particles correlated to longshore sediment transport at all depths was in a northern direction throughout the field experiment. The longest distance of transport was 5 km over a period of 36 days. (ii) \"Onshore\" sediment transport was present; sand from 15 m depth was found at 8 m depth. (iii) The cross-shore sediment transport carried sand to a depth of 8 m, but no colored sand from shallow water (2-4 m) was found deeper than 8 m. (iv) Although sedimentation at the marina entrance during the experiment was high, only small amounts of tagged sand were found at the entrance. (v) Findings of tagged sand showed the main area of sedimentation to be along the marina's main breakwater.\n      </p>", "In this paper, I explore interpretations of Israeli museum representations of the Holocaust that prevail among diasporic Jews. I address such questions as how the Holocaust, an event that so marks Jewish contemporary history and identity, is represented in a Jewish state. To what does the movement from the sites of the Holocaust in Europe to the site of its memorialization in Israel gesture? What do diasporic Jews tell us of their visits to these sites of memorialization? I also address the significance of shifting the sites of memorialization from their geographical and historical sites. The perspective on public history used in this paper is concerned with the orientation and set of conceptual balancing acts adopted and applied when reading, interpreting or experiencing forms of public history.

Tel Aviv, situated on the shore of the Mediterranean, is the business and social metropolitan hub of Israeli society. The two cities are perceived in Israeli culture as representing two opposing political-cultural principles: Jerusalem is historical and holy--a probable prescription for cultural intolerance and political violence; Tel Aviv is contemporaneous and profane--a possible recipe for a thriving and hedonistic civil society. Such a perception will inform the first part of the essay. In its second part, a critical look at this perception will be offered. Critics contest the common depiction of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv as two antidotal poles and consider it disingenuous if not deceiving. They contend that the two cities are more alike than the common perception would lead one to believe, and that they form in fact a common Israeli system, with just a slight division of labor among them. The third part of the essay will expand beyond Jerusalem and Tel Aviv as such and will consider the larger context of Israeli political culture and especially the bifurcation between post-Zionism and neo-Zionism.

Yet despite the sudden chaos they wreak and their prevalence during the last decade or so, most societies have only recently created organizational forms that can manage and handle their threatening potential. This article analyzes the relations between terror attacks and the emergence of new organizations specializing in death and disaster We explore this issue through the case of ZAKA, the Ultra-Orthodox Identification Teams for Victims of Disasters in Israel. This organization sheds light on how in highly complex and bureaucratized countries new types of specialists in death by terror developed. From an anthropological point of view, organizational specialists in death by terror are expected to act proficiently on the basis of existing cultural norms and principles. Such organizational bodies are not only expressions of social responses to the unexpected disorder produced by terror but are also powerful cultural agents that produce new meanings. Concretely, not all organizations gain trust and support from the general public to allow its members to touch, treat and recompose the bodies of the dead, we contend that ZAKA legitimizes its goals and actions through the amalgamation of three unique elements: (a) Given that ZAKA's practices are grounded in Jewish traditions concerning death and burial, the organization use these cultural roots to gain acceptance of treating victims of terror attacks. In this way, the actions of ZAKA volunteers are legitimized since they fulfill central religious (Talmudic) duties concerning death and the treatment of corpses, (b) The organization mixes practices and knowledge from different institutions and bodies such as the police, military or medical organizations. Moreover, ZAKA cooperates with various state organizations that specialize in death events and disasters. This combination not only reinforces the legitimacy of their actions but turns them into social experts for dealing with the victims of terror and mass death, (c) During a terror event the organization deals not only with death but also with aid to, and treatment of, the injured. By giving them social permission to treat, touch and recompose the human flesh, society also sanctions them to touch the very basis of social order: treating the human body and dealing with questions of life and death in the public sphere. We end by offering a number of thoughts about the wider implications of our case study.\n      </p>", "A continuous and gradual increase in the incidence of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) has been reported in southern Israel over the last 20 years. The goal of our research was to determine if and how anthropogenic disturbances enhance the occurrence of the disease. To assess the effect of anthropogenic disturbances, we selected twelve 60 x 60 m plots, six in disturbed and six in undisturbed habitats at each of five study sites in southern Israel. We trapped rodents and sand flies, determined Leishmania major infection prevalence in rodents, and measured various environmental parameters. Infection prevalence in the reservoir host, the rodent Psammomys obesus, was significantly higher in disturbed habitats than in undisturbed ones. Infection prevalence was positively correlated with vector (Phlebotomus papatasi) density but not with host density. P. papatasi density was positively correlated with soil moisture. Soil in disturbed habitats had significantly more moisture, and plants were significantly more lush than in undisturbed habitats. P. obesus density was positively correlated with plant lushness. These results suggest that an important impact of anthropogenic disturbance, the addition of water, improves the conditions for vector breeding and promotes larger host populations by improving the quality of their food. These effects, in turn, should enhance disease transmission risk to humans.\n      </p>", "Der Atlas steht paradigmatisch in einer disziplin\u00e4ren Tradition, die aus der Synthese von Wissenschaft und Nationalismus entstand, eine Tradition, die sich des kartographischen Instrumentariums bediente, um in verschiedenen Schl\u00fcssen bestimmte Anspr\u00fcche zu untermauern. Dieser Synthese wurde in Israel mit der Ankunft der \"Deutschen Gruppe\" und ihrer Einbindung in die Institutionen von Verwaltung und Wissenschaft eine besondere Bedeutung zuteil. Dabei kam David Amiran bei der Einf\u00fchrung der deutschen Konzepte und der Anpassung des Atlas an den nationalen politischen Konsens in Israel eine ausschlaggebende Bedeutung zu. In einem Land wie Israel lag das wichtigste Instrument zur Kartographie, wie das Israeli Survey, in den H\u00e4nden der politischen Entscheidungstr\u00e4ger. Die Frage, die sich zwangsl\u00e4ufig stellt, lautet, inwiefern staatliche Informationen nach staatlichen Kriterien, d.h. in \u00dcbereinstimmung mit der Regierungspolitik, pr\u00e4sentiert werden m\u00fcssten, oder ob diese Informationen nicht auch Kritik und wissenschaftlicher Interpretation ausgesetzt werden sollten. Ist es \u00fcberhaupt m\u00f6glich, sich auf solche Informationen zu beziehen, ohne der ideologischen Neigung des Kartographen Beachtung zu schenken? Ist die Karte und der Begleittext nichts als die Kreation einer \"offiziellen Sprache\", einer Sprache, die eben diese politischen Entscheidungstr\u00e4ger versuchen in die Gesellschaft einzuf\u00fchren, um ihre Ideen voranzutreiben?/Verleiht die Verf\u00fcgung \u00fcber die technischen Instrumentarien zur Kartographie einer Regierung das alleinige Recht der kartographischen Pr\u00e4sentation? Und, wenn dies der Fall ist, m\u00fcsste man dann jede kartographische Publikation dieser Institution der kartographischen Propaganda verd\u00e4chtigen? Trotz aller Kritik und Interpretation muss man wiederholen, dass der Atlas of Israel f\u00fcr die Zeit, in der er entstand und auch nach heutigen Standards eine gro\u00dfartige wissenschaftliche Leistung des Staates Israel und seiner Wissenschaftler darstellt. Seine Sch\u00f6pfer machten den ehrlichen Versuch, die Informationen nach den wissenschaftlich objektivsten Methoden darzustellen und waren sich offensichtlich nicht der subjektiven und ideologischen Annahmen bewusst, die in ihre professionellen Entscheidungen mit einflossen. Dies ist kein un\u00fcbliches Ph\u00e4nomen, verglichen mit anderen National-Atlanten, wie in der Einleitung bereits angemerkt wurde. Die Entscheidungen National-Atlanten betreffend sind stets mit dem \u00dcberleben der Nation, der St\u00e4rkung der Identifizierung und der Bewahrung des Einflusses des Regimes gekoppelt und ziehen deshalb aus den unterschiedlichen Darstellungsm\u00f6glichkeiten von Wissen ihren Nutzen, wie bereits Foucault (1980) bemerkte. /// The atlas both symbolizes and perpetuates a disciplinary tradition that came into being through linking science and nationalism, a tradition assisted by using the technique of mapping to present different findings and claims. This combination was imported to Israel with the arrival of the \"German Group\" and its absorption into the institutions of authority and research. David Amiran's role in the introduction of professional ideas from Germany and the design of the atlas into the national political consensus in Israel was crucial. In a country like Israel the most important instrument for carrying out cartographical work, such as the Israeli Survey was in the hands of the political authorities. The question that needs to be asked is whether the information held by the state has to be presented according to political criteria, that is in accordance with the government's policies, or whether it should be open to criticism and scientific interpretation. Is it, in fact, possible to relate to information of this kind as information with no ideological bias on the part of the mapmaker? Is the creation of the map and its accompanying text nothing but the creation of the \"official language\" that this same political authority is attempting to instil into society in order to perpetuate its ideas? Do the technical instruments used to carry out the mapping held by a government body provide it with the exclusive use of the cartographical presentation content? And, if so, should one relate to every cartographical publication produced by such a body as being suspect of cartographical propaganda? Despite all the criticism and interpretation one must ultimately reiterate that, in relation to the period in which it appeared and even according to contemporary standards, the \"Atlas of Israel\" is a great scientific achievement for the State of Israel and its scientists. Its creators made an honest attempt to present information according to the best scientifically objective procedures and were apparently unaware that this aspiration contained within it subjective and ideological assumptions that influenced their professional decisions. One should not see this as something unusual when compared to other national atlases as we have noted in the introduction. When it comes to national atlases such considerations are connected with the survival of the nation, strengthening identification and the perpetuation of the regime's power through utilizing the different presentations of knowledge, as already claimed by Foucault (1980).\n      </p>", "A religious holiday on the Falashas (since 1975 recognized by the State of Israel as the Ethiopian Jews) is described, comparing the traditional celebration in Ethiopia with the modern version in Israel This day (known as Seged or Mehl\u00e4la) is not celebrated by other Jewish communities. In Israel it is used by Falashas (who face a severe crisis in cultural and even physical survival as a group) to express new loyalties and adaptive predispositions toward Israeli society. Very conscious of their ethnic and physical differences from other Israelis, they explicitly try to fit into the dominant civil religious structure of the State, this in order to strengthen their status as a loyal eda (ethnic community) in Israel\u2014 The original religious character of the Seged is submerged into the symbolism of Israeli Judaism by way of selective innovation. The conflicts preceding the new celebration in Israel reflect the difficult political and social situation of the Falashas outside Israel, as well as the difference of opinion as to the ' social image' of the community in the country. Dominant concern of all Falashas appears to be to deemphasize their ethnicity and to strive for assimilation; the attitude towards the means to attain this, however, varies within the Falasha community. The preparation and actual celebration of the Seged as described give evidence of the dynamics of this process.\n      </p>", "Some evidence of the existence of an ancient pharmacological theory-the Doctrine of Signatures-has been found in the folk medicine of Israel.

Analysis of the 1995 population census indicates that, all else being equal, immigrant women exert a negative effect on activity in the annual labor force. As time elapses, the probability of immigrant women being employed improves but remains considerably lower than that of both immigrant and native-born men. However, after a few years in the country, immigrant women do close the gap with native-born women. For employment status in the last week, being an immigrant woman has a positive effect on full-time employment. A detailed analysis reveals substantial stratification by country of birth. Thus, the patterns of employment status for immigrant groups can reflect different levels (single, double, and triple) of disadvantage or advantage for women. I attach this stratification to cultural background and social values of country of birth as well as to economic and religious considerations, not fully indexed by the census data. /// Cet article examine les diff\u00e9rences par genre en fonction de la situation d'emploi parmi les immigr\u00e9s en Isra\u00ebl, et la variation de ces diff\u00e9rences en fonction du pays d'origine.

The article analyses the protest vigil of 'Women in Black' in Jerusalem, and characterizes it, following Handelman (1990), as a minimalist public event. After examining and analysing the sources of minimalism it was concluded that minimalism was the result of two social processes attendant at the formation of 'Women in Black' as a social movement: personal interpretation of the political field, and avoidance of ideological deliberation amongst the participants. The minimalism of the public event preserved the movement for six years and created a collective identity that emphasized the symbolic difference between those within the demonstration and those outside it. This difference was symbolized by a juxtaposition of opposites. The essence of opposites is analysed by means of 'thick description', i.e., by deciphering them in the context of Israeli society. The study concluded that the mode of protest of 'Women in Black' has created a symbolic space in which a new type of political woman is enacted.

After an introduction to the technologies and their regulation in many Western countries and on an international level, I discuss ethical and moral concerns formulated in Western countries, many of which have no room in the bioethical discourse in Israel. The traditional argument is to explain this with religion: particularly, by arguing that Jewish religious teachings lead to a conception of ESC research and cloning as morally unproblematic. Nevertheless, in order to fully understand the Israeli situation, I argue that we have to take into consideration prevalent political narratives. The 'demographic threat' that the Jewish majority population in Israel will be outnumbered by non-Jews in the not too distant future provides a context of risk to the discourse on 'Israeli cells'. Contexts of risk extend the scope of self-governing of individuals by predetermining ways of preventing particular risks. Instead of there being a consistent governmental policy on how to regulate medical technologies, the Israeli bioethics discourse shaped the regulations on ESC research and human cloning by providing decision-makers with particular understandings of what is 'thinkable and sayable'.

I develop a game-theoretic model of government formation in which the international environment is a source of uncertainty for the policy preferences of the prime minister. The model predicts that when uncertainty is high enough, it is optimal for the prime minister to establish an oversized coalition government. By including expendable parties in a government, the prime minister has greater freedom to modify foreign policy in response to the international environment without jeopardizing majority status in parliament. The logic of the model is analyzed through two case studies: Menachem Begin, 1977-1981, and Ehud Barak, 1999-2000. The findings of the model have larger theoretical implications for the connection between domestic politics and international relations.\n      </p>", "In this paper, ethnographic data from Stockton, California and Sharonia, Israel are brought to bear on the question, In what way do dominant-minority group relations affect the educational careers of poor black American and Oriental Jewish youth?

This impinges on the organization of educational environments in each society. In both settings, minority youth must compete for educational credentials in social situations in which power relationships and symbolic formations are heavily weighted against their interests. Nevertheless, in confronting similar social situations, black American and Oriental Jewish youth have adopted divergent strategies of behavior. It is argued that alternative responses to similar educational situations can best be explained in reference to the world view and corresponding strategy for social advancement of black Americans and Oriental Jews.\n      </p>", "The Moshav, a family farm-based settlement, has been a prime example of the major changes in the rural space in Israel.

No such association was evident among Arabs. Following logistic regression analysis, low maternal age and low socioeconomic status, but not ethnicity, were significantly associated with UDI as compared to the non-UDI infants. In comparison to non-UDI, UDI was significantly more prevalent during the cold season. UDI incidence has apparently been stable over the past 15 years.

The purpose of this study is to analyze certain factors that influence immigrant scientists' integration into the society and academic community of Israel, with special attention to multilingual identity. Previous studies in this field emphasize the significance of Hebrew and juxtaposed Russian with Hebrew; however, in Israel, especially in the educated classes, English is an important status symbol and boundary marker. The data demonstrate that English is crucial in shaping the patterns of immigrants' social integration. Results of statistical tests demonstrate significant differences between those who studied English and those who studied either German or French regarding feelings of personal self-actualization and job satisfaction. Moreover, command of English proved to be the determining factor for risk of losing a job. The implication is that Israeli language policy, which has traditionally taken the acquisition of Hebrew by immigrants as its major goal, should be reformulated to include access to English instruction, since without it they are unlikely to become equal members of the Israeli middle class.\n      </p>", "Dark-morph Egretta spp. in the Palearctic region have been reported since 1869. Dark-morph Egretta garzetta are established and breed in Israel. Dark-morph E. gularis breed in southern Sinai and on Tiran Island in the Gulf of Suez, about 500 km away. Accordingly, in Israel, there are two \"types\" of dark-morph individuals that differ morphologically in conformity with the traditional taxonomy of Egretta spp. Review of reported observations indicates that both dark-morph \"types\" appeared in the Palearctic independently, about 100 years apart. It is suggested that E. garzetta dark specimens joined local populations as a result of mixing of migratory Palearctic populations with African resident populations. E. gularis probably appeared as a casual influx of solitary birds from African migratory populations, reinforced by importation of specimens from Asia to Europe since 1980. A reliable genetic study is necessary in order to solve the taxonomic status of Egretta genus. This will help to explain the source of dark-morph Egrets in Israel and set priorities for conservation and management of the widespread Egretta populations.\n      </p>", "This study identifies clay mineral assemblages between the eastern Nile delta and northern Israel to complement and refine interpretations of modern sediment provenance and dispersal patterns in the SE Mediterranean. Previous penological investigations indicate that the River Nile has been the dominant source of sediment transported to the Levant Sea, whereas sediment contributions from Sinai, Gaza and Israeli rivers and coastal cliff exposures in this region have been minor. However, this sediment dispersal pattern, modelled as the Nile littoral cell, is now being altered as a response to the High Dam at Aswan, barrages along the Nile valley and in the Nile delta, and water diversion by the high-density canal system in the Nile delta. As a result, Nile sediment input identified by high proportions of smectite is presently derived from erosion of the delta margin rather than from direct dispersal by the river proper. The present investigation records important percentages of kaolinite in the clay fraction of samples recovered in coastal cliff exposures, from east of Bardawil lagoon and Wadi El Arish to the Lebanon-Israel border. Clay mineral assemblages in the fluvial channels on the coastal plain east of the Nile delta are considerably more variable: those west of El Arish are smectite-rich, while those on the plain east and north to the Tel Aviv region are kaolinite-rich; clay assemblages between Tel Aviv and Atlit are smectite-rich; still farther north, locally between Atlit and Haifa, assemblages in some fluvial channels comprise high percentages of illite, and those from north of Haifa to the Lebanese border record large proportions of kaolinite and illite. These laterally variable clay assemblages on the Sinai, Gaza and Israeli coastal margins are more closely related to the different source terrains in highlands that back the coastal plain than to distal Nile provenance. Modern clay minerals near the coast are derived from (1) rivers that flow seasonally from highlands in Sinai and Israel, (2) seasonally variable winds that carry dust from arid and semi-arid regions toward the coast, and (3) wave current erosion of coastal exposures. As the amount of distal Nile-derived clay from Egypt is reduced, these more proximal sources will likely to account for increasing proportions of clays supplied to Sinai and the SE Levant margin.\n      </p>", "Modern post-emancipatory Jews have long been associated with cosmopolitanism, mostly as a bad thing. They've been anathematized as \"rootless cosmopolitans\" so often that \"cosmopolitan,\" used as a noun, is in some circles an anti-Semitic code word. During the heroic moments of Zionism, as with other liberation movements, this cosmopolitan strand of Judaism was deemphasized in favor of conceptions that emphasized separateness and selfconsciousness. There exists a side of Jewish identity that Zionism consciously suppressed, namely its urban, pleasure-loving, shopping-oriented cosmopolitanism. This exists also in social theory: Consumerism and modernism are joined at the hip because consumption is an indispensable part of the civilizing process. The process of consumption, of expressing our identity through tastes and possessions, changes the entire field of interaction. It makes possible new kinds of social identity. And it makes possible new forms of social integration, based on individuation and sympathy.\n      </p>", "Six decades after its founding, the Jewish state is neither as vulnerable as its supporters claim nor as callous and calculating as its critics imagine.

This paper shows that Arab protest in the Galilee has been influenced by the former set of causes as well as by the region's evolving ethnic geography and by Israel's discriminatory planning policies. The combination of these factors and the continuing (social, cultural and political) reconstruction of Arab space as 'Israel' are spawning Arab regionalism on both state-wide and regional-specific levels. Arab regional protest is focused on national, deprivation and regional land issues, and on recent Arab calls and actions for increased ethnic autonomy which have taken concrete-territorial form in Arab places and regions.

This article addresses that question, first by looking at the realities of Israel as a Jewish state and at the same time one compounded of Jews of varying ideologies and persuasions, plus non-Jews; the tensions between the desire on the part of many Israeli Jews for Israel to be a state like any other and the desire on the part of others for it to manifest its Jewishness in concrete ways that will make it unique. The article explores the ways in which the traditional domains of authority into which power is divided in the Jewish political tradition are manifested in the structure of Israel's political system, both structurally and politically; relations between the Jewish religion, state and society; the Jewish dimension of Israel's political culture and policy-making, and how both are manifested through Israel's emerging constitution and the character of its democracy.\n      </p>", "A field study to survey the custom of tying rags on sacred trees in the northern part of Israel was carried out during 2000-2001. It included 60 interviewees: 24 Druze, 18 Moslem Arabs, 12 Moslem Bedouins and 6 Christian Arab individuals. Tree veneration was found to be quite uncommon among the Bedouins and rare among the Christian Arabs. The results of the present study suggest there are 17 reasons for tying rags on sacred trees. Five reasons, as far as the author is aware, were not previously reported from the literature (i.e., breaking an oath, marking a blessed tree, marking the road to a blessed tree, asking for permission to pick fruit, and setting out rags for needy people). These usages appear to be endemic to Israel and to the Druze. Two customs previously reported from Israel but not corroborated by the present survey are to pacify a tree's spirit and as a charm for new clothes. Three of the 17 known reasons for tying rags on sacred trees are also known from regions beyond the Middle East (i.e., to transfer illness to the tree, to use a rag as a visiting card, and to pacify the tree's spirits). And lastly, several customs never reported before from Israel appear to stem from the belief in ancient pagan polytheistic religions (to ensure a good yield, offerings to a tree's deities/spirits, to pacify the ancestor's spirits, to commemorate a death, and to pacify a tree's spirit while picking fruits). Twelve of the reported 17 reasons for hanging rags on sacred trees are known from Israel. These findings elucidate the widespread and variable tree worship traditions that are prevalent today in the region. In spite of a monotheistic ban against ancient pagan beliefs, trees still remain a subject of worship in Israel today, as manifested by the daily tying of rags upon branches.\n      </p>", "The growth of the law in the new state of Israel is bound to be a matter of interest to lawyers throughout the world, compounded as it is of legal theories from many different countries against a background of religious teaching that antedates most European cultures. Mr. Goitein's article points out the similarity between modern legal developments in Israel and those of biblical times.\n      </p>", "This article investigates the interaction between terror attacks and electoral outcomes in Israel. The authors analyze a dynamic model of reputation that captures the salient characteristics of this conflict. The equilibrium of the theoretical model generates two precise empirical predictions about the interaction between terrorism and electoral outcomes. First, the relative support for the right-wing party is expected to increase after periods with high levels of terrorism and to decrease after periods of relative calm. Second, the expected level of terrorism is higher when the left-wing party is in office than it is during the term of the right-wing party. The authors test these hypotheses by using a newly created data set on terrorist attacks in Israel between 1990 and 2003. The first hypothesis is strongly supported by data culled from public opinion polls about the Israeli electorate's political preferences. The second theoretical hypothesis is strongly supported by the three Israeli governments to which the theory can be applied that served during the studied time period.\n      </p>", "This article addresses the links between national identity, temporal order, and the re-socialization of migrants. Anchored in an ethnographic account of encounters between Israeli Jews and recent migrants to Israel from the former Soviet Union, it looks at ways in which temporal re-ordering was rendered crucial to the moral transformation required of the newcomers. These encounters reveal not only the ways in which Israeli oldtimers endeavored to persuade the newcomers to bracket off their present circumstances in favour of a shared, imagined future, but also how the newcomers sought to contest the use of the future for making meaning of the present. Finally, the paper examines how a more general argument about the modern state's control over time, and the challenges currently being posed to such control, is worked out in the Israeli case\n      </p>", "Does religious commitment have a common political impact across national frontiers? To date, that question has been explored empirically only for Roman Catholics, who might be expected to behave similarly because of centralizing resources in their tradition. This article explores the extent of transnational political attitudes among Jews in the United States and Israel, two groups with less centralized authority structures and radically different religious situations. Parallel surveys of Jews in the United States and Israel, analyzed by OLS regression with the slope dummy approach, indicate that Jewish religiosity has a common influence on most political issues but often has much sharper effects in one society than the other. Given our expectation that Jews would exhibit lower levels of transnational similarity than Roman Catholics, the findings reinforce scholars who perceive religion as a potent transnational political factor.\n      </p>", "In Israel, there are no epidemiological data regarding nonfatal childhood falls. A retrospective survey was conducted in order to find epidemiological characteristics of childhood falls among the different populations of northern Israel. During the years 1993 through 1995, 3082 children were hospitalized in Rambam Medical Center (RMC) due to injury. The children were subdivided into the four main populations: Jewish and Arab residents of Haifa region (the main metropolitan area) and Jewish and Arab residents of the Galilee region (the rural region). All of the children who suffered injury that required mechanical ventilation and careful assessment were admitted to the PICU. The charts of the children admitted to the PICU were then further studied. The demographic characteristics of all the cases of falls were statistically analyzed and the annual admission rates due to falls were calculated using the national statistical registrations of children in Israel. Falls were responsible for 1049 admissions due to injury, one third of the total number of children who were admitted due to an injury. Most of the children were five years of age or younger. Two thirds of the total childhood falls were of Arabs. The majority of the admissions were of two major sub-populations of northern Israel: Arab residents of Galilee region (66%) and Jewish residents of Haifa region (34%). Higher admission rate was found among Arab children of the Western Galilee district in comparison with Jewish children of the Haifa district. Most of the children who were admitted to the PICU were Arabs: nearly all of these children were from the rural region. More Arab than Jewish children who fell were admitted to the PICU and the majority of these cases were falls from buildings (private houses). Arab children of the rural region were responsible for 95% of the cases. These falls were mainly in staircases (46%) and from balconies (21%), roofs (11%) and windows (11%). The findings of the present study suggest that young Arab rural children in northern Israel are at high risk to a severe injury due to fall. Possible causes are discussed and a preventative intervention is suggested.\n      </p>", "The recent war revealed neither a vulnerable Jewish state nor a Lebanese militia carrying the hopes of the Arab world. In truth, Israel could never have delivered the decisive victory its citizens expected, and Hezbollah has been left weakened and resented. The conflict was bloodier than anyone anticipated, but it just might set the stage for a new order in the Middle East.\n      </p>", "This article explores different notions of social justice implied in the concept of compensation in social welfare. Compensation is a primary allocative principle according to which programs are structured and eligibility for benefits is determined. While familiar in legal terms, the notion of compensation within the social welfare domain has a very different meaning. This article clarifies the meaning of compensation in the social welfare context and distinguishes it from two other principles: need and insurance. The implications of employing these principles in social welfare programs is illustrated by an examination of disability policy in Israel.\n      </p>", "Theories of entrepreneurship among immigrant groups and entrepreneurship in space are related in the context of the Israeli spatial policy. The analysis covered the effects of location and of ethnic origin on self-employment, and on the relationship between self-employment and economic well-being. The study is based on Israel's 1983 census and includes the Jewish urban labor force. Rates of self-employment were highest in Israel's major metropolitan area -Tel Aviv - and lowest in small development towns, in which a large proportion of the self-employed were in retail and construction. Nevertheless, self-employment led all major ethnic groups in all locations to higher levels of economic well being. Self-employment did serve as an upward mobility route for individuals of Eastern origin, who were less successful as employees, and for individuals residing in locations offering inferior employment opportunities. However, opportunities for business formation were limited in development towns, and the direction of Eastern origin groups to small development towns hampered their prospects for advancement through entrepreneurship. While both location and ethnicity influenced entrepreneurship, their interaction effect was weak. Complex ethnic enclaves of entrepreneurship in specific locations have apparently not developed in Israel to the same extent as in the United States.\n      </p>", "Because migration routes and stopover sites of the endangered Palearctic migratory Great White Pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus) are poorly known, satellite tracking was used to map spring and autumn migration routes, stopover sites and ranging areas in Europe, Israel and Africa. Four immature and one adult individual were equipped with transmitters in Israel. Three of these pelicans did not migrate from Israel during the tracking period. One immature male pelican accomplished two spring migrations to Europe and an autumn migration back to Israel, where it over-wintered. Its northward routes passed through Lebanon, Syria, Turkey and Bulgaria and it arrived at the River Danube after three weeks. This individual's vast ranging areas in Europe during two consecutive summers included the Aegean Sea, Bulgaria, Greece and Romania, but excluded the Danube River breeding colony. One individual continued its migration to Africa. It reached the Sudd area in southern Sudan after two stops at Lake Nasser and in Jebel Aulia Dam on the White Nile. Its range in Africa included the Sudd, Lake Roseires on the Blue Nile, the lakes of the Ethiopian Great Valley and Lake Rudolf in Kenya. Although this information was obtained from a small number of individuals it is an essential addition to the body of knowledge required in order to establish a protection policy for this migratory species.\n      </p>", "The development of Cistus incanus was explored in a dark basaltic soils and a calcareous terra-rosa, in relation to mycorrhizal establishment. Plants transplanted to the laboratory degenerated in native dark basaltic soils and in sterilized terra-rosa, where infections with mycorrhizal fungi did not occur. They grew in calcareous terra-rosa, where mycorrhizae developed. Successful development of C. incanus in unfertilized soils depended on ectomycorrhizae; infection and could be demonstrated several weeks after germination. Plants developed without mycorrhizae in both soils when irrigated with a complete nutrient solution. We conclude that when mycorrhizae are absent, C. incanus plants degenerate in unfertilized soils because of a mineral-nutrient deficiency. We suggest that absence of C. incanus and possibly some other batha-forming plants from dark basaltic soils in Israel is related to failure of ectomycorrhizal development in these soils.\n      </p>", "The majority of angiosperms have a single annual bout of reproduction; species that flower continually throughout the year are rare. Ochradenus baccatus is a gynodioecious, desert shrub whose principal flowering period is associated with the winter rains, although large individuals also remain in flower during the hot, dry summer. The goal of this study was to examine the reproductive consequences of continual flowering in a large population of O. baccatus in Israel. Over the two years of this study, 60% of individuals flowered continuously. The number of fruit and seeds per fruit were greater in winter. Winter seeds were ~12% heavier than summer seeds and had significantly higher germination rates (80 vs. 60%, respectively). Although summer seeds were smaller and less likely to germinate, we propose that the benefit derived from their production lies in their ability to capitalize on the first winter rains. These early rain events provide a head start on establishment and growth in the hostile desert environment. Plants that delay reproduction until the onset of rains risk having their offspring face the dry conditions of spring and summer.\n      </p>", "Immigration is an issue of growing relevance in welfare states. This article seeks to better understand the link between social welfare and immigration in Israel, a welfare state that has absorbed a greater proportion of immigrants than any other. Employing a conceptual framework that looks at both immigration policy and the structuring of the social welfare system, the article examines the impact of the Israeli system on the welfare of immigrants and members of other groups in society. The unique structuring of the social welfare system in Israel, described as categorical universalism, and its immigration policy are linked to what Sammy Smooha calls an \u201cethnic democracy.\u201d\n      </p>", "This article describes the relationship between individual and collective boundaries, with special reference to the geopolitical borders of Israel. It is claimed that both individual boundaries and geopolitical borders can be described-as regards their location-as constricted versus expanded, and-as regards their nature-as rigid versus excessively permeable. Israel's borders before 1967 are described as constricted and rigid, whereas following the Six Day War the border situation became more complex. The new border was expanded, but rigid, while the old border remained constricted but became excessively permeable (initially from the inside out, then from the outside in). Due to the close proximity between the individual and the social processes in Israel these border changes are assumed to carry psychological implications, for the individual as well as collectively. Specifically, external reality may threaten to invade the self. This may, alternatively, be defended against by reliance on aggression and externalization. Sensitivity to and awareness of the interaction between the individual and the collective in Israel are seen as necessary in clinical practice.\n      </p>", "In their recent book, \"The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy\", John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt argue that American support for Israel does not serve American interests. Nevertheless, they observe that American foreign policy regarding the Middle East, especially in recent years, has tilted strongly toward support for Israel, and they attribute this support to the influence of the \"Israel lobby\" in American domestic politics. Their book is principally an attempt to make a causal argument about American politics and policymaking. I examine three aspects of this argument\u2014its causal logic, the use of evidence to support hypotheses, and the argument's connection with the state of knowledge about American politics\u2014and conclude that the case for the Israel lobby as the primary cause of American support for Israel is at best a weak one, although it points to a number of interesting questions about the mechanisms of power in American politics. Mearsheimer and Walt's propositions about the direct influence of the Israel lobby on Congress and the executive branch are generally not supported by theory or evidence. Less conclusive and more suggestive, however, are their arguments about the lobby's apparent influence on the terms and boundaries of legitimate debate and discussion of Israel and the Middle East in American policymaking. These directions point to an alternative approach to investigating the apparent influence of the Israel lobby in American politics, focusing less on direct, overt power over policy outcomes and more on more subtle pathways of influence over policy agendas and the terms of policy discourse.\n      </p>", "In recent years there has been a major expansion by higher education institutions in setting up 'for-profit', offshore programmes and campuses. It has been claimed that for-profit provision in a free, or unregulated market, responds to student demand and acts as a catalyst for innovation, thus fuelling arguments for a global 'free market' in higher education. There are few opportunities to test these claims since higher education is overwhelmingly provided within national systems of education and is generally subject to strong local regulation. Israel, in the 1990s, offered a rare case of an unregulated market in higher education for foreign providers, albeit one which contained significant distortions: British institutions took the leading part in developments. This article examines that experience in the light of documentation in the public domain and of practitioner research and argues, contrary to unsubstantiated claims, that provision fell below acceptable standards. The article concludes that, in this field, consumer demand did not operate on the basis of quality and that the market-place cannot assure standards of higher education in overseas provision. Furthermore, until international standards are agreed, governments have a responsibility to regulate provision which directly affects the lives of their citizens.\n      </p>", "1. Distribution of vascular plant species on Mt Hermon, Israel, was analysed to determine if plant species occurred in discrete communities or if vegetation change was continuous along the altitudinal gradient (300-2810m a.s.l.). 2. Numbers of species beginning and ending their ranges in 50- and 100-m elevational bands were compared to those expected if species were arranged randomly along the mountainside. A Monte Carlo simulation was used to determine expected distributions of range borders. 3. There were no significant differences between cumulative frequency distributions of observed and expected downslope boundaries at either the 50- or 100-m spatial scale, although distributions of upslope boundaries differed from expected. 4. While species borders were occasionally aggregated within individual altitudinal bands at both spatial scales, coincidence of aggregated downslope and upslope termini, indicating an abrupt ecotone, occurred only around 1200 m a.s.l. This elevation marks a transition from maquis vegetation to an open deciduous forest. However, the opposite border of neither community was aggregated. 5. Although there were some vegetation discontinuities along the mountainside, there was no evidence of discrete plant communities.\n      </p>", "We compared time budgets, selection of habitat, and nursing schedules of female, free-ranging Nubian ibexes (Capra ibex nubiana) accompanied by following young (the usual maternal strategy) and those with young accidentally confined to a natural physiographic trap (i. e., nursery), which prevented them from following their mothers for several days. Following young and those in the nursery occurred simultaneously in the same area and population in the highlands of the Negev Desert in southern Israel. The behavior of mothers of young confined in the nursery differed from that of mothers with following young, and among the same individuals before and after their young left the nursery. Females with young confined in the nursery selected richer feeding habitats, spent more time feeding per day, foraged further from escape terrain and in smaller groups than did mothers with following young. Minimizing risk of predation to offspring appeared to be a key constraint on the behavior of mothers with following young.\n      </p>"], "words": {"concept": {"number": 1, "prob":
