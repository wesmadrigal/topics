In the context of globalization, Russia is stepping up efforts to re-establish itself as a regional and global power. Despite recent progress in domestic economic development, Russia's comparative ratings in major international surveys remain modest or low and many indicators of political rights and civil liberties in Russia demonstrate worsening trends. Russia still lags behind other countries on many of the criteria measuring economic freedom, market attractiveness, globalization, corruption, opacity, and competitiveness. The article explores the lessons for Russia in its political-economic transformation from \"peer\" countries such as Chile, China, and Venezuela. In exploring the driving forces of Russian economic internationalization, the article focuses on three alternative scenarios conceptualized as \"Chilean,\" \"Chinese,\" and \"Venezuelan.\" Each of these scenarios reflects various traits that have commonalities with the Russian political-economic system, leadership, and situational characteristics in the international context. After examining the internal dynamics and external environmental factors pertaining to Russia, the article concludes that the most probable mid-range alternative for economic internationalization will resemble the Venezuelan scenario, with some elements of the Chinese model also evident. /// Cet article examine les conditions, les tendances et les sc\u00e9narios de fond de l'internationalisation \u00e9conomique russe.

There are many reports of the adverse conditions in Russian prisons, often highlighting the consequences for health, in particular, risks of HIV, tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases. However, there are no reviews of the broader health issues in the Russian penal system. This paper reviews the available information on the health of the imprisoned population in Russia and the factors underlying it. It was undertaken by means of a search of Russian and international literature, including unpublished sources, supplemented by in-depth interviews with 27 key informants from the Ministry of Justice, prison administration, and non-governmental organizations. Published and unpublished data from the ministries of health and justice were used to describe the demographic characteristics of the imprisoned population and compare it with the general population. Although convicts are drawn disproportionately from disadvantaged groups in society and are detained in adverse physical conditions, the standardized mortality ratio from all causes is slightly over one-third of that in the overall Russian male population. This is mainly explained by an eight-fold lower mortality from external causes and a more than two-fold lower mortality from cardiovascular disease. These far outweigh the increased mortality from infectious diseases. The chances of survival of young men in Russia may actually be improved by being in prison, highlighting the need for policies that reduce the overall level of violence and other external risks, such as dangerous driving habits, in Russian society. Yet while conditions are improving in Russian prisons, with death rates falling, there are still many avoidable deaths and high levels of mental illness and infectious disease. There is also much that is not known about the health of Russian convicts, with what is available reflecting what is measured rather than what is important.\n      </p>", "This article examines the effects of dyadic ties and interpersonal trust on referrals and investment decisions of venture capitalists in the Chinese and Russian contexts. The study uses the postulate of transitivity of social network theory as a conceptual framework. The findings reveal that referee-venture capitalist tie, referee-entrepreneur tie, and interpersonal trust between referee and venture capitalist have positive effects on referrals and investment decisions of venture capitalists. The institutional, social and cultural differences between China and Russia have minimal effects on referrals. Interpersonal trust has positive effects on investment decisions in Russia.\n      </p>", "This paper examines the link between organizational culture and effectiveness for foreign-owned firms operating in Russia. Beginning with a model of organizational culture developed in the United States, the paper presents a multimethod analysis of culture and effectiveness in a transition economy. We argue that effectiveness in Russia relies more on adaptability and flexibility than it does in the United States. Furthermore, the legacy of the Communist era forces firms in Russia to deal with a workforce with a unique time perspective and a unique set of subcultures that often undermine attempts at coordination and integration. We first explore these ideas using survey data on 179 foreign-owned firms operating in Russia and compare the results to those obtained for firms in the United States. We then present four case studies designed to ground the results in the Russian context, and to document cultural dynamics not captured by the model.\n      </p>", "The brown bear (Ursus arctos) population in Russia is approximately 130,000 animals, the largest population of this species remaining in the world. While the eastern part of brown bear range probably has not changed significantly for ages, the western part, especially that in the European part of the country, has been dramatically reduced compared with previous centuries. Progressive deforestation led to the southern border of bear range retreating northward. The northern border of brown bear range in Russia is still limited exclusively by natural zonation. This study reviewed the changes in brown bear range that occurred during the last 30-40 years using literature sources and a mail survey of local game managers. Brown bear distribution in Western Siberia did not appear to change significantly since 1960, while in European Russia the species range progressively enlarged to the south. The largest extension of brown bear distribution was observed in neighboring Estonia, where bears are now more widespread than they were 130 years ago. However, some insular populations were eliminated, and 5 remain in danger.\n      </p>", "Background: Tobacco is a leading cause of avoidable death in Russia but there is, as yet, relatively little information in the public domain on who is smoking and how this is changing. This information is important for those seeking to develop effective policies to tackle this issue. Objective: To determine the prevalence of smoking in Russia and its association with sociodemographic factors. Design: Cross-sectional survey on patterns of tobacco consumption. Setting: Data were collected using the New Russia Barometer, a multi-stage stratified-sample survey of the population of the Russian Federation undertaken in the summer of 1996. Participants: Data were available on 1587 individuals (response rate 65.7%). Respondents differed little from the overall Russian population in terms of age, sex, education, and voting intention. Main outcome measures: Prevalence of current and past smoking. Results: Smoking is common among males of all ages and in all areas. Of those aged 18-24 years, 65% smoke, rising to 73% in those aged 25-34 and then falling steadily to reach 41% in those aged 65 and older. Among women, smoking is much more common among the young (27% in those aged 18-34) than among the middle-aged and elderly (5% in those aged 55 and older), and more common among those living in urban areas than in rural areas. Smoking is also more common among men and women suffering material deprivation but there is no independent association with education. Among men, but not women, church attendance is inversely associated with smoking. In both sexes, but especially women, heavy drinking and smoking are associated. Conclusions: Tobacco poses a major threat to the health of future generations in Russia, especially among women. A robust policy response is required.\n      </p>", "Russia has a distinctive 'geography of punishment' that is the product of the use of the peripheries as a place of exile and incarceration. Framing the analysis in a discussion of recent penal theory, including in the works of Michel Foucault, the author traces the formation of Russia's penal peripheries up to the present day and uses the example of the north of Perm' oblast to analyse the process involved in forging a 'penal region'.\n      </p>", "In the global financial crisis, Russia faces the most severe challenge to its politicoeconomic system. Oil prices plummeted, and Russia's exports and state revenues dropped with them. The economy was severely shaken, and cracks appeared in its semi-democratic system headed by the Putin-Medvedev diarchy. However, relations with Washington showed signs of improvement as President Obama reset the overall tone of U.S. foreign policy.

Their divergent approaches have helped create distinct institutional environments. This study focuses on a particularly important strategic decision firms face-alliance partner selection. The study's results suggest that China's more stable and supportive institutional environment has helped Chinese firms take a longer-term view of alliance partner selection, focusing more on the potential partner's intangible assets along with technological and managerial capabilities. In contrast, the less stable Russian institutional environment has influenced Russian managers to focus more on the short term, selecting partners that provide access to financial capital and complementary capabilities so as to enhance their firms' ability to weather that nation's turbulent environment. This study contributes to knowledge about the influence of the institutional environment on alliance partner selection decisions for firms domiciled in transition (and emerging) economies.\n      </p>", "This paper stresses the role of budget system reform in economies in transition as an essential basis for the implementation of effective fiscal policies. However, introducing such structural reforms in often unstable economic environments has not proved easy. Using Russia as a case study, the magnitude of the problems faced is documented and the strategy of reform eventually adopted is critically reviewed. In conclusion, some lessons are drawn for other transitional countries undertaking similar reforms and the future agenda for completing these reforms in Russia is indicated.\n      </p>", "At the beginning of the transition period, many Russian households faced substantial economic hardships and uncertainties. An economic downturn had become one of the major factors responsible for the significant and rapid decline of Russian fertility. However, many households tried to cope with this situation by engaging in multiple income generating activities and the cultivation of food on private plots of land. The question therefore arises whether these activities had a positive impact on fertility decisions. This paper explores the association between additional employment or subsistence measures (second jobs, part-time self-employment, and part-time family agriculture) and the probability to have a first or a second child in Russia during 1990 and the spring of 1993. Data from 966 respondents from the Russian component of the survey \"Social Stratification in Eastern Europe after 1989: General Population Survey\" show that activities that generate an additional income were positively associated with the birth of a second child. This is especially the case if these activities produce half of a respondent's or her household's income. The birth of a second child was also positively associated with the fact that a household consumed food that was cultivated by the household itself. However, none of these activities was significantly connected with the birth of a first child.\n      </p>", "Russia's semi-democratic system and fuel-driven state capitalism gradually recovered from the financial crisis.

It also argues that a full account of Uzbekistan's turnaround needs to take into consideration systemic factors, namely, an external environment in which Russia provided a viable strategic and economic alternative.

The swans were more numerous in the region, and their distribution more widespread, in the 19th century and first half of the 20th century than they are today. In the mid 20th century, increased human activity resulted in a substantial decline in numbers, with breeding pairs no longer occurring in parts of central Karelia, nor in the Leningrad region in southern Karelia. A gradual increase in numbers began in the 1980s, and their breeding distribution shifted southwards. The southernmost sites where Whooper Swans breed regularly are now at 62\u00b010\u2032N in west Karelia (on the Russian-Finnish border), much further north (at 63\u00b020\u2032N) in central Karelia, but further south again (at around 62\u00b0N) where Karelia meets the Arkhangelsk region. Further east, regular breeding occurs across the Kargopol district of Arkhangelsk, from 61\u00b045\u2032N in the west to 61\u00b020\u2032N at its southeast border with the Vologda region (at Lake Lacha). Irregular breeding occurs across southern Karelia and the northern part of the Leningrad region. The change in the southern limit of the swans' breeding distribution cannot, however, be considered an expansion of the breeding range because the swans have not yet fully returned to the range occupied in the first half of the 20th century.\n      </p>", "This article explores the region-level impediments to the process of party formation in Russia during 1993-2002. The design of Russia's national electoral system produces parties because they are entitled to contest the proportional part of legislative elections. Once produced in this way, parties are motivated to penetrate into the regions. However, the article empirically demonstrates that the parties' attempts to penetrate the peripheries of the country have failed throughout the period. Region-level factors that impede the process of party formation include the dominant modes of separation of power, electoral systems, and the patterns of intra-elite conflict in the regions. In turn, the lack of territorial penetration makes national political parties unsustainable. /// L'article analyse les freins exerc\u00e9s au niveau r\u00e9gional sur le processus de formation des partis en Russie, de 1993 \u00e0 2002.

The findings lend mixed support to the theory. Although women reported relatively high levels of strain, strained females tended to use alcohol to cope only when in a close relationship with someone who abused alcohol regularly. At the same time, strain was associated with a significant increase in alcohol coping among men, regardless of peer relations. However, for both genders, alcohol-condoning beliefs consistently outperformed strain as a predictor of drinking behavior. No evidence was found of conditional relations involving legitimate coping strategies or deviant beliefs.

After several decades of decline, the notification rate of all new TB cases among permanent residents increased by 7.5% per year from 1991-1999 and the death rate by 11% per year. Growth was quickest from 1993-1995 but increased again after the economic crisis of August 1998. Approximately 120 000 new cases and 30 000 deaths were reported in 1999. Case detection and cure rates have fallen in Russia since the mid-1980s; the fall has been accompanied by a higher frequency of severe disease among cases, and higher death and case fatality rates. With a mathematical model describing the deterioration in case finding and cure rates we could replicate the average rate of increase in incidence 1991-1999 but not the precise timing of the observed changes. Other factors that probably helped to shape the observed rise in caseload include enhanced transmission due to the mixing of prison and civilian populations, an increase in susceptibility to disease, and changes in the proportion of cases detected by surveillance. Although our explanation for the resurgence of TB is incomplete, we have identified a set of measures that can be implemented now to cut transmission, incidence and deaths.\n      </p>", "Despite the growing interest within international relations theory and political geography in critical geopolitics, there has been little engagement - other than from Western perspectives - with the relationship between geopolitics and national identities in Russia.

We have modified indirect demographic methods and applied them to a population sample to investigate predictors of mortality in Russia. Methods: A national sample of the Russian population was interviewed in a cross-sectional survey. The participants were asked about characteristics of their eldest siblings, including their vital status, year of birth, and year of death (if deceased). The association between personal characteristics and mortality risk was estimated for 682 male and 698 female siblings (of whom 122 and 81, respectively, had died). Results: In both sexes, mortality was strongly associated with smoking and low education. After adjustment for smoking and education, mortality was elevated in men and women who drank alcohol at least once a month. Mortality was also higher among in men who had been binge drinking (more than half a bottle of vodka per drinking session) at least once a week (adjusted risk ratio [RR] = 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2-4.9) and in women who were binging at least once a month (RR = 3.9; CI = 1.1-14.5) compared with nonbinging. Subjects: Similar associations with drinking were seen for cardiovascular deaths in men. Childhood social circumstances were not associated with mortality.

The paper presents sex specific data on risk factors for coronary heart disease. Though the cardiovascular mortality is high in Russia, the calculated risk for coronary heart disease (the Framingham risk score and the Norwegian risk score) was lower in all age groups of men and women in Arkhangelsk compared with studies from the Western Europe and USA.

Methods: This is a retrospective cohort mortality study among 5,185 shoe manufacturing workers employed between 1940 and 1976, and followed from 1979 through 1993. Exposure to CP was assessed by linking the job history with industrial hygiene data. We calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMR) using the Moscow population as reference, and conducted an internal comparison analysis based on Poisson regression modeling. Results: For the entire cohort, all-cause mortality was close to expectation and all-cancer mortality was increased. There was an increase in the mortality from liver cancer (SMR = 2.4, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-4.3), kidney cancer (SMR = 1.8, CI = 0.9-3.4), and leukemia (SMR = 1.9, CI = 1.0-3.3). Mortality from liver cancer and leukemia was associated with various indicators of CP exposure. A similar, although less consistent, pattern was found for kidney cancer mortality; while for the remaining neoplasms, no association was suggested with CP exposure. Conclusions: The association between CP exposure and risk of leukemia may be due to concomitant exposure to benzene. The results for liver cancer point towards a carcinogenic effect of CP\n      </p>", "This article analyzes the \"realist\" support for the current regime as well as the support for democracy as a set of \"idealist\" principles in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. It also analyzes political support for nondemocratic regimes as alternatives to democratic governance. The main conclusion of this article is that mass public support for democracy as the best form of government encompasses an absolute majority of citizens in Georgia, Ukraine, Moldova, Armenia, and Belarus as well as a relative majority of Russian citizens. Political support for the current regimes declined between 1992 and 2002 and collapsed in Georgia, Ukraine, Moldova, and Armenia. This collapse of public support for the current political regime contributed to the \"revolutions\" in Georgia and Ukraine. The proportion of supporters for authoritarian regimes in Russia and the other post-Soviet countries decreased from about one-third to one-fifth of their respective electorates. This cross-national study provides empirical evidence of increasing support for democracy as an ideal form of government and a corresponding decrease in support for autocracy in eight political regimes in the Commonwealth of Independent States area in the period from 1992 until 2002. /// Cet article analyse tant le soutien \"r\u00e9aliste\" au r\u00e9gime actuel que le soutien \u00e0 la d\u00e9mocratie comme ensemble de principes \"id\u00e9alistes\", en Russie, Ukraine, Bi\u00e9lorussie, Moldavie, Arm\u00e9nie, G\u00e9orgie, Kazakhstan et Kirghizstan.

Though crucial to Durkheim's work on homicide, this idea remains untested. The authors took advantage of the natural experiment of the collapse of the Soviet Union to examine this hypothesis. Using data from Russian regions (N = 78) and controlling for measures of anomie and other covariates, the authors estimated the association between political change and change in homicide rates between 1991 and 2000. Results indicated that regions exhibiting less support for the Communist Party in 2000 (and thus greater change in political ideals because the Party had previously exercised complete control) were regions with greater increases in homicide rates. Thus, while democratization may be a positive development relative to the Communist juggernaut of the past, it appears that the swift political change in Russia is partially responsible for the higher rates of violence there following the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n      </p>", "The socialist and postsocialist contexts offer important challenges for anthropologists developing a critical analysis of fertility. The need for fertility studies to address class and gender inequities is often overlooked by postsocialist scholars, whose work is mired in responses to the socialist past and ongoing pronatalist campaigns. I examine the ways that fertility analysis has been used in national political struggles in Russia, and explain why supporters of democratic reforms and women's rights have neglected to address gender and class issues in their fertility studies. While Russian nationalists cite fertility decline as proof that market reforms threaten Russia's existence, defenders of neoliberalism draw on demographic transition theory to redefine fertility decline as a universal sign of socioeconomic development. Working with conventional demographic paradigms and a postsocialist cultural logic, Russian transition theorists simultaneously oppose pronatalist politics, support women's reproductive choice, and reproduce the limitations of liberal paradigms regarding the family, society, and public policy. This article shows how anthropological critiques of demographic transition theory can be expanded and nuanced by considering the ways this theory gets adapted to particular cultural logics and political contests.\n      </p>", "Russian economic reformers of the early 1990s believed that integration with the global economy would facilitate the construction of a market economy and the reconstruction of the Russian state by helping to break down economic interests inherited from the USSR. However, the global economy did not act as an agent of transformation in Russia. Russia's reintegration with the global economy became narrowly focused on the sale of treasury bills to finance the budget deficit as attempts to stabilize state finances in 1996-7 made Russian financial markets attractive to foreign investors. There was, however, no underlying change in the government's economic fortunes and attempts at stabilizing state finances engendered political conflict. As a result, Russia was exposed to changes in world markets and the rouble collapsed in August 1998. The devastation of the Russian economy as a consequence of these developments means that the Russian state is the only force that can lead reform. However, it is in such a weak position that its ability to act as an agent of change is doubtful.\n      </p>", "Trade in gall bladders of brown bears (Ursus arctos) has been practiced in Russia for at least a century. Trade increased dramatically starting in 1991 as a consequence of opening state borders, weakening state control, and increasing economic needs of local people. From 1991-94 bile was traded throughout Russia, most intensively in the far east where sophisticated dealer networks have apparently developed. Analysis of prices for bile in Russia and other countries in 1994-95 indicated that the major destinations for bile from Russia are Japan, Macau, South Korea, and Taiwan. Bile from Russian bears may also contribute to medicinal markets in oriental communities in Western Europe. Thousands of gall bladders are smuggled from Russia annually and it is still not clear where these go. Customs control is very weak and probably will not be improved in the near future. I analyze recent trends in trade of brown bear parts in Russia and adjacent countries, based on interviews with local mammalogists from spring 1993 and 1994.\n      </p>", "The highly industrialized small town of Verkhnyaya Pyshma (in the Urals region of Russia) was chosen as the site of a multimedia-multipollutant risk assessment using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency methodology. The assessment was based on routine environmental pollution monitoring data for ambient air, soils, drinking water, and food, and the international environmental epidemiology literature. Using an a priori set of the preliminary health-based criteria, we selected nine pollutants for risk assessment: total suspended particles (TSP), sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), ammonia arsenic, copper, cadmium, and lead. We used dose-response functions derived from epidemiologic studies to assess individual and population risks for TSP, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, As, Cd, and Pb. We assessed both cancer (for BaP, As, and Cd) and non-cancer (for all the chosen pollutants but BaP) responses, but in this paper we discuss only the assessments of noncarcinogenic risks due to TSP, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Pb, and Cd as examples of how the quantitative estimates of health effects can be produced by using a risk function approach.

In the past 15-20 years considerable experience has been gained from Russian and joint Russian-US laboratory and clinical studies with type A monovalent and bivalent vaccines prepared with genetic reassortant viruses derived from one of these cold-adapted viruses in particular, A/Leningrad/134/57. More recent experiences include use of trivalent cold-adapted vaccines with a type B component. The overall high level of safety of individual and combined vaccines in pre-school and school-aged children, with illness reductions in open field trials equivalent to that seen with inactivated vaccines, is such as to suggest that practical measures might now be justified to facilitate expansion of the use of these vaccines to other countries. It is proposed that further experimentation with the Russian cold-adapted live attenuated vaccines should be focused on issues that will relate to the public health perspective, i.e. selection of the single best candidiate type A and B vaccines for intense study using as criteria their potential for meeting licensing requirements outside Russia, and documenting the clinical protective efficacy of a single vaccine dose compared to two doses as studied until now. Resolution of these issues is important to ensure that costs for future live vaccine production, control, and utilization will be kept at lowest levels so that expanded use of live vaccines will have maximum cost-benefit and affordability. To guide those interested in these issues, examples are given of populations for whom a licensed live cold-adapted vaccine might be considered, together with indications of extra data needed to fully validate each suggested use.\n      </p>", "Between 1989 and 1993, the total fertility rate in Russia dropped from 2.01 to 1.38, a fall of unprecedented size in peacetime. The more common explanation asserts that the fertility decrease is the population's response to the socio-economic crisis occurring in the country. The alternative hypothesis states that the fertility decrease is just a continuation of the long-term trend, while the crisis has accelerated this process. On the basis of individual data obtained in the 1994 microcensus, which involved 5 per cent of Russia's population, this paper attempts to find arguments for and against each of the two hypotheses The analysis is based on questionnaires of 798 thousand women born between 1959 and 1975. Three indicators of fertility are investigated: frequency of birth in 1993, expected number of children, and desired number of children. These indicators are linked to 28 background characteristics, including marital status, number of children ever born, ethnicity, level of education, housing condition, and income level. The data do not reveal essential fertility differentiation by economic status, which would be present of the first hypothesis were right. At the same time, a clear connection is found between the frequency of births in 1993 and such socio-cultural markers as living in town or countryside, ethnicity, and the desired number of children. In addition, 1993 fertility actually conforms to women's opinions about the number of children they intend to have. These results cast doubt on the hypothesis that the economic crisis is the main and only cause of the recent fertility decrease in Russia. /// Entre 1989 et 1993 la somme des naissances r\u00e9duites est tomb\u00e9e de 2,01 \u00e0 1,38 en Russie, chute sans pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent en temps de paix. L'explication la plus courante voit dans cette baisse la r\u00e9ponse de la population \u00e0 la crise socio-\u00e9conomique qui s\u00e9vit dans le pays. Une autre hypoth\u00e8se suppose que cette baisse est simplement la suite d'une tendance \u00e0 long terme que la crise a accentu\u00e9e. En se basant sur des donn\u00e9es individuelles obtenues par le micro-recensement de 1994, portant sur 5% de la population russe, cet article essaie de trouver des arguments pour et contre chacune de ces deux hypoth\u00e8ses. L'analyse est bas\u00e9e sur des questions pos\u00e9es \u00e0 798 000 femmes n\u00e9es entre 1959 et 1975.

Notable trends are increasing criticism of environmental and resource management in Russia and a (re)turn to pre-socialist Russian theorizations of society-nature interactions. Specifically, the no\u00f6sphere, ethnogenesis and geosystems are trends in the literature that signify how Russian geographers (re)construct environmental knowledge.

Home ranges of males and females were not significantly different in size. There was little intrasexual overlap in use of space, particularly among females, but home ranges of males and females overlapped extensively. Ranges of any particular male or female typically overlapped those of two to four individuals of the opposite sex, suggesting a promiscuous or polygynous mating system. Individuals used a single day burrow and several shelter burrows. Use of day burrows was exclusive, but shelter burrows often were used by several individuals. When foraging, S. telum used a walking gait and harvested seedheads from low (15-25 cm) grasses; bipedal saltation was used only for escape. No food cache or caching behavior was observed.\n      </p>", "In this article Luke March explores the Russian authorities' efforts to \"manage democracy\" through the creation of \"parties of power.\" It focuses on the quasi-leftist party Just Russia, one of four parties currently represented in the Russian Duma and the only one that represents a \"parastatal\" opposition (opposition owned and controlled by the state). The history of Just Russia tells us much about the dynamics of what Andrew Wilson has described as Russia's \"virtual politics\": the regime must continually organize manageable quasi-opposition parties in order to bolster its democratic credentials and channel real social discontent, yet when-ever it does so effectively, it quickly creates a potential political threat that must be neutralized. Just Russia has parallels in other authoritarian party systems, such as Mexico under the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) or Nigeria under Abacha and Babangida; the main difference in contemporary Russia lies in the remarkable skill with which Russian state actors conjure up and promote ersatz parties. Nevertheless, even in Russia, virtual politics may become real politics in the longer term.\n      </p>", "Barter in Russia mainly comes from liquidity shortage. However, barter persists despite the conditions of its emergence having vanished. This paper proposes an institutional and Post Keynesian interpretation of this fact, qualified as \"barter hysteresis.\" In a context of radical uncertainty, the lack of liquidity generates adaptative behaviors and institutional creations that will survive the monetary shortage. Network-organized barter acts as an alternative payment and financing institution while supporting the production activities. Hysteresis then stems from the fact that the entry into such a private payment system may be viewed as an uncertain irreversible investment with sunk costs.\n      </p>", "Embracing the Russian Federation since 2003, the Bologna process is no longer exclusively confined to western European countries. As early as 1999, Vladimir Putin declared the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, wedged between Lithuania and Poland, as a potential pilot region for intensified cooperation between Russia and the EU on a number of policy areas, including higher education. In this paper, we study whether the Bologna process has served to underpin these ambitions. With a view to the EU, we will ask to what extent the European Union has proffered a model or directly influenced the path for transformation of Kaliningrad's higher education system. We argue that a number of Kaliningrad-based actors in higher education have recognized the salience of European models and the need to work closely with partners from the EU, while Moscow only allows for marginal discretion in terms of Kaliningrad's higher educational policy.\n      </p>", "The breeding biology of the Pigeon Guillemot (Cepphus columba) was studied at Cape Ulyakhpen, the Chukotka Peninsula, Russia, in 1988-1990.

This sense of impunity is critical, for it creates a climate in which torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment is used as a tool to expedite the investigative process and guarantee the success of the subsequent prosecution. This study argues that impunity for torture by law enforcement officials in Russia is fostered by three discernible factors. First, the Criminal Code inadequately articulates the prohibition of torture. Second, the Code of Criminal Procedure contains substantive shortcomings that create a structure that both incentivizes torture and discourages investigation into allegations of torture. And, third, allegations of ill treatment and torture that are raised during trial trigger no substantive investigative actions. The combined effect of these factors is that the state, in effect, fosters the law enforcement officers\u2019 sense of impunity.

This essay posits potato as an axis of practice, around which myriad gestures of labor, exchange, and consumption are organized; it also presents potato as a complex system of knowledge, embedded in historical memory and encapsulating local theories of economic devolution. Several ethnographic and economic studies have analyzed the significance of postsocialist food growing; this essay focuses on the chief product of that labor and the narratives that circulate around it. It argues that although potato conveys popular critiques of social stratification, it also frames experiences of personhood.\n      </p>", "We conducted seabird surveys along the entire coast of the Chukotka Peninsula (northwestern Siberia, Russia) from 1983 to 1991.

Our estimate that at least 3 300000 seabirds breed on the Chukotka Peninsula demonstrates the importance of this region to arctic seabird populations.

In a sample of 422 villagers, there were 37 family members of survivors of Stalinist purges. In comparison to villagers with no family history of persecution, those who had such history perceived their social life with other villagers and their life in general to be much improved in the late 1990s. They also reported much lower levels of depression than those without a history of persecution. Differences that were discovered could not be accounted for by demographic characteristics of the respondents. The results suggest that individuals with a history of family trauma related to political persecution may perceive their environment as more positive as a result of political changes and may cope with political transitions differently than persons who have no history of family persecution.\n      </p>", "El presente trabajo tiene el prop\u00f3sito de analizar los objectivos y las direcciones fundamentales de la proyecci\u00f3n asi\u00e1tica de la pol\u00edtica energ\u00e9tica de Rusia hasta el a\u00f1o 2020, as\u00ed como poner de manifiesto sus primeros resultados reales.

Using satellite tracking, we followed 11 White-naped Cranes (Grus vipio) on migration from their breeding grounds in eastern Russia to their wintering grounds in China and Japan. From 1991 to 1993, we captured cranes with the aid of helicopters and attached satellite transmitters (platform transmitter terminals) to captured birds via a harness system. We tracked cranes for 156 days on average, across 2558 km, and obtained an average of 339 locations per crane. Cranes migrated over 8-90 days. During migration, birds spent 1-30 days at 4-12 rest sites. Cranes wintered at two main sites: Poyang Lake, China, and Izumi, Japan. All seven cranes migrating to the Poyang lake area rested at the Yellow River delta-Bohai Bay, China, and all three traveling to Izumi rested in the Demilitarized Zone on the Korean Peninsula. Other important rest sites were marshes around the Wulagai River, Huainan, Hu-Lun Lake, Linyi, Tangshan, the Three Rivers (Sanjiang) Plain, Tianjin, and the Xar Moron; all in China, and Lake Khanka-Xinghai at the border of China and Russia. The habitats resting cranes used most frequently were plains, including upland areas, marshes, and rivers. Although nature reserves exist at the two main wintering sites of Poyang Lake and Izumi, rest sites used by cranes were poorly protected. Even when areas used by cranes for resting or wintering were included in nature reserves, reserves were threatened by human encroachment and development. To ensure that cranes can continue to migrate successfully, it is crucial that the establishment of reserves continues at important rest areas and that the areas covered by reserves at wintering sites be extended to include more of the areas utilized by cranes. Also, development and human disturbance should be minimized in reserve areas. Because long-distance migrant birds, including cranes, range over such large areas, conservation of these organisms and their habitats necessitates multinational communication and cooperation.\n      </p>", "From 1992 to 1994 life expectancy for Russian males dropped from 62.0 to 57.6 years. Female life expectancy dropped from 73.8 years to 71.2 years. This drop in life expectancy coincided in time with the introduction of painful economic reforms in Russia, leading to a rapid decrease in real wages and pensions, nearly complete loss of personal savings, and a tremendous increase in the poverty rate. This article examines the temporary changes in mortality for violent causes of death during the crisis period with a special emphasis on age-specific and gender-specific differences in the response to economic crisis.\n      </p>", "The author argues that the decline of philosophical thought and research in Russia is over. He describes the state of present-day philosophy in Russia, its background, and prospects for development citing concrete examples and little known facts. Any survey of the state of the philosophy in post-Communist Russia is a complicated task requiring accuracy and completness. Whether I succeed in this task remains to be seen, although I shall be content if I manage to present a clear picture. It will of course be subjective and reflect my interests and preferences, remaining in this sense quite incomplete. But I aim to present a concise survey, identifying the most important trends, personalities, and topics of discussion. I shall focus on changes with respect to the following issues: 1) the state of research in philosophy, in particular noticeable shifts in problematics, geography, and management; 2) philosophical education, i.e., noticeable development in problematics, approaches, geography, and management. Moreover, I shall examine the origin of these shifts and assess whether they are of a qualitative character.\n      </p>", "This paper re-examines the gender wage gap in Russia between 1994 and 1998 taking into account the pervasiveness of Russia's non-payment institutions. Using censored regression techniques we investigate wage discrimination at different sections of the income distribution and for various important sub-groups. We find that the wage gap is distributed unevenly. Most notably, women at the lower end of the income distribution suffer the highest degree of discrimination. However, we find that wage arrears and payment in-kind attenuated wage discrimination, particularly amongst the lowest paid workers, suggesting that Russian enterprise managers assigned importance to equity considerations when allocating these forms of non-payment.\n      </p>", "This study uses data on 374 respondents, aged 16 and older, from the Moscow Oblast Survey to examine the relationship between alcohol consumption and divorce in Russia. A logit regression model of drinking in Moscow finds that both divorced and single persons have elevated risks of drinking relative to married persons. This relationship is independent of control variables including gender, education level, and religiosity. Hence, although Russian alcohol consumption has been largely typified as a reaction to macrosociological problems such as terrorism and chronic shortages of consumer goods, a Western model of divorce and drinking is supported.\n      </p>", "Due to its geo-strategically intermediate location between the East and the West, Russia pursues a multi-vector foreign policy approach toward the West (Europe), Center (Eurasia), and East (Asia), with Northeast Asia (inclusive of the Korean peninsula) included in the latter. Thus, relations with European countries in its West-orientation, relations with former Soviet states in its Center-orientation, relations with Asian-Pacific (especially Northeast Asian) countries in its East-orientation, as well as, its relations with US on the global level, all comprise the fundamental construct of Russian foreign policy-deeply interrelated, influencing one another. Therefore, if tension mounts from the West or Center, it is more than likely that Russia would respond in the East as well. However, fundamentally, the Russian foreign policy in Northeast Asia appears to continue the present policy of balancing the regional powers and securing its status in the region. In fact, Russia encourages this paradigm by strengthening its role and position through various initiatives. Given that, Russia' s policy toward Northeast Asia and the Korean Peninsula, by the newly formed Medvedev's administration, will not differ greatly from the previous Putin administration's policies. It will continue to expand its influence and endorse policy which strengthens Russia's role in forming regional security system. Essentially, Russia will promote its regional influence by building strong Sino-Russian relations, drive efforts to increase its influence on North Korea, and stabilize its relations with South Korea. Positively, it will try to constrain United States' unilateral influence in this region, and will also try to counter China's rise to be a regional hegemonic power, if necessary. To that end, Russia puts a high priority on the development of the Six-Party Talks into a permanent Multilateral Peace and Security Regime within the region.\n      </p>", "This paper evaluates the performance of fiscal policy since the 1998 crisis, along several dimensions and using a variety of indicators. Russia has progressed tremendously in recent years on public debt sustainability largely because the real interest rates on public debt have been negative and growth has been high. However, the constant oil-price balance shows a progressive worsening starting in 2001 with a modest reversal in 2004. As to optimal fiscal policy in a country endowed with exhaustible resources, analysis of the nonoil fiscal balance shows that Russian fiscal policy has had a mixed record. It has spent part of the windfall before introducing the oil stabilization fund, but has saved most of the oil revenues in the last two years. The standard fiscal impulse shows that budget policy has not contributed to the increase in aggregate demand since 2003. However, the fiscal position was not tight enough to contain the inflationary effect of the exceptional oil windfalls for the economy as a whole.\n      </p>", "Only one of Russia's 89 provinces has bolted--so far. But the West must face a disturbing new dynamic: the Kremlin's weakening grasp on the entire Russian Federation. More and more, Russia's restless regions are asserting themselves in domestic and international affairs, whether Moscow lets them or not. The center will probably hold. But America and its allies must learn to contend with a larger cast of actors who are both unfamiliar and unruly.\n      </p>", "In this article I investigate ritual life at the Moscow Choral Synagogue, the largest and longest running Orthodox synagogue in the Russian capital. Unlike many Eastern European synagogues, this synagogue is a thriving prayer community due to its unique congregation of Russian, Georgian, Bukharan, Mountain, and visiting Western Jews. I focus on a fistfight that took place between an Israeli and a Georgian Jew during prayer. I detail how Russian and Georgian Jews interpreted the incident to be a result of their different ethnicities, Russian and Georgian respectively. The fight elucidates how ritual in post-Soviet society provides the means for the production of ethnicity and Jewish identity. Arguing for localism within Judaism's transnational ideology, I suggest that Jewish identity, like ritual, is performative and contextual. I also show how the shifting power relations in post-Soviet society have reshaped ethnicity, making state-endorsed market reform a reference point of ethnic differentiation.\n      </p>", "In northern Taimyr, Russia, nest attendance and changes in body-mass during incubation of a Greater White-fronted Goose (Anser albifrons albifrons) were studied with the help of a balance under the nest. All the energy required during incubation was derived from catabolism of endogenous stores since the female did not feed during this period. Body-mass loss was 25.4 g per day. The cost during incubation at an average air temperature of 9 \u00b0C was estimated to be 610 kJ per day which is only slightly more than Basal Metabolism Rate (BMR, predicted on the basis of an interspecific allometric equation). Cost of thermoregulation during incubation was estimated at 2.1 g body stores per day per \u00b0C; this is equivalent to an overall thermal conductance value of 0.59 W \u00b0C.\n      </p>", "Using Reidenbach and Robin's (Journal of Business Ethics 7, 871-879, 1988) multi-criteria ethics instrument, we carried out the first empirical test of Robertson and Crittenden's (Strategic Management Journal 24, 385-392, 2003) cross-cultural map of moral philosophies to examine what ethical criteria guide business people in Russia and the U.S. in their intention to behave.

The paper notes the origins of those studied in the professional or highly skilled workers in the former Soviet Union. The paper reveals the complexity and fragility of the circumstances of these entrepreneurs and suggests that commentary in both Russia and the West that pins its hopes for social stability on the emergence of a new property owning middle class in Russia are, at best, premature.\n      </p>", "I examine issues tied to the alleged difficulties of mutual understanding between Russia and the West. I show that some of the background to these issues lies in the difference of culturally grounded differences in perceptual and conceptual schemata. In the West, a broadly understood Aristotelianism and in Russia Neoplatonism designate dominant attitudes to the world. The Russian 'lunar' consciousness, in comparison with the 'solar' consciousness of the West, tends by and large precipitously to totalize the world, and the experienced multiplicity of the real is referred to its imagined center. The difference between Russia and the West, limited to some degree by mutual similarities, can become the basis of an axiological and intellectual dialogue important for one side and the other.\n      </p>", "This paper designs an index of socio-economic development in Russia following the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991. The purpose of this index is to act as a measure of a regions' economic potential for the purpose of regional comparison and also to help policy makers in designing future regional economic policy. Finally, with the use of this weighted index this paper proposes some suggestions concerning the future design of regional economic policy in Russia.\n      </p>", "This paper studies the determinants of the unusually high and volatile price differential between common (voting) shares and preferred (nonvoting) shares in Russia' emerging stock market. It focuses on three potential explanations for the price spread between these two classes of stock: the control contest model of the voting premium, the inferior liquidity of preferred shares, and the risk of expropriation of preferred shareholders as a class. The regression analysis, based on data from 1997 to 2005, supports the control contest explanation and the liquidity argument. The hypothesis of expropriation of preferred shareholders as a class receives limited support, and only in the early period of the Russian stock market's development. The paper addresses the issue of structural breaks in the evolution of the price differential, related to the 1998 financial crisis and to improvements in investor protection in Russia in the early 2000s. It also provides new estimates of the magnitude of the private benefits of control in Russian companies.\n      </p>", "The continuous zone of settlement long considered a defining feature of Europe, is undergoing spatial fragmentation along its eastern periphery. Massive areas of rural depopulation have emerged in many regions of European Russia, including its heartland. As a result of farmland abandonment, no fewer than 20 million hectares of arable land are already deserted in European Russia, and more will be left behind in the foreseeable future. The ongoing spatial fragmentation results in two diverging structures, identified on the basis of a unique district-structured database: an emerging archipelago of commercial farming, and the so-called black holes, the likely loci of soon-to-be-abandoned land. While land abandonment is by no means a uniquely Russian phenomenon, one of its preconditions in Russia is that farmland was extended beyond environmentally reasonable limits. The rural depopulation naturally leads to the contraction of farmland. Because land that is likely to be retained under cultivation is a better match to people's actual ability to cultivate it, fewer resources are going to be wasted, and the overall efficiency of Russia's agriculture is likely to rise as a result.\n      </p>", "Something happened on the way to the fire sale of Russia's vast natural resources. In the wake of the Soviet collapse, new Russian conglomerates-not bigger, more experienced Western firms-unexpectedly came out on top.

But their success depends on how quickly they can abandon the shady business practices on which their empires were built.\n      </p>", "The Russian nickel refineries located in the cities of Nikel and Zapolyarny close to the Norwegian border are responsible for extensive sulfur dioxide and nickel pollution, as well as severe ecological damage in both countries. The aim of our study was to investigate human nickel exposure in the populations living on both sides of the Norwegian-Russian border. The design was a cross-sectional population-based study of adults aged 18-69 years residing in S\u00f8r-Varanger municipality, Norway, and Nikel and Zapolyarny, Russia, during 1994 and 1995. Individual exposure to nickel was assessed by measurements of nickel in urine using electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry. For controls, urine was collected from adults in the Russian cities of Apatity and Umba (Kola Peninsula) and the Norwegian city of Troms\u00f8, all of which are locations without nearby point sources of nickel. Altogether 2,233 urine specimens were analysed for nickel. People living in Nikel had the highest concentrations (median 3.4 \u03bcg/l), followed by Umba (median 2.7 \u03bcg/l), Zapolyarny (median 2.0 \u03bcg/l), Apatity (median 1.9 \u03bcg/l), Troms\u00f8 (median 1.2 \u03bcg/l), and S\u00f8r-Varanger (median 0.6 \u03bcg/l). Regardless of geographical location, the Russian study groups all had a higher urinary-nickel average than those in Norway (p&lt;0.001). With the exception of Nikel, neither the Russian nor the Norwegian urinary-nickel levels were associated with residence location near a Russian nickel refinery. We concluded that industrial nickel pollution alone could not explain the observed discrepancy between Norway and Russia; we also discuss other possible nickel exposure sources that may account for the high urinary levels found in Russia.\n      </p>", "Leaders of commodity-exporting states will sometimes push exports even when world prices are declining, if export receipts allow access to international capital markets. This article demonstrates that such state-mediated ties between commodity and capital markets shaped the politics of foreign trade in tsarist, and then Soviet, Russia. It also refutes an alternate, group-centered explanation of the same historical cases proposed in Rogowski's Commerce and Coalitions, pointing out serious empirical errors and oversights. These empirical problems have methodological roots. Searching for universal \"laws,\" rather than sometimes relevant \"mechanisms,\" limits the consideration of counterhypotheses to those that apply to a whole universe of cases, rather than a subset of them. Because such counterhypotheses serve to determine which data are relevant, their exclusion weakens the empirical tests to which proposed laws are subjected. Thus, the ambition for generality may cause scholars to become inadvertently too generous to the theories they seek to test.\n      </p>", "Drawing from concepts of cultural distance and cultural propensity to change, we predict the convergence, divergence or crossvergence of distributive justice values in China and Russia, as compared with US managers. Using institutional theory, we predict responses by organizational type (joint ventures/foreignowned vs state-owned enterprises (SOEs)). Lastly, we develop predictions based on the interaction of culture and organizational type. Results indicate divergence in China, regardless of organizational type. In contrast, differences by organizational type were observed among Russian managers, with convergence among managers in joint ventures, but continuing divergence among managers in SOEs. Implications for theory are discussed.\n      </p>", "During spring-fall 1985-95, 5 groups of orphaned brown bear cubs (Ursus arctos) were captive-raised in the Central-Forest Biosphere Reserve in Russia. The groups of 2-12 individuals were raised to be released in the wild. We documented the onset of aggressive behavior between cubs. When cubs were 3 to 40-45 days old they were not aggressive toward one another. Low intensity aggressive behavior developed between 45-55 days. After 60 days of age, aggressive reactions were observed near food, including milk bottles, food cups, or natural foods. At age 5-7 months some cubs stayed in the wild surroundings of the station, did not return to their artificial den, and fed on ant (Formica spp.) brood pupae and larvae. Individual success in getting ants was inversely proportional to the level of social activity and aggression in the group. Individual success was highest in small groups (2-3 animals) where the number of aggressive contacts and the degree of dominant behavior was lower than in groups of 6-12 individuals. Subordinate members of large groups were very irritable and stayed immobile for long periods. They also revealed the pathological habit of paw sucking and their growth rate was retarded. After the age of 6 months when bears cubs stayed in the woods, these large groups spontaneously separated into smaller groups of 2-3 cubs. We suggest that aggressive behavior in cubs regulates group size, and the age of onset and level of aggression are adaptive features for brown bear survival. Aggression begins when ants are most abundant (Jun-Jul) and when lactation declines in free-ranging female bears. The more aggressive individual would likely be the most fit under these circumstances. We provide evidence that size of the brown bear family is an optimal solution of maintaining the population within the constraints of (1) the resource base, (2) the level of aggression among family members, and (3) the physiological traits of nursing by females. Based on these factors, we consider 3 cubs to be the optimal litter size. Larger litters would probably have difficulty in getting enough protein-rich food, while smaller litters could lead to population decline.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "Using data from a panel survey of a representative probability sample of Russian households, we examine how individual traits, locality, and \"sex-event context\" are associated with condom use in contemporary Russia. At the individual level, age has negative effects and measures of risk orientation have positive effects on the probability of condom use; for women, education has positive effects and Muslim belief has negative effects. Condom use is higher among residents in Moscow and St. Petersburg and lower (for women) among rural residents. Most importantly, the same individuals make different choices about condom use from one sex event to the next, and their choices are systematically related to the nature and duration of their relationship to their partner, as well as to their partner's age. Condom use is prevalent in casual encounters and in those involving new partners or commercial sex workers. Coupled with the strong effects of age for both partners, this pattern represents good news regarding the potential for the spread of HIV in Russia. Other findings are more worrisome: HIV awareness and knowledge of condoms' effectiveness in blocking transmission of the virus do not influence condom use at all, and married people are relatively unlikely to use condoms even in extramarital encounters and especially in long-term affairs. Accordingly, interventions should target older Russians who are married and have sex with long-term nonspousal partners.\n      </p>", "This article compares the impact of globalization on the political systems and political economy of Russia and China since the beginning of their respective reform periods.

Second, it looks at the converging attitudes of the two regimes towards industrial restructuring and privatization, highlighting the continued role that they both reserve for state direction. This includes an orientation towards national industrial champions. Third, the evolution of policies of both states towards guided democratization are discussed leading to an assessment of the importance of nationalism in their responses to globalization, particularly in the recent doctrine of 'sovereign democracy' of Putin's United Russia party.

In the Cold War period, the Russian and Japanese governments conducted the negotiations in context of the Cold War paradigm that was based on superpower rivalry. However, the end of the Cold War brought other elements for forming national policy, which included regional and local interests in the 1990s. In other words, the issue in the Southern Kurile Islands was no longer considered solely as a power struggle. This study refers to the existence of linkage between the national governments and regional and local parties that share common interests over the territorial issue. In the 1990s, in spite of different perspectives on the issue, regional and local cooperation between the Russian and the Japanese was gradually enhanced. At the same time, both central governments adopted a conciliatory manner to conduct territorial negotiations. Although the two governments could not reach an agreement to settle the territorial issue, both new conditions in the 1990s became new incentives for the future settlement. I argue that intergovernmental negotiations that involve not only national but also regional and local concerns are products of interaction of policies and perceptions of the national government, the region, and local residents.\n      </p>", "In this paper we present a demographic analysis of the marital and fertility careers of Russian women, born between 1900 and 1960 and based on individual retrospective life histories, collected in the most recent (five percent) microcensus of the Russian Federation from 1994.

The point of his teaching is the preservation of the traditional social/cultural make-up of each civilization.

He emphasizes that globalism, led by the USA, is a mortal threat to the cultural identity of Russia/Eurasia and all other civilizations. For this reason the USA and Russia are locked in mortal conflict with one other. At the outset of his intellectual career, in post-Soviet Russia, Dugin believed that Putin would follow the Eurasian road.

This means that we consider not only factor conditions, but also demand conditions, the presence and status of related and supporting industries, firm strategy, structure, and rivalry, and the role of government in creating a competitive Russian forestry. Our analysis of the factor conditions prevailing in the mid to late 1990s indicates that the prospects for the Russian forestry could be very good. However, this potential will be realized only if substantial problems can be solved with regard to revising government policy, clarifying property rights, developing and maintaining the infrastructure, and achieving a stable and not too rapid increase in costs.

While the former suggests that the fertility decline after 1989 is associated with the economic hardship accompanying the transition to a market economy, the micro-evidence using the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey is to the contrary. There is no negative association between labour market uncertainty or a labour market crisis and fertility, and frequently there is even a positive association. That is, women or couples who are themselves affected by labour market crises often had a higher probability of having another child in the period 1994-1996 than women/couples who were less affected by such crises. The lack of a negative association, and the presence of a positive association in many instances, is surprising from the standpoint of economic fertility theory. It is also contrary to many explanatory theories about the recent fertility decline in Central and Eastern European countries that are built on a more or less direct connection between the labour market or an economic crisis and low fertility. /// Cet article, qui analyse la baisse de la f\u00e9condit\u00e9 en Russie au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 1990 dans une double perspective macro et micro, pr\u00e9sente une divergence frappante entre ces deux points de vue. Alors que le premier sugg\u00e8re que la baisse de la f\u00e9condit\u00e9 apr\u00e8s 1989 est associ\u00e9e aux difficult\u00e9s \u00e9conomiques g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9es par le passage \u00e0 l'\u00e9conomie de march\u00e9, l'analyse micro, qui s'appuie sur l'enqu\u00eate de surveillance longitudinale russe, arrive au r\u00e9sultat inverse. Il n'existe aucune association n\u00e9gative entre l'instabilit\u00e9 \u00e9conomique ou la crise du march\u00e9 du travail et la f\u00e9condit\u00e9 et souvent on retrouve m\u00eame une association positive. Ainsi, les femmes ou les couples qui \u00e9taient touch\u00e9s par la crise du march\u00e9 du travail ont souvent eu une plus grande probabilit\u00e9 d'avoir un autre enfant dans les ann\u00e9es 1994-1996 que ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9pargn\u00e9s par cette crise. L'absence d'association n\u00e9gative ou m\u00eame, dans certains cas, l'existence d'une relation positive, ne cadrent pas avec la th\u00e9orie \u00e9conomique de la f\u00e9condit\u00e9. Elles vont aussi \u00e0 l'encontre des nombreuses th\u00e9ories explicatives sur la baisse r\u00e9cente de la f\u00e9condit\u00e9 dans les pays d'Europe centrale et orientale qui reposent sur une relation plus ou moins directe entre crise \u00e9conomique et basse f\u00e9condit\u00e9.\n      </p>", "The Kamchatka Ecology and Nature Management Institute has been censusing brown bears (Ursus arctos) in the southern part of the Kamchatka peninsula (Russian Far East) since 1991. The censused area comprised 11,045 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; within the districts of Yelizovo, Ust' Bolsheretsk, Sobolevo, and Ust' Kamchatsk. We used an aerial total count method while flying in small fixed-wing planes during late spring (May-early Jun) to collect data on bear numbers, their distribution, den location, birth rate, and cub survival. A total of 1,051 bears was observed during 83 hours of overflight time during 1991, 1993, and 1994. Our yearly estimates of average bear densities in the southern part of Kamchatka (54,100 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; study area) ranged from 0.81 to 1.30 bears/10 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Some areas had high bear density (&gt;1.7 bears/10 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) despite hunting pressure. Bear numbers declined (&lt;0.8 bears/10 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) near settlements along main roads. The main threat to brown bears in Kamchatka is poaching for bear parts by local residents. We recommend that aerial censuses be expanded and improved to more accurately estimate population status and trends. Alternate means of employment in ecotourism and outfitting should be developed for local residents to encourage their support of measures to sustain Kamchatka's brown bears.\n      </p>", "With China's accession to the WTO in 2001, Russia is by far that organization's most prominent nonmember. This paper applies the gravity model to gauge whether this \"outsider\" status has been affecting Russia's export structure. On the basis of cross-section and panel regressions for 1995-2002, we find that Russian exports to WTO members have fallen short of the model's predictions. The paper discusses possible explanations of this result, including Russia's exclusion from various WTO procedures, although own-export restrictions could have a similar effect. The model points to Russia's further trade reorientation toward WTO members after a putative accession. Our results also prompt some ideas that may clarify the recent empirical controversy over the WTO's overall role in promoting trade.\n      </p>", "The dynamics of collective remembering are examined by analyzing what happens when a \"blank spot\" in history is filled with information that had previously not been available or publicly acknowledged. Taking Russian accounts of the secret protocols of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939 as a case study, it is argued that \"schematic narrative templates\" that shape deep collective memory give rise to a tendency to maintain this memory and help it overcome the \"narrative rift\" that occurs when embarrassing episodes from the past are publicly acknowledged. Schematic narrative templates are set forth as underlying strong conservative forces that resist change in collective memory at a deep level. It is suggested that debates grounded in formal history may help overcome this resistance to change but that such efforts will be limited as long as the forces of deep collective memory are not recognized.\n      </p>", "Russia's social and economic transformation at the beginning of the twentieth century was accompanied by profound cultural and artistic transformation. In particular, Russian cultural elites struggled to control and contain what they saw as threats to Russia's national culture. At the same time, however, they sought ways to bring the working classes into a closer cultural accord with educated society. Although these efforts continued a long process of intelligentsia efforts to shape Russian society by controlling the development of \u201cthe people,\u201d industrialization and urbanization had already begun to fundamentally restructure the relationship between the educated and popular classes.\n         In musical life, the intelligentsia struggled with two somewhat contradictory impulses: first, to simultaneously protect musical and song traditions from the threat of contamination by new urban genres; and second, to develop \u201crational recreations\u201d that would appeal to the peasantry and the urban working classes. To those ends, they created, among other activities, accessible (obshchedostupnyi) concerts, temperance choirs, and singing classes in a wide variety of locations across the Russian Empire. These musical projects were part of a much larger, somewhat utopian effort by educated society to create an ideal Russia by eliminating its supposed social, cultural, economic, and political backwardness relative to Western Europe. Nevertheless, the consequences for Russian musical life proved significant. Not only did these efforts lay the moral and intellectual foundation for Soviet-era interventionist and utopian cultural policies, but they also in the short term significantly diversified and democratized musical life in the last decades of tsarist rule.\n      </p>", "Recently, the Centre for Demography and Human Ecology in Moscow in collaboration with the Institut National d'Etudes Dimographiques in Paris undertook a reconstruction of registered deaths in individual republics of the former Soviet Union. The first set of such data, tabulated by sex, age and cause of death, covers the deaths registered in Russia between 1965 and 1993. The present article extracts from the data set information on registered suicide mortality and reviews its trends and age and sex patterns. The link between alcoholism and suicide is strongly suggested.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img
