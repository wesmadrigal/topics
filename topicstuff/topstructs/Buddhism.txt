The study has been realized through readings and meetings with Japanese Buddhist monks and/or Japanese immigrants. These intellectuals defend a religious experience based on a universal notion of representations of Japanese Buddhism, which provides them with a non-dualistic philosophical perspective and a unique psychological experience. Through innovative spiritual experiences these intellectuals have broken the tension created within the dispute between secularized science and the Catholic hegemony, both predominant in the intellectual panorama.\n      </p>", "There has been little dedicated sociological research on the appeal Buddhism holds for many individuals in the West. It is suggested that this absence reflects a current tendency within the discipline to highlight a new age approach to spiritual involvement and to overlook other optional styles of engagement. Such a pattern of study is concerning because the propensity to privilege the new age style would seem to be less an outcome of a coherent research agenda than a result of the currency that the idea of postmodern religion has come to assume in theoretical accounts of spiritual transformation in contemporary societies. Using data from a modest quantitative survey, the study investigates spiritual style among a sample of Australians who have developed an interest in Buddhist practice and belief. The results point to the prevalence of a traditional approach to involvement, whereby the individual decides to engage solely with Buddhism for the long duration. Given its possession of these qualities, the research goes on to examine the social patterning of spiritual commitment. The findings suggest that comprehending the social restrictions to any kind of involvement is a more pressing sociological question than explaining social divergences among the engaged.\n      </p>", "This article examines how organizational context shapes the way gender is socially constructed in two non-Judeo-Christian religious organizations in the United States, one Theravada Buddhist organization founded by immigrants and one started by converts. People at the two organizations disagree with each other about what Theravada Buddhism teaches about women in teaching and leadership positions but agree that outside of these positions, women and men are equally able to gain access to and practice the tradition. Despite these understandings, women and men have distinct gender roles and responsibilities at each organization that are in tension with what the leaders and attendees understand the tradition to teach. The extent to which teachers and attendees recognize these tensions and the ways they respond to them are explored, and their implications for each organization and for studies of gender and religious organizations are discussed.\n      </p>", "In Tibet, certain categories of Buddhist sacra are ascribed the power to liberate through sensory contact. No less than \"buddhahood without meditation\" is promised, offering an expedient means to salvation that seemingly obviates the need for a rigorous regime of ethical, contemplative, and intellectual training. This article investigates two such categories of sacra, substances that \"liberate through tasting\" and images that \"liberate through seeing\" as found in a mode of revelation particular to Tibet and culturally related areas, in which scriptures and sacred objects are reportedly embedded in the landscape as terma or \"treasures\" (gter ma). The author argues that charisma invested in these substances and images \u2014 through an amalgamation of relics and special means of consecration \u2014 provides the grounds for the soteriological benefits claimed as a result of sensory contact with them. The question is whether these benefits suggest a notion of grace in Tibetan Buddhism, and if so how it might contravene without contradicting the law of karma. Exploring this question sheds light on the role of the senses and the nature of Buddhist soteriology as it developed in Tibet.\n      </p>", "Damien and John Keown claim that there is important common ground between Buddhism and Christianity on the issue of euthanasia and that both traditions oppose it for similar reasons in order to espouse a \"sanctity of life\" position. I argue that the appearance of consensus is partly created by their failure to specify clearly enough certain key notions in the argument: particularly \"Buddhism,\" \"euthanasia\" and the \"sanctity of life.\" Once this is done, the Keowns' central claims can be seen to be either false or only restrictedly true.\n      </p>", "This paper explores the complex relationship between Nichiren and esoteric Buddhism (mikky\u014d). It first reconsiders the received view of Nichiren as an intransigent and systematic critic of all forms of esotericism, and suggests that his criticism should be understood as a strategy of legitimation. It then attempts to reevaluate Nichiren's interactions with the Buddhism of his time, focusing on the influence that notions developed in Tendai esotericism (Taimitsu) and rituals in vogue in the early medieval period exercised on Nichiren. In particular, it considers Nichiren's construction of a mandala as the object of worship (honzon) of his Lotus Buddhism. Nichiren used his knowledge of esotericism to reinforce the exclusive faith in the Lotus S\u016btra that he advocated. His tendency to amalgamate ideas originating from different traditions places him in a line of continuity with the forms of Buddhism that preceded him. In this respect, the analysis of Nichiren's relation to esoteric Buddhism also becomes significant as a case study for a reexamination of the tenets of early medieval Buddhism (Kamakura Buddhism).\n      </p>", "As Buddhism spread into China, the Mahayana (Dacheng) and Hinayana (Xiaocheng) schools, as well as the kong \u7a7a (empty) or you \u6709 (being) schools, each developed separately, with all sorts of competing theories emerging. While Chinese Buddhism saw a revival in modern times, Western science also gained ground all over the country, and many scholars, technologists and monks sought to interpret the meaning of kong according the achievements and method of the natural sciences. They used science to interpret the content and methods of Buddhist teachings, ontology, and outlook on life. Of the scholars who did so, Wang Jitong (\u738b\u5b63\u540c) and You Zhibiao (\u5c24\u667a\u8868) are the most excellent.\n      </p>", "This paper begins by describing the early history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka as recorded in the two Pali chronicles, the Dipavamsa and the Mahavamsa. Their general approach treats the introduction of Buddhism into the island as a royal package sent by the Emperor Asoka to his Sri Lankan ally Devanampiya Tissa, through the former's son and daughter, Mahinda and Sanghamitta. Buddhism was immediately accepted as the state religion, thus linking it with the destiny of the Sinhala people. This pattern is not, however, supported by the only extant category of Buddhist archaeological remains from this period - over 1,000 Buddhist cave-dwellings. It is clear from their dedicatory inscriptions that they were constructed by patrons bearing high royal titles about whom the chronicles are remarkably silent. By drawing from studies of modern forest-dwelling monks, it is possible to identify more fully the processes at work and to identify the discrepancy between the two records. It is argued that the first monks attracted political patronage by virtue of their ascetic discipline and soon became one of the vehicles for competition between localized political organizations. As this competition ended, a single high king ruling a loose political federation emerged, with the formerly ascetic monastery communities as wealthy feudal landlords; both were increasingly interdependent. This relationship led to the creation of a foundation myth forever cementing the interests of the legitimate rulers with the survival and patronage of Buddhism.\n      </p>", "In this study concerning exorcising demons (yakku) in Sinhala Buddhism the scapegoat mechanism theory of Ren\u00e9 Girard is used as reference. The author first explains that the original residents of Sri Lanka were demonized after having been subjugated by the Aryan newcomer (conqueror) from North India; furthermore Buddhism adapted itself to this process of demonizing inhabitants and their gods. The central part of the study deals with the ritual of sacrificing a surrogate victim to placate the \"violent\" demons Mahasona and Riri Yakka, when they take possession of human beings. Until. now it has been generally understood, that animal sacrifice was eradicated completely from Sinhala Buddhist society. The real killing of a surrogate victim moreover seems to have been overlooked or ignored in recent anthropological studies about exorcism in the Sinhala Buddhist part of Sri Lanka. The emphasis is laid on mask-dance, music, and comedy. -The author however claims that sacrificial substitution not only is an essential part of the yakka ritual, but that this limited sacrificial practice also has been given a more or less official sanction in Sinhala Buddhism through a kind of mythic charter between the demons and the gods, the latter acting in the name of Buddha.\n      </p>", "Although syncretism as a cultural phenomenon is a widely recognized feature of the transmission of religion from one culture to another, the particular adjustment made by the folk religions to world missionary religions is not widely mentioned as such in the literature of the history of religions. In this paper, the author explores the accommodation made by the folk religion of Korea to Buddhism. In doing so, two different types of syncretism are examined, and the concept of \"reverse syncretism\" is discussed.\n      </p>", "Won Buddhism was founded in the early 20th century, but although it is one of the more important new religions in modern Korea little research has been undertaken on it to date by non-members. In this introductory study based on field observations and text studies, essential information is presented which will provide a starting point for further investigations. This includes an outline of the historical development, set in motion by the founder Pak Chung-Bin (1891-1943), and of the general features of Won Buddhism as a religion. Particular attention is given to Won Buddhism's role in modernisation processes, to the question of gender balance, and to the sense in which Won Buddhism should be regarded as a \"new religion\" on the one hand and as a form of \"Buddhism\" on the other hand. Of methodological interest is a sub-discussion running through the article about the delicate relationship between believers' and observers' accounts of a religion. Four illustrations are included.\n      </p>", "A major premise of this paper is that Buddhism provides a logic and means to help resolve this tension between in-grained economic system imperatives and the changes actually required for achieving environmental sustainability. In this simple depiction, we examine the logic inherent within Buddhism's Four Noble Truths, and the means proffered in the Eightfold Path, and extend upon these basic ideas with knowledge and experience available from 21 st century environmental science, economics and technology fields. The ultimate goal is to illustrate how this ancient wisdom can help inform and facilitate the successful transformation to sustainable human economies.\n      </p>", "In medieval Japan, H\u014dnen and Shinran appropriated the rhetoric of \"other-power\" and \"easy-practice\" to validate their radical doctrines and draw dividing lines between themselves and the established schools of the day. In this essay, I argue that these are not useful categories for understanding the religious dynamics of the period. Like the rhetorical distinctions of Mah\u0101y\u0101na/H\u012bnay\u0101na and sudden/gradual in earlier Buddhist debates, these polemical labels had only a marginal relationship to the schisms of the day. An examination of the writings and practices of J\u014dkei (1155-1213), a prominent monk of the Hoss\u014d school and contemporary of H\u014dnen, reveals that \"other-power\" and \"easy-practice\" were, in fact, valued features on both sides of the debate. As a representative of \"established\" Buddhism, J\u014dkei was not unique in this respect, but he serves as a useful example to problematize the frequent adoption of these categories in interpretations of \"Kamakura Buddhism.\"\n      </p>", "Modern scholarly study of women in early Indian Buddhism began over a hundred years ago, towards the end of the nineteenth century. In this article, I assess strategies that have been prominent in scholarly engagement with the texts from the period that are pertinent to this debate. The article is focused around discussion of four historical-critical hermeneutic strategies which either have figured within the debate or, as is the case in the final section, are suggested as pertinent to the debate. The four strategies are: a hermeneutics of resonance; gender-construct hermeneutics; comparativist hermeneutics; and finally revisionist hermeneutics. The first three comprise strategies which have featured significantly in the debate, from its origins to changes that have arisen particularly during the last two decades. The final strategy is, essentially, my own assertion.\n      </p>", "This paper argues that the Thai hierarchy of guardian spirits can and should be incorporated in a Buddhist conceptual order. Reasons for intra-cultural diversity in the labelling of and behavior toward guardian spirits in a Central Thai village may be traced to canonical sources and cosmological structure. A set of principles underlying the villagers' classification of supernatural beings are proposed demonstrating how ambiguities permit alternate orderings of spirits. Ethnographic and textual evidence are combined in this argument. Finally, this argument raises questions of broader theoretical interest in cultural anthropology regarding the relation between cognition and action, and the use of folk taxonomies.\n      </p>", "What began as a trekking adventure becomes a search for spiritual \"health\" in the Buddhism of the Himalayan regions of India.

The latter was retreat master and, along with her husband Ian Thorson, in the middle of guiding forty students through a three-year, three-month, three-day silent meditation retreat. But when McNally stabbed Thorson, the Diamond Mountain Board asked both to leave. Feigning departure, the couple sneaked into a small cave just outside the Diamond Mountain property, where two months later Thorson died of dehydration. Stories of scandal, cult and death flooded the media. This essay provides an account of these events, the mistrust of my research that emerged because of the media\u2019s stigmatization of the group, and the type of trust-building necessary to continue my research.\n      </p>", "This paper presents a description of the Shan calendrical system and how it is used, beginning with a discussion of Shan cosmology, the nature of the relationship between Buddhism and animism, and the role of power in that relationship. I provide an account of the calendar, systems used to determine auspicious and inauspicious days and directions, kinds of events scheduled in reference to particular systems, and the consequences of mis-scheduling events. I then argue that this evidence indicates that Buddhism, animism, and astrology form a single religious system. The analysis of the calendrical system raises further questions about the nature of power and its role in unifying Shan religion.\n      </p>", "This article explores the dynamic processes by which the Lahu people negotiate Buddhist gender ideologies according to their cosmology of gender unity. It focuses on the contesting gender symbolism embedded in the local images of Buddha as a pair of indigenous supreme gods, a non-Lahu missionary who founded Lahu Buddhism, and three charismatic Lahu monks in history. This study contributes to scholarly inquiries into the complexities and diversity of women's religious status across cultures.\n      </p>", "For the Shan, Tai Yai, of Maehongsorn Province in Thailand, kho is not a spirit proper. The Shan do not placate or propitiate it. Rather, kho is misfortune personified. When it strikes, whether it be caused by witchcraft, fever, disease, people try to send it away. They attempt to improve their Buddhist merit to prevent its evil effects. This paper describes how these Shan treat kho. The relevance of these observations for understanding Buddhism in the area is briefly indicated.\n      </p>", "In response to Shintoist criticism of Buddhism in the early 1930s, a group of prominent Buddhists and Buddhologists wrote articles on Buddhism and Japanese spirit for a special issue of Ch\u016b\u014d Bukky\u014d in 1934. They highlighted historical connections between Japanese Buddhism and the state, and drew correspondences between Buddhist doctrines and various Shinto and Confucian concepts that were central to discourses on Japanese culture and the imperial system in the early-Sh\u014dwa period. In drawing those doctrinal correspondences, they aligned Japanese Buddhism with main components of the imperial ideology at that time.\n      </p>", "This paper argues against the current view that the apsidal form was Buddhist in origin and that apsidal Hindu temples are essentially Buddhist shrines subsequently converted to Hinduism. It also counters the linear view of religious change, which suggests that the Hindu temple came into its own after the decline of Buddhism in the fourth-fifth centuries AD. Instead, the paper establishes that the apsidal form was part of a common architectural vocabulary widely used from the second century BC onwards not only for the Buddhist shrine, but also for the Hindu temple and several local and regional cults. The historical development of the apsidal shrine is traced at three levels. One is at the macro-level of the Indian subcontinent from the second century BC to the nineteenth century AD. Second is the location of the apsidal form in the religious landscape of a particular site, viz. that of Nagarjunakonda in the lower Krishna valley in Andhra. Finally, the paper highlights the archaeological excavations conducted at the apsidal temple of Gudimallam also in Andhra to trace the history of the religious site from the second century BC to the twelfth century AD, the objective being to highlight the changing nature of the Hindu temple. The paper thus makes a case for plurality of religious beliefs and practices in ancient South Asia as against the prevailing view that these local and regional cults were gradually subsumed under the mantle of Sanskritization starting from the fourth-fifth centuries onwards.\n      </p>", "In the funeral rites of the Thai Yuan (the Thai of the North) in the Fang area of Northern Thailand orthodox Buddhism and ancestral beliefs find a perfect harmony. Death is a moment of solidarity for the whole village and an occasion to celebrate a great feast in honour of the deceased. All these rites are to facilitate a good rebirth of the dead person who is believed to be dangerous to the living before having reached a new existence. Described are (1) the different rites related to a natural death by old age or sickness (rites just after death, the funeral vigil and procession, rites at cremation and after cremation); (2) rites related to a violent death, caused by drawning, killing, or road accident, in order to neutralize any evil influence from the souls of such persons; (3) rites related to death caused by childbirth being a most horrible one, especially before delivery; (4) the solemn cremation of a monk, a great feast for the whole village which puts an end to the long mourning.\n      </p>", "A brief historical setting of Sokkuram in the context of Silla unification of Korea will be followed by a further brief cultural setting of this temple - considering it a product of both an international Buddhism and an 'international style'. The first discussion deals with those aspects which set Sokkuram apart from its Asian rock-cut temple equivalents. It will consider what type of Buddhist building Sokkuram is, some Asian prototypes, the method of construction, its architectural elements and decoration, and a comparison with the Yungang and Longmen sites in China. The second discussion deals with the political significance of Sokkuram, taking the building as part of a national programme of State Buddhism comparable with other east Asian countries at that time, and it considers the temple's siting, orientation and use of iconography to underline a political, as well as a religious, message.\n      </p>", "After years of meditating, are you still saddled with many of the same personal conflicts and interpersonal inhibitions that plagued you before you began? Rubin explores the hidden flaws in the meditative method itself. He explores Buddhism's ambivalent relationship to emotional life, and the negative consequences of \"letting go\" of experience. Detaching from experience may result in renouncing vital aspects of ourselves, such as constructive passion. The author argues that real meditation is transformative not tranquilizing, fostering a dynamic way of living.\n      </p>", "This article examines the process by which the academic discourse on the decadence of early modern Buddhism was developed, especially in the context of Meiji Japan (1868-1912). The predominant framework in which much of the modern research on Edo Buddhism took place was informed, grosso modo, by the assumption that early modern Japanese Buddhism was very distant from what it should essentially have been. The origins of this discourse are usually traced back to Tsuji Zennosuke, but by the time he published his works on the subject, such an image of Edo Buddhism was already the norm among both scholars and clergy. Keeping these aspects in mind, after brief considerations on the role of precept restoration during the late Edo Period, this article will focus in particular on the period from the Meiji Restoration (1868) to the establishment of Japanese Buddhist history as a specific field of study during the early years of the twentieth century. It will also deal to a certain extent with Tsuji's ideas on the subject.\n      </p>", "The Mendicant Sect is a Buddhist movement that combines Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism. Based on fieldwork, analysis of ritual handbooks and other sect materials provided by informants, and readings of published works of Vietnamese monastics and scholars, this article introduces the sect's history and philosophy, describes its Central Vihara, and records a case study of its lay ritual practice, the Eight Precepts Ritual [B\u00e1t Quan Trai Gi\u1edbi]. In so doing, it illustrates the \"revival of religion\" thesis with a southern and Buddhist case study, while challenging the notion that Vietnamese Buddhism is essentially Mahayanist.\n      </p>", "This article places Nichiren within the context of three larger scholarly issues: definitions of the new Buddhist movements of the Kamakura period; the reception of the Tendai discourse of original enlightenment (hongaku) among the new Buddhist movements; and new attempts, emerging in the medieval period, to locate 'Japan\" in the cosmos and in history. It shows how Nichiren has been represented as either politically conservative or radical, marginal to the new Buddhism or its paradigmatic figure, depending upon which model of \"Kamakura new Buddhism\" is employed. It also shows how the question of Nichiren's appropriation of original enlightenment thought has been influenced by models of Kamakura Buddhism emphasizing the polarity between \"old\" and \"new\" institutions and suggests a different approach. Lastly, it surveys some aspects of Nichiren's thinking about \"Japan\" for the light they shed on larger, emergent medieval discourses of Japan's religiocosmic significance, an issue that cuts across the \"old Buddhism\"/\"new Buddhism\" divide.\n      </p>", "How have Buddhist nuns in Myanmar engaged themselves in monastic relationships while being officially excluded from the monastic institution (the Sangha) since the female order disappeared?

I begin by presenting the main characteristics of the ambivalent status of Buddhist nuns and the methodological problem this raises\u2014an analysis of donation interactions between nuns and lay donors indicates the different paths that lead to monastic identification. I then focus on the various relationships in which nuns are engaged in Myanmar, with a description of the combination of relationships between nuns, monks, and lay donors that highlights the monastic system as a network of dynamic relationships in which monastic social identity and its processes of legitimation can take place.\n      </p>", "The origins of Japan's medical ideas, which are deeply rooted in its religion, culture and history, are not widely understood in medical societies of other countries. We have taken up the task of summarising this tradition here so that some insight can be gained into the unique issues that characterise the practice of medicine in Japan. We borrow from the sayings of Tohkaku Wada, a medical philosopher of late eighteenth-century Japan, for a look at Japanese medical tradition. Wada's medical thought was very much reflective of the Buddhism, Zen, and swordsmanship that informed eighteenth-century philosophy in Japan. His central concepts were \"chu\" and \"sei\", that is, complete and selfless dedication to the patient and the practice of medicine. This paper explores Wada's thought, explaining it mainly from the standpoint of Japanese traditional culture.\n      </p>", "In the present work, I constructively engage the thought of the American pragmatist John Dewey and the Zen Buddhist D\u014dgen on moral cultivation. I argue that Dewey presents a useful notion of moral development and growth with a focus on attentiveness to one s situation, but I also note that he leaves out extended analysis of how one is to foster such an orientation. Turning to the writings of D\u014dgen, I argue that Deweyan moral theory can be supplemented by the methods that Zen Buddhism prescribes to bring attentiveness back to one s experience of activity. This analysis is placed in the context of my overall project of orientational meliorism, or the alteration of one's orientation toward self, world, and activity with the goal of improving the quality of ones future experience.\n      </p>", "Revitalized interest in \"the virtues\" has affected the study of Buddhism in recent years, and in this regard we may benefit by focusing on the Zen Master D\u014dgen (1200-1253). Seeking to describe D\u014dgen's moral virtues, we might begin by a study of his primer, the \"Sh\u014db\u014dgenz\u014d\" Zuimonki; a particularly efficacious template for this project would appear to be one provided by Edmund L. Pincoffs in his book \"Quandaries and Virtues: Against Reductivism in Ethics\". This \"modus operandi\" reveals D\u014dgen's exhortation of a broad array of mandatory and nonmandatory virtues, partially depend- ing on whether or not the intended recipient is a layperson or one leading the religious life. If valid, this description may benefit D\u014dgen Studies as well as contribute to, and encourage, other \"Western\" efforts to articulate Buddhist ethics.\n      </p>", "Culture and politics have a close relationship, but how exactly does the cultural become the political? This article builds a theoretical framework for this question by examining Vietnamera U.S. poets' politicization of Buddhism at the expense of more effective or more easily controllable discursive resources. I find, first, that outcomes depend on whether wouldbe appropriators and legitimate owners of the appropriated resource can strike a mutually beneficial bargain. Second, whether two such distinct parties emerge depends on how tightly contexts of the appropriation process are linked. Consequently, appropriation is best understood as reciprocal exchange.\n      </p>", "Stimulated by a recent meeting between Western psychologists and the Dalai Lama on the topic of destructive emotions, we report on two issues: the achievement of enduring happiness, what Tibetan Buddhists call sukha, and the nature of afflictive and nonafflictive emotional states and traits.

Such disregard is remarkable since Durkheim relied on his interpretation of Buddhism to support two crucial claims in his definition of religious phenomena: that gods or spirits are not essential to religion, for Buddhism has no meaningful gods or spirits; and that the sacred-profane dichotomy is characteristic of all religions, since it is found even in an atheistic religion like Buddhism. We examine Durkheim's discussion to show that, despite qualifications and caveats, his claims regarding Buddhism are flawed on both counts. On the one hand, we show that Buddhism admits the existence of supra-mundane beings not as a secondary, but as a primary component of its religion; on the other hand, we demonstrate that the distinction between sacred and profane is marginal to Buddhist thought.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Within a broader framework of comparative religious ethics, such a claim is not extraordinary; overcoming prudentialist self-interest, cultivating sympathy, and acting on others' behalf are ethical values highly praised by most religious traditions, including Buddhism. Nevertheless, this proposal runs counter to those who hold Therav\u0101da Buddhism to be dominated by the world-renouncing values of the monk antithetical to a social ethic. It also differs from the view that monastic and lay ethics, while not in opposition, are merely complementary.

We find that Engaged Buddhists would be largely in sympathy with Rawls's proposals. There are differences, however: Rawls builds his view from the idea of independent nation--states, while the Buddhists see the world more in terms of a single humankind, the members being highly interdependent with one another, and also with the physical world. The Buddhists would also push harder than Rawls for global structures building multilateralism, restrict more severely justifications for war and behavior in war, stress economic justice more heavily, and insist on all the human rights in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n      </p>", "This introduction to the volume provides background information necessary for understanding the arrangement and content of the succeeding articles.

Because of the cumulative nature of the information presented, following the chronological development and spread of the religion, the volume is best read from beginning to end.\n      </p>", "The adoption of Buddhism by some of the Taispeaking peoples had on their cosmology and soteriology an impact that the present paper considers from the specific point of view of the conceptions relating to abnormal death. It emerges from the comparison between Buddhist and non-Buddhist Tai, that the doctrine of karma had certainly an impact on the interpretation of bad death, but that it has not deeply changed its symptoms as well as the typology of the malevolent ghosts it generates. Despite their wildness, these ghosts may be tamed and become guardian spirits of local communities, under certain conditions which are examined in the last part of the paper.\n      </p>", "This article attempts to define karma as both action and the effects of action. In terms of the effects or fruits of action, the effect of action upon the mind is the focus; thus, the idea of \"effect\" is primarily defined as psychic residue and is compared to Freud's notion of memory traces. In addition, action that produces karma is said to be accompanied by the \"pulling\" feeling of volition (cetan\u00c4&#129;). Some comparisons are then made between cetan\u00c4&#129; and the theories of Karen Horney in Western psychology vis \u00c3\u00a0 vis her view of the neurotic's compulsive, driven feelings. The article also has a more ethically oriented side. Often, the karma doctrine is believed to be the only causal factor responsible for one's present condition, and thus, a person's unfortunate circumstances: sometimes this notion leads to blaming a person for his or her misfortune. This article seeks to discover whether or not this idea truly has scriptural backing. Lastly, the article explores the issue of whether or not one must always live out the entirety of the effects of one's actions or if it is possible to purify or eliminate actions' effects before they come to fruition. For this question in particular, the article examines both Therav\u00c4&#129;da and Mah\u00c4&#129;y\u00c4&#129;na thinking.\n      </p>", "", "", "", "The author provides a personal and experiential account of Zen Buddhism and psychoanalysis. The notion of oscillations serves as an organizing structure. Drawing from the British psychoanalyst Wilfred Bion and the American Zen teacher Robert Aitken, the notion of suffering, meaning here to permit, is considered as the central motivating force and organizing principle for both disciplines. As a critique of traditional psychoanalytic writing an \"experiment in dialogue\" is offered that draws from a variety of writing styles including prose, poetry, free-association, stream of consciousness, traditional teaching stories and case material to discuss various experiential states such as linearity, circularity, resistance, ambivalence, passion, rage and the potential for a mutually supportive dynamic between Zen and psychoanalysis.\n      </p>", "A Sri Lankan folktale presenting Jesus as a delusory emanation of M\u0101ra is discussed here for its significance in understanding how Christianity was seen by the early-modern Sinhalese. By depicting Jesus as demonic and his teachings as inimical to Buddhism, Sri Lankans situated Christianity in the context of the cosmic rivalry between the Dhamma and the disordering forces of M\u0101ra. The Hindu background of certain motifs in the folktale is considered, as are its probable origins in the religiopolitical milieu of the eighteenth-century Kandyan kingdom and its relevance to later Buddhist revivalists. This study also questions empiricist approaches to Sri Lankan historiography, and proposes that folklore provides scholars with an invaluable supplement to Western documentary materials and the island's official chronicles when attempting to reconstruct the indigenous perception of European Christianity.\n      </p>", "The incidence of conversion to Christianity among Khmer refugees is negligible by comparison with the rates reported among such Southeast Asian refugee groups as the Hmong. However, among those Khmer who do convert, there is a notable tendency toward strict religious orthodoxy. Based on ethnographic research among Khmer refugees in the metropolitan Boston area, this article examines the phenomenon of Khmer conversion, exploring why some Khmer convert despite the strong association of Khmer identity with Theravada Buddhism. It also examines the sociocultural forces that encourage some converts to adopt orthodox attitudes toward their new religion. Finally, it considers the long term impact of Christian conversion on Cambodian-American identity, class stratification, and assimilation to American culture.\n      </p>", "How do people in a northern Thai community think about the central Theravada Buddhist concept of anicca (a Pali term referring to impermanence)? Different interpretations and applications are explored through conversations with 27 monks and laypeople in the town of Mae Chaem, Chiang Mai Province. Authoritative discourse, occupation, life experience, and personal concerns were all found to be involved in the ways that people in this community use the concept of impermanence in their everyday lives. I address a distinction between abstract and practiced culture, and make an argument for the significance of lived experience in the scholarly understanding of Buddhism.\n      </p>", "The penetration of Buddhism into China and its amalgamation with the native religious culture constitute an interesting and important historical movement about which little is yet known.

From that time on edifices of some kind probably existed for housing Buddhist images, although this has not yet been confirmed archaeologically. The construction of Asukadera, the first Buddhist temple compound, began in 588. By 624 more than twenty such temples had been built in Yamato and other provinces in the central Kinai district; all were characteristically initiated by leading aristocratic clans. By the year 692, the number of temples rose to 548 nationwide. Among the newly constructed temples, Kudarataiji (639) was the first to be sponsored directly by the Emperor and built under the supervision of government officials. Similar circumstances attended the construction of late seventh-century temples that followed (Kawaradera, Takechitaiji, Yakushiji, Daikan Daiji). Accordingly, the first phase of Buddhist expansion in Japan may be characterized as involving a transition from support by local clans only, to a pattern in which official support of the Emperor played a major part.\n      </p>", "This paper discusses a project the author has been engaged in since 1994 with women in the Japanese Buddhist community who are working across sectarian boundaries to recreate a Buddhism that goes beyond patriarchy. While the celibacy prized by many Buddhist orders that profess renunciation of secular married life has resulted in oppression of women, this paper points out that women face similar problems even in the laicized Shin school. The paper describes various perspectives that women of this project have adopted in their feminist critiques of Buddhism and their movement to remake Buddhism for today, and argues that the question of whether traditional Buddhist orders can overcome their predicament depends upon whether the men can open themselves to hear the women's voices of protest. The paper shows that this project can also contribute to a critique of the Eurocentric feminist version of Buddhism that informs the understanding of some European and American feminist scholars in this field.\n      </p>", "The study of the history of religion and the history of Buddhism in Japan has recently advanced in great leaps and bounds, with many heretofore unknown facts coming to light. Research on specific topics have gradually accumulated in a variety of fields, and the new perspectives that have emerged have made possible intense debates on how to reevaluate (or \"revision\") the history of religion and Buddhism in Japan. The field of ancient (kodai) Japanese history-the focus of this essay-has also shown remarkable progress in recent years. Textual studies on the basic historical sources for this period have steadily advanced, including the analysis of the difficult Nihon shoki. In this essay I have tried to absorb the results of recent research and sketch a new history of religion and Buddhism in ancient Japan.\n      </p>", "The paper examines literary evidence on the spread of Buddhism in Western India (Maharashtra-Guijarat area) and discusses the routes by which Buddhism travelled from its center in Magadha to the Ajanta region in Marathwada, the Karle-Junnar-Nasik area and the Kanheri-Broach territory. It is argued that this literary evidence must be taken seriously especially in view of the fact that recent excavations at Pauni in the Vidarbha region, are claimed to have revealed a pre-Asokan phase of Buddhism in Maharashtra. The paper examines the distribution of the excavated chaitya-Samgharam complexes in Maharashtra and attempts to arrive at the probable size of the Buddhist community, its monastic organization and lay support during the period 2nd cent. B. C.-A. D. 200 as revealed in architecture and inscriptional evidence. The conclusion stated is that Buddhism did not sweep Maharashtra, that it was a minority faith and that the obvious distinction between Buddhism and Brahmanism lay more in the Buddhist monasteries than among the lay people.\n      </p>", "The paper draws on the Heideggerian distinction between Bildung and Besinnung to locate a discussion of theological strategies in the face of Nietzsche's pronouncement that God is dead, and sketches what should be an epistemologically vigilant (and thus properly sceptical) Buddhist response to that pronouncement. The theological options that are mentioned or discussed include naive and critical theological realism, anti-realism and a nontheistic 'spiritual realism'. Buddhism is discussed in terms of its naturalistic sources and their development in the expression of states of mind rather than in terms of belief.\n      </p>", "This article examines the attitudes and responses of Chinese Buddhists with regard to the Sino-Japanese war of the 1930s and 1940s by focusing on two figures, Taixu and Leguan. Both the Japanese and Chinese Buddhists were confronted with the same problems, such as the relation between the universalism of Buddhism and the question of nationalism, as well as the tension between the Buddhist prohibition against killing and the necessity of killing one's enemies during wartime. Taixu attempted to radically change Chinese Buddhism and establish a humanistic Buddhism. Leguan at first had a positive view of Japanese Buddhism and saw it as a possible model for modernizing Buddhism in China, but later became very critical of Japanese Buddhism and encouraged taking action against the Japanese invasion. Both struggled with the difficult problem of whether it was proper for a Buddhist to actively take up arms and fight in a war for their nation. Placing Japanese Buddhism in the wider perspective of East Asia, and such comparisons with Chinese (and Korean) Buddhists, should provide fruitful hints for rethinking modern Japanese Buddhism.\n      </p>", "Is Therav\u0101da Buddhism a moral way of life? Both the classical P\u0101li texts and contemporary Therav\u0101da Buddhist practice are examined to determine the answer. After characterizing morality and placing the Therav\u0101da code of conduct in its religious context, the central focus of attention is whether the Buddhist action-guides involve a concern for the welfare of those upon whom one's acts impinge. Looking at the unenlightened Buddhists first, the significance of the pa\u00f1cas\u012bla, social influence, giving, and the \"sublime states\" is considered. The conclusion to each consideration is that the advocated way of life is not moral. Turning to the enlightened Buddhists, objections to the possibility of morality being connected with an enlightened Therav\u0101da Buddhist way of life are first discussed: the enlightened not having the capacity for moral consideration, real versus this-worldly welfare, and the enlightened being beyond good and evil. Next the status of enlightened Buddhists within their religious context and the practice of instructing others concerning the path to enlightenment are examined, with the conclusion being that enlightened Buddhists who opt to help others are moral. Thus the basic path required by Therav\u0101da Buddhism is non-moral in leading to nibb\u0101na, but moral activity may be opted for in the enlightened way of life. Some relevant secondary literature (King, Ling, Danto, and Little and Twiss) are commented upon in the discussion.\n      </p>", "As part of a growing environmental movement in Thailand, a small number of Buddhist monks engage in ecological conservation projects. These \"ecology monks\" teach ecologically sound practices among Thai farmers and criticize rapid economic development nationwide (which they see as one of the primary causes of the country's environmental crisis).

This paper starts from the position developed by the psychologist Jerome Bruner, who argues that there are two distinct modes of thought, the paradigmatic (or logico-scientific) and the narrative, and that they are equally important in ordering experience and constructing meaning. Texts written in both of these modes were crucial in the establishment of Pure Land Buddhism in Japan during the Heian Period. The \u014cj\u014dy\u014dsh\u016b, written by Genshin in 985, is perhaps the single most important text in the development of this form of Buddhism in Japan, but insofar as it presents a systematic and comprehensive outline of Pure Land cosmology, doctrine, and practice, it is an example of a text written in the paradigmatic mode. But another text from this period written in the narrative mode, the Nihon \u014cj\u014d Gokuraku-ki by Yoshishige no Yasutane, played an equally important role in the spread of Pure Land Buddhism. This text is a collection of forty-two brief biographies of people believed to have been born in the Pure Land. These biographies serve both to \"prove\" that the Pure Land really exists and provide us with models with which to fashion our lives so we can gain birth in the Pure Land.\n      </p>", "The interpretation of Buddhism as consonant with science has been an essential factor in the transmission of Buddhism to the West, as well as in the success of certain reform movements in Asia. Both westerners and Asians developed the discourse of scientific Buddhism in response to different but interrelated crises in their various cultural contexts in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Anagarika Dharmapala's contribution to this discourse arose out of a crisis of legitimacy in Sinhalese Buddhism that stemmed from colonialism, missionization, western hegemony, and western representations of Asians and Buddhism common to this period. Two Americans, Paul Carus and Henry Steel Olcott, attempted to establish the scientificity of Buddhism in response to the Victorian crisis of faith. This discourse represented Buddhism as an inverse reflection of what skeptics and liberal Christians believed to be problematic about orthodox interpretations of Christianity in light of scientific developments and biblical criticism.\n      </p>", "This paper examines the non-religious factors contributing to the growth and acceptance of Buddhism in India. The rise of Buddhism occurred during a period of expanding bureaucratic empires. This article analyzes why the values and practices of Buddhism, in contrast to Hinduism, were well suited to the needs of expanding empires. In particular, Buddhism better satisfied the political and economic needs of the rulers and the economic and status needs of the merchants. This encouraged the adoption of Buddhism by the two social groups who served as the chief agents of change in the growing empires.\n      </p>", "Buddhism in Thailand has been both subjected to integrative policies advanced by the Thai government and manipulated as an instrument for promoting national integration. As a result of reforms instituted at the end of the nineteenth century, several different traditions of Therevada Buddhism were united into a national religious system. In recent years, the Thai government has attempted to involve the Buddhist Sangha in efforts to promote economic development among the Thai peasantry and assimilation of tribal peoples into Thai society. While the policies designed to integrate Buddhism within Thailand were successful, the efforts to use Thai Buddhism as instrument of national policy could prove deleterious rather than advantageous to the attainment of national goals.\n      </p>", "This article is a continuation of the study published in the March issue of the Journal of Religion, and gives an interpretation of the important ideals and teachings which emerged from the penetration of Buddhism into China.\n      </p>", "The western Deccan is well-known for its spectacular rock-cut Buddhist architecture and its extensive Buddhist monastic complexes. Many of these structures were cut during the Satavahana period, the first large-scale state polity in western India. In order to understand how Buddhist monastic institutions were integrated into the social, political, and economic organization of this period, it is necessary to begin to consider how production and distribution of produce and craft goods were structured and how both Buddhist monastic institutions and political authorities were involved in these patterns. Specifically, I examine the hypothesized link between Buddhism, trade, and state formation and suggest that no simple causal relationship can be discerned.\n      </p>", "Up to the 1980s, Buddhist influence in Brazil was, at best, exiguous and marginal. The Buddhist Society of Brazil, established in 1923 by Theosophists, was short-lived, and was only reestablished in 1955 with little public visibility and activity. In areas with a high concentration of Japanese-Brazilians, temples, and monks of different denominations were the closest contact some Brazilians had with this religious tradition. Still, it was chiefly a \"Japanese thing\" or an alien practice \"for Japanese.\" Zen's appeal to some intellectuals from the 1960s was a limited phenomenon, somehow related to the counterculture movement in the country. From the 1980s on, the media was instrumental in popularizing Buddhism in Brazil, particularly Zen and the newcomer Tibetan Buddhism. This follows a trend in the United States called \"Tibetan chic.\" Against this background, Soka Gakkai International (SGI) is becoming familiar to many Brazilians as it receives more social visibility and legitimacy. This article initially presents the history of SGI expansion from Japanese immigrants to Brazilians. The focus then changes to its organizational structure and activities.

The confrontation between local traditions and this modern form of Buddhism leads us to question the applicability of the idea of conversion in the Nepalese context. In traditional Nepal, religion is the principle that structures society and conversion is not possible and is even constitutionally prohibited.

It is difficult to pinpoint the exact beginnings of this system. While there are medieval precedents, the broad development of the relationship between a temple and its parishioners as established through funerary rituals is primarily a phenomenon of the early modern period. I argue that there are roughly five distinct phases to the development of the templeparishioner system: the proto-temple-parishioner system during the medieval period, the beginnings of the temple-parishioner system in the first half of the seventeenth century, the establishment of the temple-parishioner system in the second half of the seventeenth century, the establishment of the registration of religious affiliation, and the emergence of fully developed funerary Buddhism after 1700.\n      </p>", "This article addresses Chinese contemporary artist Song Dong's July 2009 edible installation-cum-performance at the former PaceWildenstein Gallery in New York City, in which he created landscapes out of foodstuffs. The landscapes alluded to penjing, an artistic practice of creating miniature sceneries using natural elements. Their accompanying inscriptions on the gallery walls, on the other hand, humorously appropriated colophons commonly attached to hanging scroll paintings. The installation departed from these traditional artistic forms, however, as the viewers literally consumed the landscapes. The corporeal implications of Song's work reference the body-centric performances of Tehching Hsieh and Zhang Huan, as well as the relational aesthetics events staged by Rirkrit Tiravanija, while Song's broader emphasis on ephemerality, drawn from Zen Buddhism, points to the transience of bodily needs and desires, even as he aims to fulfill them.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Buddhism is realized by a monastic community of meditators, preachers, and chanters.

Both Confucian and Buddhist rites that exclude females from participation in roles of ritual leadership exist. However, the spiritual welfare of traditional Korean families depends upon a religious division of labor that leaves women with important, legitimate, and autonomous ritual roles. By analyzing the myth of Princess Pari, sung by and among women in the context of certain of these rituals, it is possible to examine how Korean women represent to themselves both those structural contradictions implied in the texts of the great tradition, and those actually experienced in their lives. The continued ability of Korean women to control symbol-making in a religious context allows them to affirm their moral worth as women and confront elements of valued great traditions which seem to deprive them of moral excellence, legitimate religious roles, and even entry into paradise.\n      </p>", "The transition from the medieval to the early modern Buddhist order was directed in large measure by a new regulatory regime instituted by the Tokugawa bakufu. These new directives issued from Edo increasingly regulated every aspect of both political and religious life during the first half of the seventeenth century. As the bakufu extended its control over domains through a pyramidal hierarchy of order towards the center, similar formations of regulation governing Buddhist sectarian order emerged in an increasingly formalized fashion. At the same time, power did not operate in a unilateral direction as Buddhist institutions attempted to shape regulation, move toward a self-regulatory model of governance, and otherwise evade control by the center through local interpretations and implementations of law. This essay takes up how state regulation of religion was managed by S\u014dt\u014d Zen Buddhism, with particular attention given to rules governing the clerical ranks and the robes worn by clerics of high rank. The 1627 \"purple robe incident\" is examined as an emblematic case of the new power relationship between the new bakufu's concern about subversive elements that could challenge its hold on power; the imperial household's customary authority to award the highest-ranking, imperially-sanctioned \"purple robe\"; and Buddhist institutions that laid claim on the authority to recognize spiritual advancement.\n      </p>", "This article explores the intersection of clinical narcissism and Buddhist meditation practice.

It is futile to follow Durkheim in seeking a better definition, as all such definitions must fail because religion is a polythetic class.

Buddhist cultures are particularly relevant because the compounding takes an unusual form.

As part of the climate of modernization, foreigners, government officials, and the press increasingly identified Buddhism as superstitious and backward. In response, Buddhist leaders divided traditional Buddhist cosmology and practices into the newly constructed categories \"superstition\" and \"religion.\" Superstition was deemed \"not really Buddhism\" and purged, while the remainder of Buddhism was made to accord with Westernized ideas of religion. Buddhist philosopher Inoue Enryo was crucial to this process. This paper explores \"superstition\" and \"religion\" in his writings, and it discusses the aspects of Buddhism that were invented and sublimated under the influence of this distinction. This paper argues that not only did Buddhism became a religion in Meiji Japan but also that in order to do so it had to eliminate superstitions, which included numerous practices and beliefs that had previously been central.\n      </p>", "Within the Buddhism and gender debate in Western scholarship, various approaches to the study of Buddhist literature--Orientalist, Protestant Buddhism, and a doctrinal approach--have led to a taxonomy of value being accorded various texts such that some are overvalued and others either wholly or largely ignored. The first women scholars of Buddhist studies in the West--Caroline Rhys Davids, Mabel Bode, and I. B. Horner--labored under the Orientalist fallacy and thus set up some initial distortions in the survey of the textual record that have persisted. However, the work of these women also possesses many strengths and contemporary scholars would do well to follow their lead in continuing more detailed textual work in the field while also rescinding their overemphasis on the Pali literature and bringing into the frame all relevant texts by, about, or concerning women from ancient Indian Buddhism.\n      </p>", "Pure Land Buddhism achieved its primary influence in East Asia because it supplied a nonmonastic, autonomous source of religious authority and practice to middle elites in those cultural regions. In contrast Pure Land failed to achieve any success in India. The explanation for the marginalization of Indian Pure Land is probably sociopolitical: Pure Land teachings tended to bypass not only the authority of the Hindu brahmins, but even the authority of Buddhist renunciate orders. Indian social history did not produce any significant middle elites concerned with such non-gurucentric religious authority. As a result, Buddhist India did not produce any innovations in the up\u00e2ya of religious institutionalization in Buddhism.\n      </p>", "The reconstruction of Japanese Buddhism in Meiji, Taisho, and Showa Japan involved not only interchanges with Europe and the United States. A central but overlooked catalyst for change was increased travel to and exchange with other Buddhists in Asia. An examination of travel accounts and other writings of three Meiji-era Japanese Buddhist travelers to South and Southeast Asia-Kitabatake D\u014dry\u016b, Shaku K\u014dzen, and Shaku S\u014den-reveals how contact with Buddhists in those regions stimulated Japanese Buddhists to rethink the role of the historical Buddha in their tradition and demonstrates the importance of these contacts for Buddhism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.\n      </p>", "In this article, the concept of dereification in religion is developed, both theoretically and empirically, by analyzing Zen Buddhism. The central thesis is that Zen Buddhism, by virtue of the Mahayana concept of \"emptiness\" (sunyata), constitutes a dereifying perspective. In addition, using the phenomenology of Alfred Schutz, the experience of dereifying perception, which is acquired through Zen meditation, is described as a state of focused dur\u00e9e. Furthermore, several of the interactional methods through which Zen practitioners demonstrate their dereifying perspective are analyzed from an ethnomethodological and conversation analytic perspective, and the role of these methods in koan training is explained.\n      </p>", "This article examines Sai On's understanding of language and its correspondence with reality within the context of Confucianism, Buddhism, and the politics of eighteenth-century Ryukyu. Well aware of the limitations of language in conveying profound metaphysical truths, Sai On criticized Buddhists for their alleged erudition while displaying considerable rhetorical skill and erudition himself Though a critic of Buddhism, Sai On's writings suggest a strong Zen influence. Like most other Confucians, he accepted the Buddhist-inspired understanding of a material world whose basis was constant change and sought to create a stable society by mastering the principles of change. The ambivalence in Sai On's critique of language use and Buddhism is in part a reflection of a broader problem many Confucians experienced in dealing with foundations and change, and in reconciling Buddhist and Confucian truths.\n      </p>", "Recent developments in technology and material culture suggest that physicalism may come to be accepted as the commonsense view of the constitution of persons. Like many other spiritual practices, Buddhism has traditionally relied on a dualist understanding of human nature, according to which persons are made up of both physical and nonphysical entities and events. Would anything central to the Buddhist project be lost if that were replaced by physicalism? Clearly the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra doctrine of consciousness-only would be undermined. But it is claimed that apart from this there is little that is crucial to Buddhism that would be threatened by the development of a thoroughly physicalist culture.\n      </p>", "Our contemporary awareness of an environmental ethic is understood to be based on representing a cosmology of the interconnection of all beings. This construct is coincident with the emerging sense of our present view of the phenomenal world and resonant with the insights of Theravada Buddhism.\n      </p>"], "words": {"essay": {"number": 2,
