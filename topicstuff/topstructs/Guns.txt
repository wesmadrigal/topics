A wreck was discovered and its investigation revealed guns, a shot, potsherds, glass bottle pieces, a broken rudder and dressed granite stone blocks. These finds suggest that the wreck dates from the Portuguese period (seventeenth to eighteenth century AD) and was therefore a wooden-hulled ship. The most probable cause of the wrecking was the shallow laterite shoals in the region.

In the United States, more people kill themselves with firearms than with all other methods combined. A central question regarding the relation between firearms and suicide is whether the ready availability of firearms increases the suicide rate, rather than merely increasing the proportion of suicides from guns. Methods. We used publicly available data for the nine regions and 50 states in the United States over a 10-year period (1988-1997) to examine the association between levels of household firearm ownership and rates of suicide, firearm suicide, and non-firearm suicide by age groups and gender. Results. In both regional and state-level analyses, for the U.S. population as a whole, for both males and females, and for virtually every age group, a robust association exists between levels of household firearm ownership and suicide rates. Conclusions. Where firearm ownership levels are higher, a disproportionately large number of people die from suicide.\n      </p>", "Electrically biased plasma guns firing across the magnetic field are an effective way to heat a magnetically confined plasma.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "To examine how perceptions of safety are influenced as more people in a community acquire firearms, we conducted a nationally representative random-digit-dial survey of 2,500 adults and asked whether respondents would feel more safe, less safe, or equally safe if more people in their community were to acquire guns. We used multivariable logistic regression to explore correlates of perceived safety while taking into account various confounders. Fifty percent of respondents reported that they would feel less safe if more people in their community were to own guns; 14% reported they would feel more safe. Women and minorities were more likely than were men and Whites to feel less safe as others acquire guns, with Odds ratios of 1.7 and 1.5, respectively.

However, fatality and injury statistics clearly show that guns are finding their way into young people's hands. Many of these youth obtain guns through illegal gun markets. This article focuses on how guns in the United States are manufactured, marketed, and sold. The article shows how the legal and illegal gun markets are intimately connected and make guns easily accessible to youth. \u25d7 Although the domestic gun manufacturing industry is relatively small and has experienced declining sales in recent years, it has significant political clout and a large market for its products, and has engaged in aggressive marketing to youth. \u25d7 Lax oversight of licensed firearms dealers, combined with little or no regulation of private sales between gun owners, mean that guns can quickly move from the legal gun market into the illegal market, where they can be acquired by young people. \u25d7 Certain guns, especially inexpensive, poorly made small handguns, are particularly attractive to criminals and youth. The author observes that several policy innovations--including increased regulation of licensed firearms dealers, intensified screening of prospective buyers, regulation of private sales, gun licensing and registration, and bans on some types of weapons--hold promise for decreasing the flow of guns into the hands of youth.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "While youth violence has always been a critical part of delinquency, the modern epidemic is marked by high rates of gun violence. Adolescents in cities possess and carry guns on a large scale, guns are often at the scene of youth violence, and guns often are used. Guns play a central role in initiating, sustaining, and elevating the epidemic of youth violence. The demand for guns among youth was fueled by an \"ecology of danger,\" comprising street gangs, expanding drug markets with high intrinsic levels of violence, high rates of adult violence and fatalities, and cultural styles of gun possession and carrying. Guns became symbols of respect, power, identity, and manhood to a generation of youth, in addition to having strategic value for survival. The relationship between guns and youth violence is complex. The effects of guns are mediated by structural factors that increase the youth demand for guns, the available supply, and culture and scripts which teach kids lethal ways to use guns.\n      </p>", "A state in the international system implicit in realism must allocate its limited resources between satisfying its intrinsically valued ends and the means of military power. I formalize this guns-versus-butter problem in a simple infinite-horizon model in which two states must continually decide how to allocate their resources and whether to attack the other state. The analysis establishes sufficient conditions to ensure the existence of an equilibrium in which neither state attacks; shows that there is a strictly Pareto-dominant pair of peaceful equilibrium payoffs; characterizes the unique, peaceful Markov perfect equilibrium that yields them; and describes the comparative statics of the equilibrium allocations.

Indeed, some commentators have suggested that recent cohorts of youth have been composed of \"superpredators\" who have little regard for human life. The evidence, however, suggests that other factors are responsible for recent increases in youth gun violence. This article analyzes the extent and causes of youth violence in the United States, paying particular attention to the late 1980s and early 1990s, when rates of homicide and robbery committed by youth rose to extremely high levels. Examination of trends for these crimes shows that: \u25d7 The increase in violence in the United States during the late 1980s and early 1990s was due primarily to an increase in violent acts committed by people under age 20. Similarly, dramatic declines in homicide and robbery in recent years are attributable primarily to a decline in youth violence. \u25d7 The increase in youth homicide was predominantly due to a significant increase in the use of handguns, which converted ordinary teenage fights and other violent encounters into homicides. \u25d7 Several other interrelated factors also fueled the rise in youth violence, including the rise of illegal drug markets, particularly for crack cocaine, the recruitment of youth into those markets, and an increase in gun carrying among young people. The author points out that youth violence diminished as the crack markets shrank, law enforcement increased efforts to control youth access to guns, youth gun carrying declined, and the robust economy provided legitimate jobs for young people.\n      </p>", "High-pressure grease guns using a shrouded nozzle were 'fired' from varying distances at amputated lower limbs to determine the pressure at which penetration of the skin occurred.

Over an 11-month period, I examined the functions of adult male and female participation in intergroup aggression in five groups of eastern black-and-white colobus monkeys, or guerezas (Colobus guereza), in the Kakamega Forest, Kenya. Guerezas are large-bodied arboreal African colobine monkeys that usually live in one-male multifemale groups, though multimale multifemale groups are not uncommon. During 174 study days, I observed 136 encounters, most of which were aggressive in nature. I evaluated the hypotheses that through intergroup aggression (1) males were directly defending mates, (2) males were indirectly defending mates by directly defending food resources, (3) males were attempting to attract mates via infanticide, and/or (4) females were defending food resources. I found strong evidence consistent with both the direct male mate defense and indirect male mate defense via resource defense hypotheses, but no evidence consistent with the male mate attraction via infanticide hypothesis. There was little evidence in favor of the female resource defense hypothesis beyond the fact that females occasionally participated in intergroup aggression in four of the five study groups. A review of the most intensive studies of primate intergroup encounters suggests that direct male mate defense may occur in almost all primate species, while female resource defense appears to be most common in species with high levels of female philopatry. The indirect male mate defense via resource defense strategy has rarely been evaluated and may be a more common male strategy than is currently believed.

Such responses create meaningful categories that actors then use to anticipate future responses to objects.

Heller, the Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment guarantees a personal, individual right to keep and bear arms. But the Court left lower courts and legislatures adrift on the fundamental question of scope. While the Court stated in dicta that some regulation may survive constitutional scrutiny, it left the precise contours of the right, and even the method by which to determine those contours, for \"future evaluation.\" This Article offers a provocative proposal for tackling the issue of Second Amendment scope, one tucked in many dresser drawers across the nation: Treat the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms for self-defense the same as the right to own and view adult obscenity under the First Amendment\u2014a robust right in the home, subject to near-plenary restriction by elected government everywhere else. This Article's proposal to treat guns like smut is sure to stir controversy. But it is grounded in solid methods of constitutional analysis. The Court in Heller sent unmistakable signals that the First and Second Amendments are cousins and may be subject to similar limitations. As Justice Scalia noted, the First Amendment excludes from its protection certain categories of speech: \"obscenity, libel, and disclosure of state secrets.\" The Second Amendment may be \"no different,\" and almost certainly excludes from its protection certain categories of \"bearing\" and certain categories of \"arms.\" Moreover, the \"home-bound\" approach to the Second Amendment rationalizes the disparate norms that animate the Court's privacy jurisprudence. It situates the Second Amendment within tradition and doctrine that accord constitutional weight to a spatial and conceptual distinction between the home and the public sphere. Finally, this proposal has the benefit of simplicity: The Court has already marked boundaries for an individual right to adult obscenity in the home. Those boundaries are surprisingly applicable to the individual right to bear arms, and far easier to administer. While this proposal will not resolve all issues of Second Amendment scope, its prudential and practical merits deserve serious consideration as part of post-Heller discourse on the Second Amendment.\n      </p>", "Guns are historically steady components of Turkish culture and traditions. However, the implementation of regulations about firearms is relatively recent. The major legislative breakthrough in the control of the acquisition and possession of firearms was the passage of Law no. 6136 about firearms and knives and other weapons on July, 10, 1953. Turkey is also party to two international conventions aimed at controlling the production, import, export, acquisition, and possession of firearms; however, although signed, these conventions are still not ratified. Moreover, in Turkey, psychiatrists are designated as experts in the process of gun licensing. Their appointed mission is to determine whether the applicant has any psychopathology that might prevent him or her from obtaining a gun license. Although the process to be followed for gun licensing is, in theory, clearly stated and determined in a circular distributed in 1997, there are many shortcomings in practice that await rectification. Data about gun proliferation in Turkey derive principally from statistical analyses performed by the Turkish Statistical Institute of the office of the Prime Minister of Turkey and from sporadic research done on gun license applicants and risk groups. Similarly, nongovernmental organizations' (NGO) involvement in the nonproliferation cause is also limited in Turkey. The major NGO in the area is the Umut Foundation, which actively organizes campaigns focused on raising public awareness about nonproliferation. Unfortunately, although the legislation exists, the control of the acquisition and possession of guns and the process of licensing do not function ideally in practice and renovation is a requisite. Again, there is no established systematic and standardized program to styme the proliferation of guns in Turkey. Other NGOs are needed to follow the steps of the Umut Foundation.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "Interethnic conflicts abound in the dryland areas of Eastern Africa.

The effect of gun ownership on all other crime categories is much less marked.

While the existing literature argues that guns symbolize masculinity, most research on the actual use of guns has focused on marginalized men. The issue of concealed handguns is interesting because they must remain concealed and because relatively privileged men are most likely to have a license to carry one. Using in-depth interviews with 20 men, this article explores how they draw on discourses of masculinity to explain their use of concealed handguns. These men claim that they are motivated by a desire to protect their wives and children, to compensate for lost strength as they age, and to defend themselves against people and places they perceive as dangerous, especially those involving racial/ethnic minority men. These findings suggest that part of the appeal of carrying a concealed firearm is that it allows men to identify with hegemonic masculinity through fantasies of violence and self-defense.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Today\u2019s \u201cIron River of Guns\u201d flowing from the United States into Mexico has a long backstory.

The movement of kuku dipi is part of a constellation of informal trade that has emerged alongside the large-scale logging and oil projects in the Gulf Province. These networks involve the exchange of alcohol, pornography and radios by logging ship crews for live birds, crocodile skins and other local flora and fauna. Numerous sets of speculations have arisen about the seen and unseen transactions that these exchanges are felt to entail. Focusing on aspects of kuku dipi's use and movement in the Delta, I examine some of the explanations and anxieties around this illicit commodity. Doing so provides insight into kuku dipi's social impact and illuminates how the Purari's engagement in this trade is an attempt to transcend and cope with the economic and political disparities caused by the current resource extraction projects.\n      </p>", "We present an ethnographic examination of the Agambenian approach to sovereignty through the example of a particular \"state of exception\" namely, the militarized Turkish Cypriot enclaves of the 1963-74 period and their transformation into an unrecognized state structure. We argue that both the enclave administration and its subsequent variations have operated under a simulacrum of sovereignty, a claim to sovereignty that is both overproduced and incomplete. We examine the emergence of this simulacrum, which we claim allowed Turkish Cypriots to play with another form of existence, one at the interstices of exceptionality. This interstitial life, we argue, is characterized by a particular form of \"abandonment,\" one that may allow one to \"enjoy one's exception.\"\n      </p>", "This paper examines the linkage between crack market activity and gun homicide suggested by Blumstein (1995), who argues that the arrival of crack stimulated an increased availability of guns among juveniles. This greater availability of guns, the argument continues, is responsible for the sharp upswing in juvenile homicide experienced in the United States in the mid-1980s. Using city-level data on crack arrests and gun-related juvenile homicide, we fit a change-point version of the Bass (1969) model of innovation diffusion. We find that, in most large American cities, the diffusion process for crack cocaine experienced an onset of dramatic growth that was followed by a similar, slightly slower growth in gun homicides committed by juveniles. We further use cluster analysis to find that the spatial patterning of the two processes is similar, starting on the East and West Coasts and working their way toward other regions of the nation. Gun use in homicide among slightly older offenders (ages 18\u201324) also experienced a change at roughly the same time as the juveniles, but the rate of diffusion was considerably milder than for the younger group; offenders ages 25 or older generally show no growth in gun-related homicide whatsoever. In addition, there is no detectable surge in juvenile nongun homicide activity. Based on these findings, we conclude that the crack cocaine markets\u2014gun availability linkage is highly plausible, and we suggest directions for future research in clarifying the dynamics of the late-1980s surge in juvenile homicide.\n      </p>", "", "", "", "As the Vietnam War concluded with the failure of US foreign policy, the so-called \"Cold War consensus\" collapsed in American politics and society. A significant number of lawmakers came to revisit their national security positions, and under these circumstances the Anti-ballistic Missile (ABM) bills came up in the 91st Congress (1969\u201470). The costly missile program quickly stirred a major controversy, particularly over a trade-off between guns (defense budget) and butter (welfare spending). This article examines how and why party rank-and-file members in US Congress stayed the course or shifted their positions during the ABM debates. The empirical findings suggest that representatives did not immediately abandon their national security preferences, but rather employed gradual position shifts in legislative processes. In addition, institutional conditions such as \"in-party\" and \"party-out-of-power\" hindered or helped legislators' position reversals. This case study of the \"guns-or-butter\" debates in 1969 and 1970 sheds light on how the representative system in America works in response to public discomfort, with lawmakers trying to fine-tune their individual policy positions and collective party reputations simultaneously.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "Southerners have been found to have higher levels of gun ownership than persons who reside elsewhere. This may be due to cultural factors peculiar to the Southern region. If so, this would have interesting implications for gun control initiatives. Although the differential in gun ownership has been linked to varying support or opposition to gun control, the relationship between this variable and specific types of gun control has not been examined. With this in mind, we investigate how specific types of gun ownership interact with Southernness, controlling for the effects of other variables, to determine preferences for three different types of gun control. We use 1975 data collected by DMI on a stratified random sample of 1538 noninstitutionalized adults in the United States. An analysis of several logistic regression equations indicates that a cultural component, related to Southernness, affects attitudes toward gun control. Southerners, in general, were the most opposed to permits and handgun bans. Southern shotgun owners, in particular, were found to be the most opposed to gun registration.

This article presents case studies of eight cities' efforts to police gun crime. Some cities emphasized police-citizen partnerships to address youth violence, whereas others focused on aggressive enforcement against youth suspected of even minor criminal activity. Still others attempted to change youth behavior through \"soft\" strategies built on alternatives to arrest. Finally, some cities used a combination of approaches. Key findings discussed in this article include: \u25d7 Law enforcement agencies that emphasized police-citizen cooperation benefited from a more positive image and sense of legitimacy in the community, which may have enhanced their efforts to fight crime. \u25d7 Aggressive law enforcement strategies may have contributed to a decline in youth gun violence, but they also may have cost police legitimacy in minority communities where residents felt that the tactics were unfair or racially motivated. \u25d7 Approaches that emphasize nonarrest alternatives and problem-solving strategies offer an intriguing but unproven vision for addressing youth gun violence. None of the initiatives presented in the case studies has been shown conclusively to reduce youth gun crime over the long term. The author suggests that policing alone cannot contain youth gun violence, but by carefully balancing enforcement with community collaboration, police departments can help shift social norms that contribute to youth gun violence.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "For all the talk of deft diplomacy and political courage, the largely unacknowledged prime mover behind this April's historic Good Friday Agreement on Northern Ireland's political future has been European integration.\n      </p>", "Electrically biased plasma guns can be used to inject nonneutral plasma beams via the polarization drift mechanism.

Nail gun injuries are among the most common in wood frame construction. Despite evidence that the majority of injuries from unintentional firings could be prevented with a sequential trigger mechanism on the tools, the safer trigger has not been embraced in the fast-paced residential construction industry. An experiment was conducted in an attempt to realistically evaluate the magnitude of productivity concerns. Methods. Ten journeymen carpenters built a yard shed on two occasions, using nail guns with two different trigger configurations, alternately, under controlled conditions. Mean differences in time required, nails used, and proper placement were evaluated considering the trigger used and whether the building was the carpenter's first or second project. Results. The sequential trigger tool required a mean of 10 additional minutes of active nailing time, which represented 10% of mean nailing time (97 minutes) but only 0.77% of the total mean work time (1,298 minutes) to construct each shed. No significant differences were observed in nail count or placement. The majority of the time variability was related to who was using the tool, rather than the type of tool in the person's hand. Conclusions. Productivity concerns should focus more on improving the skill of the carpenter rather than on the trigger mechanism. Failure to place tools with the safer trigger configuration, which requires the nose piece to be depressed before the trigger is pulled, in the hands of workers does not make sense given the frequency and potential repercussions of injuries associated with the use of these tools in wood framing.\n      </p>", "After the overthrow of Chilean President Salvador Allende in 1973, several professors, graduate students, and filmmakers, with help from the Los Angeles Group for Latin American Solidarity, joined to create a film \"pamphlet\" documenting the social and cultural accomplishments of Allende's Unidad Popular administration and exposing the machinations of the U. S. government and the Chilean upper class that provoked the coup. Using footage generously lent by the producer that been made in Chile for another film, as well as Chilean archival footage and segments produced locally, Chile: With Poems and Guns, first shown in January 1974 in Los Angeles, became widely distributed nationally and internationally. Some of the participants in making the film remained together to continue making films as a collective known as Lucha. Despu\u00e9s del golpe de estado en contra del presidente chileno Salvador Allende en 1973, varios profesores, estudiantes de posgrado y cineastas se unieron con el Los Angeles Group for Latin American Solidarity para crear un \"panfleto\" cinematogr\u00e1fico que documentase los logros del gobierno de Unidad Popular de Allende y las maquinaciones del gobierno estadounidense y la clase alta chilena para provocar el golpe. Haciendo uso de material de archivos chilenos, segmentos producidos localmente y pel\u00edcula rodada en Chile para otro filme y generosamente suministrada por el productor, Chile: With Poems and Guns (\"Chile: con poemas y armas\") se estren\u00f3 en enero de 1974 en Los Angeles y se distribuy\u00f3 ampliamente a nivel nacional e internacional. Algunos de los participantes en el rodaje se mantuvieron juntos y continuaron produciendo pel\u00edculas bajo el nombre de Lucha.\n      </p>", "The process of disarmament, demobilization, reinsertion and reintegration (DDRR) of former combatants plays a critical role in transitions from war to peace. The success or failure of this endeavour directly affects the long-term peacebuilding prospects for any post-conflict society. The exploration of the closely interwoven relationship between peacebuilding and the DDRR process also provides a theoretical framework for this article, which aims to present an assessment of various disarmament, demobilization and reinsertion (DDR) programmes planned or implemented in a number of countries over the last two decades. The assessment is conducted by focusing on three specific DDR issues: disarmament as a social contract; demobilization without cantonment; and the relevance of financial reinsertion assistance. The majority of these initiatives adopted a 'guns-camps-cash' approach that seems to provide only a limited perspective for dealing with a wide range of complex issues related to the DDR process. Therefore, the article questions whether there is a need for a more comprehensive consideration of disarmament by acknowledging and responding to its social, economic and political implications. In conjunction with the above-mentioned consideration, disarmament in terms of a social contract is proposed as an alternative to the current military-centred approach. Experience also indicates a tendency towards the inclusion of cantonment in the demobilization phase, regardless of whether it actually can have some negative impacts on the DDRR process in general. Subsequently, the article questions such implications and possible approaches to demobilization without cantonment. Finally, the article focuses on the effectiveness of cash payments during reinsertion as an easier alternative to the provision of other material assistance, since this tends to be the most controversial aspect of the reinsertion phase.\n      </p>", "Focusing on the disagreement between Edwin Nourse and Leon Keyserling, two members of the first Council of Economic Advisers, the Truman Administration's gradual shift from Nourse's belief that a choice had to be made between \"guns or butter\" and Keyserling's claim that an expanding economy permitted large defense expenditures without sacrificing an increased standard of living is explained. In 1949, when Keyserling gained support from such presidential friends as Dean Acheson and Clark Clifford and persuaded the President, Nourse resigned as CEA Chairman, warning about the dangers of budget deficits and increased funding of \"wasteful\" defense costs. Keyserling succeeded to the chairmanship. He influenced Truman's Fair Deal proposals and the economic sections of National Security Council resolution 68 which, in April, 1950, asserted that the larger armed forces America needed would not affect living standards or risk the \"transformation of the free character of our economy.\"\n      </p>", "This article provides an economic analysis of underground gun markets, drawing on interviews with gang members, gun dealers, professional thieves, prostitutes, police, public school security guards and teenagers in the city of Chicago, complemented by results from government surveys of recent arrestees in 22 cities, plus administrative data for suicides, homicides, robberies, arrests and confiscated crime guns. We find evidence that transactions costs are considerable in the underground gun market in Chicago, and to some extent in other cities as well. The most likely explanation is that the underground gun market is both illegal and 'thin' - relevant information about trading opportunities is scarce due to illegality, which makes search costly for market participants and leads to a market thickness effect on transaction costs.\n      </p>"], "words": {"limited": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "all": {"number": 1, "prob":
