Rather than ending responsibly, with attention to matters of \u2018closure,\u2019 talk of transition and carefully held space for reflective thinking (Birnbaum &amp; Cichetti, 2008), we unravelled somewhat unceremoniously on the way back from lunch at the Pizza Express, perched outside the gents in the downstairs foyer at the university, unable to find an empty room to host our farewells. Yet in a manner completely congruent with our starting out and working together, the task we had set ourselves to end did not materialise as it \u2018should.\u2019 This special issue has afforded us the opportunity to attend differently to our endings/beginnings and also to each other \u201cas if for the first time\u201d (Eliot, 1944).

Four classes wrote essays using terminals linked to a mainframe computer (Experimental Group), and four classes wrote essays in the traditional mode using pens, pencils or typewriters (Control Group). The eight instructors agreed upon a common syllabus and common teaching approaches for the freshman writing course. To measure writing performance, they devised an analytic scale. To measure writing apprehension, they used a writing apprehension test developed by Daly and Miller. The Experimental Group showed greater progress than the Control Group from the pre to post Essay Test but could not demonstrate superior performance on the six required essays of the course. For writing apprehension, there was no significant difference between the two groups.\n      </p>", "University students' beliefs about themselves as writers and about the experience of learning in writing were investigated as related to writing approaches as measured by the Inventory of Processes in College Composition (Lavelle 1993). General findings included support for the deep and surface paradigm as well as variation in students' conceptions of writing, in their attitudes about themselves as writers, and in their felt need for personal expression in writing. Implications for instruction and further research are included.\n      </p>", "Recent changes in mathematics curricula, both in South Africa and elsewhere, have begun to change the overwhelmingly symbolic nature of mathematics in schools (in the sense of use of mathematical symbolism), promoting more use of the oral and written language. Engaging students in 'Writing-to-Learn' activities in mathematics classrooms has been identified and claimed by various mathematics education researchers as having a positive impact on the learning of mathematics.

Drawing on the results of a large-scale analysis of the linguistic characteristics of secondary-aged writers, we outline gender difference in the sample. The article explains the limited differences revealed through this analysis but highlights the repeated pattern of differences in boys' writing, mirroring parallel patterns in able writers.

This distinction has also been found in research on student practice and understanding of essay and discursive writing. This paper reports on results from a study of 40 interviews conducted with students taking creative writing courses at three different higher education institutions in the United Kingdom. Interviews were conducted with students of various levels of experience and expertise in creative writing and included students taking a single undergraduate module in creative writing and students enrolled in a highly selective Masters program in Creative Writing. The interviews focused on the students' conceptions and practice of creative writing while taking their respective courses. The analysis of the interview transcripts revealed an underlying subjectivist epistemology in the students' general assumptions and perception of the nature of Creative Writing vis-\u00e0-vis other forms of academic writing. Linked to this epistemology, the analysis disclosed a typology of four differing conceptions of student understanding and practice of creative writing within two overall transcribing and composing categories of conception. These categories closely resemble student's conceptions of writing practices in other disciplines.\n      </p>", "Writing has a role of increasing importance in the teaching of chemistiy. Analysis of the use of this writing can be aided by classifying writing by types such as expressive, poetic, transactional, empiricist and contingent. The status of chemistry teaching within the writing across the curriculum movement indicates that writing is important in teaching chemistiy and that a range of writing including not only transactional but also expressive writing should be applied. Transactional writing such as laboratory reports and formal term papers has been used in chemistry teaching for a long time and its importance is unquestioned. Part of the value of expressive writing is that it can provide communication within the classroom and involve the students in the course. In-class writing is an example of this. In-class writing is described in some detail along with suggestions for its successful use.\n      </p>", "In the past decade there has been a substantial increase in the number of introductory statistics courses taught at the undergraduate level. Many have argued successfully for the extensive use of writing in such courses in an attempt to highlight the interdisciplinary role of statistics and acknowledge that a good statistician must also be good at summarizing his or her analyses to nonstatisticians. This point was made by Radke-Sharpe, who went on to add that incorporating writing demands time, energy, and creativity, but that it is usually well worth the effort. This article discusses the efforts made by the authors to include writing in their courses, and some of the techniques that made the writing process painless and productive for both students and faculty.\n      </p>", "Since the early 1970s, many educators have touted writing as a means of enhancing learning. Several reasons have been suggested for this purported enhancement: that writing is a form of learning, that writing approximates human speech, that writing supports learning strategies. Alternatively, some researchers have cautioned that the educative effects of writing may be contingent on the contexts in which it occurs. The research on writing's effects on learning is ambiguous. This meta-analysis of 48 school-based writing-to-learn programs shows that writing can have a small, positive impact on conventional measures of academic achievement. Two factors predicted enhanced effects: the use of metacognitive prompts and increased treatment length. Two factors predicted reduced effects: implementation in Grades 6-8 and longer writing assignments.\n      </p>", "In this essay, I will look at the relationship between Creativity and Spirituality in the field of writing in general, and in scientific writing in particular. A few issues such as why we write and different kinds of writing will also be briefly discussed. In general, creativity is related to a special way of SEEING, or insight, as mentioned in many spiritual traditions. Therefore, with regard to Creativity as the term is used in this essay, a certain level of spirituality is implicitly assumed.\n      </p>", "A writing system is a visual notation system wherein a repertoire of marks, or strokes, is used to build a repertoire of characters. Are there any commonalities across writing systems concerning the rules governing how strokes combine into characters; commonalities that might help us identify selection pressures on the development of written language? In an effort to answer this question we examined how strokes combine to make characters in more than 100 writing systems over human history, ranging from about 10 to 200 characters, and including numerals, abjads, abugidas, alphabets and syllabaries from five major taxa: Ancient Near-Eastern, European, Middle Eastern, South Asian, Southeast Asian. We discovered underlying similarities in two fundamental respects. (i) The number of strokes per characters is approximately three, independent of the number of characters in the writing system; numeral systems are the exception, having on average only two strokes per character. (ii) Characters are ca. 50% redundant, independent of writing system size; intuitively, this means that a character's identity can be determined even when half of its strokes are removed. Because writing systems are under selective pressure to have characters that are easy for the visual system to recognize and for the motor system to write, these fundamental commonalities may be a fingerprint of mechanisms underlying the visuo-motor system.\n      </p>", "Having written as a group for four years, we continue with an emblematic methodology of writing into the dark, writing into a space that has become an intensive, maturing, messy, ethically caring, collaborative venture of changing composition. Our collective self writes into a tentative anticipating trust in our presence though we are shaded in uncertainty. We have written with desire and labor, intimacy and work, stuttering and stumbling our way through what has been a vibrant and aging transatlantic writing group.

The authors examined the effectiveness of self-regulated strategy development (SRSD), a strategy instructional model designed to promote development in each of these areas. Instruction focused on planning and writing stories and persuasive essays. The addition of a peer support component to SRSD instruction aimed at facilitating maintenance and generalization effects was also examined. SRSD had a positive impact on the writing performance and knowledge of struggling second-grade writers attending urban schools serving a high percentage of low-income families. In comparison with children in the Writers' Workshop condition, SRSD-instructed students were more knowledgeable about writing and evidenced stronger performance in the two instructed genres (story and persuasive writing) as well as two uninstructed genres (personal narrative and informative writing). Moreover, the peer support component augmented SRSD instruction by enhancing specific aspects of students' performance in both the instructed and uninstructed genres.\n      </p>", "In the first chapter the article delineates the \"Writing Culture-Debate\" in cultural anthropology concluding that an adjusted ethnographical practice requires elaborating more on questions of authority, power, and vocality. In the light of these premises, the next chapters analyse texts of a similar regional and topical context - shamanism in Siberia - but of different dates of origin (18th - 21st century). After revealing the different ethnographical discourses in these texts, the article concludes with a reflection on the merits and shortcomings of the \"Writing Culture-Debate\" and discusses possible implications for a self-conscious ethnography.\n      </p>", "A model for guiding students in writing reviews of family literature is presented. The conceptual base for the model is drawn from Bloom and associates' (1956) taxonomy of educational objectives.

Systematic debriefings suggested uniqueness to learning outcomes connected to zoo animals. Subsequent analysis of student writing indicated that students responded to situational interest by recording more observations, made use of more science facts, and used more science vocabulary when writing about unique animals (albino hedgehog, legless lizard) than 'ordinary' animals (rabbit, dove). The results are interpreted in terms of motivation, creating situational interest, and the familiarity of the schema available to the students. Policy implications are discussed.\n      </p>", "Publication is essential to science. Scientists have an obligation to publish their results-to commit them to public scrutiny by distributing them widely in a permanent medium. In this article, we emphasize that scientific writing does not have to be bad writing. It does not even have to be dull, stodgy, and obtuse. Science is exciting; that is why we do it. Your scientific papers should convey that excitement, communicating your findings so that any trained scientist can understand them and, just as importantly, remember them. However, scientific style is not easy to master, because it is rigidly constrained and highly disciplined, for good reason. Scientific style must be concise, absolutely accurate, and unambiguous. Yet, few graduate students are given formal instruction in scientific writing. Somehow they are supposed to hack out their first manuscripts on their own, learning only as their drafts are returned covered with red ink. In this article, we present graduate students with a guide to getting through the publication process, from crafting their first manuscripts, to mastering scientific style, to enduring the review process, and finally to joining the ranks of their published colleagues.\n      </p>", "We describe a successful interdepartmental program at a major research-oriented university that melds freshman writing with freshman biology to the significant benefit of both disciplines.

It discusses the importance and demands of everyday writing in work, and the role of formal education in preparing people for the localised learning about writing that is necessary upon entering work. It considers the issue of the transfer of knowledge, and argues that both metacognitive and conceptual understandings about writing are crucial elements in enabling people to transfer and adapt foundation literacy skills to the workplace.\n      </p>", "It has been claimed that writing to learn mathematics (WTLM) may benefit students' conceptual understanding as well as their procedural ability. To investigate this claim, we collected data from students in two sections of an introductory calculus course. In one of the sections, students used WTLM activities and discussed the activities after completing the writing; in the other section, students used similar activities that did not involve writing but engaged them in thinking about the mathematical ideas and in discussing the activities. The errors from the in-class and final exams of both groups of students were categorized and analyzed for information about the students' conceptual and procedural understanding. We found no significant differences between the WTLM group and the non-writing group, which suggests that the real benefit from writing activities may not be in the actual activity of writing, but rather in the fact that such activities require students to struggle to understand mathematical ideas well enough to communicate their understanding to others.\n      </p>", "Findings are presented from a small-scale longitudinal study of first- year psychology students' learning. Three developmental hierarchies were derived in the analysis of the interview data, which described different aspects of the variation in students' accounts of their conceptions of essay writing. Although the findings did suggest that the students made some development in their conceptions, it seemed that by the end of the study many of them were still unable to describe what was expected for their essays in a way which fully mapped onto their tutors' accounts. The effects of advice given to students about their essay writing were also investigated. Students were given help that seemed relevant to developing their conceptions, but there was little evidence in the interviews that this made an impact on their learning and students often described minimal engagement with advice and feedback. Two case studies are presented to give a more holistic perspective on the students' accounts of their essay writing. These cases suggest the limitations of simple categorisations, as they emphasise the complex and idiosyncratic nature of students' development.\n      </p>", "Today, teachers of English are faced with the problem of developing new vantage points from which to consider the use of computers in writing programs, writing classrooms, and individual writing processes. Until this time, the profession has subscribed to a limited view of computers anti their effects on writing - a view circumscribed by the paradigms of other disciplines or by our own past experiences with teaching machines and paper-and-pencil composing. These visions are not capable of accommodating the larger and more radical changes wrought by the electronic medium we are now using. By subscribing to them, English teachers may, as Coleridge says, have created a \"tacit compact\" not to pass beyond a certain limit in speculating about computers. This paper suggests four overlapping areas of exploration, four points of departure that might help us spark creative re-formations of our thinking about computers and their relationship to writing: 1.) Computers and teaching writing, 2.) Computers and language theory, 3.) Computers and learning from the past, 4.) Computer research in other fields.\n      </p>", "This project explores the feasibility of a semester-long writing activity for beginning foreign-language students.

Included in the article are a description of how such a project can be developed, sample student writing in Spanish as well as results of a student survey on perceived usefulness of the writing task and its effect on language acquisition. Both student reaction as well as the typical ultimate written product suggest that such an approach to writing is an excellent component in fostering general language acquisition and likely interest in pursuing further language study.\n      </p>", "The African American gang practice of writing while dancing is part of a nonstandard gang written tradition that crosscuts multiple expressive media. In dance, feet become primary media of written production as gang members spell out affiliations, nicknames, enemies, and memorials to the dead. Because gang members integrate writing with ephemeral expression, gang literacy expands scholarly constructs of writing that rely on materiality, durable form, and a lack of sociality or context. In such performative media, gang members thus provide a novel frame for questioning how literacy constructs impact racial politics in the United States.\n      </p>", "The authors investigated the effects of guided journal writing on students' understanding of themes and main characters in a complex novel. Three English 12 classes were randomly assigned to 1 no-writing condition and 2 writing conditions\u2014character clues and general-response questions. The results from 2 posttests consistently indicated that students who wrote significantly surpassed students who did not write. Student self-ratings data indicated that the students believed that the writing activities helped them with story understanding. Student interview data indicated that students believed that the writing made them think more deeply about the story. The results support the contributions of writing to student literary learning and the research of J. Marshall (1987) and G. E. Newell (1994, 1996).\n      </p>", "This essay demonstrates how theories of writing considered as an invented technology can open new interpretive doors into the study of literature. First I briefly explain the effects and consequences of the technology of writing in relation to speech, the primary effect being the disembodiment of language. I explain in a similar way the effects and consequences of written story in relation to oral story. Then I examine writing and orality, literature and orature in Forster's A Passage to India in such a way as to show how the theory of writing as a technology can actually produce interpretations.\n      </p>", "In this paper, we describe our encounters in and passes through the figuration of the threshold as producing writing between-the-two: or, loss of the individual subject. We describe how in the threshold, we meet in that in-between space, a space of shared deterritorialization in which we constitute one another. Also, we describe writing between-the-two in the threshold as a site of embodiment, of affect. In thinking of how to articulate our way of thinking and writing together as between-the-two and as different than a collaborative project where two \u201cI\u201ds contribute pieces both with and independent of the other, we take our cue from Ken Gale and Jonathan Wyatt's (2009) Between the Two. In this book, they articulate a way of thinking and writing inspired by Deleuze and Guattari's collaborative work as that which is not a working together, but a working in the gap \u201cbetween the two\u201d (Deleuze &amp; Parnet, 1987/2002, p. 13). This spark of creativity in the gap is both like and unlike what we will explain in this article. Like Gale and Wyatt, we lean on figurations and concepts in the writings of Deleuze and Guattari as a referent; however, our between-the-two is pursued more deliberately through a materialist knowing in being that produces our becoming with and in a digital threshold.\n      </p>", "In this essay I look at issues of authority and voice as they have entered the current critique of ethnographic writing.

This method follows the standard procedure of submission of a paper to a journal, whereby the students (peer) review each other's work, revise their papers in light of the referee's comments (or rebut them). Then acceptance \"for publication\" by the editor is marked by a high grade. It has been used in a variety of physics-related courses (astronomy, high-fidelity sound, biophysics), and also in general university-wide courses (The Atomic Bomb, The Bhagavad-Gita). The method introduces students to broadly-accepted scholarly communication modes of communicating ideas, with anonymous reviews. With suitable organization the time spent by faculty can be readily reduced, and faculty efficiency improved, to make the method convenient and viable. Also, it seems that other disciplines can use this method to advantage.\n      </p>", "Conducting a writing class by way of a mainframe network changes relationships among students and instructor. Writers file texts in a central directory. In the classroom less, they spend more time reading and learning from each others' texts. Instructorial authority is diffused.

It is written and presented with the hope that it will diffract from the (im)possibilities of rigid classification and of creating a category of difference with which to capture or unitise collaborative writing. Further, this paper, in resisting closure and conclusion, also wishes to write with and for becoming collaborative writing, sensing the opportunities, the potential and the creative anticipations that writing collaboratively always seems to afford.

We explore the identities that mathematicians present to the world in their writing and the ways in which they represent the nature of mathematical activity. Analysis of 53 published research papers reveals substantial variations in these aspects of mathematicians' writing. The interpretation of these variations is supported by extracts from interviews with the mathematicians.

The search to locate how writing functions among a culture's communicative practices can involve identifying domains that are unique to it, for example, where some kinds of writing attain a standing such that they are not meant to be understood as the transcription of a testimony or other oral act. Such a possibility is part of our culture but not part of many others, and is, among other things, a significant cognitive development. This article takes a diachronic perspective, back to a moment in our own past when a certain class of writings began to demand a kind of understanding different from that demanded by writing in that culture up to that time. I look at the Middle Ages to examine, inter alia, the written document putting into question prevailing temporal indices; the move of the act of writing away from an identification with other constatable acts and toward a more oblique and less committed relation to those acts; biblical exegesis as elaborating a new stance of writing through its practice of written gloss; the teaching of writing skills and the professionalization of the writer; and the significance of a renewed use of the cursive hand. The changing status of writing both encouraged and is implicated in the appearance and legitimizing of a set of utterances (and the acts behind them) seen as beneficially unmoored rather than moored, in a space and time of their own.\n      </p>", "This study compares pencil-and-paper and computer-assisted versions of a college process/model program in critical thinking and academic writing to a traditional composition program. Students in the experimental sections used more linguistic markers of argument and comparison/contrast, attempted more arguments and made stronger arguments.

Applications of computer assisted techniques in studying meaning in poetry, teaching technical writing and in teaching practice, suggest new approaches to collaborative thinking and writing.\n      </p>", "Papago Indian children in elementary school bridge two languages and more than two cultures. Although English is the first language of most Papago children, the unwritten Papago language is used often in home environments to communicate with grandparents and tribal elders. The children are also members of more than two cultures. They belong both to the Papago community, with its Indian heritage and practices and the influence of Christian missions, and the community of American children, united by media, sharing common interests of television shows, sports, and video games. The writing of these children in school reflects their linguistic competence as they make meaningful written language, and the particular cultural influences as they reflect awareness of cultural pragmatics in their writing. This article focuses on three Papago children who were part of a two-year longitudinal study of the writing process and behaviors during writing of third- and fourth-grade Papago children. Samples of their pen pal letters, general narrative writing, their own versions of Indian legends, and other writing are examined and compared.\n      </p>", "The role of publishers as cultural agents is under-researched by those who have made use of the extensive canon of twentieth-century countryside writing.

The task of writing a grant proposal in response to a specific set of instructions is used to illustrate the analysis and responses necessary to complete a major written communication project. The concept of focusing on--and writing for--the reader (in this case, the proposal reviewer) is emphasized. Although good communication skills affect life-styles, productivity, and economics in our society, the communication skills of the American public are sorely lacking--even among people with high levels of education--because students receive little training in these skills in the United States educational system. However, such skills can be taught to younger students as well as to adults.\n      </p>", "Through a discussion of the work of Marie Cardinal and Annie Ernaux, this article aims to problematize the anglophone academic world's tendency to associate French feminisms predominantly with avant-garde or highly theoretical texts. The work of Ernaux and Cardinal is presented alongside a discussion of its reception by readers and critics in France, and by academics in English-speaking countries. The first part of the article identifies aspects of Ernaux's and Cardinal's works which cannot be encompassed within a critical framework based on the dichotomy between na\u00efve realism on the one hand and the politically and linguistically radical text on the other. Ernaux's plain language, for instance, is clearly very unlike the linguistic experimentation of 'feminine writing'; nonetheless the emphasis on social class in her writing constitutes a political intervention which is at least equally valid. The reception study in the second part of the article provides further evidence of the relevance to gender politics in France of Cardinal's The Words to Say It (1975) and texts published by Annie Ernaux in the 1980s and 1990s. The ambivalent response of critics seems to indicate the troubling nature of writing which combines the codes of realism and autobiography (or autobiographical fiction in Cardinal's case) with the depiction of taboo subjects such as menstruation, or a daughter's response to her mother's debilitating illness and death. The article also charts the widespread popularity of these texts in France, particularly with women readers, and gives some examples of the pleasures described in letters to the authors. In conclusion, we argue that the ambivalent space between popular and high culture occupied (albeit differently) by Ernaux and Cardinal may be particularly effective in terms of gender politics, and that even in the late 1990s, the personal may be as political as ever.\n      </p>", "Community college remedial reading students composed an informational report from sources, a task commonly assigned in higher education that integrally combines reading and writing processes. Productivity, use of source text, reproductions, accuracy, and inclusion of key ideas were analyzed as a function of two exogenous variables, text density (high, low) and domain (health, business), and two endogenous variables, prior knowledge and general literacy skill. Text density interacted with literacy skill for productivity, and with prior knowledge for accuracy. Individuals with lower literacy or prior knowledge scores were at a disadvantage with high but not low density source text. Domain affected productivity, use of source, and inclusion of key ideas: health text was associated with superior performance. Domain effects may be explained by metacognitive or motivational variables, or differences in the readability of the source texts.

Typically, studies of discourse development have emphasized structural aspects of text. However, children appropriate not only forms, but also words, themes, purposes, and styles. From a developmental point of view, the concept of appropriation raises at least three questions: What is it that children appropriate? Where do they get their material? And what do they do with that material? In an attempt to make sense of appropriation as a developmental construct, we examine one third-grader's writing: Suzanne's book, \"The missing piece.\" We find that Suzanne appropriated material from two major sources: (a) adult-authored text -- Margaret Sidney's novel, \"Five little Peppers and how they grew\" -- and (b) the meanings and values of a stratified local peer culture. We conclude by discussing the significance of this work for future research on children's discourse development.\n      </p>", "With special attention to the use of unconventional practices and pictorial signs in casual letter writing, this article shows how young Japanese women effectively exploit affect-laden shape, form, and function in order to establish intimate and solidary relationships. They rely on both conventional and unconventional aspects of Japanese orthography, encoding affect specific to the given context and merging spoken with written modes of self-representation. In so doing, they seem to draw on diverse \"frames\" of written language, and to manipulate symbolic means of association and integration for achieving reciprocity. These features not only provide the basis for reciprocity, but may also suggest a new mode of literacy caused by social change.\n      </p>", "We discuss a pedagogical strategy to improve the writing of laboratory reports. Our multipronged approach gauges students' comprehension beforehand, rewards early success, and focuses feedback on the most serious writing issues. In preliminary studies, more students were able to achieve our threshold for success in our introductory courses, and students reported being more motivated to write well.\n      </p>", "Most discussions of the relationships between 'the East', 'the West' and writing have, following Edward Said, involved interpreting the representations of people and places within travel writing, novels and other literary forms. This paper argues that this restricted engagement with practices of reading and writing limits the ways in which the relationships between people involved in the global geographies constructed since the fifteenth century can be understood. Through presenting a detailed discussion of the role of royal letters within the voyages of the English East India Company in the early seventeenth century, it argues that an analysis of 'how writing travels' which concentrates on the production, carriage and use of texts as material objects can foreground the active and collective making of global geographies as a contested enterprise involving multiple agents in a variety of sites. This paper presents writing as a global cultural practice and traces its place in the making of an early modern trading network.\n      </p>", "Between 1826 and 1831 Anne Royall published nine volumes of travel writing, together with a volume of letters written while she was living and touring in Alabama. Frequently repetitious, often limited in their scope, and highly opinionated, these books provide an insight into American society during the 1820s from a very particular viewpoint. This paper explores this particularity. It argues that although some scholars have suggested there is an identifiable feminine perspective in female travel writing, Royall's writings do not readily match these criteria. As a consequence Royall's writings raise questions about the existing paradigms of female travel writing.\n      </p>", "This article analyzes a set of handwritten documents produced by a Burundese asylum seeker in Belgium. The documents are instances of \"grassroots writing\": their authorship is collective, and they display considerable problems with \"remembering.\" They are also rather typical text-artifacts of globalization processes, in which literacy products from one part of the world meet literacy expectations from another part. Two general points are derived from the analysis. (i) The function of documents such as these is not \"reading,\" but rather a complex of reading, viewing, and decoding. The documents are at least partially VISUAL bearers of information. Such functions need to be investigated ethnographically. (ii) The reason for this is the fact that the production and reception of such documents has to be set against the background of widely different economies of literacy. Consequently, the differences between text production and text reception are grounded in worldwide patterns of inequality. This casts doubt on a number of popular theses about the nature of contemporary societies and the role of discourse in late modernity.\n      </p>", "The self-regulated strategy development approach to instruction was used to help 3 middle school students who had learning problems, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and specific language impairment, learn a strategy for planning and writing expository essays. The composition strategy helped students to consider their topic in advance and to use text structure knowledge to develop 5-paragraph essays. Regular education teachers provided instruction to the target students in inclusive classrooms; special education teachers facilitated the writing program. A multiple-probe design across students (R. D. Horner &amp; D. M. Baer, 1978) was used to assess to the effects of the strategy. Instruction had a positive effect on the students' approach to writing and overall writing performance. Four weeks following instruction, students' papers remained improved and were still longer and more complete.\n      </p>", "This study explored the practices of two high school teachers of U.S. history and their students' performance on evidence-based history essays over 7 months. Data include pre- and posttest essays, interviews, observations, teacher feedback, assignments, and readings. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons of 42 students' work show that one class improved in writing evidence-based history essays whereas the other did not. Qualitative analyses of the teachers' practices suggest that different opportunities to learn to read, write, and think historically are not equally valuable. In particular, the following qualities of instruction support students' development in writing evidence-based historical essays: approaching history as evidence-based interpretation; reading historical texts and considering them as interpretations; supporting reading comprehension and historical thinking; asking students to develop interpretations and support them with evidence; and using direct instruction, guided practice, independent practice, and feedback to teach evidence-based writing. The act of writing alone is not sufficient for growth in evidence-based historical writing.\n      </p>", "The purpose of this study was to describe the variations in literacy achievement among native and non-native upper primary school children (grades three to six) in the Netherlands. Various measures of word decoding, reading literacy and writing skill were collected from 1091 native Dutch children, 753 children with a former Dutch colonial background and 580 children with a Mediterranean background. The results showed the non-native children to lag behind their native peers on all of the tasks, although the differences on the decoding and writing tasks were fairly small. The Mediterranean children scored significantly lower than the ex-colonial children on all of the reading literacy tasks but equally high on the decoding and writing tasks. For both the native and non-native children, the same underlying factor structure was found to characterise their literacy achievement. Grade and ethnic status consistently predicted the factor scores for Word Decoding, Reading Literacy and Text Writing. In addition, socio-economic status (SES) predicted Reading Literacy and the variable sex predicted Writing Skills.\n      </p>", "In this article, Jerome de Groot looks at the ways in which prison was conceived of in writings by imprisoned royalists to show that royalist writings are more diverse than we have realized. He reflects on the physical conditions of prisons and on writings about imprisonment during the 1640s and 1650s as a way of considering the complex, overlapping, and dynamic ways that legal and royalist identity was conceptualized during those decades. Prison writing shows us not simply the models that royalism deployed to represent itself but also how it understood and engaged with multiple other discourses, including law, religion, and dissidence.\n      </p>", "This paper describes the novel ways in which the Orlando Project, based at the Universities of Alberta and Guelph, is using SGML to create an integrated electronic history of British women's writing in English. Unlike most other SGML-based humanities computing projects which are tagging existing texts, we are researching and writing new material, including biographies, items of historical significance, and many kinds of literary and historical interpretation, all of which incorporates sophisticated SGML encoding for content as well as structure. We have created three DTDs, for biographies, for writing-related activities and publications, and for social, political and other events. A major factor influencing the design of the DTDs was the requirement to be able to merge and restructure the entire textbase in many ways in order to retrieve and index it and to reflect multiple views and interpretations. In addition a stable and well-documented system for tagging was deemed essential for a team which involves almost twenty people, including eight graduate students, in two locations.\n      </p>", "This article investigates the role of script choice in bilingual writing, drawing on classified advertisements and other texts written for and by Russian-speaking immigrants in New York City. The study focuses on English-origin items that appear in Russian texts, which are found to be written either in roman or Cyrillic script. Through an investigation of categorical and variable constraints on this variation, it is found that script choice relates to the distinction between lexical borrowing and single-item codeswitching. It is argued that writers may, consciously and on a token-by-token basis, choose the Cyrillic script to mark a word as borrowed or the roman script to mark it as foreign. However, they may also avoid this choice, as hybrid forms attest, especially when the use of characters shared by both alphabets allows ambiguous readings. The findings thus have implications for understanding notions of language boundaries in bilingual language use.\n      </p>", "In this article, I make a case for how the conventional deductive writing style common in top impact mainstream journals affects what we can know, how we can learn, and the extent to which qualitative methods are valued. Using case examples, I demonstrate how a deductive logic perpetuates a myth that is ethically and pedagogically problematic, constrains theory building, and invites inappropriate benchmarks for quality. Further, articulating qualitative analysis methods in a formulaic manner can actually overshadow and discourage the artistic insight of grounded analyses. The article closes with a discussion of how communication scholars are well equipped to help transform publication conventions so that qualitative methods may be presented in more flexible and expansive literary styles.\n      </p>", "Recent years have seen rapid advancement in our understanding of the phonology and grammar of Classic Ch'olan and the distribution of Lowland Mayan languages in the Classic period. The control over the data has advanced to such an extent that Classic Ch'olan should no longer be considered chiefly a product of reconstruction, but rather a language in its own right, providing fresh input to historical reconstruction. The interpretation of writing system principles has moved into the forefront of research, and recent discussions of these and other major issues are summarized here. This review suggests that the exceptional phonological transparency of the Maya script, which is a precondition for the current advances in linguistic epigraphy, is rooted in the need of scribes to spell out regional linguistic variants, and a sociolinguistically oriented theory of the evolution of writing in general is formulated and tested on the Mayan hieroglyphic materials.\n      </p>", "The NCTM Research Committee developed this article to address a distinctly important activity that links research and practice: writing research-based articles for practitioner journals.

In other words, I am presuming that educational anthropologists, like many other academics, are interested in grounding their research in a theory of social construction because they wish not only to describe and analyze social practices, but to interrupt those social practices they believe oppress certain designated classes inside educational institutions, namely students, teachers, minorities, and women. Hence, whether one's interest in cultural criticism derives from the work of the founding members of the Frankfurt School or from that of educational revisionists, such as Friere's \"Pedagogy of the Oppressed\" (1973), Bowles and Gintis's \"Schooling in Capitalist America\" (1976), Bourdieu and Passeron's \"Reproduction in Education, Society, and Culture\" (1977), Apple and Weiss's \"Ideology and Practice in Schooling\" (1983), and Giroux's \"Theory and Resistance in Education\" (1983), to name only a few, the goal of critical ethnography is always the same: to help create the possibility of transforming such institutions as schools-through a process of negative critique.\n      </p>", "Studies on language shift often refer to the demise of the ousted variety by detailing various stages of language decay and extinction. Problematic for these accounts are well-documented cases of intervening social phenomena, such as language revival movements, which can alter in some way the stages of decline. French Louisiana's situation illustrates language shift interacting with a strong revival movement. In the wake of the revival and in spite of continued shift, another trend is apparent -- the writing of Louisiana French. Whereas shift clearly represents a stage of language decline, the creation of a written code functions as a key ingredient for language maintenance. A sociolinguistic analysis of these forces reveals the complexity and the conflict involved in the choice of the written word.\n      </p>", "A natural-language description written in a production-type grammar writing language is defined by a set of grammar rules and a control mechanism. This paper introduces such grammer writing systems and highlights the relationship between the two components. It then proposes a data-driven control strategy, which offers several advantages over existing systems in terms of grammar development and maintenance and computational efficiency. This data-driven control strategy divides the grammar into active and inactive rules. Active rules are attached to their corresponding nodes in the test structure and only these rules participate in the pattern matching process. Upon the successful application of one rule, a new set of active rules will be derived. This derivation involves a search process, simplified by a pre-compilation of the grammar which determines the interaction between rules. This scheme also automatically partitions the grammar according to linguistic classes and provides an incremental way of writing ambiguity rules.\n      </p>", "This textual ethnography concerns an estate property case from an Islamic law court in mid-twentieth-century Yemen.

Here we suggest that reflection on the thinking that happens in the writing process itself is a key analytic practice researchers can use to understand and transform the world. We invite readers to examine with us how productivity as a discourse in doctoral education relegates the act of writing to just another task to be completed, one more stage within the hierarchical processes of what we call PhDness. Using multiple texts as reflexive accounts of our writing as inquiry practices, written throughout and after our phenomenological and poststructural dissertation work, respectively, we demonstrate how writing not included in the final dissertation served as a necessary space\u00a0to think\u00a0potential action.\n      </p>", "This article discusses the declining ability of social work students to write proficiently and offers a brief historical review of different approaches to the writing problems of American students. It describes the development of a writing assistance program at a graduate school and the program's outcomes after its initial year. Using a global writing assessment, the authors found that 1/3 of entering MSW students had inadequate writing skills, and only 57% of these took advantage of the writing assistance offered.\n      </p>", "College freshmen at more selective schools perform best on holistically scored writing tasks. Regardless of school, those who claim to write better or worse than their peers do so. Although individual topics affect students' scores, the students' sense of the ease or interest level of a topic is not the source of the effect. Surveys revealed that students assess topics containing quoted material beyond newspaper reading level as duller and more difficult than topics that ask students to argue their opinion on a current controversial issue, but students feel that they usually write on difficult, interesting topics. Students at more selective schools found writing more pleasurable and more interesting than their counterparts and were more confident in their writing abilities. Freshmen enjoyed writing more and were more confident in their abilities than older students. Students' interest in writing varied significantly depending on their teachers.\n      </p>", "This study, a description of children's views of the contexts surrounding their writing, examines five contextual factors (ownership, setting, audience, purpose, and genre) from the perspectives of 20 children in grades 1 through 5. Two boys and two girls at each grade were asked to collect home and school writing for three months. In three individual meetings, each child labeled selected products for each contextual factor. Categories thus derived were further analyzed to examine the range of audiences, purposes, and genres across grades within three common writing situations: self-sponsored writing at home, self-sponsored writing at school, and assigned writing. This article discusses patterns in the type and number of categories reported.

The data came from the Longitudinal Study of Children at Risk, an ongoing investigation of the school adjustment of 1,255 low-income African-American children in government-funded programs in the Chicago Public Schools. Sources consisted of teacher questionnaires, parent questionnaires, children questionnaires, and standardized test scores, and open-ended answers to two questions on students' Year 4 questionnaires. Those questions were scored for content, mechanics, and language usage. Results indicated that the subjects evidenced low writing ability, they did not like to write, they did little writing, and what writing they did emphasized mechanics rather than content. On all questionnaires, what consistently and significantly correlated with writing ability were effort, attitude, teacher and student expectations, maturity, motivation, self-confidence, and behavior. The findings lead to two recommendations: First, more composition must be included in the school curriculum, and it must be taught by teachers who know about writing. Second, schools should pay more attention to affective factors that they can influence, such as teachers' expectations and students' self-confidence.\n      </p>", "The language of academic journals tends to become so technical that only specialists are able to understand the unnecessarily complex features of vocabulary, syntax, discourse, and format. This seems particularly unfortunate at a time when the results of present-day scholarship in linguistic and cultural anthropology need to be as widely accessible as possible. An examination of problems in two articles in Language and one in the American Anthropologist points out the nature of the difficulties and some of the solutions.\n      </p>", "This article describes the effects of dialogue journaling through e-mail on the language produced by two groups (experimental and control) of first-semester-Spanish college students. The independent variable was the use of electronic mail while the dependent variables were accuracy and number of words per message. Quantitative results showed that the control group significantly outperformed the experimental group regarding grammatical accuracy. Non-significant differences for either lexical accuracy or number of words were found. For qualitative analysis, a questionnaire administered to both groups requested their opinions on the effectiveness and attitude towards the journaling technique. The authors concluded that, although the e-mail medium promoted a more positive attitude towards the language, dialogue journals via e-mail did not improve grammar skills. Thus, suggestions are offered to modify instruction to enhance other positive results from the use of electronic writing in L2, thereby providing a way to incorporate authentic, real-life writing tasks, develop better classroom rapport, and allow advantages to students otherwise reluctant to speak in class.\n      </p>", "The literature on winegrowing in the southwest of France, or Aquitaine, has largely recounted the past of the Bordeaux merchants and winegrowers who developed the celebrated grand crus. While the developers of quality wines did control the production and marketing of wine in the Aquitaine as a whole, missing from the literature are accounts of small growers of the interior who produced table wines and who forged the wine cooperative movement in the early twentieth century. This omission is attributable to a historical conjuncture that subordinated the producers of table wines to those who produced the grand crus while elevating these quality wines as the quintessential representative of the French wine industry. An ethnographic perspective, or one of critical historiography, on the wine cooperative movement can help to restore a plurality of winegrowing pasts.\n      </p>", "Many of the recurrent ideas, attributes, and tactics associated with prison writing are found in a work widely regarded as the final testimony of Boethius, a sixth-century prisoner. In this essay, Rivkah Zim shows how Boethius came to terms with adversity by reaffirming his values and explores the ways in which this paradigmatic text exploits the circumstance of imprisonment to enhance its authority. Three early modern case studies help refine criteria for assessing the authority of carceral experience, and an overview of several kinds of prisoners' writings, including those of Thomas More and John Bunyan, shows how adversity was exploited to promote political strategies. Finally, Zim considers some modern critical approaches to prison writing and proposes a conceptual framework for what we might call a politics of prison writing.\n      </p>", "This article examines the censorship of Irish writing since 1950. It gives an historical overview of the evolution of literary censorship in twentieth-century Ireland, with particular reference to the operations of the Censorship of Publications Acts, 1929 and 1946. It includes a list of books by Irish authors that were banned since 1950; an account of the supplanting of the Catholic activists who had controlled the Censorship of Publications Board since its inception; the fundamental reforms introduced in 1967; and an account and analysis of the impact of censorship on Irish writing and Irish writers, and the variety of their responses.\n      </p>", "This exploratory study examines the impact of face-to-face collaborative technology on group writing. We compared small groups writing managerial memoranda in a computer-supported meeting room, and with conventional writing tools. The computer environment, the Capture Lab, allowed us to study how a technology designed for broad functionality and flexibility in group process affects collaborative work. We find that the technology alters the writing process, resulting in less initial group planning, more individuai work, and more revising than when conventional tools are used. This affects negotiation and consensus-reaching processes. The technology also reduces speech and group focus. User feedback suggests the technology has both positive and negative effects on group interaction. The technology did not affect overall document quality, although one measure suggests it can enhance writers' audience adaptiveness. Comparisons of how different groups used the technology suggest that these patterns influence document quality. In the conclusion, we discuss what groups need in order to use this kind of collaborative technology effectively and future research directions.\n      </p>", "Teachers of grades pre-K\u20138 are charged with the responsibility of developing children's statistical thinking.

Students undertaking this task typically possessed varying levels of scientific literacy and were drawn from a cohort of mixed abilities. The assessment task involved the construction of a scientific report that included feedback from instructor to students before final submission of the assessment piece. After initial submission of a scientific report, the instructor developed a cohort-specific marking scheme based on the deficiencies that were evident within the class group. Using a mixture of peer and self-review against specific criteria, the students were required to resubmit an amended report. This resulted in elevated marks compared with those that would have been obtained after first submission, thus rewarding the student for the application of feedback. This technique proved to be efficient for both parties and also resulted in improvement of skills of the entire student population, regardless of the ability of the student prior to the assessment task. Using this methodology, students of varying aptitudes were able to measure their own skill improvement against tangible criteria, and enjoy a degree of learning success independent of the ranking within their group.\n      </p>", "The early modern Sino-Vietnamese dictionary known as the Ch\u1ec9 Nam Ng\u1ecdc \u00c2m Gi\u1ea3i Ngh\u0129a contains two prefaces: one written in Literary Sinitic, using Sinitic characters, and one written in Vietnamese, using the \u201cvernacular\u201d script called Ch\u1eef N\u00f4m. If read separately, each preface makes independent arguments in favor of \u201csemantosyllabic\u201d graphemes (characters that encode information for both meaning and pronunciation). However, when read as a single, continuous text, the prefaces combine to present a defense of Ch\u1eef N\u00f4m\u2014not as a vernacular alternative to Sinitic characters\u2014but as a legitimate augmentation of the intellectual technology they represent, and thus capable of \u201ctaming\u201d southern culture and intellectuality into literate civilization\n      </p>", "This study analyzes a natural, real life writing session involving a male executive in the construction business, his female secretary, and a male representing himself as a state official working together to write a letter to a state official urging action on a long overdue claim. The conversation generated by these three parties revealed that (1) the writers' lack of explicit statements of communicative goals and stylistic intent hampered the letter drafting; (2) the participants had stereotypes about what constitutes good business letter writing; (3) the directness of the earlier drafts gradually diminished; and (4) the participants' roles in the creation of the letter shifted from draft to draft.\n      </p>", "In this collaborative autoethnography, the five of us explore the experience and ethics of writing\u2014and living\u2014from/in intensity.

Conditions that may stimulate subconscious mental processes to generate useful ideas are discussed. They are doubt, venturesome attitude, diversity, thorough preparation, tension, temporary abandonment, relaxation, writing, exchange with colleagues, freedom from distraction, and deadlines. Various forms of chance and their roles in research and problem solving are discussed.

A random sample of 493 persuasive papers written by 17-year-olds during the 1978-79 National Assessment of Educational Progress writing evaluation were analyzed. The results of the analyses indicate that general coherence is an important element of writing quality and that the lexical cohesive features of synonym, hyponym, and collocation are important elements of writing quality and general coherence in manuscripts of the same length.\n      </p>", "As various competing definitions of classroom writing competence emerge, researchers must essentially confront the question, \"On what basis does one select one definition over another?\" To answer this question, this paper argues the need to consider the sociopolitical dimension of this construct, in addition to the conceptual and design criteria dimensions. The paper begins by noting that all definitions of classroom writing competence represent partially specified, or simplified, definitions. To illustrate the principles of partial specification in writing research, six emerging paradigms of writing research are considered. It is shown that each of these paradigms makes contradictory claims as to what constitutes the principal causative context of classroom writing competence. The sociopolitical implications for each of these paradigm's partial specifications are discussed in terms of five purposes of education. The paper concludes by reiterating the need to select definitions of classroom writing competence in terms of sociopolitical criteria.\n      </p>", "Participatory research is a radical praxis through which marginalized people acquire research capabilities that they use to transform their own lives. In this article, I examine how parent writers incorporated facets of community writing into their research practice as they developed their practices and identities as researchers.

We used video analyses of the sessions to identify well-coordinated and poorly coordinated groups. Through user questionnaires, group members evaluated their work processes and products as well as the computer-supported environment. Writing experts independently rated the quality of the groups' final documents. We discovered that quality of coordination was strongly tied to groups' evaluations of their work processes, work products, and tools. Well-coordinated groups tended to be more efficient than poorly coordinated groups although we observed no differences in the quality of their documents. We also identify what coordination strategies lead to effective group work and offer suggestions for additional tools to facilitate coordination.\n      </p>", "This study concerns the convergence of electronic literacy, collaboration, and critical pedagogy in the classroom. I argue that teachers in the humanities must relinquish the vestiges of non-electronic criteria in their assessments of electronic literacy. Instead, the interplay of human and technological factors in the classroom leads to a reaffirmation of literacy as a social process. The radical democratization and multivocality of the corporate or collaborativelywritten text demands a critical problematizing of our roles and actions as teacher-readers. The viability of static criteria for good literacy practices vanishes with electronic literacy. Feminist cyborg theory offers a useful paradigm for understanding the corporate text by bridging theories of electronic literacy and theories of collaborative learning. The cyborg is a dynamic techno-fusion of difference and contradiction: much like the corporate text. A cyborgian perspective reaffirms the polyvocalic, instable nature of postmodern literacy and calls for contextual writing criteria.\n      </p>", "This paper elaborates the potential and limitations of Intelligent Tutoring Systems in the teaching of language skills, in particular, of writing. It (1) outlines the goals and significance of research in Intelligent Tutoring Systems, emphasizing their value in formulating knowledge about teaching more explicitly; (2) analyzes the pedagogical assumptions underlying research in Intelligent Tutoring Systems, focusing on theories of discovery learning and learning by doing; (3) describes the architecture of these systems; and (4) illustrates the instructional design issues by describing PARNASSUS, a project to construct an Intelligent Tutoring System for exploring instructional design issues in teaching students to write.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Accessing ancient meaning and sound from graphic notations is an immense challenge to archaeologists, whether with respect to marked objects, petrographs, or phonic writing. Two paths clear the way: the detection or reasoned reconstruction of \"situation,\" how graphic notations were used in the past and in what social and cultural setting, and the process of \"extraction,\" the hermeneutic scholarship that decodes such messages and establishes the relative plausibility of an interpretation. Situation is easier to study and extraction more likely to occur in cases of phonic writing, where varieties or types, physical inspection, decipherment, origins, and extinction permit multiple inroads into past sound and meaning.\n      </p>", "Although slate writing equipment is a common feature of archaeological assemblages from historical sites in Australia, archaeologists have paid these items relatively little attention. The main period of production spanned the period 1770-1900. Thereafter, there were calls to remove slates from the schoolroom because they were regarded as unhygienic. Archaeological evidence indicates, however, that slates persisted in use well into the twentieth century. This paper examines the role of writing slates and pencils in colonial Victoria, their function in education, and their presence beyond the turn of the century. Slates remained in use due to their economy and convenience, the lack of supplies of cheap paper, and the persistence of older models of classroom teaching.\n      </p>", "This review considers evidence cited in support of and in opposition to Writing Across the Curriculum (WAC) and Writing in the Disciplines (WID). After defining WAC and WID terms and concepts and reviewing the literature on key developments of the WAC/WID movement, the authors recommend that key terms be defined more precisely and that multimodal learning be adopted more consistently to address varied learning styles. Noting the complexities of affirming student achievement, specifically when success is attributed without qualification to WAC/WID initiatives, the authors question evidence cited in support of WAC/WID goals and pedagogies. They also consider the monetary costs of WAC/WID initiatives.\n      </p>", "Two noteworthy and successful vernacular rhetoric manuals printed in sixteenth-century England are actually writing manuals, books on how to compose letters: William Fulwood's The Enimie of Idlenesse (1568), and Angel Day's The English Secretorie (1586). Both works reflected and sought to influence literacy habits in the book-reading public, and reveal a wider range of cultural engagement than has previously been thought. In particular, three aspects are likely to have stirred reader interest: a connection for vernacular learners with both the humanist and dictaminal epistolary traditions that formed the core of prestige education; a focus on practical letter exchanges that carry familial and social significance; and a large collection of model letters, in which readers would have found exemplary discourse coupled with proto-fictional and amatory elements that could be enjoyed as entertainment. Understanding the varied appeals of these two books helps us fill out the larger picture relating to how vernacular literacy was valued, developed, and applied.\n      </p>", "This article focuses on the assessment of writing abilities among master of social work students. The purposes and methods of writing assessment are explored, as well as the evaluation and reporting of results. The article also summarizes results from an assessment project conducted in 2003 of 129 MSW students' writing skill. Among the findings were (a) 1 quarter of the beginning MSW students did not have adequate writing skill, (b) their major deficit was in building an essay using appropriate and sufficient details with a persuasive voice, (c) 3 factors predicted good writing skills, and, (d) 1 of these factors, \"selectivity\" of students' undergraduate college, was related to subsequent academic success at the graduate level.\n      </p>", "The emerging technology of item writing for achievement tests is reviewed. Several different approaches to item development are discussed. A continuum of item-writing methods is proposed ranging from informal-subjective methods to algorithmic-objective methods. Examples of techniques include objective-based item writing, amplified objectives, item forms, facet design, domain-referenced concept testing, and computerized techniques. Each item-writing technique is critically reviewed, and empirical studies of methods are described. Recommendations for further research and for applications to achievement testing are presented.\n      </p>", "Ethnographic analyses of political dissidence are deeply implicated in the political contests about which ethnographers write. A comparison of the authors' fieldwork among dissidents in Argentina, Kenya, and the United States reveals both the differing dynamics of contests over the political and the complex ways that ethnographers are situated within such contests. In Argentina during the last period of military rule it was dangerous to be defined as political; in Kenya, when multiparty elections were finally authorized, being recognized as political was a prerequisite for legitimacy; and in the United States, where protest is officially legal but unofficially suspect, being defined as political has advantages and disadvantages. We argue that ethnographic writing is inextricable from such contests, and we advocate more explicit attention to how anthropologists negotiate their positions during fieldwork and how they reposition themselves through their writing.\n      </p>", "We propose a series of projects for introductory data analysis classes using a single, real multivariate dataset. The assignments combine four current trends in statistics education: computers, real data, collaborative learning, and writing. Completing the project sequence allows students to appreciate and understand the interconnectedness of statistical concepts. We present rationale for the assignments including five objectives. We provide institutional and course background, an explanation of the data source and variables, grading criteria, a summary of each project, and an assessment of student learning. We conclude with a Web address to facilitate implementation of this approach.\n      </p>", "This article outlines how a theory of narrative can be used to deconstruct qualitative research texts. Although research texts are a distinct genre in comparison with works of fiction, the basic components of literary activity are similar. Researchers structure and emphasize data and participants in various ways to tell a logical story. Narrative analysis offers a specific framework and terminology that researchers can use to construct texts. Ultimately, such tools can prepare qualitative researchers to make intentional choices in regard to writing. The authors define the narratological concepts of character, plot, story, and focalization. They discuss how these concepts can be used to teach qualitative research methods.\n      </p>", "Teachers who have participated in Summer Institutes of the National Writing Project (NWP) have often claimed \"it changed my life.\" What do teachers mean when they say this? What does it mean to \"transform\" in a professional development setting and what might researchers and professional development providers gain from an understanding of teacher transformation as a kind of teacher learning? And how, if at all does the writing that teachers engage in at the Summer Institute matter for transformation? This article addresses such questions through a study of teacher participants in one NWP Summer Institute involving analysis of interview, observation, and textual data. The author offers a model of teacher transformation that highlights the influence of writing groups and feedback.\n      </p>"], "words": {"essay": {"number": 3, "prob": 2.4843794641193497e-05},
