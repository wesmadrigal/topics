{"total_words": 1462, "documents": ["A travel management programme allows an organisation to manage corporate travel expenditure, and through a well-formulated travel policy, to control its travel expenses. However, traveller non-compliance of the travel policy is an increasing area of concern with surveys conducted amongst travellers showing various reasons for non-compliance, both deliberate and unknowing. The purpose of this article is to look beyond the reasons and identify the underlying factors that influence travel policy compliance. Two broad categories of factors that lead to non-compliance are distinguished: those related to the corporate travel policy as formulated and communicated by the organisation, referred to as corporate-related factors and including issues of corporate culture and business ethics; and those related to the person of the corporate traveller, referred as personal-related factors and including issues of personal ethics. This article makes a first attempt at identifying factors that have not previously been recognised in those industry or academic studies done on non-compliance or violation of the corporate travel policy.\n      </p>", "In contrast to previous literature, we propose a consistency test that does not impose any particular common functional form for the preference structure underlying the travel cost (TC) and contingent valuation (CV) models. We derive testable consistency conditions between TC and CV data in the context of mixed demand systems when valuing changes in environmental quality. These conditions are a subset of the rationality conditions. The proposed consistency tests are implemented combining TC and CV data. The empirical results show that it is possible to combine stated TC and CV, but not revealed TC and CV data.\n      </p>", "International business travel is now an omnipresent feature of working life for many millions of people around the globe. Whatever the organizational reason, it is now the likelihood that many individuals are engaged in undertaking work outside of the formal workplace in an irregular pattern which has become an almost ordinary aspect of their working-life. Such is the magnitude of international business travel that it is now highly significant for bringing multi-million dollar expenditure to countries and the global airline and hotel sectors, and supporting an international business travel management industry. Yet, surprisingly, little has been written on the agency of international business travel, beyond vignettes of the organizational requirement for physical proximity. In this introduction (and special issue) we consider what further academic analyses of business travel must do to extend knowledge and understanding of the growth and use of travel in the twenty-first century. The article is in five parts. First, we consider the function of international business travel in firms as part of strategies to tie-together spatially distributed subsidiaries. Second, we unpack the modes and spaces of business travel. Third, we discuss the impacts of business travel on both the traveller, but also the environment. Fourth, we introduce the major arguments and contributions of the four articles in this special issue. Finally, we identify future research agendas that should develop existing theory and understanding of the compulsion for international business travel.\n      </p>", "High predation rates on bird nests located near habitat edges are often explained by the presumed use of edges as \"travel lanes\" by mammalian predators. Through repetitious and indiscriminate citing, the travel-lane concept has become dogma. I review the empirical evidence of use of habitat edges by mammals that are commonly identified as predators of bird eggs. I argue that 1) earlier works did not provide evidence that predators used edges as travel lanes, 2) strong empirical evidence that mammalian predators use edges as travel lanes is lacking, and 3) increased use of edges by predators, if it occurs, may result from several alternate processes such as greater foraging efficiency near edges or simply greater predator density or diversity. Furthermore, I caution that use of narrow and linear habitats such as fencelines and roadways by foraging or travelling predators does not constitute \"edge use\" because these habitats are too narrow to include habitat interior. Until further work confirms or refutes the use of edges by predators, caution is warranted before referring to edges acting as travel lanes for mammalian predators.\n      </p>", "Objectives\u2014Preliminary investigations of whether 10 884 staff and consultants of the World Bank experience disease due to work related travel. Medical insurance claims filed by 4738 travellers during 1993 were compared with claims of nontravellers. Methods\u2014Specific diagnoses obtained from claims were analysed overall (one or more \u03c5 no missions) and by frequency of international mission (1, 2\u20133, or \u22654). Standardised rate of claims ratios (SRRs) for each diagnostic category were obtained by dividing the age adjusted rate of claims for travellers by the age adjusted rate of claims for non-travellers, and were calculated for men and women travellers separately. Results\u2014Overall, rates of insurance claims were 80% higher for men and 18% higher for women travellers than their non-travelling counterparts. Several associations with frequency of travel were found. SRRs for infectious disease were 1.28, 1.54, and 1.97 among men who had completed one, two or three, and four or more missions, and 1.16, 1.28, and 1.61, respectively, among women. The greatest excess related to travel was found for psychological disorders. For men SRRs were 2.11, 3.13, and 3.06 and for women, SRRs were 1.47, 1.96, and 2.59. Conclusions\u2014International business travel may pose health risks beyond exposure to infectious diseases. Business travellers file medical claims at a greater rate than non-travellers, and for many categories of disease, the rate of claims increases with frequency of travel. The reasons for higher rates of claims among travellers are not well understood. Additional research on psychosocial factors, health practices, time zones crossed, and temporal relation between travel and onset of disease is planned.\n      </p>", "Understanding mechanisms influencing the movement paths of animals is essential for comprehending behavior and accurately predicting use of travel corridors. In Yellowstone National Park (USA), the effects of roads and winter road grooming on bison (Bison bison) travel routes and spatial dynamics have been debated for more than a decade. However, no rigorous studies have been conducted on bison spatial movement patterns. We collected 121 380 locations from 14 female bison with GPS collars in central Yellowstone to examine how topography, habitat type, roads, and elevation affected the probability of bison travel year-round. We also conducted daily winter bison road use surveys (2003-2005) to quantify how topography and habitat type influenced spatial variability in the amount of bison road travel. Using model comparison techniques, we found the probability of bison travel and spatial distribution of travel locations were affected by multiple topographic and habitat type attributes including slope, landscape roughness, habitat type, elevation, and distances to streams, foraging areas, forested habitats, and roads. Streams were the most influential natural landscape feature affecting bison travel, and results suggest the bison travel network throughout central Yellowstone is spatially defined largely by the presence of streams that connect foraging areas. Also, the probability of bison travel was higher in regions of variable topography that constrain movements, such as in canyons. Pronounced travel corridors existed both in close association with roads and distant from any roads, and results indicate that roads may facilitate bison travel in certain areas. However, our findings suggest that many road segments used as travel corridors are overlaid upon natural travel pathways because road segments receiving high amounts of bison travel had similar landscape features as natural travel corridors. We suggest that most spatial patterns in bison road travel are a manifestation of general spatial travel trends. Our research offers novel insights into bison spatial dynamics and provides conceptual and analytical frameworks for examining movement patterns of other species.\n      </p>", "Many research papers have presented mathematical models for vehicle scheduling. Several of these models have been embedded in commercial decision support systems for intra-city vehicle scheduling for launderies, grocery stores, banks, express mail customers, etc. Virtually all of these models ignore the important issue of time-dependent travel speeds for intra-city travel. Travel speeds (and times) in nearly all metropolitan areas change drastically during the day because of congestion in certain parts of the city road network. The assumption of constant (time-independent) travel speeds seriously affects the usefulness of these models. This is particularly true when time windows (earliest and latest stop time constraints) and other scheduling issues are important. This research proposes a parsimonious model for time-dependent travel speeds and several approaches for estimating the parameters for this model. An example is presented to illustrate the proposed modelling approach. The issue of developing algorithms to find near-optimal vehicle schedules with time-dependent travel speeds is also discussed. The modelling approach presented in this paper has been implemented in a commercial courier vehicle scheduling system and was judged to be `very useful' by users in a number of different metropolitan areas in the United States.\n      </p>", "Information technology (IT) advances often create turmoil and disturb existing industry structures. In the travel industry, electronic distribution has existed for d\u00e9cades via the global distribution Systems (GDSs), reservation Systems that were introduced in the early 1980s on mainframe platforms. Yet with the Internet, new digital intermediaries have threatened the viability of these legaey GDSs. We examine this transformation of e-travel distribution to test the theory ofnewly vulnerable markets, which predicts how markets become vulnerable to fundamental changes triggered by IT. The tenets of newly vulnerable markets theory are supported. The GDS market became newly easy to enter due to a decrease in barriers to entry caused by the Internet and other technologies, attractive to attack due to their out-of-date and inefficient pricing mechanisms, which made opportunistic pickoff possible across customer profitability gradients, and difficult to d\u00e9fend due to their lack of vision and Strategie inflexibility. We use our findings to expand the application of this theory to newly vulnerable e-markets, in general.\n      </p>", "Single wolves (Canis lupus arctos), a pair, and a pack of five habituated to the investigator on an all-terrain vehicle were followed on Ellesmere Island, Northwest Territories, Canada, during summer. Their mean travel speed was measured on barren ground at 8.7 km/h during regular travel and 10.0 km/h when returning to a den.\n      </p>", "Adventure travel is one of the fastest growing but least understood forms of international tourism. Its role in the economic development of remote world places and its impact on local society, economy, and the environment are not fully comprehended, even though adventure tourism has been adopted enthusiastically by many Third World nations. The paper analyzes adventure travel in Nepal and places it within the theoretical frameworks of tourism models and sustainable development. Building on core-periphery tourism theory, an adventure travel spatial-linkage model is proposed that connects Nepal's remote frontiers with the global tourism economy. Within this model, adventure tourists move through a hierarchy of travel gateways before reaching adventure destinations located among isolated, subsistence populations. This movement produces a unique structure of tourism space that in turn contributes to the formation in Nepal of regional developments such as hilltown gateways, hinterland tourism destinations, and multi-use parklands. An adventure tourism impact model relates tourism problems associated with exceeding social and environmental carrying capacities. It also includes more positive impacts linked to converging the interests of Nepal's national economy, indigenous populations, tourists, and conservation development. With its steady growth, adventure tourism in Nepal will play an increasingly important role for national and local development in the frontier areas.\n      </p>", "The frontier traveller, venturing out into the peripheral parts of our world such as the poles, the peaks of mountains or the great deserts, must deal with the remoteness and riskiness of the setting. The traveller is mentally apart from friends and family, and immediate rescue may be difficult, if not impossible. This article explores the attraction of remoteness, isolation and solitude for the frontier traveller, using qualitative interview and biographical data collected in a study of frontier travel experiences. Some participants referred to intense, spiritual experiences at the frontier, with the remoteness and silence of their journeys facilitating reflection, both internal and external. Isolation and solitude appear to engender a sense of freedom and escape from the cares of everyday life in the frontier traveller, while the study also highlights the attraction of self-sufficiency in remote settings, particularly during the solo frontier travel experience, where the individual is forced to make decisions and manage situations, without recourse to another's advice, skills or experience. The resultant heightened challenge and risk was perceived as a form of authenticity by some participants. The links between isolation and opportunities for self-actualization are also noted in this article. The implications of these findings for marketing tourism experiences are examined, given the potential for the peripheries to become more accessible to tourists in the future, as well as the role played by culture and privilege in these types of adventurous experiences in far-flung locations.\n      </p>", "Federal employees frequently travel to professional-development conferences and training events. Conference planners often decide on event locations arbitrarily with little regard for travel cost. We developed a method for evaluating travel costs and determining the least expensive conference site from over 261 US cities with government-contracted airfares. It involves using the relaxation method for solving the noncapacitated shortest-path-network problem and computing interairport distances using latitude and longitude data. A decision support tool called OffSite allows conference planners to assess collective travel costs for attendees arriving from geographically dispersed locations. Event planners input a list of origin cities for conference participants, and OffSite then determines the lowest-cost location. This tool can restrict the search for meeting venues to the origin locations of potential hosts for the conference. In addition, OffSite is flexible enough to allow planners to choose a preferred destination.\n      </p>", "This article presents the results of the empirical testing of the corporate travel policy compliance model conceptualised by the authors and first published in the Journal of Business Ethics in 2009. In the previous article, the theory underlying the model was explained. This article follows with the results of the empirical testing of the model and focusses on those related to the influence of personal factors on policy compliance. The constructs used to define personal-related factors include personal ethics, individual morality, self-interest, levels of job- and life satisfaction and the conditions of travel. The empirical investigation sought to determine if personal-related factors significantly influenced travel policy compliance and from the study it could be concluded that there is a correlation, with certain factors exhibiting a stronger correlation than others. The implication is that organisations need to understand the impact of factors previously ignored or under-valued as determinants of non-compliance and take steps to recognise and remedy the situation to achieve higher levels of travel policy compliance amongst corporate travellers.\n      </p>", "The influence of winter recreation on wildlife in Yellowstone National Park (YNP), Wyoming and Montana, USA, is a controversial issue. In particular, the effects of road grooming, done to facilitate snowmobile and snowcoach travel, on bison (Bison bison) ecology are under debate. We collected data during winters, from 1997 to 2005, on bison road use, off-road travel, and activity budgets to quantify temporal trends in the amount of bison road and off-road travel and to identify the ecological factors affecting bison movements and use of the groomed road system in the Madison-Gibbon-Firehole (MGF) area of YNP. Using model comparison techniques, we found bison travel patterns to be influenced by multiple, interacting effects. Road travel was negatively correlated with road grooming, and we found no evidence that bison preferentially used groomed roads during winter. Snow water equivalent, bison density, and the springtime melt period were positively correlated with both bison road and off-road travel. From behavioral scans on 68 791 bison, we found that travel is only a small percentage (11%) of all bison activity, with foraging comprising 67% of observations. Also, only 7% of traveling bison and 30% of foraging bison were displacing snow, and we suggest foraging, rather than traveling, is likely the major energetic cost to bison in winter. Bison utilize their own trail network, connecting foraging areas using stream corridors, geothermal pathways, and self-groomed travel routes. Our results indicate that temporal patterns in bison road travel are a manifestation of general travel behavior and that groomed roads in the MGF do not appear to be a major factor influencing bison ecology and spatial redistribution. We suggest that the changes in bison spatial dynamics during the past three decades have likely been the result of the natural phenomenon of density-dependent range expansion, rather than having been caused by the anthropogenic influence of road grooming.\n      </p>", "Responding to recent debates in human geography on the need to explore more complex renderings of everyday visuality, this paper explores some of the fluid relationships between everyday visuality, materiality and mobility through practices of contemporary railway travel in Britain. Based on extensive empirical research, this paper explores three different but related visual practices experienced during the course of a railway journey. First, it looks at how sublime forms of vision emerge to produce a variety of passive embodied effects. Second, it looks at how more attentive visual practices are implicated in the temporal organisation of the journey and have the capacity to activate changes to routine. Third, it looks at how the physical materiality of the carriage interior serves to mediate the visual field in particular ways and gives rise to a series of freedoms and constraints. Whilst the visual consumption of landscapes viewed through a window is often taken to be an axiomatic part of the travelling experience, this paper demonstrates the importance of apprehending how a multiplicity of visual practices affect how perceptions of time, space and location unfold over the course of a journey.\n      </p>", "Travel writing has an ancient past in China. In this article, John E. Wills ranges over the period from 500 BCE to the Manchu era, identifying the continuities and changes over that long era. Chinese travelers and those who generated accounts of journeys ventured forth for a variety of reasons shaped by political, cultural, and economic imperatives. Many Chinese travelers were drawn to Buddhist monasteries; others, including members of ruling groups, went on expeditions to gather geographical knowledge that they could then use in administering the country. By the fourteenth century the Chinese possessed perhaps the largest port in the world and the legacy of travel helped fuel economic long-distance enterprises and extensive trade, especially in Southeast Asia.\n      </p>", "Communities are traditionally built with one transportation mode and user in mind\u2014the adult automobile driver. Recently, however, there has been an international focus on the trip to school as an opportunity to enhance children's independent active travel. Several factors must be considered when designing programs to promote walking and bicycling. This paper examined the influence of child sex on caregivers' decisions about travel mode choice to school.\n         Caregivers of children in grades three to five from ten California Safe Routes to School communities were surveyed on their child's normal travel mode to school and factors that determined travel decisions. Results indicate that the odds of walking and bicycling to school are 40 percent lower in girls than boys; however, this relationship is significantly moderated by the caregiver's own walking behavior. The findings suggest that programs that focus on increasing children's active travel to school should consider multiple influences on health behavior, including the neighborhood physical activity of parents.\n      </p>", "Objectives\u2014This study investigated sources of self reported psychological stress among international business travellers at the World Bank, following up on a previous study showing that travellers submitted more insurance claims for psychological disorders. Hypotheses were that work, personal, family, and health concerns, as well as time zone travel, contribute to travel stress. Methods\u2014A travel survey was developed from focus groups and consisted of questions about these potential sources of travel stress. Surveys were sent to a random sample of staff, stratified by number of travel missions, age range, and sex. Canonical correlation analyses estimated the association between key survey items on sources of stress and two measures of travel stress. Results\u2014498 staff completed the survey. More than a third reported high to very high travel stress. Correlations between predictors and travel stress showed that social and emotional concerns (such as impact of travel on family and sense of isolation) contributed the most to such stress, followed by health concerns, and workload upon return from travel. Surprisingly, time zone travel did not contribute to the self reported stress of these travellers. There were few modifiers of stress, although respondents suggested that a day of rest after travel and reduced workloads would help. Conclusions\u2014The current study confirms clinical impressions about several correlates of travel stress. Similar research with travellers in other organisations could help to determine whether the findings from this study are valid and what measures can be taken to reduce the psychological health risks to travellers.\n      </p>", "This travel cost demand study included prices for closely related goods such as money and time costs of on-site time, on-site purchases, and other trip activities. A disequilibrium labor market model was estimated. The sample was mainly composed of persons who did not substitute earned income for leisure time. The few persons who had the capability to substitute time for money were excluded from the sample. Consumer surplus was estimated to be $69 per trip using the expanded model. A model using only the conventional travel cost variables resulted in estimated surplus per trip of $45.\n      </p>", "A travel cost demand model is derived from a utility function which postulates that individuals choose the optimal total number of site recreation days given by the product of the number and length of their recreation trips. By relaxing the assumption that on-site time is constant across recreationists, the applicability of the travel cost method is extended. The model is estimated using a maximum likelihood procedure appropriate for the truncated sample data which is characteristic of most user-specific recreation data. Failure to do so would result in overestimating the value of Great Lakes fishing by 3.5 times.\n      </p>", "The present report describes a fatal case of imported AIDS-related disseminated histoplasmosis capsulati infection associated with multiple coexisting infections, diagnosed with cultural recovery of Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum with a commercial radiometric Mycobacterium medium. The epidemiological and clinical features of histoplasmosis capsulati and duboisii in Europe are reviewed by examining also 69 documented cases of Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum infection (25 in AIDS patients) and 17 cases of Histoplasma capsulatum var. duboisii infection (3 in HIV-infected patients), described since 1980. This draws special attention to the role played during recent years by the emergence of the HIV pandemic and the progressive intensification of travel and immigration as risk factors for this disease in our continent. AIDS patients, who are prone to multiple concurrent opportunistic infections which may share clinical and laboratory features with each other and with other HIV-associated diseases, represent the most relevant current group at risk for severe disseminated histoplasmosis, which may come to medical attention far from their place of origin.\n      </p>", "Episodic memory, enabling conscious recollection of past episodes, can be distinguished from semantic memory, which stores enduring facts about the world. Episodic memory shares a core neural network with the simulation of future episodes, enabling mental time travel into both the past and the future. The notion that there might be something distinctly human about mental time travel has provoked ingenious attempts to demonstrate episodic memory or future simulation in nonhuman animals, but we argue that they have not yet established a capacity comparable to the human faculty. The evolution of the capacity to simulate possible future events, based on episodic memory, enhanced fitness by enabling action in preparation of different possible scenarios that increased present or future survival and reproduction chances. Human language may have evolved in the first instance for the sharing of past and planned future events, and, indeed, fictional ones, further enhancing fitness in social settings.\n      </p>", "The disintermediation hypothesis, or the supposition that the role of middlemen will be eliminated or reduced with the emergence of digital networks, has gathered much attention among scholars and in the business press. The information-intensive travel industry has been seen as especially interesting in terms of bypass threats, as it is an outstanding example of a sector where the position of the intermediaries\u2014the travel agencies\u2014traditionally has been strong, yet they have been seen as an unnecessary overhead by the suppliers. This paper reports on a national mail survey conducted to investigate the plausibility of the disintermediation hypothesis in travel by drawing on consumer intention data. The results indicate that nearly all Finnish Internet adopters use the Internet to look for travel-related information, but that only a small portion of the consumers has any experience with self-booking services. Nevertheless, the data reveal an intention by a significantly growing number of consumers to abandon high street travel agencies when booking holiday journeys. Approximately half of the existing and prospective Internet bookers intend to use direct distribution (disintermediating) approaches, whereas half intend to use the Internet merely as a communications channel to human travel agents, thereby primarily fostering reintermediation. The study also shows that the emergence of travel reservation services through mobile electronic channels is likely to reinforce and expedite the disintermediation phenomenon by attracting a large portion of the many non-shopping Internet users to electronic markets.\n      </p>", "Between 1826 and 1831 Anne Royall published nine volumes of travel writing, together with a volume of letters written while she was living and touring in Alabama. Frequently repetitious, often limited in their scope, and highly opinionated, these books provide an insight into American society during the 1820s from a very particular viewpoint. This paper explores this particularity. It argues that although some scholars have suggested there is an identifiable feminine perspective in female travel writing, Royall's writings do not readily match these criteria. As a consequence Royall's writings raise questions about the existing paradigms of female travel writing.\n      </p>", "Asians as well as Europeans composed travel narratives about distant lands during the early modern period. In light of current debates about the nature of \u201cmodernity,\u201d Michael H. Fisher explores in this article the first four travel accounts written by Indians about Britain intended for Indian readers, considering these authors' backgrounds, approaches, and selected content. All four authors emerged from the Persianate class of Muslim scholar-officials that struggled to maintain its sociopolitical position in the face of expanding British colonialism. While these authors recognized British technical, political, and military achievements, they also contested British assertions of cultural superiority, particularly concerning religion and gender relations.\n      </p>", "E-business is rapidly spreading in service industries. Firms that adopt this innovative way to sell or deliver services and manage customer relationships must make technological and strategic changes. Firms in the same industry adopt e-business at different rates. Why do some firms actively implement e-business, and others take a more cautious attitude? Drawing on several research streams (innovation adoption research, institutional theory, strategic orientation theory, and upper-echelon theory), this article proposes a multi-level model to explain e-business adoption by service firms. The model was empirically tested using survey and interview data from travel agencies in Taiwan. External competitive pressure, innovation orientation, financial slack, and IT resources were found to be associated with two measures of e-business adoption. CEO risk-taking propensity and firm size also had an interaction effect on e-business adoption. Interviews with CEOs indicate that most travel agencies in Taiwan are not yet ready to apply mobile technologies in their daily business. The slow progress of mobile e-business was largely attributed to the limited capacity of mobile devices and the misfit between travel product characteristics, consumer behavior, and current mobile solutions.\n      </p>", "Travel accounts of the Reconstruction U.S. South (1865-1880) played a formative role in the process of determining where the region fit within the nation-state after the Civil War. Postbellum travel narratives by northern men and women, in particular, dealt with the South's contradictory placement as both an occupied territory of the North/nation and part of the national body itself through a discourse of imperialism that translated a North-South regional binary into a colonizer-colonized distinction and framed the South as an imperial holding of the U.S. This article uses postcolonial studies and postcolonial geographies of North America to examine three textual themes that sustained this imperial framing of the South within northern travel narratives: discourses of civilization, descriptions of nature, and discussions of whiteness. The first two themes bolstered northern travelers' positioning of the South as an imperial holding, although gender contoured how northern travelers participated in a civilizing mission directed toward newly emancipated African Americans and how easily these travelers assumed the role of imperial explorer in rural and marginal southern sites. By contrast, white rural poverty in the postbellum South, through its simultaneous racial similarity to and class difference from white northern travelers, problematized a clean separation of North from South and highlighted the imperfections and contradictions of the postbellum South as an imperial holding of the North/nation. This article argues for more critical attention to the production of southern difference in the mid-nineteenth century and the postbellum South's place in relation to future American imperial projects.\n      </p>", "Thomas De Quincey's essay, 'The English Mail-Coach', is a unique and richly-textured meditation on the means and meanings of travel in the early nineteenth century. The opposition it sets up between pre-industrial and industrial forms of transport is inherently unstable, and its lament for the golden age of coach travel is complicated by the fact that De Quincey's mail-coach itself symbolizes the social and historical forces that brought about its demise. Exemplary of Romantic resistance to industrial culture, the essay's progressive withdrawal into purely intrapsychic self-transportation also offers a limit case of the Romantic internalization of the travel genre.\n      </p>", "The worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) raised questions about the risk of importation of such infection, in particular by air travel. Entry screening was implemented in some countries although poor evidence on its effectiveness is reported. We developed a model to estimate the number of imported SARS cases between regions, using the 2003 SARS epidemic data to apply this model for two scenarios: from Beijing to Frankfurt and from Hong Kong to London. We back-calculated the data to estimate individuals' time of infection and built a model where every individual has a probability of being isolated, of traveling, and of being undetected at arrival. The findings, consistent with what was observed in 2003, suggest that entry screening does not affect the predicted number of imported cases. Inversely, importation depends on the transmission dynamic in the country of origin (including control measures in place) and on the intensity of air travel between regions.\n      </p>", "This paper empirically illustrates how different assumptions regarding recreationists' decision-making behavior affect the predicted changes in recreational activity given a water quality improvement. A multinomial logit model, which reallocates visits away from other sites to the improved site, predicts a smaller outward shift of the recreationist's demand curve than the more traditional travel cost model, which does not assume any reallocation of visits among sites.\n      </p>", "1. The feeding rates of many predators and parasitoids exhibit type II functional responses, with a decelerating rate of increase to reach an asymptotic value as the density of their prey or hosts increases. Holling's disc equation describes such relationships and predicts that the asymptotic feeding rate at high prey densities is set by handling time, while the rate at which feeding rate increases with increased prey density is determined by searching efficiency. Searching efficiency and handling time are also parameters in other models which describe the functional response. Models which incorporate functional responses in order to make predictions of the effects of food shortage thus rely upon a clear understanding and accurate quantification of searching efficiency and handling time. 2. Blackbird Turdus merula exhibit a type II functional response and use pause-travel foraging, a foraging technique in which animals search for prey while stationary and then move to capture prey. Pause-travel foraging allows accurate direct measurement of feeding rate and both searching efficiency and handling time. We use Blackbirds as a model species to: (i) compare observed measures of both searching efficiency and handling time with those estimated by statistically fitting the disc equation to the observed functional response; and (ii) investigate alternative measures of searching efficiency derived by the established method where search area is assumed to be circular and a new method that we propose where it is not. 3. We find that the disc equation can adequately explain the functional response of blackbirds feeding on artificial prey. However, this depends critically upon how searching efficiency is measured. Two variations on the previous method of measuring search area (a component of searching efficiency) overestimated searching efficiency, and hence predicted feeding rates higher than those observed. Two variations of our alternative approach produced lower estimates of searching efficiency, closer to that estimated by fitting the disc equation, and hence more accurately predicted feeding rate. Our study shows the limitations of the previous method of measuring searching efficiency, and describes a new method for measuring searching efficiency more accurately.\n      </p>", "This study examines the distances traveled for inpatient obstetrics care by women residing in rural Alabama in 1983 and 1988. During that time 23 rural hospitals in the state stopped providing obstetrics services and mean travel distances increased by 6.8 miles. However, in 1988 50% of rural pregnant women bypassed the nearest rural hospital still providing obstetrics services. Multivariate techniques are used to examine the effects of distance and service offerings of rural hospitals and their substitutes on the actual distance traveled for care. Patient characteristics are also considered. The most important finding is that a 5% increase in per capita income in the woman's home county is associated with a 20% increase in actual travel distance, other things equal. Implications for rural health policy are discussed.\n      </p>", "In this article, Julie F. Codell examines the rhetorical turns and themes of travel accounts written in the late nineteenth century by Indian travelers to Europe, demonstrating how their \u201cguest\u201d narratives structured comparisons between Britain and India in particular, comparisons that at once sublimated and remained invisible to imperial power relationships. The essay shows the way in which these travelers \u201cwrote back\u201d to the genre of travel accounts by appropriating, reversing, and ironizing its conventions\u2014including its ethnographic posture, the aristocratic Grand Tour, and the celebration of hospitality\u2014as well as its specific vocabulary. Seeing Britain as at once utopia and dystopia, these writers projected an empowering atopia, which allowed them to imagine the future of India.\n      </p>", "A model is developed to determine travel times between points in an urban area with a limited amount of input. The model uses a network consisting of grid shaped links and high speed, freeway links. The travel time over the grid shaped links is computed internally using a macroscopic description of travel velocities and paths. A minimum time algorithm is applied to the network to find the minimum travel times between all points in the network. A test of the procedure showed that the results of the grid travel time model closely agreed with travel times produced by the standard detailed network method. The grid model uses substantially less input and performs its computations in a very short period of time. It is possible to develop a model that closely agrees with the detailed network model with even greater simplification. The procedure developed seems to have promise for a number of applications in the transportation planning process.\n      </p>", "In order to control for censoring and the integer nature of trip demand, the use of count data models in travel cost analysis is attractive. Two such models, the Poisson and negative binomial, are discussed. Robust estimation techniques that loosen potentially stringent distributional assumptions are also reviewed.

While travelers--be they businesspeople, politicians, or diplomats--can testify to the problems that being on the road may bring, a systematic discussion of this issue is necessary. None of the current models of occupational stress address this concern, and organizations have generally not effectively prepared their employees to withstand this stress. This article reviews the concept of travel stress among business executives, including the sources and the potential impact of stress before, during, and after travel. We offer both organizational and individual interventions for preventing and coping with the kinds of problems that often result from traveling on business domestically and internationally.\n      </p>", "More and more air travel is travel for leisure and this has major implications for sustainable mobility and for the environment. Here aspects of the leisure and air travel industries are examined in relation to their resource consumption and impacts.

Facility users are distributed over a finite set of demand points, with the weight of each point proportional to its demand intensity. Each demand point is assigned to the closest facility. The objective is to locate facilities so as to minimize average Manhattan travel distance to a random demand. We show that an optimal set of facility locations can be drawn from a finite set of candidate points, all of which are easy to determine.\n      </p>", "This paper considers the role that physical, corporeal travel plays in social life. There is a large and increasing scale of such travel. This increase has occurred simultaneously with the proliferation of communication devices that in some ways substitute for physical travel. I hypothesize that the bases of such travel are new ways in which social life is 'networked'. Such increasingly extensive networks, hugely extended through the informational revolution, depend for their functioning upon intermittent occasioned meetings. These moments of physical copresence and face-to-face conversation, are crucial to patterns of social life that occur 'at-a-distance', whether for business, leisure, family life, politics, pleasure or friendship. So life is networked but it also involves specific co-present encounters within specific times and places. 'Meetingness', and thus different forms and modes of travel, are central to much social life, a life involving strange combinations of increasing distance and intermittent co-presence. The paper seeks to examine the place of travel within the emergent pattern of a 'networked sociality'. It seeks to contribute to the emerging 'mobility turn' within the social sciences.\n      </p>", "The trip/visit variable in the individual travel cost method is often regarded as discrete. Furthermore, it is often reported in surveys as a grouped variable (the number of visits reported falling into one of several classes). This paper develops a travel cost model which takes account of discreteness and grouping in both demand and benefit estimation. A case study and associated simulations are then reported which indicate the potential extent of bias that may arise from ignoring discreteness/grouping in demand and benefit estimation. The information loss involved in varying the size of visit classes is also examined.\n      </p>", "This study concerns travel times in a stochastic network in which units move among the nodes that process the units. The network may be closed or open, there may be several types of units and the processing at each node may depend on the numbers of units at the other nodes. This is a Jackson network when the nodes operate independently. The travel time on a \"route\" in this network is the time it takes for an arbitrary unit to traverse one of a series of nodes that constitute the route, when the network is in equilibrium. An example is the time for a unit to move from one set of nodes to another. We present an expression for the expectation of a general travel time. We also characterize the distribution of the travel time, and the sojourn times at the nodes, on an overtake-free path. This includes the known results on the product-form distribution of sojourn times at the nodes on overtake-free paths in Jackson networks.\n      </p>", "Patients with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) are often described as having impaired ability for planning and decision making despite retaining intact capacities for explicit reasoning. The somatic marker hypothesis is that the VMPFC associates implicitly represented affective information with explicit representations of actions or outcomes. Consequently, when the VMPFC is damaged explicit reasoning is no longer scaffolded by affective information, leading to characteristic deficits. These deficits are exemplified in performance on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) in which subjects with VMPFC perform significantly worse than neurotypicals in a task which requires them learn from rewarding and punishing experience to make decisions. The somatic marker theory adopts a canonical theory of emotion, in which emotions function as part of a valencing system, to explain the role of affective processes. The first part of the paper argues against this canonical account. The second part provides a different account of the role of the role of the VMPFC in decision-making which does not depend on the canonical account of emotion. Together the first and second parts of the paper provide the basis for a different interpretation of results on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). In fact the IGT may be probing a deficit in what has been called mental time travel: the ability to access and use information from previous experience and imaginatively rehearse future experiences as part of the process of deliberation.\n      </p>", "For migratory species, duration of migration, or \u201ctravel time,\u201d is often a critical variable in determining the cost of migration. Observed travel times are the result of both environmental factors such as air or water currents and the behavior of individuals. In an effort to distinguish among these components, I developed a migration model based on an advection\u2010diffusion equation that characterizes population movements in terms of two biologically meaningful parameters: migration rate and rate of population spread. I applied the model to travel time data from juvenile chinook salmon (Onchorhynchus tshawytscha), which were tagged during their seaward migration. The tagged fish originated from three separate evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) as classified by the U. S. National Marine Fisheries Service. The model was expanded by allowing migration and diffusion rates to vary with fish length and river flow. Variability in travel times explained by these factors was strikingly similar from year to year within ESUs, and the migratory behavior revealed by the analysis was consistent with the life\u2010history patterns that distinguish the ESUs. The approach presented here is easily adaptable to a wide range of migratory species and may be particularly useful for predicting how at\u2010risk populations respond to variable conditions in regulated or otherwise disturbed migration habitats.\n      </p>", "We consider the placement (location and orientation) of a single finite-size (finite-area, arbitrary shape) facility in the plane under the assumption that all travel occurs according to the rectilinear (or Manhattan) metric in the presence of impenetrable barriers to travel. Facility users are distributed over a finite set of demand points. The facility serves the users via a service point (server) located on the boundary of the facility. We consider an interactive model in the sense that there is interaction between not only the facility and the users, but also among the users themselves. We identify the candidates for optimal placement(s) for a facility with a fixed orientation and then for a facility with a fixed server location. Finally, we present a heuristic for the solution of the general problem, when the location and orientation are both unknown.\n      </p>", "This work deals with the problem of traffic assignment with a nonlinear travel-time function. The nonlinear travel-time function makes it possible to simulate congestion on urban streets in a more realistic manner. The optimal traffic assignment pattern is obtained by using a variational technique for a multicopy network problem with nonlinear travel-time functions and turn penalties.\n      </p>", "This paper examines travel visa restrictions in 188 countries. We measure travel visa requirements (1) facing foreign visitors into a given country and (2) facing citizens of a given nation traveling abroad. Our analysis shows that countries are more likely to impose visas on foreign visitors when they are large, but less likely when they are rich and economically free. Citizens from richer and more populous countries face fewer travel visa requirements when traveling abroad. Countries are less likely to impose visa requirements on similar nations.\n      </p>", "Models of prey choice in depleting patches predict an expanding specialist strategy: Animals should start as specialists on the most profitable prey and then at some point during patch exploitation switch to a generalist foraging strategy. When patch residence time is long, the switch to a generalist diet is predicted to occur earlier than when patch residence time is short. We tested these predictions under laboratory conditions using female parasitoids (Aphidius colemani) exploiting patches of mixed instars aphid hosts (Myzus persicae, L1 and L4). The duration of patch exploitation was manipulated by changing travel time between patches. As predicted, patch residence times increase with travel time between patches. Our results provide empirical support for the expanding specialist prediction: Parasitoid females specialized initially on the more profitable hosts (L4), and as the patch depleted, they switched to a generalist diet by accepting more frequently the less profitable hosts (L1). The point at which they switched from specialist to generalist occurred later when travel times and hence patch residence times were short. By affecting the patch exploitation strategy, travel time also determines the composition of hosts left behind, the \"giving up composition.\" The change in the relative density of remaining host types alters aphid populations' age structure.\n      </p>", "Over the past ten years, Rosenbluth Travel has grown from a regional travel agency with $40 million in annual sales to one of the five largest travel agencies in the United States, with sales of $1.3 billion. Their strategy was based on exploiting the structural changes initiated by airline deregulation in 1978, including growth of the corporate travel market and increasing economies of scale leading to consolidation. Information technology (IT) was a fundamental part of this strategy. The case sheds light on several theories on gaining competitive advantage through IT; these theories feature technology leadership, leveraging critical resources, the role of IT infrastructure, and switching costs. While these theories contribute to an explanation of Rosenbluth's success, a critical factor appears to be the vision to see an opportunity and the ability to hustle to exploit it.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The river also is used for transportation of hazardous chemicals and petroleum products, and is the receiving stream for wastewater effluents from numerous industries and municipalities. To minimize the public's risk from contaminant spills and accidental discharges, drinking water providers need timely warning of approaching contaminants. Based on a modified plug-flow (MPF) formulation, a time-of-travel model has been developed to provide projections of the time of arrival, peak arrival time, time of passage, and duration of contaminant spills on the Mississippi River. Estimates of the peak concentrations of contaminants passing downstream locations are calculated from spill mass, discharge, and calculated duration. The model used for this research was calibrated using dye time-of-travel studies. The primary objective of this model is to facilitate the timely warning of drinking water providers. Additionally, this model may be of value in other water quality management applications, including contingency planning, impact assessment, monitoring, enforcement, and surveillance.\n      </p>", "Have women's travel needs risen as a result of their increased employment? Is their traditional gender-role affecting their travel mobility and activity opportunities? What does the future hold?\n      </p>", "Despite the hypothesized propensity for shirking to mark legislative institutions, the evidence is rather equivocal; moreover, most of the research has focused exclusively on legislator voting, thereby constraining whatever generalizations might emerge. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the debate over the question of political shirking by extending the range of phenomena examined to include congressional foreign travel. Our analysis provides evidence that opportunism is a problem in Congress. We find that last-period problems have arisen in the area of foreign travel, and that increased scrutiny to the problem on the part of Congress only shifted consumption patterns, i.e., legislators began taking foreign junkets near, but not at the end of, their legislative careers. Not all foreign travel should be construed as worthless junketing since there is strong evidence that some foreign travel is related to members' responsibilities on congressional committees.\n      </p>", "Der Beitrag pr\u00e4sentiert theoretische \u00dcberlegungen und einen \u00dcberblick \u00fcber vorliegende empirische Erkenntnisse eines Forschungsfeldes, das sich gegenw\u00e4rtig in der Verkehrsforschung abzeichnet und in dem Verkehrsgeographen eine prominente Rolle spielen.

This research field deals with the development of travel demand over the life course of individuals. This process is referred to as 'mobility biographies'. It is embedded into the context of other 'partial biographies', namely residential biography, employment biography, and household biography. The hypothesis is that travel demand on an individual level is relatively stable in the medium term, but changes singnificantly in the context of certain key events in the life course. Such key events include, among others, residential location changes, workplace changes, and the birth of children. The paper concludes with some methodological considerations and the identification of research requirements.\n      </p>", "Foraging animals usually keep track of how costly it is to reach new resource patches and adjust patch residence time and exploitation rate accordingly. There are at least two potential factors, which are not necessarily closely linked, that animals could measure to estimate costs of traveling: the time the forager needs to reach the next patch and the amount of energy it has to invest until arrival. In the parasitoid wasp Venturia canescens, females forage for hosts from which their offspring can develop. Two different types of this parasitoid exist. The thelytokous type lives in anthropogenic habitats where flight is not necessarily linked with foraging. The arrhenotokous type lives under field conditions and shows frequent flight activity. We tested whether the wasps would use time or energy needed to assess patch availability, by either confining them into vials or letting them travel actively in a flight mill between patch visits. Our results show that in thelytokous lines, time is a sufficient cue influencing patch exploitation and an additional effect of the energy needed was not visible. In the arrhenotokous wasps, however, only the number of rounds flown in the mill influenced subsequent behavior, while mere time spent traveling did not.\n      </p>", "This article uses research on business air travel to study the external linkages of clusters. Using a typology of travellers (from commuters, explorers, and nomads to visiting tradesmen and missionaries) we show how elements of the cluster have more complex external connections than proposed by most of the cluster research literature. Maintaining these linkages involves hyper-mobility of individuals. We explore the implications of such continued physical travel for understandings of the workplace, for work-life balance and for citizenship. We conclude by warning against any one-dimensional understanding of the relationships.\n      </p>", "To assess the prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) in future travellers, all visitors to the Zurich University Vaccination Center in July/August 1990 were invited to participate in a cross-sectional study. A total of 1126 future travellers were recruited to have a blood sample drawn and to complete a brief questionnaire. Among these, 35 refused or were excluded, thus 1091 were evaluated. The overall prevalence of anti-HAV was 16.5%. This rate was 5.9% in future travellers born in or after 1961, 11.8% in those born 1951-60, 21.4% in those born 1941-50 and exceeded 49% in all decades born in or before 1940. Risk factors for significantly elevated anti-HAV rates were place of birth or a stay exceeding one year in tropical, subtropical or Southern European countries and travel for occupational reasons. Compared with findings from earlier surveys conducted mainly among blood donors in Switzerland and elsewhere in Europe, the results of the present study show lower anti-HAV prevalence rates. In conclusion, it seems unnecessary to test future travellers for anti-HAV except if they are born before 1944, or have a history of jaundice or of prolonged stay in the tropics, subtropics or in Southern Europe.\n      </p>", "Instead of observable prices of recreational visits, travel cost method (TCM) researchers are obliged to substitute researcher-assigned visitation cost estimates. I argue that visitation costs are inherently subjective, but are ordinally measurable so long as the cost increases with distance travelled. It follows that traditional TCM yields only ordinally measurable welfare estimates. The household production function formulation of TCM \"resolves\" this problem only by imposing severe and untestable analytical restrictions. TCM cannot serve as a stand-alone technique for estimating recreation benefits; rather, it must be calibrated using information generated with fundamentally different methods.\n      </p>", "Charnov's marginal value theorem predicts that female parasitoids should exploit patches of their hosts until their instantaneous rate of fitness gain reaches a marginal value. The consequences of this are that: (1) better patches should be exploited for a longer time; (2) as travel time between patches increases, so does the patch residence time; and (3) all exploited patches should be reduced to the same level of profitability. Patch residence time was measured in an egg parasitoid Anaphes victus (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) when patch quality and travel time, approximated here as an increased delay between emergence and patch exploitation, varied. As predicted, females stayed longer when patch quality and travel time increased. However, the marginal value of fitness gain when females left the patch increased with patch quality and decreased with travel time. A. victus females appear to base their patch quality estimate on the first patch encountered rather than on a fixed innate estimate, as was shown for another egg parasitoid Trichogramma brassicae. Such a strategy could be optimal when intergenerational variability in patch quality is high and within-generational variability is low.\n      </p>", "This paper extends the limits-to-value model of Davern and Kauffman to explore market and process-level factors that impact value flows to firms for their information technology (IT) investments. We characterize IT value in terms of potential value and realized value, and show how each is subject to different effects\u2014limits to value\u2014 that diminish the benefits of the investment. Our typology identifies barriers specific to the valuation process (industry and organizational barriers), and to the conversion process (resource, knowledge and usage barriers). Following the development of our analytical framework from existing economic and organizational theories of IT valuation and technology adoption and diffusion, we analyze a series of case studies of Internet-based travel reservation systems in electronic commerce (EC). These cases provide evidence in support of the usefulness of the framework, and illustrate the extent of the difficulties faced by organizations in making their investments in EC systems pay off.\n      </p>", "The expansion of global air travel and seaborne trade overcomes geographic barriers to insect disease vectors, enabling them to move great distances in short periods of time. Here we apply a coupled human-environment framework to describe the historical spread of Aedes albopictus, a competent mosquito vector of 22 arboviruses in the laboratory. We contrast this dispersal with the relatively unchanged distribution of Anopheles gambiae and examine possible future movements of this malaria vector. We use a comprehensive database of international ship and aircraft traffic movements, combined with climatic information, to remap the global transportation network in terms of disease vector suitability and accessibility. The expansion of the range of Ae. albopictus proved to be surprisingly predictable using this combination of climate and traffic data. Traffic volumes were more than twice as high on shipping routes running from the historical distribution of Ae. albopictus to ports where it has established in comparison with routes to climatically similar ports where it has yet to invade. In contrast, An. gambiae has rarely spread from Africa, which we suggest is partly due to the low volume of sea traffic from the continent and, until very recently, a European destination for most flights.\n      </p>", "Among the many British women abroad in the late nineteenth century were a number of travellers who toured the American West with a naturalist's pen and sketchbook. California, with its giant sequoias and redwoods, scenic Yosemite Valley and Sierra Nevada, and the Mediterranean flora of the southern coasts, especially attracted travellers with a naturalist orientation. We examine the botanical and naturalist writings and art of two well-known (and well-heeled) world travellers - Constance Gordon Cumming and Marianne North - and another more obscure British aristocrat, Theodora Guest, sister of the Duke of Westminster, who travelled in California in the late nineteenth century. We examine relationships among these elite women's association with the Romantic aesthetic and naturalist traditions, natural sciences, class-based associations between women and flowers, and emergent environmentalism. The works of these women indicate the process by which natural history rhetorics and styles became embedded within gender, class, and imperial relations; and how the division of natural history into professional and amateur domains relegated women to discursive margins.\n      </p>", "This paper considers the role of travel in the generation of geographical knowledge of the eastern bloc by British geographers. Based on oral history and surveys of published work, the paper examines the roles of three kinds of travel experience: individual private travels, tours via state tourist agencies, and tours by academic delegations. Examples are drawn from across the eastern bloc, including the USSR, Poland, Romania, East Germany and Albania. The relationship between travel and publication is addressed, notably within textbooks, and in the Geographical Magazine. The study argues for the extension of accounts of cultures of geographical travel, and seeks to supplement the existing historiography of Cold War geography.\n      </p>", "Omitting substitute prices from a travel cost model is shown to cause a significant bias in consumer surplus estimates. Three sets of travel cost models are developed from a common data base representing 60,000 day-users of U.S. Army Corps of Engineer reservoirs in Kansas and Missouri. The first set of models omitted substitute prices; the latter two sets included them. An analysis of variance test showed that consumer surplus estimates from the first set of models were significantly higher than the other two (F = 26.2 with 2, 20 degrees of freedom). The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.\n      </p>", "The variability of travel times on a given route for a particular journey is known to be an important factor in influencing the choice of mode and route for trips, particularly for those trip types where constraints may exist on arrival time at the destination. Previous work in this area has concentrated on daily variability for journeys by private car. This paper describes some results obtained from a study of travel time reliability for a work trip using two alternative and directly comparable public transport modes, bus and underground rail (metro), in Paris, France. Data were collected to permit the study of the distributions of variations in daily travel times, relationships between measures of variation and congestion, and to compare the characteristics of the two modes. It was found, for instance, that while the bus offered a potentially quicker and more direct service in terms of its free travel time and route location, in practice the metro provided a faster and more reliable service under normal operating conditions. The results of the study confirm and extend earlier work, and some areas for further research are suggested.\n      </p>", "To characterize the association between county-level risk factors and the incidence of mumps in the 2006 Iowa outbreak, we used generalized linear mixed models with the number of mumps cases per county as the dependent variable. To assess the impact of spring-break travel, we tested for differences in the proportions of mumps cases in three diff\u00e9rent \u00e2ge groups. In the final multivariable model, the proportion of Iowa's college students per county was positively associated (P&lt; 00001) with mumps cases, but the number of colleges was negatively associated with cases (P = 00002). Thus, if the college students in a county were spread among more campuses, this was associated with fewer mumps cases. Finally, we found the proportion of mumps cases in both older and younger persons increased after 1 April (P= 00029), suggesting that spring-break college travel was associated with the spread of mumps to other age groups.\n      </p>", "Objectives: Spouses and staff of the World Bank Group (WBG) were questioned about the impact of international business travel on families and travellers. Dependent variables were self reported stress, concern about the health of the traveller, and negative impact on the family. We hypothesised that several travel factors (independent variables) would be associated with these impacts. These travel factors had to do with the frequency, duration, and predictability of travel and its interference with family activities. Methods: Survey forms were developed and distributed to all spouses of travelling staff as well as a small sample of operational staff. Kendall's tau b correlation coefficients of response frequencies were computed with the data from scaled items. Written responses to open ended questions were categorised. Results: Response rates for spouses and staff were 24% and 36%, respectively. Half the spouse sample (n=533) and almost 75% of the staff sample (n=102) reported high or very high stress due to business travel. Self reported spouse stress was associated with six out of eight travel factors. Female spouses, those with children, and younger spouses reported greater stress. Self reported staff stress was significantly associated with four out of nine travel factors. Further insight into how business travel affects families and staff (including children's behavioural changes) and how families cope was gained through responses to written questions. Conclusions: The findings support the notion that lengthy and frequent travel and frequent changes in travel dates which affect family plans, all characteristic of WBG missions, negatively affects many spouses and children (particularly young children) and that the strain on families contributes significantly to the stress staff feel about their travel. Policies or management practices that take into consideration family activities and give staff greater leeway in controlling and refusing travel may help relieve stress.\n      </p>", "The paper studies the problem of predicting traffic equilibrium (TE) in a transportation network within the framework of decision making among discrete choices in a probabilistic and uncertain environment. Conventional approaches to predict TE typically assume that travel times are deterministic and perceived accurately by the travelers; and some new TE models have considered probabilistic travel times or inaccurate perceptions but not both. In our generalized model, which we refer to as GTESP, the travel time on each route is random and each traveler perceives, possibly inaccurately, a travel time probability distribution for each route which may vary from traveler to traveler. Each traveler uses a disutility function of travel time to evaluate each route and chooses that route which minimizes his expected disutility. GTESP is difficult to solve for general nonlinear disutility functions. However, special cases\u2014in particular when arc travel times are statistically independent and the disutility functions to evaluate route travel times are linear, exponential, or quadratic\u2014are solvable, at least approximately. GTESP is general in the sense that most existing TE models can be shown to be special or limiting cases of GTESP. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates, with illustrative examples, that GTESP appears to capture travelers' risk-taking behavior more realistically than existing TE models.\n      </p>", "This study examines the use of travel incentives as motivators for a commission only life insurance sales force in the United Kingdom.

A flexible and integrated approach to the analysis of daily urban travel-activity behavior as a complex phenomenon is described. The methodology incorporates systematic identification of classes of similar daily travel-activity patterns and the evaluation and interpretation of these groups. The approach described here comprises three stages; namely, transformation, group formation, and cluster interpretation and evaluation. In the first stage, raw input data describing the daily travel-activity patterns of a sample of individuals is transformed into a set of points in a real Euclidean space, where each point represents a daily travelactivity pattern. In the second stage, a cluster analysis algorithm is employed to identify groups of similar daily travel-activity patterns. In the third stage, the identified groups are interpreted by defining representative patterns for each group. Classifications produced by the methodology can be used to analyze and model relationships between daily travel-activity behavior and potential explanatory variables.\n      </p>", "Consider n items located randomly on a circle of length 1. The locations of the items are assumed to be independent and uniformly distributed on [0, 1). A picker starts at point 0 and has to collect all n items by moving along the circle at unit speed in either direction. In this paper we study the minimal travel time of the picker. We obtain upper bounds and analyze the exact travel time distribution. Further, we derive closed-form limiting results when n tends to infinity. We determine the behavior of the limiting distribution in a positive neighborhood of zero. The limiting random variable is closely related to exponential functionals associated with a Poisson process. These functionals occur in many areas and have been intensively studied in recent literature.\n      </p>", "The field of travel medicine is concerned primarily with ways to maintain the health of international travelers.

We examined the movements of 10 female and 7 male cougars (Puma concolor) at 15-min intervals during 44 nocturnal or diel periods of hunting or traveling in the Santa Ana Mountain Range of southern California, USA, between 1988 and 1992. Cougars tended to move in a meandering path (mean turning angle \u223c54\u00b0), and distance moved (mean and mode \u223c300 m) was not correlated with turning angle. Cougars used a broader range of habitats for nocturnal or diel movements than for previously described daybed locations for this same population. Riparian vegetation ranked highest in a compositional analysis of vegetation types selected during movement; grassland, woodland and urbanized sites were least selected. During periods of stasis (we presume many of these were stalking locations), patterns of selection were less marked. Cougars spent a disproportionate amount of time in highly ranked vegetation types, and traveled slowest through riparian habitats and fastest through human-dominated areas. Our results suggest that travel speed may provide an efficient index of habitat selection in concert with other types of analysis. Hunting or traveling individuals consistently used travel paths that were less rugged than their general surroundings. Traveling cougars avoided 2-lane paved roads, but dirt roads may have facilitated movement. Maintenance and restoration of corridors between large wildlands is essential to conserving cougars in southern California. Our results indicate that riparian vegetation, and other vegetation types that provide horizontal cover, are desirable features in such corridors, that dirt roads should not impede cougar use of corridors, and that corridors should lie along routes with relatively gentle topography. Our results suggest that cougars do not key in on highway-crossing structures in a way that creates a prey trap. Our empirical frequency distributions of distances and turning angles, along with cougar responses to vegetation, topography, and roads can help parameterize an individually-based movement model for cougars in human-altered landscapes.\n      </p>", "This paper examines some of the geographical dimensions of domestic tourism in Sweden through a regional analysis of domestic travel patterns using data from the 1994 Travel and Tourism Data Base (TDB). Spatial variations in purpose of trip--visits to friends and relatives and to second homes, leisure travel and business travel--are analysed on an origin-destination basis for 31 regions, primarily through the use of ternary graphs, dominant flow analysis and the derivation of Relative Acceptance Indexes. The Swedish patterns and results generally follow those found in earlier studies which underline the importance of distance, population and the geography of the country concerned but noticeable differences were identified according to trip purpose. Distance, especially as indicated by the prominence of intra-regional flows and the RA Index values, was shown to be important for each trip purpose but moreso with regard to VFR/SH travel than business trips while leisure travel constitutes an intermediate case. Population size was also a critical factor but less important for business trips than for VFR/SH travel and leisure travel. A basic east-west division of the country was found in terms of origins and destinations but important differences occurrred by purpose of trip, particularly where business travel was concerned. Regional biases were also evident in the dominant destination flows for leisure and business travel but to markedly different regions, further demonstrating the need to disaggregate domestic travel.\n      </p>", "The objective of this research is to explore what would happen if the Hong Kong influenza pandemic strain of 1968-1969 returned in 2000. We report the results of a series of simulations of an SEIR epidemic model coupled with air transportation data for 52 global cities. Preliminary results suggest that if the 1968-1969 pandemic strain returned, it would spread concurrently to cities in both the northern and southern hemispheres thereby exhibiting less of the characteristic seasonal swing. In addition, after recognition of pandemic onset in the focal city, the time lag for public health intervention is very short. These findings highlight the importance of coordinated global surveillance and pandemic planning.\n      </p>", "Knowing how far away animals can detect food has important consequences for understanding their foraging and social behaviors. As part of a broader set of field experiments on primate foraging behavior, we set out artificial feeding platforms (90 \u00d7 90 cm or 50 \u00d7 50 cm) throughout the home range of one group of 22 brown capuchin monkeys, at sites where they had not seen such platforms previously. Whenever the group approached such a new platform to within 100 m, we recorded the group's direction and speed of approach, and the identity and distance from the platform of the group member that detected the platform or came closest to it without detecting it. We used logistic regression on these data to examine the effects of group movement speed, platform size and height, and focal individual age and sex on the probability of detecting the platform as a function of distance. Likelihood of detecting a platform decreased significantly at greater distances - the probability of detecting a platform reached 0.5 at 41 m from the group's center and 25.5 m from the nearest group member. These results show that detectability of platforms by the entire group (9 adults, 13 juveniles) was less than twice that for single group members. Detectability at a given distance decreased severely as the group moved faster; at their fastest speed, individuals had to approach a platform to within less than 10 m to find it. The large platforms were significantly more likely to be detected than the small ones, suggesting that increased use of larger food patches by wild primates may not necessarily reflect foraging preferences.\n      </p>", "Deciding to embark upon a travel reduction policy is only the start of a process. The path to realization of policies is not necessarily straightforward, as there may be a gap between policy intentions and behavioural outcomes, and there may be barriers which affect implementation. From consideration of a series of case studies it is possible to identify the nature of potential pitfalls and barriers. Awareness of these can assist in better policy making.\n      </p>", "This paper introduces the problem of finding the least expected travel time path between two nodes in a network with travel times that are both random and time-dependent (e.g., a truck, rail, air or bus network). It first shows that standard shortest path algorithms (such as the Dijkstra algorithm) do not find the minimum expected travel time path on such a network, then proposes a method which does find the minimum path. Next, this paper shows that the optimal \"route choice\" is not a simple path but an adaptive decision rule. The best route from any given node to the final destination depends on the arrival time at that node. Because the arrival time is not known before departing the origin, a better route can be selected by deferring the final choice until later nodes are reached. A method for finding the optimal adaptive decision rule is proposed.\n      </p>", "Hoarding strategies range between scatterhoarding (small multiple hoards) and larderhoarding (large single hoard). We hypothesized that spatial distribution of food affects hoarding strategy of 2 nocturnal psammophilic rodents, Gerbillus pyramidum and G. allenbyi. We used a modular arena to test the prediction that hoarding strategy would tend toward scatterhoarding as travel distance during foraging increases. We manipulated travel distance and studied its effect on hoarding behavior. G. allenbyi, as predicted, tended to scatterhoard as travel distance increased. G. pyramidum, however, reacted to changes in travel distance by moving the location of its larderhoard but did not scatterhoard. We suggest that hoarding strategy may be scale dependent and that gerbils will increase their number of hoards when energy costs of travel are sufficiently high.\n      </p>", "Objectives. For depression, this research measures the impact of travel time on visit frequency and the probability of receiving treatment in concordance with AHCPR guidelines. Methods. The medical, insurance, and pharmacy records of a community-based sample of 435 subjects with current depression were abstracted to identify those treated for depression, to determine the number of depression visits made over a 6-month period, and to ascertain whether treatment was provided in concordance with AHCPR guidelines. A Geographic Information System was used to calculate the travel time from each patient to their preferred provider. Poisson and logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the impact of travel time on visit frequency and guideline-concordance, controlling for patient casemix. Results. In the community-based sample, 106 subjects were treated for depression by 105 different preferred providers. About one-third (30.7%) were treated by a mental health specialist. One average, patients made 2.8 depression visits over the 6-month period. One-third (28.9%) of the patients received guideline-concordant treatment for depression. The average number of visits for those receiving guideline-concordant care was significantly greater than for those not receiving guideline-concordant care (P &lt; 0.01). Travel time to the preferred provider was significantly associated with making fewer visits (P &lt; 0.0001) and having a lower likelihood of receiving guideline-concordant care (P &lt; 0.05). Discussion. For depression, both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy treatment regimens require frequent provider contact to be effective. This study suggests that travel barriers may prevent rural patients from making a sufficient number of visits to receive effective guideline-concordant treatment.\n      </p>", "Models and algorithms for vehicle routing are usually based on known constant travel times between all relevant locations, an assumption that is far from reality, particularly for urban areas. But the consideration of travel times that vary with the time of day poses two serious problems: the adaptation of the algorithms and the procurement of reliable data about the behavior of the travel times in the road network. This article describes the derivation of travel time data from modern traffic information systems. It presents a general framework for the implementation of time-varying travel times in various vehicle-routing algorithms. Finally, it reports on computational tests with travel time data obtained from a traffic information system in the city of Berlin.\n      </p>", "Recent emphasis on the growth in overseas arrivals has overshadowed domestic tourism which, nevertheless, remains a very significant social and economic activity in New Zealand. This paper analyses the geographical dimensions of tourist travel using data from the Domestic Travel Study. Once broad national trends are identified, inter-regional travel patterns are examined using dominant flow analysis and regional profiles are established by means of ternary graphs. This analysis shows the dominance of the major metropolitan markets, the regionalized nature of much domestic tourism and regional variations in visitor profiles. Regional population size plays a major role in determining overall flows but what appears to make the difference between a net loss or gain in total bednights is a region's ability to attract holiday visitors. This underscores the value which the promotion of domestic tourism may have in regional development.\n      </p>", "We extend count data travel cost modeling by developing a utility theoretic system of semilogarithmic recreation demand equations. The restrictions required to make the system utility theoretic are applied during estimation. The model is applied to individual wilderness recreation trips in a system of four Canadian wilderness parks. The resulting demand system is used to examine the impacts of changing U.S.-Canadian currency exchange rates on participation and welfare of U.S. recreationists.\n      </p>", "Seven cases of watery diarrhea of explosive onset, three of them ending within two weeks, are discussed. The cause of diarrhea is believed to be the presence of an organism called Cyanobacterium-like organism. These are non-refractile, spherical bodies, 8-9 micrometers in diameter, which take on a faint to deep pink color after modified kinyoun acid-fast staining. Risk factors such as travel to and from warm regions, and water as a possible source of infection are briefly discussed.\n      </p>", "One of the disadvantages of group life is competition over food. How this conflict is solved is an interesting issue for sexually monomorphic species, with co-dominant sexes. Since female mammals, particularly primate females with long gestation and lactation periods, have higher reproductive costs, the question arises how this increased need translates into leadership among group members and, thus, priority of access to food resources. We investigated seven wild, pair-living and six multi-male groups of white-handed gibbons (N = 13), in which females are expected to experience even increased rates of food competition. We examined leadership tendencies in the context of group movement, travel order, access to food resources and feeding priority (i.e., monopolizing/sharing a food patch). We found that females consistently led travel by maintaining their position at the front of groups and that traveling order amongst the entire group remained consistent between journeys. Lead females usually arrived first at food sources and tended to feed alone when food resources were limited. Female reproductive stage appeared to influence their motivation to lead, as cycling females led movements more frequently than pregnant and lactating females did. We conclude that, although appearing co-dominant, gibbon females assume a greater leadership role in coordinating group activities.\n      </p>", "A large corporate client of Rosenbluth Travel Agency conducts several foreign trips every year which include scientists and business persons. During their tours, each group is supposed to visit as many as 60 different companies located in about 20 different cities. Each meeting is to be attended by a business person and a scientist. Some meetings require the attendance of a specific individual while some allow any scientist or business person. Our objective was to determine a feasible tour with the minimum number of repeat visits. We developed a computer program that uses heuristics to solve the problem.\n      </p>", "The travel time \u03c4(t) on a link has often been treated in dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) as a function of the number of vehicles x(t) on the link, that is, \u03c4(t) = f(x(t)). In earlier papers, bounds on the gradient of this travel time function f(x) have been introduced to ensure that the model, and in particular the exit times and outflows, have various desirable properties, including a first-in-first-out (FIFO) property. These gradient conditions can be restrictive, because most commonly used travel time functions do not satisfy the conditions for all inflow rates. However, in this paper we extend the earlier results to show that the same properties (including FIFO) can be achieved by instead assuming f(x) is convex, convex about a point, or has certain weaker properties that are satisfied by most travel time functions f(x) proposed or used in practice. These results hold under the conditions in which the travel time function \u03c4(t) = f(x(t)) has generally been applied in the DTA literature, that is, with each link being homogeneous (uniform capacity along the link) and without obstructions or traffic lights. In that case, even if f(x) does not satisfy the above gradient condition, the range in which it is violated is not attainable and hence cannot cause a problem.\n      </p>", "This essay compares the imaginative geographies of Egypt produced by Florence Nightingale and Gustave Flaubert as they travelled up the Nile Valley and back to Cairo in 1849-50. Their experiences are used to emphasize the physicality (rather than merely the textuality) of travel writing. The differences between their imaginative geographies and in particular between their representations of landscape, space and people, illuminate the complex and fractured formation of Orientalism as a constellation of power, knowledge and spatiality, and its entanglements with patriarchy, sexuality and various colonialisms.\n      </p>", "The study of colonialism erases the boundaries between anthropology and history or literary studies, and between the postcolonial present and the colonial past. From the standpoint of anthropology, it is also reflexive, addressing the colonial use and formation of ethnography and its supporting practices of travel. Since the 1960s, the study of colonialism has increasingly presented a view of colonialism as struggle and negotiation, analyzing how the dichotomous representations that Westerners use for colonial rule are the outcome of much more murky and complex practical interactions. By thus treating Western governmentality as emergent and particular, it is rewriting our histories of the present.\n      </p>", "While recent ethnographic research has complicated our understanding of the \"cosmopolitan,\" assumptions persist that those who are cosmopolitan must be metropolitan, mobile, consumers. Ethnic minority caf\u00e9 owners in the borderland town of Dali, Yunnan, located in the himalayan foothills of southwest China, challenge these assumptions. Their cosmopolitanism has arisen not out of travel, consumption or metropolitan residence, but out of producing cosmopolitanism for transnational travelers, and increasingly, national tourists. While the caf\u00e9 owners' production of cosmopolitanism has become a means for social mobility and ethno-religious revitalization, not a political end in itself, their cosmopolitanism has political implications for how \"minorities,\" \"indigenous peoples,\" and borderland places are conceptualized, represented and controlled. The cosmopolitan production of the minority caf\u00e9 owners calls for us to reconceptualize the who, what and why of cosmopolitanism.\n      </p>", "Instituting air travel restrictions to slow the geographical spread of smallpox cases would have significant consequences and present serious logistical concerns. Public health decision makers must weigh the potential benefits of such restrictions against their negative impact. The goal of this research is to provide a basic analytical framework to explore some of the issues surrounding the use of air travel restrictions as a part of an overall containment strategy. We report preliminary results of a compartmental model for the inter-city spread of smallpox cases resulting from US domestic air travel. Although air traffic can be halted within hours as was shown following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, these results suggest that the consequences of halting domestic air travel may not be outweighed by public health benefits.\n      </p>", "We consider stochastic vehicle routing problems on a network with random travel and service times. A fleet of one or more vehicles is available to be routed through the network to service each node. Two versions of the model are developed based on alternative objective functions. We provide bounds on optimal objective function values and conditions under which reductions to simpler models can be made. Our solution method embeds a branch-and-cut scheme within a Monte Carlo sampling-based procedure.\n      </p>", "A review of various metrics used to characterize transient storage indicates that none of the existing measures successfully integrate the interaction between advective velocity and the transient storage parameters (storage zone area, storage zone exchange coefficient). Further, 2 existing metrics are related to mean travel time, a quantity that is independent of the storage zone exchange coefficient, \u03b1. This interaction and the effect of \u03b1 on travel time are important considerations when determining the mass of solute entering the storage zone within a given reach. A new metric based on median reach travel time is therefore proposed. Median reach travel time due to advection-dispersion and transient storage, and median reach travel time due solely to advection-dispersion are computed based on numerical simulations. These 2 travel times are used to determine F&lt;sub&gt;med&lt;/sub&gt;, the fraction of median travel time due to transient storage. Application of the new metric to 53 existing parameter sets indicates that transient storage accounts for 0.12% to 68.0% of total reach travel time. Rankings of storage zone importance based on the new metric are substantially different from rankings based on storage zone residence time, storage exchange flux, and the hydrological retention factor. These differences result from the ability of the new metric to characterize the interaction between advective velocity and transient storage, and the resultant effects on reach travel time and mass transport.\n      </p>", "This paper looks at the conditions of the emergence of \"race\" as a new scientific category during the eighteenth century, arguing that two modes of discourse and visualization played a significant role: that on society, civility, and civilization\u2014as found principally in the travel literature\u2014and that on nature, as found in natural history writings, especially in botanical classifications. The European colonizing enterprise had resulted in an extensive flow of new objects at every level. Visual representations of these new objects circulated in the European cultural world and were transferred and transformed within travelogue and natural history writings. The nature, boundaries, and potentialities of humankind were discussed in this exchange within the conceptual grid of classifications and their visual representations. Over the course of the century the discourse on society, civility, and civilization collapsed into the discourse on nature. Humans became classified and visually represented along the same lines as flora, according to similar assumptions about visible features. Concurrently, these visible features were related necessarily to bundles of social, civilized, and cognitive characteristics taken from the discourse on society, civility, civilization, as found in the contemporaneous travelogue.\n      </p>", "This article explores networking and travel in two international knowledge organizations located in Denmark. It shows that these knowledge organizations are organized in various ways through different types of network on different scales. Therefore the individual employees in both organizations are dependent on their ability to create and maintain relations within networks. The article argues that such networking activities cannot be understood separately from air travel. However, work and travel decisions are also highly individualized, meaning that a number of more individual and non-work rationalities are also significant in employees deciding whether to travel or not. Therefore the article concludes that, in a number of social situations, individual rationalities function as a barrier to the increased use of video technology. It is therefore necessary to create new mechanisms to support the increased use of virtual communications in order to reduce the environmental impact of air travel in knowledge organizations.\n      </p>", "In network models for dynamic traffic assignment the link travel times are often described by \"whole-link\" models. In particular, they have been expressed as a function of the number of vehicles currently on the link. Such whole-link models are useful approximations and make the network model tractable when flows and travel times are varying over time. Here we propose an alternative whole-link model to approximate travel times. For a vehicle entering a link at time t, we let the link travel time be a function of a weighted average of the inflow rate at the time it enters and the outflow rate at the time it exits. We show that this model ensures first-in-first-out and has other desirable properties. We indicate computational methods for solving the model, apply it to various patterns of inflows, and compare the numerical results with two alternative whole-link models.\n      </p>", "Physicians dealing with prophylactic measures for tourists going to developing countries will often not be able to foresee the outcome of their recommendations. Therefore an open study with 2,627 Austrian tourists on their flight home from a tropical destination was carried out to evaluate the behaviour of typical short-term travellers with respect to different kinds of precautionary measures. 94.1% of all tourists informed themselves before travelling abroad, but a high proportion of travellers tends to contact only their travel agency or their personal friends, this leading to inadequate information. Regarding the individual performance of precautionary measures the results indicate a few principal conclusions: Among the recommended inoculations the vaccinations against typhoid fever, poliomyelitis and tetanus are widely underestimated, the latter two in particular for adults, while compliance with the passive immunization against Hepatitis A is generally good (more than 80% of all travellers receive Hepatitis A immunoglobulins prophylactically). The most crucial point seems to be the chemoprophylaxis against malaria in as much as a) there seems to be considerable lack of information about malaria endemic areas among phycisians, b) tourists tend to use the most simple applicable drug unaware of epidemiological considerations and c) the regular intake of chemoprophylaxis declines significantly with the complexicity of the intake procedure. In addition, tourists are in general well informed about nutritional risks, but only half of them will receive adequate information on the risk of sexually transmitted diseases and a basic medical travel kit.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your
