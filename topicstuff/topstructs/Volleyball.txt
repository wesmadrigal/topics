Design\u2014Analysis of national sports injury insurance registry data. Setting\u2014Finland during 1987-91. Subjects\u2014621 691 person years of exposure among participants in soccer, ice hockey, volleyball, basketball, judo, or karate. Main outcome measures\u2014Acute sports injuries requiring medical treatment and reported to the insurance company on structured forms by the patients and their doctors. Results\u201454 186 sports injuries were recorded. Injury rates were low in athletes aged under 15, while 20-24 year olds had the highest rates. Differences in injury rates between the sports were minor in this adult age group. Overall injury rates were higher in sports entailing more frequent and powerful body contact. Each sport had a specific injury profile. Fractures and dental injuries were most common in ice hockey and karate and least frequent in volleyball. Knee injuries were the most common cause of permanent disability. Conclusions\u2014Based on the defined injury profiles in the different sports it is recommended that sports specific preventive measures should be employed to decrease the number of violent contacts between athletes, including improved game rules supported by careful refereeing. To prevent dental injuries the wearing of mouth guards should be encouraged, especially in ice hockey, karate, and basketball.\n      </p>", "The article describes two Estonian anthropometric cross-sectional studies of 1549 ordinary schoolgirls (aged 7-18) and 46 girls, who regularly practised volleyball (aged 13-16). Data are presented on 22 basic anthropometric measurements and 6 body composition characteristics (body mass index, mean skinfold, body density, relative mass of fat by Siri, absolute mass and relative mass of subcutaneous adipose tissue). All anthropometric variables were classified into five height-weight SD classes. Schoolgirls were divided into six age groups (7-8, 9-10, 11-12, 13-14, 15-16, 17-18). Volleyballers were observed as one group as their age in SD classes did not differ significantly. The classification consisted of five categories: three height-weight concordant categories: I - small (small height, small weight), II - medium (medium height, medium weight), III large - (big height, big weight) and two height/weight discordant categories: IV - so-called pyknomorphs, V - so-called leptomorphs. To assess the differences between classes the Scheff\u00e9-test was used (\u03b1 = 0.05). It proved likewise possible to comparatively systematize lenght, breadth and depth measurements, circumferences and body composition characteristics in all six age groups (7-18 years) of ordinary schoolgirls and in 13-16-year-old volleyballers as in their case the average age did not differ significantly between the classes. Diese Abhandlung beschreibt zwei estnische anthropometrische Querschnittsuntersuchungen an 1539 regul\u00e4ren Schulm\u00e4dchen im Alter von 7-18 Jahren und an 46 M\u00e4dchen im Alter zwischen 13-16 Jahren, die regelm\u00e4\u00dfig Volleyball spielen. Die Untersuchungsdaten umfassen 22 anthropometrische Ma\u00dfe und 6 Charakteristika der Body Composition (Body Mass Index, mittlere Hautfaltendicke, K\u00f6rperdichte, relative Fettmasse nach Siri, absolute und relative Masse des subkutanen Fettgewebes). Alle anthropometrischen Variablen wurden in f\u00fcnf K\u00f6rperh\u00f6hen-K\u00f6rpergewicht-SD-Klassen klassifiziert. Die Schulm\u00e4dchen wurden in sechs Altersgruppen eingeteilt (7-8, 9-10, 11-12, 13-14, 15-16 und 17-18 Jahre). Die Volleyballspielerinnen wurden als eine Gruppe betrachtet, da ihr Alter in den SD-Klassen nicht signifikant differierte. Die Klassifikation umfa\u00dft f\u00fcnf Kategorien: drei in Bezug auf K\u00f6rperh\u00f6he und K\u00f6rpergewicht konkordante Kategorien: I - klein (geringe K\u00f6rperh\u00f6he und geringes K\u00f6rpergewicht), II - mittel (mittlere K\u00f6rperh\u00f6he und mittleres K\u00f6rpergewicht), III - gro\u00df (gro\u00dfe K\u00f6rperh\u00f6he, gro\u00dfes K\u00f6rpergewicht) und zwei in Bezug auf K\u00f6rperh\u00f6he und K\u00f6rpergewicht diskordante Kategorien: IV - sogenannte Pyknomorphe und V - sogenannte Leptomorphe. Um die Differenzen zwischen diesen Klassen zu \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen, wurde der Scheff\u00e9-Test herangezogen (\u03b1 = 0.05). Es erwies sich als m\u00f6glich, L\u00e4ngen-, Breiten- und Tiefenma\u00dfe, Umf\u00e4nge und Charakteristika der Body Composition in allen sechs Altersgruppen (7-18 Jahre) der regul\u00e4ren Schulm\u00e4dchen und der 13-16 Jahre alten Volleyballspielerinnen vergleichend zu systematisieren, da bei ihnen das mittlere Alter nicht signifikant zwischen den einzelnen Klassen differierte.\n      </p>", "This article describes an optimization process used to schedule the First Division of Argentina's professional volleyball league. The teams in the league are grouped into couples, and matches are held on Thursdays and Saturdays. In each pair of consecutive Thursday\u2014Saturday matches, the two teams in each couple play against two teams from another couple. Minimization of travel distances is critical because the teams' home locations are scattered throughout the country and teams do not return to their home sites between consecutive away matches, making this problem a variation of the well-known traveling tournament problem. The coupled format gives rise to two key decisions: (1) how to couple the teams, and (2) how to schedule the matches. We apply integer programming techniques and a tabu search heuristic to solve these questions. The league successfully used the resulting schedules in its 2007\u20142008, 2008\u20142009, 2009\u20142010, and 2010\u20142011 seasons, reducing the total travel distance while meeting all of the teams' requirements. This is the first application of the traveling tournament problem to a real-world sports league reported in the optimization literature.\n      </p>", "Heath-Carter somatotypes were determined on 127 of the 138 female members of 10 South Australian representative games squads (badminton, basketball, cricket, hockey, lacrosse, netball, soccer, softball, squash and volleyball).

Six students, one male and one female per class, from three classes, identified as demonstrating low incidences of supportive behaviors during volleyball games, were participants in this study. A multiple baseline across classes design was used to examine the data. During baseline few incidences of non-supportive behaviors occurred among all six students. However, the participants seldom displayed supportive behaviors during games (i.e., encouraged each other). Following the introduction of the dependent group contingency, supportive behaviors for all participants increased. Follow-up data, collected in an alternative setting, indicated variable maintenance. The results are discussed in the context of group contingencies and social behaviors in sports.\n      </p>", "Heath-Carter somatotypes were determined on 206 male members of South Australian representative squads in 17 sports. Complete state squads were tested in the following sports: badminton, basketball, cycling, field hockey, field lacrosse, gymnastics, speed roller skating, squash, swimming and volleyball. Thirty-six percent of the subjects had either represented their country in international competition or, in the case of Australian Rules football, received All-Australian recognition. The overall somatotype of 2.3-5.3-2.8 (balanced mesomorph) was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) less endomorphic, more mesomorphic and more ectomorphic than baseline data in the literature. The sportsmen are therefore better equipped for physical activity in that they have to displace less relative fat mass yet have a greater relative muscle mass with which to initiate and sustain movement. Ten of the group means were in the ectomorphic mesomorph category, 5 were balanced mesomorphs and 2 were in the endomorphic mesomorph grouping. A one-way MANOVA, which used Wilks' lambda as the test statistic, was employed to determine whether there were any statistically significant differences between the group somatotype means.

However, some have proposed that as an educational framework, it lacks adequate theoretical grounding from a motor learning perspective to empirically augment its perceived effectiveness. The authors examine the literature base providing the theoretical underpinning for TGfU and explore the potential of a nonlinear pedagogical framework, based on dynamical systems theory, as a suitable explanation for TGfU's effectiveness in physical education. Nonlinear pedagogy involves manipulating key task constraints on learners to facilitate the emergence of functional movement patterns and decision-making behaviors.

An experimental approach investigated the survival rates of four macrofaunal species which were subjected to human trampling at different intensities in a holiday-activity simulation. It was found that the clam Donax serra was slightly impacted at all trampling intensities while Donax sordidus and the isopod Eurydice longicornis were affected only at high trampling intensities. Vigorous beach games, such as volleyball, may have a damaging effect on D. serra. In a second experiment, the severe effects of human trampling on D. serra and the benthic mysid Gastrosaccus psammodytes were investigated using numbered animals in enclosures.

Dependent variables included (a) time learners spent in preparation, in motor development, and in knowledge acquisition, and (b) their subsequent levels of motor involvement in volleyball and taekwon-do. An experimental case study protocol was used with two volleyball trainers and three taekwon-do instructors. Results show how supervision strategies sensitize teachers to the importance of time spent learning, and improve aspects of teaching within teachers' control, for instance, how much time to give to organizing or explaining tasks.

Correlations of frequency of appropriate trials and inappropriate trials with achievement and differences in these correlations for skill groups and for boys and girls were determined. Significant interaction effects were identified for the forearm pass for the number of appropriate trials and for the ratio in appropriate:inappropriate ratio. For the serve, significant main effects were found for gender and skill level for inappropriate trials, for skill level for total trials, and for gender for the appropriate:inappropriate ratio.

In this study, we present data on the occurrence of sports injuries among children in six European countries, namely Austria, Denmark, France, Greece, The Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. An operational definition for sports injuries was developed, and comparable data from the European Home and Leisure Accident Surveillance System, an established injury surveillance system operating in 12 European union countries, were collected from the participating member states, during a 1-year period (1998). Sports injuries were examined in schools, in organised and unorganised settings, and in specific types of sports by demographics and injury descriptive variables. Sports injuries represent a quantitatively important and sufficiently serious problem in European union countries, accounting for an estimated annual number of about a quarter of a million outpatient visits in two of the participating countries, which provide national estimates. It is evident, that sport injuries are not only common but also injuries of considerable severity, since a large fraction represents fractures, while approximately 4% of the total require hospitalisation. Football and basketball among male children are, in declining order, the two sports responsible for the most frequent injuries in the European union countries, whereas gymnastics and volleyball prevail among females.

Fourteen anthropometric measurements were taken from the players, and these data were systematized into a 5 SD height-weight classification (small, medium, large, pyknomorphous and leptomorphous). The players participated in 28 matches, which were recorded in parallel with two computers equipped with the program Game. The girls' proficiency in the game was assessed in the same body build classes. For each class, the total number of serves, receptions, attacks and blocks, their mean values per player and percentage from elements performed during the whole tournament were calculated. In the same way, for each class the total number of points scored and separately the number of points scored in serve, attack and block were calculated. For each class the mean index of proficiency was calculated for serve, reception, attack and block. The results showed, that the most successful were the girls of class 3 with big height and weight. The small girls of class 1 were the least successful. The players belonging to the other classes formed an intermediate group. The authors recommend the use of the body build classification as it enables simultaneous assessment of body build and proficiency in competitions. Die vorliegende Untersuchung hat den K\u00f6rperbau sowie die spielerische Leistungsf\u00e4higkeit von 74 Volleyballsspielrinnen im Alter zwischen 13 und 15 Jahren zum Gegenstand, die an den estnischen Meisterschaften teilgenommen haben. An diesen Spielerinnen wurden vierzehn anthropometrische Ma\u00dfe erfasst. Diese Daten wurden in eine 5 SD-K\u00f6rperh\u00f6hen-K\u00f6rpergewicht-Klassifikation (klein, mittel, gro\u00df, pyknomorph und leptomorph) eingeordnet. Die Spielerinnen nahmen an 28 Spielen teil, welche parallel mit zwei Computern aufgezeichnet wurden, die mit dem Programm Game ausger\u00fcstet waren. Die spielerischen Leistungen der M\u00e4dchen wurden in diesen K\u00f6rperbauklassen bewertet. F\u00fcr jede dieser Klassen wurden die Gesamtzahl der Aufgaben, Annahmen, Angriffe und Blockierungen, ihre mittleren Werte pro Spielerin sowie der Prozentsatz dieser Elemente w\u00e4hrend der gesamten Spieldauer berechnet. In der gleichen Weise wurde f\u00fcr jede Klasse die Gesamtzahl der Punkte und getrennt die Zahl der Punkte f\u00fcr Aufgaben, Angriffe und Blockierungen berechnet. Au\u00dferdem wurde f\u00fcr jede Klasse der Leistungsindex f\u00fcr Aufgaben, Annahmen, Angriffe und Blockierungen ermittelt. Die Ergebnisse zeigten, dass am erfolgreichsten die M\u00e4dchen der Klasse 3 mit gro\u00dfer K\u00f6rperh\u00f6he und gro\u00dfem K\u00f6rpergewicht waren. Die kleinen M\u00e4dchen der Klasse 1 waren am wenigsten erfolgreich. Die zu den anderen Klassen geh\u00f6renden Spielerinnen nahmen eine Mittelstellung ein. Die Autoren empfehlen die Verwendung der K\u00f6rperbauklassifikation, da sie gleichzeitig die Einsch\u00e4tzung von K\u00f6rperbau und spielerischer Leistung in Wettk\u00e4mpfen erlaubt.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
