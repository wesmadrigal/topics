Blake also promotes postmodernism as a resource for rejuvenating educational theory. The paper demonstrates that postmodernism is inadequate as a basis for rethinking educational theory and for forging a radical educational politics.\n      </p>", "In this article, we elaborate on various key ideas about consumption and consumer from a theoretical position that we have labeled \"liberatory postmodernism.\" By unmasking the limitations of modernism that have to do with the onerous nature of its metanarratives and narrow conventionalism, we show that postmodern developments offer alternate visions of consumption processes that have an emancipatory potential. The analysis in our article begins with a discussion of the philosophical foundations of modernism and postmodernism followed by a cultural critique of modernism-exposing, for example, the modernist distinction between production and consumption and the privileging of production over consumption. We demonstrate how postmodernism is concerned with the reversing of the conditions of modernity and with a wide range of issues regarding the construction of the subject (i.e., the consumer), the role of the symbolic in consumption processes, the notion of the spectacularization of life, the creation of the hyperreal, and the cultural signification of fragmentation We conclude the article with a proposal for an epistemology of consumption that subsumes scientific knowledge under a broader category of narrative knowledge and recognizes multivocality of consumption forms.\n      </p>", "Postmodernism, an intellectual movement that originated in the humanities, has received considerable attention in the organization theory literature. Because many scholars remain uncertain as to just what this controversial perspective is, the present article offers a straightforward explanation of postmodernism's basic themes. Additionally, the author attempts to provide some balance to the overwhelmingly sympathetic presentations of postmodernism in the organization theory literature by offering a critical assessment of how it would redirect the study of organizations. Consistent with an intellectual divide dating to the Enlightenment, while those engaged in \"normal science\" are concerned with the question of what is true, it appears that those who sympathize with postmodernism are addressing the question of what is good. Postmodernists, it is argued here, wish to engage in advocacy for values and preferences that they view as putting them in radical opposition to the status quo. To facilitate such advocacy they call for the repudiation of \"modernism,\" in particular the key modernist notion that there is an objective truth that can be sought out rationally and systematically. Postmodernists adopt, instead, a relativist philosophy, which contends that \"truth\" must be considered merely subjective, such that one's view of truth is only relative to one's circumstances. Although taking the position that no one can say what is or is not \"true\" puts them in opposition to mainstream science, it supports their ability to discredit views they oppose, and simultaneously provides a defense against those who would claim that the postmodernist's view is not \"true.\" Whether the postmodernist approach has the potential to enhance our understanding of organizations is addressed here by examining its philosophical and historical roots, the research and theory that it has so far inspired, and the critical commentary on our field that its adherents have offered.\n      </p>", "The paper highlights the urgent and radical questions and problems which postmodernism poses for educational studies in general, and the philosophy of education in particular. First, it outlines and interrelates the legacies of modernism in social and cultural theory. Next, it describes the reactionary anti-modernism of the Right, and contrasts this with traditionalism. It is argued that the current political and economic context of education is largely anti-modernist, not traditionalist. The stirrings of radical doubts about modernism are described and contrasted with the antimodernism of the Right. A salient theme to this point is the variety of conceptions of the relationship between knowledge and power. Mature postmodernism is characterised centrally in terms of a reconceptualisation of that relationship. The metamorphosis of the concept of the self in postmodernism is described and related to new problems about ethics and a newly emerging importance for the aesthetic. Finally, the paper argues that while the fundamental issues for philosophy of education are unchanged - problems about instrumentalism and various issues of autonomy - these are radically recast in postmodernism, and present new difficulties.\n      </p>", "During the last few years a group of geographers has seen decisive problems in the accepted ways of thinking about the subject matter of geography, the ways of knowing that subject matter, and the ways of communicating the results of geographical inquiry. They have attempted to develop alternatives to these accepted practices. Advocates of these alternatives have characterized the now questionable views as \"modernist,\" and have claimed to be \"postmodern.\" In doing so they have appealed to the intellectual authority of several individuals, notably Nietzsche, Rorty, and Wittgenstein. Yet a closer analysis of the works of those authorities suggests the need to rethink the claims of the most vocal of postmodernists. Indeed, an analysis of the works of postmodernists in terms of the critiques-of authority, ontology, history, and language-developed by the very authorities whom they cite suggests that postmodernism is in important respects modernist. This, if we return to the works of postmodern geographers' intellectual predecessors, should come as no surprise; an important emphasis of their work, yet one typically missing in postmodernists' uses of it, is the nature of habit and custom in human life and language.\n      </p>", "This article addresses the situation of contemporary theological thinking in relation to postmodernism, or contemporary Continental philosophy. Using a criterion of health from Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalysis, it argues that theology should avoid either simple-minded assimilation of postmodernism or closeminded rejection. After critically surveying some current theological movements and figures, such as Radical Orthodoxy, I turn away from a paradigm of theology based on Barth to one based on Paul Tillich. Finally, an alternative notion of health is elaborated which leads to a deep and transformative encounter between postmodernism and theology.\n      </p>", "Postmodernism and poststructuralism have only been mentioned in passing within this journal.

The paper is in four episodes. We begin by exploring the differences between modernism and postmodernism and introducing some of our sources (episode 1), moving on to the study of language through structuralism and into poststructuralism (episode 2). This section introduces some key concepts and approaches which we illustrate in a short case study (episode 3) of the language of OR.

Archaeologists have cast their nets even more widely, not only toward anthropology and history, but to fields ranging from molecular biology to hermeneutics. Postmodernist approaches maintain that archaeologists should be looking at the past from multiple perspectives and listening to its multivocality. Archaeologists, in fact, not only develop different ways of understanding the past, but actually develop alternative pasts. This paper argues that multiple paths to alternative pasts enhance archaeological understanding and, at the same time, stimulate the development of archaeological theory.\n      </p>", "This paper locates the work and critical reception of the experimental poet Lyn Hejinian within the emerging debates of 'third-wave' feminist critique. It centrally argues that Hejinian's writing at once illuminates and undermines the apparent tensions between a feminist and an anti-foundationalist critical position. It specifically focuses on Hejinian's use of autobiography, as at once gesturing to the limitations of the theoretically naive self-knowing subject, steeped in the discredited assumptions of modernity, and the continuing cultural validity of and desire for narrative, identification, self-expression and referentiality. The paper argues that Hejinian's writing makes sense of this equivocation, not through its use of feminized tropes assumed to subvert the linear assumptions of the genre and render the reader 'active', but through an attention to the ironical complexities of her own cultural positioning. Hejinian's writing demonstrates how the representation of the postmodern feminist subject involves an attention to authoriality, to the possibilities of textual experimentation and to the cultural sites that legitimize the production of meaning for these things. Hejinian demonstrates not simply that feminism can reconcile a need for agency with a critique of agency, and that such an act needs to consider its collective implications, but that these kinds of claims actually require an engagement with the varied contexts that continue to make feminist's attention to literature meaningful.\n      </p>", "\"Jusep Torres Campalans,\" the apocryphal biography of an avant-garde painter published by Max Aub in 1958, should be read as a reflection on two matters of great importance to an exile of the Spanish Civil War: the relation between art (or literature) and politics, and the relation between fiction and reality. In spite of the fictional quality of its protagonist, \"Jusep Torres Campalans\" constitutes a serious history, commentary and critique of modernism that can be read as one of the first true samples of postmodernism in Spanish letters. Further, the book is a political statement in itself, closely connected with Aub's own position and experience as an anti-Francoist Republican exile at the height of the Cold War.\n      </p>", "Observations about the effects of postmodernism on the urban landscape have been numerous, but measurement of the effects has been limited. As long as they are vague and debated, definition of postmodernism will be ambiguous.

A buffer procedure is an important element in the analysis.\n      </p>", "This article explores the similarities between Afrocentricity and postmodernism with an eye toward defining their responses to hegemony. The author argues that these ideas share similar platforms, although they may have been derived from different experiences. Clearly, the assault on all forms of prejudice, bigotry, hierarchical arrangements, and class discriminations are at the base of both ideas. By examining the intellectual history and details of the postmodern movement the author seeks to provide its characteristics that relate to the Afrocentric idea.\n      </p>", "This essay consists of fragments, questions, and reflections which introduce this collection of essays on feminism and postmodernism in anthropology and which explore the problematic conjunctions and disjunctions of these \"isms\" in the academy in general.\n      </p>", "This article is based on the presupposition that postmodern philosophy has been largely influenced by Nietzsche's writings. The author raises the question of how Nietzsche and postmodern philosophy are interpreted in the contemporary philosophical discourse in Lithuania. The conclusion drawn is that many philosophy critics in Lithuania are interested in Nietzsche's philosophy (Mickevi\u017eius, Sodeika, \u0160erpytyt\u00e8, Sverdiolas, Baranova) and in the problems of postmodern philosophy (Ker\u0161yt\u00e8, Rubavi\u017eius, \u017dukauskait\u00e9, Serpytyt\u00e8, \u0160verdiolas, Baranova, Norkus). The article also raises a second crucial question: beyond the critics, are there any truly authentic postmodern thinkers in Lithuania? This article's main hypotheses is that Arvydas \u0160liogeris' philosophy is the best and perhaps the only example of original Lithuanian postmodern thought; it is based on, and interconnected with, the deeply inherited roots of existential thought in Lithuanian philosophical culture. The arguments for these hypotheses are as follows: first, \u0160liogeris is the first philosopher in Lithuania who has tried to reason in an interdisciplinary manner, e. g. trying to overcome the modernistic distinction between philosophy and the arts (especially literature, poetry, and the visual arts); secondly, \u0160liogeris's philosophizing is indispensable to his writings\u2014 his texts are examples of an experience of writing as thinking and thinking as writing; thirdly, following Deleuze's presupposition that the philosopher is a creator, one can see this creative aspect in \u0160liogeris's approach. His texts show how it is possible to synthesize insights from philosophy and poetry.\n      </p>", "This essay examines contemporary diagnoses of cynicism, issuing from scholars such as Peter Sloterdijk, Frederic Jameson, and Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, to distill a clear concept of cynicism and its social and political consequences. In particular, it seeks to call into question accounts in which cynicism suddenly bursts onto the scene as a response to recent, post-1960s political disappointments and the corrosive philosophy of postmodernism. Instead, by turning to Denis Diderot's perplexing dialog Rameau's Nephew, I demonstrate that the impulse toward cynicism may lie buried much deeper in modernity, in the thought of enlightenment itself. This longer perspective helps us to understand the conditions for the emergence of cynicism today, while problematizing hard and fast distinctions between enlightenment and postmodernism. I conclude by warning against excessively moralistic denunciations of cynicism, demonstrating that such denunciations harbor the very same antipolitical tendencies which they locate in cynicism. Instead, I argue we must find a form of politics appropriate to an increasingly cynical age.\n      </p>", "Skeptical postmodern claims about the viability of authorship and meaning in literature are contrasted in historical persepective with Rabindranath Tagore's views on the power of literary art to illuminate reality and enrich feeling. Consequences of postmodern methods and theories are explored with reference to his defense of art and life as a unity that entails unique knowledge and insight. Although influenced by Western culture, he distrusted theory applied to art. For him, durable meanings are an imperative of life for which literature is a vehicle. A post-Nobel Prize attempt to promote Eastern wisdom as a corrective to Western rationalism and materialism did not succeed.\n      </p>", "This paper makes an intervention in the debates on postmodernism as dominant social and cultural order of the present from the perspective of post-socialist transformation. Grounded in an analysis of theoretical discourses and of qualitative interviews, it highlights the hierarchical time/space constructions and universalizing tendencies inherent in many proclamations of the postmodern epoch and contests the uncritical acceptance of the 'end of history' metanarrative. Post-socialist transformation is shown to be a complex process that fits uneasily into pre-given categories and disrupts an ordering logic that divides between a western, postmodern 'us' and 'the rest' of the world. My argument is formulated on the basis of research on the transformative processes in former east Germany.\n      </p>", "Using novelistic vignettes, this article calls for the reader's imaginative engagement in a highly-charged situation involving accusations of sexual harassment on our campus. This event made visible not only the contradictions between the traditional humanism grounding higher education and postmodern and feminist challenges to it, but also the dangers of feminist collaboration in liberal humanist projects. We invite readers to reflect on their own allegiances to the various and competing discourses that help structure the academy today as we expose our own shifting subject positions and investments. We aim to call into question the possibility of knowing the \"truth\" of this event, even as we self-consciously construct a reading of it in order to displace the \"official\" humanistic interpretation given to this situation by the college's president, in favor of one that applies postmodern and feminist insights about discourse, subjectivity, and the power/knowledge nexus to an \"ethnography\" of the academy.\n      </p>", "Reviewing \"The Ethics of Gender, Feminism and Christian Ethics,\" and \"The Cambridge Companion to Feminist Theology,\" the author suggests that Susan Parsons responds to questions postmodernism has posed to both feminism and Christian ethics by using insights gained from various accounts of the moral subject found in feminist philosophy, ethics, and theology. Hesitant to embrace postmodernism's critique of the possibility of ethics, Parsons redefines ethics by establishing a moral point of view within discursive communities. Yet in her brief treatment of Emmanuel Levinas, Parsons does not explore the postmodern option he offers feminists: an understanding of moral responsibility that can be critical of ethics. Parsons also ignores some feminist perspectives in the physical and natural sciences, thereby missing valuable insights of feminists who insist upon the materiality of the body.\n      </p>", "This essay examines the work of Nancy Fraser and Seyla Benhabib, two philosophers who have demonstrated that feminist theorists can usefully draw upon both postmodernism and the critical theory tradition, with which Fraser and Benhabib are more clearly associated. I argue that each theorist claims the universal ideals and normative judgements of modernism, and the contextualism, particularity, and skepticism of postmodernism. I do this by revisiting each of their positions in the now well-known Feminist Contentions exchange, by examining the diverse ways in which they reconcile universalism and difference, and by exploring each theorist's critique of the Habermasian public sphere.\n      </p>", "In this paper, I argue in favour of regarding human geography as part of the social theory movement.

Drawing upon data from an ethnographic study of a summer college readiness program for African American, Asian American, and Anglo youth, we explore how postmodern theories can provide insights into the multiple roles of evaluators and increase reflexivity in ethnographic program evaluation.\n      </p>", "The current state of British sociology of education is reviewed; noting its decline, but suggesting that its influence has been dispersed throughout educational research in Britain. It is argued that its fate is not simply a product of external attack but also derives from internal problems. Against this background, it is suggested that postmodernism can be treated as a stimulus for a fundamental reconsideration of the proper nature and role of academic research on education.\n      </p>", "This paper examines the ways in which the history curriculum in UK schools has been subject to contestation in recent years and considers the implications of the impact of postmodernism -particularly consumption - upon history teaching. It explores the relationship between 'official history' taught in schools and the 'unofficial histories' which influence children in the community, in the media and through the heritage industry. It argues that the powerful images gained outside the 'official' environment have profound implications for the ways in which children are influenced and socialized, which may cause schools to reconceptualize the way history is taught. In particular, it considers the implications of Giroux's (1992) concept of a 'border pedagogy' for history teaching.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

These assumptions are that truth is discoverable through human reason; that certain knowledge is possible; and furthermore, that such knowledge will provide a basis for the ineluctable progress of Mankind. The Enlightenment project is underwritten by the conviction that knowledge gained through the scientific method is secure. In so far as biomedicine inherits these assumptions it becomes fair game for postmodern deconstruction. Today, perhaps more than ever, plural values compete, and contradictory approaches to health, for instance, garner support and aquire supremacy through consumer choice and media manipulation rather than evidence-based science. Many doctors feel a tension between meeting the needs of the patient face to face, and working towards the broader health needs of the public at large. But if the very foundations of medical science are questioned, by patients, or by doctors themselves, wherein lies the value of their work? This paper examines the issues that the anti-foundationalist thrust of postmodernism raises, in the light of a case of mild hypertension. The strict application of medical protocol, derived from a nomothetic, statistical perspective, seems unlikely to furnish value in the treatment of an individual. The anything goes, consumerist approach, however, fares no better. The author argues that whilst value cannot depend on any rationally predetermined parameters, it can be rescued, and emerges from the process of the meeting with the patient.\n      </p>", "Examination of trends in postmodernist theory with regard to cultural production from a Brazilian perspective and an analysis of the production of Brazilian writers reveals that postmodernism creates a \"market culture\" and that the pressures and limits of this culture influence the form and content of texts.\n      </p>", "This article discusses a group of pieces that can best be understood as musical collages: the third movement of Luciano Berio's Sinfonia (1968), the first movement of George Rochberg's Music for the Magic Theater (1965), and the last movement of Bernd Alois Zimmermann's Musique pour les Soupers du Roi Ubu (1966). It demonstrates that chromatic complementation and a concurrent systematic process of chromatic saturation provide the logic behind the harmonic, formal and voice-leading content of these pieces, thus establishing an unexpected link between these works and their serial predecessors.\n      </p>", "Different accounts of Skinner's work are often in conflict. Some interpretations, for example, regard Skinner as a mechanist. Other interpretations regard Skinner as a selectionist. An alternative interpretation is to see Skinner as employing both views with changes in these views and their proportionate relations over time. To clarify these distinctions, it is helpful to see Skinner's work against the background of similar changes that have been taking place in Western Culture. An extended and overlapping shift in cultural values has occurred from modernism to postmodernism. Some key distinctions in this shift are that modernism emphasizes abstract simplicity, permanent necessity, and absolutely certain sources of truth. Postmodernism emphasizes complex and concrete contexts, probability, and explanations of change in terms of consequences. Skinner shows a similarly extended and overlapping shift over time that results in separate sets of responses which may be regarded as two sides or two selves of Skinner: one an organized collection of responses aligned with modernism, another an organized collection of responses aligned with postmodernism.\n      </p>", "This paper demonstrates that advancing our understanding of international political economy (IPE) entails posing the question of otherness and difference as an object of theoretical and historical inquiry. It suggests that the discourses of postmodernism, feminism, and postcolonial criticism directly contribute to IPE by locating the problematic of identity/difference at the center of the dialectic of social change. By pinpointing the strength and the problematic nature of each of these discourses, it argues that the reconstruction of IPE based on the recognition of difference requires 'an empathetic cooperation' among these discourses as a precondition for the creation of a dialogical interaction between theoretical discourse and subject-positions to whom it is addressed.\n      </p>", "The National Research Council report Scientific Research in Education claims to present an inclusive view of science as it responds to federal government attempts to legislate educational research. This author argues, however, that the report in fact narrowly defines science as positivism and methodology as quantitative. These definitions are made possible by the outright rejection of postmodernism and the rejection by omission of other theories including queer, feminist, race, postcolonial, critical, and poststructural theories. The chief issue in this report is, in fact, not \"science\" but the larger issue of epistemology, from which methodologies like conventional science emerge. After using postmodern analyses to illustrate the danger of the report's normalizing and totalizing discourse, this author urges researchers to be on guard against those who would reject diverse epistemologies and methodologies in educational research.\n      </p>", "This paper offers broad and critical perspectives on current development thinking. A brief summary of different meanings of development and a thumbnail sketch of broad trends over the past twenty to thirty years in relation to major development indicators is followed by a discussion of reasons for the emergence of fundamental critiques of conventional development and developmentalism from perspectives known variously as post-structuralist, post-development and anti-development. Connections are made between these and the literatures on postmodernism, postcolonialism and post-traditionalism.

I too worry that shallow works given even more shallow and opportunistic readings can have negative social consequences. But I also recognize that most of Weiss's concerns are not unique to postmodern writings. Many of the problems he discusses could also be descriptive of work from different conceptual and methodological stances. Statistics are often contrived and misleading. Ethnography has at times aided colonization. Both social and physical sciences have at times produced bad theories and been put to very negative uses. Some early postmodernist theorists, Christians, and scientists, were Nazis, and elements of each of their fundamental conceptions could be co-opted to support this particular form of barbarism. This potential utilization, however, does not lead for me to a blanket condemnation of postmodernism, science, ethnography, religion, or statistics. Devotees of each have used their special understandings to fight tyranny. Both postmodernism and science also draw on fundamental conceptions that are productive, enable open choices, and help us see through the masters and ideologies of a particular time and place. I am less interested in blame than in finding what each can contribute. I look to an ongoing community discussion that helps us to do the best we can to sort out the good from the bad, and I hope that the current set of essays helps stimulate a positive dialogue.\n      </p>", "Revived Weimar\u2010era \u201cradical conservatism\u201d and fresh \u201cNew Right\u201d and \u201cpaleoconservative\u201d theories offer a radical cultural critique of global capitalism and liberal democracy.

Then there is a critical analysis of the underlying philosophy in postmodernism connected with historiography, its theory of language and linguistic idealism, of its opposition to historical realism and its refusal to accept the reality of the past as a possible reference object and finally, of its theory of historical narration as a fictional construction with no type of conditioning. The article also points out some reasons for the appeal of this thought and sustains that the sceptical and politicised view that it has on historical research is basically erroneous, incongruent with historians' way of thinking about their own work and unable to provide an understanding of historiography as a form of committed thought to reach and understand humanity's past.\n      </p>", "Drawing primarily from the work of Julia Kristeva and Judith Butler, the author suggests that a postmodern approach to identity can be used to challenge the essentialism that pervades both feminist empiricism and standpoint theory, and thus move feminist psychology in a more emancipatory direction.

Engagement has engendered reconstructions of complex, diverse peoples and practices that are more equitable, relevant, and sound. Yet, for many archaeologists, the connection with feminist perspectives has frayed in recent years. Their studies of gender articulate dated ideas about women and epistemological frames that highlight duality and universality. Examinations of labor divisions typify shortcomings. To advance gender's study and archaeology, practitioners need to consider several concerns about identity and difference emerging from thirdwave feminism. Gender is envisioned as intersection. Bioarchaeology, especially, will benefit from feminist approaches that reflect critically and regard gender in nonnormative and multiscalar terms. To this end, resistance to feminism must fade. Opposition stems from its imagined relationship with postmodernism, but conflation misconstrues feminism's sociopolitical commitment to emancipatory change.

Her paradoxical and enigmatic way of writing, however, has induced widely differing interpretations.

On the other hand Lispector's work has been defined as post-structuralist and deconstructionist according to postmodernist parameters. A contradiction emerges: whereas the theory of difference insists on the importance of the female subject, the postmodernists are no longer concerned with the autonomous and self-identical subject. Can Lispector be both a representative of \u00e9criture f\u00e9minine and of postmodernism, can she be claimed for both the construction and deconstruction of the subject? The following remarks try to show how Lispector develops an aesthetic principle that allows for self-discovery and search for meaning by way of abandoning meaning altogether; meaning as it emerges from logo- and phallocentrism, from the symbolic order and its language.\n      </p>", "In recent years, the adoption of postmodern theoretical perspectives within educational research has prompted strong critical reaction. For some critics (particularly Marxist researchers), the greatest fault of postmodernism is that it lacks an agenda for social change. This paper takes issue with this argument, and with four associated arguments: (1) that postmodernism disempowers those to whom it claims to give voice; (2) that it appeals only to intellectuals and has no practical value; (3) that it denies the possibility of the construction of a new social order; and (4) that it colludes with the status quo in its refusal to act. Addressing each of these points in turn, the author suggests that, contrary to the view of these critics, postmodernism offers a powerful force for social change, through the acceptance of uncertainty, the acknowledgement of diversity and the refusal to see concepts such as 'justice' or 'society' as fixed, or as governed by unassailable 'truths'.\n      </p>", "The articles raises the question of typology of Russian literary postmodernism. The author argues that since its very birth, Russian postmodernism has been represented by two opposing trends which he terms conceptualism and neo-baroque. The author suggests that these two trends began at the end of the 1960s and developed simultaneously in the underground culture of the 1970s-80s. Sharing the major features of postmodernist poetics, they have different origins, have developed opposing artistic strategies, and have shaped philosophical concepts. However, in the 1990s both these trends of conceptualism and neobaroque reached the point where poetics and artistic ideas began to merge, and the bi-polar structure of Russian literary postmodernism began to dissolve. The later hypothesis is illustrated in the article by the comparative analysis of novels written by the two leading writers of each of these trends - Goluboe salo (The Blue Fat) by Vladimir Sorokin and Generation P by Viktor Pelevin (both written in 1999).\n      </p>", "Through an international case study, this paper illustrates how a conversation method was used effectively to address a cross-cultural ethics problem.

It is suggested that the stage approach used by postmodernists, in which they define themselves as representing the next, superior stage after modernism, be replaced with a lineage approach in order to assess the possible merits of postmodernism. It is argued that such an approach would reveal postmodernism as a weak approximation of interactionist and pragmatist thought.\n      </p>", "Postmodernism refers to (1) postmodern social conditions, i.e. postmodernity, and (2) an allegedly new theory for understanding society. As the latter, postmodernism is a critique of the scientific paradigm which dominates in the Western world. Feminist theory is one of the most vigorous manifestations of postmodernist thought at this time. This paper argues that the postmodern analysis is an extension of important elements of classical social theory. For example, linguistic determinism, epistemological relativism, cultural criticism and left-liberal bias in favor of underdogs are characteristics of Symbolic Interactionism and of other types of interpretive/humanistic sociology, if not\u2014to some extent\u2014of Sociology itself.\n      </p>", "Family therapy has entered the postmodern era, a period characterized by shifting values and an increasing respect for personal meaning.

It argues that postmodernism liquidates, rather than solves, the unity of disunity problem by treating \"wholes\" as mere appearances. The article contends that postmodernism needs to be taken more seriously than it has been by sociologists but that, ultimately, the challenge presented by postmodernism validates the relevancy of classical theory. The article concludes that the postmodernist influence has diminished sociology's relevance to real-world problems and, as a result, made the discipline less relevant for undergraduates. It calls for a revitalized sociology of sociology with the capacity to think through the trap formed by neoconservatism on the one side and the micro politics of postmodernism on the other.\n      </p>", "In their recent hooks, Jennifer Ashton and Alan Gilbert consider both the dominance of the postmodern paradigm and its incoherence. As Donald Allen and George Butterick note in their anthology The Postmoderns: The New American Poetry Revised, postmodernism's \"chiefcharacteristic is its inclusiveness, its quick willingness to take advantage of all that had gone before\" (12). It's precisely this indiscrimination Ashton and Gilbert read as vexed because it disavows difference.

And despite its definitional ambiguities, some philosophers see in postmodernism a reason for the rise and interest in business ethics. This view is challenged on two grounds: (1) its philosophical source in Europe; and (2) its vocabulary. Martin Heidegger, one of the major forces in postmodernism's rise, left a confusing legacy. In his early years, Heidegger advocated moral subjectivism; in his later years, he argued that moral standards could be found in the lives of human gods whose pronouncements would replace the precepts of a Western Civilization he found decadent. Contemporary postmodernism seems to take inspiration from the views of both the younger and older Heidegger even though he, himself, saw contradictions between them. The confusion is compounded by incorporation of Neitzsche's God-is-dead thesis into Heideggerian thought, thereby, confronting philosophers with a dilemma: if God is out of the picture, and if objective rules derived from human nature do not exist, what human gods can lead us? Will they come from a political or cultural elite? How should we know them? Why should we trust them? Unless-and until-these questions are answered, it is unwise to build business ethics on a postmodern foundation. Another-and seemingly insignificant-reason for rejecting postmodernism ethics is the esoteric vocabulary used by its expositors to advance it. More jargon will not help philosophers who try to respond to moral questions raised by business managers themselves.\n      </p>", "This article critically examines the postmodern Blackness phenomenon that seeks primacy in African American thought. Using an Afrocentric analytical approach centered on the axis of culture and history of African Americans, I argue that the postmodern Blackness phenomenon is an unfortunate and precarious turn away from relevance. In its disapproving attitude and stance on cultural identity and consciousness, the quintessential issues in political belonging and politics, postmodern Blackness behaves as an impediment in the African American quest for freedom. Among the political hazards wrought by postmodern Blackness are (a) incessant disunity among African descended peoples and (b) dependency on political actors external to the African American community who are well organized and purposeful in pursuit of their own interests. This analysis also explains that at its core, postmodernism is yet another way of expressing the individualistic ethos of the European worldview.\n      </p>", "In this essay we discuss changes in the cultural meaning and significance of time in postmodernism. We begin by examining the experience of time and space in the Middle Ages and its radical alteration following the Renaissance. After a relatively brief period of optimism during the Enlightenment regarding the scientific control over time and space, a new crisis beginning in the mid-nineteenth century emphasized the increasing disjuncture between external, objective notions of time and the way time was experienced subjectively. We argue that the current literature on time and postmodernity is best understood in this context, where earlier disequilibriating effects brought about by modern technologies are exacerbated by new developments in transportation and communications technology. Here we discuss the particular effects on topics of interest to social scientists such as changes in notions of personal identity and the effacement of historical time. We conclude with a call for more empirically grounded work on questions concerning time in postmodernism. We lament the paucity of concrete data as well as the excess of useless polemics and recommend several researchers already conducting work in this field.\n      </p>", "This article investigates the place of postmodernism in sociology today by making a distinction between its epistemological and empirical forms. During the 1980s and early 1990s, sociologists exposited, appropriated, and normalized an epistemological postmodernism that thematizes the tentative, reflective, and possibly shifting nature of knowledge. More recently, however, sociologists have recognized the potential of a postmodern theory that turns its attention to empirical concerns. Empirical postmodernists challenge classical modern concepts to develop research programs based on new concepts like time-space reorganization, risk society, consumer capitalism, and postmodern ethics. But they do so with an appreciation for the uncertainty of the social world, ourselves, our concepts, and our commitment to our concepts that results from the encounter with postmodern epistemology. Ultimately, this article suggests that understanding postmodernism as a combination of these two moments can lead to a sociology whose epistemological modesty and empirical sensitivity encourage a deeper and broader approach to the contemporary social world.\n      </p>", "\"Business Ethics and Postmodernism: A Response\" considers the contribution of Ronald Green, David Schmidt, Clarence Walton, Ron Duska, and Richard Neilsen to a special issue of Business Ethics Quarterly entitled \"Business Ethics and Postmodernism.\" This essay poses a fundamental question: to what extent can a position which characterizes itself as postmodern be ethical? The paper argues on philosophical grounds that the debate between modernity and postmodernity is a debate over the very possibility of an ethic. The paper concludes that although Jacque Derrida has made the most convincing argument for an ethic within postmodernity, it remains skeptical because such an argument simply presupposes assumptions which owe their origin to modernity.\n      </p>", "Although the postmodern turn has profound implications for the social sciences, its reception in sociology has been mixed.

In his article in this Review in September 1992, Dana Villa urged us to reconsider this standard account. He argued that when read in light of postmodernist theory, Hannah Arendt provides the basis for a revised conception of the public sphere that privileges plurality and difference over consensus. Jim Johnson suggests that Villa's analysis is a thinly veiled polemic against critical theory. Johnson argues that, as critique, Villa's argument is neither decisive nor encompassing, and that as polemic it blinds Villa to potentially fruitful disagreements with critical theorists. Villa replies that Johnson misses the synthetic thrust of the original article because he identified public realm theory too narrowly with Habermas.

Further, the liberationist moral stance taken in postmodern discourse tends towards the excesses diagnosed by Hegel as 'the law of the heart'; that is, a romantic solipsism that ignores the ambiguity and limits of human existence. The moral and theoretical problems of postmodernism are linked to the anomie of contemporary society, which presses beleaguered intellectuals towards the use of interprevist modes of thought. The article concludes by questioning the emancipating potential of postmodern theory that places imagination at the centre of anthropological inquiry, and argues instead for a reconsideration of the fundamental constraints and potentials of the human condition.\n      </p>", "Sostiene este texto que la autoconfianza y la unidad de la \"historia\" han sufrido una fractura sin precedentes debido a la cr\u00edtica postmodernista, aunque no s\u00f3lo por ella.

We then evaluate what have been described as two different strands of postmodernism; 'postmodernism of reaction' and 'postmodernism of resistance' and conclude that, while there are clear differences in intention and in emphasis, the 'two postmodernisms' have too much in common to be thought of as separate discourses. Next, we try to identify some key problems with postmodernism per se. Our central argument is that, contra the postmodern rejection of the metanarrative, a Marxist analysis still has most purchase in explaining economic, political, social and cultural changes and current developments in capitalist societies. We argue that postmodernist analyses in general, in their marginalisation and/or neglect of the determining effects of the relations of production, are essentially reactionary. While noting a range of problems with postmodernism, we focus on its methodology and on its politics. In particular, we suggest that postmodernism, whether unwittingly or not, by denying the notion of 'emancipation in a general sense', serves to disempower the oppressed. In the second part of the paper, we look at postmodernism and education. We argue that recent major processes of restructuring, underpinned by market-led strategies, are in line with the latest requirements of capitalism. This is either denied, ignored or underplayed, or else the changes are designated merely as 'postmodern', in the discourse of postmodernism. In rejecting the determining effects of capital, or in denying or underemphasising the dualism of social class inherent in capitalism, postmodernism, we argue, serves to uphold the Radical Right in its two nation hegemonic project.\n      </p>", "Studying anthropologists and making the culture of culture professionals into an object of research not only foregrounds the quandaries of feminist, postmodernist, and postcolonial critiques as cultural practice, but also demonstrates that such quandaries are coincident with the representational politics of anthropology.

It has also had a broader impact on how we think about lyric poetry in general. For Emily Dickinson's experiments with dual authorship, hybrid-collage forms, and the blurring of stylistic and formal lines between poem and letter indicate the social embeddedness of what critics often still consider a private genre. This essay blends these two lines of thought in order to consider the lyric (and here, especially, Dickinson's lyrics) not only as a socio-historically embedded form but also as a form that may have application to our theorizing of the social. The essay argues that in a sequence of poems and letters in the period from 1862 to 1863 Dickinson identifies a possessiveness at the heart of the lyrical subjectivity that poisons social relations and stands as the most pervasive legacy of Romanticism. The essay then shows how Dickinson criticism, which can serve as a microcosm of critical trends in general, critiques but never casts aside this post-Romantic subjectivity that still limits our social theorizing. Then it shows how Dickinson seeks to do just this, to present within her lyrics an alternative poetic subjectivity that makes possible a revolutionary, pacifistic (though not passive) form of social relation.\n      </p>", "This essay surveys the present position of postmodernism with respect to the effect of its ideas upon historiography. For this purpose it looks at a number of writings by historians that have been a response to postmodernism including the recently published collection of articles, The Postmodern History Reader. The essay argues that, in contrast to scholars in the field of literary studies, the American historical profession has been much more resistant to postmodernist doctrines and that the latters' influence upon the thinking and practice of historians is not only fading but increasingly destined to fade. The essay also presents a critical discussion of the current philosophy of postmodernism in its bearing upon historiography, directed chiefly against its claim that the world has undergone an epochal transition from the modern to a postmodern age; its theory of language and linguistic idealism; its opposition to historical realism and denial of the actuality of the past as a possible object of reference; and its theory of historical narrative as unconstrained fictional construction. This discussion includes a consideration of the work of postmodernist thinkers such as J.-F. Lyotard, of the recent books by David Roberts and Robert F. Berkhofer, Jr. which espouse a postmodernist theory of history, and of the narrativist theory of Hayden White. The essay also notes some of the reasons for postmodernism's appeal; and while it does not deny that postmodernist philosophy may have served a useful purpose in provoking historians to be more self-critical and aware of their presuppositions and procedures, it maintains that its skeptical and politicized view of historical inquiry is deeply mistaken, out of accord with the way historians themselves think about their work, and incapable of providing an understanding of historiography as a form of thought engaged in the attainment of knowledge and understanding of the human past.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

This essay argues that the complex and contradictory stylistics inherent in the various trends subsumed under the realist revival may be better explained with reference to developments in aesthetic perception, which may have occurred independently of the conceptual stances (modernist, postmodernist, post-postmodernist, etc.) with which they are often authorized. In order to refine the differences between various contemporary realisms and their relations to the postmodernist avant-garde, this essay discusses the experimental use of representational rhetoric by authors such as Raymond Carver, Frederick Barthelme, and Bret Easton Ellis and contrasts them with 1970s Cooveresque fiction and the more recent representational writing of, among others, Philip Roth, Rick Moody, and Jeffrey Eugenides.\n      </p>", "This article begins by examining recent work on labour history by some French and British historians, who have been influenced by postmodernism and the 'linguistic turn' but often find themselves locked into what are primarily 'cultural' explanations of labour's identity and development. It disputes the culturalist methodology and stresses that an alternative model of discourse analysis insists on contextualisation, which in turn re-instates the significance of realms of explanation outside language, text and culture. It also sees the comparative method as a means of identifying historical structures, and concludes with a schematic account of European labour in the twentieth century. /// Cet article commence par un examen de travaux r\u00e9cents au sujet de l'histoire ouvri\u00e8re par certains historiens fran\u00e7ais et britanniques, influenc\u00e9s par le postmodernisme et le 'tournant linguistique' mais se trouvant souvent coinc\u00e9s dans des explications essentiellement 'culturelles' au sujet de l'identit\u00e9 et le d\u00e9veloppement du mouvement ouvrier.

I want to consider the ramifications of postmodernism for the social scientific study of religion, which above all means for theories of religion. Those ramifications are wholly negative: postmodernism opposes theories, and does so because it opposes generalizations. Objections to generalizations and thereby to theories in the social sciences long antedate the rise of postmodernism, but earlier objections are on modernist grounds. Postmodernism is oblivious to these criticisms and instead assumes that criticism begins with postmodernism itself. Where at least some modernist criticisms are not easily answerable, all post-modern criticisms are easily answerable, for all of them rest on confusions about theorizing.\n      </p>", "This article explores the relationship between feminism and postmodernism in anthropology through a reading of the Derek Freeman / Margaret Mead controversy. It argues that the tensions between feminism and \"experimental\" ethnography can be captured by attending to writing practices in book reviews of Freeman's refutation of Mead. It compares reviews by George Marcus, Bonnie Nardi, and Albert Wendt, a Samoan writer. What follows is a discussion of feminist ethnography as an emergent response to the masculine bias of experimentalism. Lila Abu-Lughod's \"Can There be a Feminist Ethnography?\" redraws lines between feminist anthropology, experimental ethnography, and \"halfie\" or bicultural identity.\n      </p>", "In this paper I argue that any serious attempt to move sociology toward a viable multiculturalism will require an interrogation of the fundamental and historical forces at work in Western epistemological traditions. I focus on two such major historical forces: the Platonic subject/object separation and Judaeo-Christian theology.

Most critics correctly point out that Chicana/o ambivalence cannot be separated from the conflicted material realities historically experienced by Mexican Americans, but this view has not prevented some critics from tiptoeing into the idealist terrain of postmodernism. Postmodernist theory has provided Chicana/o criticism with conceptual tools for explaining the heterogeneity of culture, but its antagonism toward history and class analysis has limited the potential for Chicana/o studies to develop an effective social criticism. Two postmodernist terms used to describe ambivalence are \"cultural schizophrenia\" and \"heterotopia.\" Historical materialism \u2014 a method that makes truthclaims about social existence after a rigorous critique of the concepts and ideas that emerge from that existence \u2014 stands as a viable alternative to postmodernist theory for the interpretation of Chicana/o literature.\n      </p>", "A basic element of postmodernist theorizing in education is the critique of essentialistic modes of social analysis, including reproductionist theories that seek to specify how schooling is structurally linked to the capitalist socio-economic system. Critical postmodernists, notably Henry Giroux, Peter McLaren, and Stanley Aronowitz, agree that reproductionist theories are problematic and contend that an anti-essentialistic approach is more fruitful. I argue, however, that their version of anti-essentialism pre-supposes certain false dualisms, and is thus fundamentally flawed. Furthermore, their notion of postmodernity--which is based in part on anti-essentialism--fails to adequately characterize key developments in contemporary capitalism. In summary, critical postmodernism does not help us 'name the system' as part of the effort to develop a more viable theory of radical education. A structural, reproductionist theory that takes into account local struggles and 'non-class' phenomena remains an essential part of an emancipatory project to transform existing institutions.\n      </p>", "The essential task of Third World novels, it is said, is to give appropriate form to the national experience and the range of questions that may be asked of these texts must predominantly refer to this experience.

Focusing more narrowly on the politics of reading individual texts the essay examines Salman Rushdie's book Shame.

The premise of the text is that postmodernism offers a different interpretation from modernism about the twin ideas of knowledge and identity. The author concludes by offering suggestions about how postmodernism might reorient the work of comparative higher education research.

Drawing upon the work of Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Derrida and F\u00e9lix Guattari, the paper argues that the current fascination with the quadratic nightmare of relativism, textualism, nihilism and perspectivism derives from a confused analysis of narration and signification. The root of this confusion lies in the persistent inability of human geographers to grasp, write and perform the movement of difference. Rather than decompose things, subjects and events into differential fragments, the paper suggests that writing must strive to immerse itself in a myriad of heterogeneous flows. Several consequences erupt from this immersion: first, writing must flatten the feigned separation of world and text by emphasizing its materiality (anti-representation); secondly, writing must hollow the apparently solid and stable ground upon which it rests through the proliferation of fractal and colloidal concepts (anti-hermeneutic); and thirdly, writing must eschew the herding of events into signs through an interminable interruption of narration and signification (antidialectical). As a general principle, the paper attempts to disrupt the rule of representational thought through a performative decompression, deconstruction and provocation of a paranoid called geography.\n      </p>", "While the postmodern turn in anthropology has largely ignored political economy, gender analysis, and its own theoretical antecedents, it does signal an important shift in attention. The post-structuralist/postmodern perspective alerts us to the problematics of one arena of cultural production, namely, that of ethnographic texts. This perspective, however, can be fruitfully applied not only inwardly, but also outwardly, in investigations of our informants' cultural production. This essay highlights the need for political-economic frames to make sense of such post-structuralist insights.\n      </p>", "The texts of OR are littered, explicitly and implicitly, with myths about the `expert' that are taken for self-evident truths. We would like to challenge these. This paper presents arguments following a postmodern route which views the world as text, where all phenomena and events can be regarded as text and, as such, subject to narrative analysis. Narrative analysis explodes and disperses text to reveal forms and codes according to which meanings are possible. The paper will introduce a case study drawing on our experiences in community OR, which we aim to use to demonstrate this approach.\n      </p>", "This article explores the encounter between autonomous aesthetics, mass genre and the publishing category of literary fiction in Martin Amis's Night Train. Taking the confused critical response to the novel as a starting point, I argue that the novel confounded the conventions governing the writing, circulation and consumption of contemporary literary fiction. In analyzing the narrative and stylistic strategies Amis deploys in exploiting the conventions of crime writing, I give an account of the relationship between high autonomous aesthetics and mass genre that made Night Train inimical to the category of literary fiction. Putting Amis's term \u201cpostmodern decadence\u201d to use as a way of conceptualizing this relationship historically, we are able to reorientate our sense of Amis's place in the cultural field and understand the set of factors that have determined his vexed reputation in contemporary literature.\n      </p>", "Richard Rorty's philosophy has two basic commitments: one to postmodernism and the other to liberalism.
