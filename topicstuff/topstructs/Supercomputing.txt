It addresses a variety of applications of supercomputers and the characteristics of a large modern supercomputing facility, the radical changes in the design of supercomputers that are impending, and the conditions that are necessary for a conducive climate for the further development and application of supercomputers.\n      </p>", "On 1 October 2004, the most ambitious high-performance Grid project in the United States-the TeraGrid-became fully operational. Resources at nine sites-the San Diego Supercomputer Center, the California Institute of Technology, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, the University of Chicago/Argonne National Laboratory, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, Texas Advanced Computing Center, Purdue University, Indiana University and Oak Ridge National Laboratory-were joined via an ultra-fast optical network, unified policies and security procedures and a sophisticated distributed computing software environment. Funded by the National Science Foundation, the TeraGrid enables scientists and engineers to combine distributed, multiple data sources with computation at any of the sites or link massively parallel computer simulations to extreme-resolution visualizations at remote sites. A single shared utility lets multiple resources be easily leveraged and provides improved access to advanced computational capabilities. One of the demonstrations of this new model for using distributed resources, Teragyroid, linked the infrastructure of the TeraGrid with computing resources in the United Kingdom via a transatlantic data fibre link. Once connected, the software framework of the RealityGrid project was used to successfully explore lattice-Boltzmann simulations involving lattices of over one billion sites.\n      </p>", "More and more scientists and engineers are becoming interested in using supercomputers. Earlier barriers to using these machines are disappearing as software for their use improves. Meanwhile, new parallel supercomputer architectures are emerging that may provide rapid growth in performance. These systems may use a large number of processors with an intricate memory system that is both parallel and hierarchical; they will require even more advanced software. Compilers that restructure user programs to exploit the machine organization seem to be essential. A wide range of algorithms and applications is being developed in an effort to provide high parallel processing performance in many fields. The Cedar supercomputer, presently operating with eight processors in parallel, uses advanced system and applications software developed at the University of Illinois during the past 12 years. This software should allow the number of processors in Cedar to be doubled annually, providing rapid performance advances in the next decade.\n      </p>", "The performance of von Neumann (serial) computers improved by a factor of $10^{6}$ between 1955 and 1990. Within the next decade we expect to see similar improvements delivered by parallel supercomputers. As this new technology matures, it shifts from being a research topic to being a fundamental tool for scientific, engineering, and business applications. Multiprocessor systems that once cost several million dollars and were found only in government laboratories are now very affordable. They have proliferated in academia, high-technology industries, and business. This new technology has also penetrated the practice of management science. Parallel and supercomputers could change the way management scientists apply the tools of their trade and influence the decision-making process.\n      </p>", "A computer experiment generates observations by running a computer model at inputs x and recording the output (response) Y. Prediction of the response Y to an untried input is treated by modeling the systematic departure of Y from a linear model as a realization of a stochastic process. For given data (selected inputs and the computed responses), best linear prediction is used. The design problem is to select the inputs to predict efficiently. The issues of choice of stochastic-process model and computation of efficient designs are addressed, and applications are made to some chemical kinetics problems.\n      </p>", "We consider two random sequential packing processes in which spheres of unit radius are randomly attached to the surface of a fixed unit sphere. Independent random spheres are generated and added successively, provided there is no overlap with previous spheres. In model 1, the process stops when a trial sphere intersects one of the previously-accepted spheres. In model 2, random sequential packing, any such overlapping trial sphere is discarded and the next random sphere is tried, until it is impossible to add any further spheres. Previous workers have conjectured convincingly that no exact analytical solution is possible for this type of problem. We use Monte Carlo simulation methods to estimate transition probabilities for the two models. Because some probabilities are extremely small, a simulation using independent repetitions of the model would be inefficient. We designed a branching process of conditionally binomial trials, and performed over 108 trials on a supercomputer.\n      </p>", "Network information systems reached the public consciousness this year as a result of the phenomenal growth in the use of the Internet. In particular, the software constituting NCSA (National Center for Supercomputing Applications) Mosaic and the World Wide Web have made global hypermedia a widespread reality for the first time. The technology underlying this software is described to explain the protocols behind information spaces. These include the historical predecessors, the current protocols with examples, future directions for the software, and discussion of research systems with different architectures. Reasons for its popularity are given, with the goal of illuminating successful services for the National Information Infrastructure.\n      </p>", "The grid has been developed to support large-scale computer simulations in a diverse range of scientific and engineering fields. Consequently, the increasing availability of powerful distributed computing resources is changing how scientists undertake large-scale modelling/simulation. Instead of being limited to local computing resources, scientists are now able to make use of supercomputing facilities around the world. These grid resources comprise specialized distributed three-dimensional visualization environments through to massive computational systems. The scientist usually accesses these resources from reasonably high-end desktop computers. Even though most modern desktop computers are provided with reasonably powerful three-dimensional graphical hardware, not all scientific applications require high-end three-dimensional visualization because the data of interest is essentially numerical or two-dimensional graphical data. For these applications, a much simpler two-dimensional graphical displays can be used. Since large jobs can take many hours to complete the scientist needs access to a technology that will allow them to still monitor and control their job while away from their desks. This paper describes an effective method of monitoring and controlling a set of chained computer simulations by means of a lightweight steering client based on a small personal digital assistant (PDA). The concept of using a PDA to steer a series of computational jobs across a supercomputing resource may seem strange at first but when scientists realize they can use these devices to connect to their computation wherever there is a wireless network (or cellular phone network) the concept becomes very compelling. Apart from providing a much needed easy-to-use interface, the PDA-based steering client has the benefit of freeing the scientist from the desktop. It is during this monitoring stage that the hand-held PDA client is of particular value as it gives the application scientist greater freedom to leave his or her desk but still communicate with their simulation, with the proviso that they remain within the range of a wireless network.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The use of sophisticated memory hierarchies enables microprocessor-based machines to have very large memories built from commodity dynamic random access memory while retaining the high bandwidth and low access time needed in a high-performance machine. Parallel processors composed of these high-performance microprocessors are becoming the supercomputing technology of choice for scientific and engineering applications. The challenges for these new supercomputers have been in developing multiprocessor architectures that are easy to program and that deliver high performance without extraordinary programming efforts by users. Recent progress in multiprocessor architecture has led to ways to meet these challenges.\n      </p>", "Well-designed lattice Boltzmann codes exploit the essentially embarrassingly parallel features of the algorithm and so can be run with considerable efficiency on modern supercomputers. Such scalable codes permit us to simulate the behaviour of increasingly large quantities of complex condensed matter systems. In the present paper, we present some preliminary results on the large-scale three-dimensional lattice Boltzmann simulation of binary immiscible fluid flows through a porous medium, derived from digitized X-ray micro-tomographic data of Bentheimer sandstone, and from the study of the same fluids under shear. Simulations on such scales can benefit considerably from the use of computational steering, and we describe our implementation of steering within the lattice Boltzmann code, called LB3D, making use of the RealityGrid steering library. Our large-scale simulations benefit from the new concept of capability computing, designed to prioritize the execution of big jobs on major supercomputing resources. The advent of persistent computational grids promises to provide an optimal environment in which to deploy these mesoscale simulation methods, which can exploit the distributed nature of computer, visualization and storage resources to reach scientific results rapidly; we discuss our work on the grid-enablement of lattice Boltzmann methods in this context.\n      </p>", "Scientific visualization has the potential to make science education more accessible and to provide a means for authentic scientific inquiry. The role of scientific visualization within science is explicated through examples of its use and by presenting a sociological account of science that portrays scientific visualization as an important new inscriptional system. Three examples of using scientific visualization within education are provided: the ChemViz Project at the National Center for Supercomputing Activities, the Image Processing for Teaching (IPT) project at the University of Arizona, and an undergraduate climatology course at the University of Chicago. Potential problems of integrating scientific visualization within secondary education are described, including students' need to learn basic scientific practices, incompatibilities between the format of the traditional high-school classroom and scientific inquiry, and the need for additional infrastructure within schools. Finally, possible solutions to these problems are described, culminating in a view of scientific visualization as a means to provide education with an important new inscriptional system for exploratory, inquiry-driven learning and to link the aims of education to the practices of science.\n      </p>", "r />\n<a href=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1372266851850/PublicationAgreementCopyrightAssignment2013-04-16.pdf\">Publication Agreement</a> (PDF) \n<br />\n<br />\n <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"This link opens in a new window\" href=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1375801381661/PASP_page_charge_form_2012_updated_Jul_2013.pdf\">Page Charges</a> (PDF) \n<br />\n<br />\n <a href=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1290109707760/copy_and_perms.pdf\">Author&#8217;s Permission Guidelines</a> (PDF) \n<br />\n<br />\n <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"This link opens in a new window\" class=\"newWindow\" href=\"http://www.astrosociety.org/membership.html\">ASP Membership</a> \n<br />\n<br />\n <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"This link opens in a new window\" class=\"newWindow\" href=\"http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/PASP.html\">Index of Abstracts</a> \n<br />\n<br />\n <a href=\"/page/journal/publastrsocipaci/confhighindex.html\">Conference Highlights Index</a> \n<br />\n<br />\n <a href=\"/page/journal/publastrsocipaci/reviews.html\">Review Paper Indices</a> \n<br />\n<br />\n <a href=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1294672787522/PASPrecform.pdf\">Library Recommendation Form</a> (PDF) \n<br />\n<br /></p>\n\t\t\t", "r />\n<a href=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1372266851850/PublicationAgreementCopyrightAssignment2013-04-16.pdf\">Publication Agreement</a> (PDF) \n<br />\n<br />\n <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"This link opens in a new window\" href=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1375801381661/PASP_page_charge_form_2012_updated_Jul_2013.pdf\">Page Charges</a> (PDF) \n<br />\n<br />\n <a href=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1290109707760/copy_and_perms.pdf\">Author&#8217;s Permission Guidelines</a> (PDF) \n<br />\n<br />\n <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"This link opens in a new window\" class=\"newWindow\" href=\"http://www.astrosociety.org/membership.html\">ASP Membership</a> \n<br />\n<br />\n <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"This link opens in a new window\" class=\"newWindow\" href=\"http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/PASP.html\">Index of Abstracts</a> \n<br />\n<br />\n <a href=\"/page/journal/publastrsocipaci/confhighindex.html\">Conference Highlights Index</a> \n<br />\n<br />\n <a href=\"/page/journal/publastrsocipaci/reviews.html\">Review Paper Indices</a> \n<br />\n<br />\n <a href=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1294672787522/PASPrecform.pdf\">Library Recommendation Form</a> (PDF) \n<br />\n<br /></p>\n\t\t\t", "", "r />\n<a href=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1372266851850/PublicationAgreementCopyrightAssignment2013-04-16.pdf\">Publication Agreement</a> (PDF) \n<br />\n<br />\n <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"This link opens in a new window\" href=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1375801381661/PASP_page_charge_form_2012_updated_Jul_2013.pdf\">Page Charges</a> (PDF) \n<br />\n<br />\n <a href=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1290109707760/copy_and_perms.pdf\">Author&#8217;s Permission Guidelines</a> (PDF) \n<br />\n<br />\n <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"This link opens in a new window\" class=\"newWindow\" href=\"http://www.astrosociety.org/membership.html\">ASP Membership</a> \n<br />\n<br />\n <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"This link opens in a new window\" class=\"newWindow\" href=\"http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/PASP.html\">Index of Abstracts</a> \n<br />\n<br />\n <a href=\"/page/journal/publastrsocipaci/confhighindex.html\">Conference Highlights Index</a> \n<br />\n<br />\n <a href=\"/page/journal/publastrsocipaci/reviews.html\">Review Paper Indices</a> \n<br />\n<br />\n <a href=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1294672787522/PASPrecform.pdf\">Library Recommendation Form</a> (PDF) \n<br />\n<br /></p>\n\t\t\t", "We describe JOINT DEFENDER, a new two-sided optimization model for planning the pre-positioning of defensive missile interceptors to counter an attack threat. In our basic model, a defender pre-positions ballistic missile defense platforms to minimize the worst-case damage an attacker can achieve; we assume that the attacker will be aware of defensive pre-positioning decisions, and that both sides have complete information as to target values, attacking-missile launch sites, weapon system capabilities, etc. Other model variants investigate the value of secrecy by restricting the attacker's and/or defender's access to information. For a realistic scenario, we can evaluate a completely transparent exchange in a few minutes on a laptop computer, and can plan near-optimal secret defenses in seconds. JOINT DEFENDER's mathematical foundation and its computational efficiency complement current missile-defense planning tools that use heuristics or supercomputing. The model can also provide unique insight into the value of secrecy and deception to either side. We demonstrate with two hypothetical North Korean scenarios.\n      </p>", "Our understanding of the physics of biological molecules, such as proteins and DNA, is limited because the approximations we usually apply to model inert materials are not, in general, applicable to soft, chemically inhomogeneous systems. The configurational complexity of biomolecules means the entropic contribution to the free energy is a significant factor in their behaviour, requiring detailed dynamical calculations to fully evaluate. Computer simulations capable of taking all interatomic interactions into account are therefore vital. However, even with the best current supercomputing facilities, we are unable to capture enough of the most interesting aspects of their behaviour to properly understand how they work. This limits our ability to design new molecules, to treat diseases, for example. Progress in biomolecular simulation depends crucially on increasing the computing power available. Faster classical computers are in the pipeline, but these provide only incremental improvements. Quantum computing offers the possibility of performing huge numbers of calculations in parallel, when it becomes available. We discuss the current open questions in biomolecular simulation, how these might be addressed using quantum computation and speculate on the future importance of quantum-assisted biomolecular modelling.\n      </p>", "Computer experiments often are performed to allow modeling of a response surface of a physical experiment that can be too costly or difficult to run except by using a simulator. Running the experiment over a dense grid can be prohibitively expensive, yet running over a sparse design chosen in advance can result in insufficient information in parts of the space, particularly when the surface calls for a nonstationary model. We propose an approach that automatically explores the space while simultaneously fitting the response surface, using predictive uncertainty to guide subsequent experimental runs. We use the newly developed Bayesian treed Gaussian process as the surrogate model; a fully Bayesian approach allows explicit measures of uncertainty. We develop an adaptive sequential design framework to cope with an asynchronous, random, agent-based supercomputing environment by using a hybrid approach that melds optimal strategies from the statistics literature with flexible strategies from the active learning literature. The merits of this approach are borne out in several examples, including the motivating computational fluid dynamics simulation of a rocket booster.\n      </p>", "Human activity, art oriented or not, implies an aesthetic component. Intelligence participates in this activity by helping to define goals in knowledged-based selection from among many options, while the aesthetic component structures outcomes, endows them with expressive power, and facilitates communication. Artifacts qualifying as works of art embody human intelligence and sensibility, as well as the experience of aesthetically applied technology. Imitation of past artistic paradigms, even when new technologies (computer-based or not) are used, precludes the discovery of new sources of beauty and thus precludes originality. The expansion and redefinition of the artistic universe that new science and technology make possible have already resulted in a broader notion of art and in new forms of artistic activity. Consequently, our concept of beauty is emancipated and expanded to include the beauty of scientific theories, some requiring visual means of expression that only new technology makes available.\n      </p>", "Determining the magnitude and location of neural sources within the brain that are responsible for generating magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals measured on the surface of the head is a challenging problem in functional neuroimaging. The number of potential sources within the brain exceeds by an order of magnitude the number of recording sites. As a consequence, the estimates for the magnitude and location of the neural sources will be ill-conditioned because of the underdetermined nature of the problem. One well-known technique designed to address this imbalance is the minimum norm estimator (MNE). This approach imposes an L\u00b2 regularization constraint that serves to stabilize and condition the source parameter estimates. However, these classes of regularizer are static in time and do not consider the temporal constraints inherent to the biophysics of the MEG experiment. In this paper we propose a dynamic state-space model that accounts for both spatial and temporal correlations within and across candidate intracortical sources. In our model, the observation model is derived from the steady-state solution to Maxwell's equations while the latent model representing neural dynamics is given by a random walk process. We show that the Kalman filter (KF) and the Kalman smoother [also known as the fixedinterval smoother (FIS)] may be used to solve the ensuing high-dimensional state-estimation problem. Using a well-known relationship between Bayesian estimation and Kalman filtering, we show that the MNE estimates carry a significant zero bias. Calculating these high-dimensional state estimates is a computationally challenging task that requires High Performance Computing (HPC) resources. To this end, we employ the NSF Teragrid Supercomputing Network to compute the source estimates. We demonstrate improvement in performance of the state-space algorithm relative to MNE in analyses of simulated and actual somatosensory MEG experiments. Our findings establish the benefits of high-dimensional state-space modeling as an effective means to solve the MEG source localization problem.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "The interdisciplinary research environment coupled with supercomputer graphics is affording new opportunities for collaborations between artists and scientists.
