However, gender-related feelings of objectification, vulnerability, and fear in this space limit women's participation. In this study, the authors investigate how women pursue their enjoyment of urban outdoor recreation at South Mountain Park in Phoenix, Arizona, despite their perceptions and experiences related to fear of violence. Through surveys and interviews with women who recreate at South Mountain, the authors look at the ways the women cope with their fear using various strategies. This study reveals the gender-related conflicts that persist for participants, who grapple with their appreciation of uncompromised nature and their need to feel safe in this environment. Ultimately, they illustrate how an ongoing negotiation exists for the women as the authors balance choices and concerns related to their outdoor recreation and what aspects of surveillance and control they consider, reject, or accept.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "This paper explores the experience of the outdoors in early childhood education in urban areas. It is based on fieldwork conducted in four settings in Dublin, Ireland in 2005. Using the central concept of affordance, the paper builds on Kytt\u00e4's earlier work (2002; 2004) by considering young children's experiences of the outdoors in terms of perceived and utilized affordances. These are analyzed in relation to three fields of action in early childhood education and care settings: indoor-outdoor connectedness, enclosed outdoor space, and the wider outdoors. Such a framework, it is proposed, offers a useful means to evaluate outdoor provision of services for young children.\n      </p>", "The objective of this study was to compare the effects of rearing calves outdoors, with and without all-weather calf jackets, with calves reared indoors on calf immunity and animal performance. In February 1999, male Holstein calves (mean (s.e.) weight 55 (1.90) kg) were randomly assigned to one of three treatments (n=30 per treatment): 1) outdoors with jacket, (J; mean age 19 (s.e. 2.0) days); 2) outdoors without jacket (NJ; mean age 19 (s.e. 1.8) days), and 3) indoors on straw (I; mean age 19 (s.e. 1.0) days). Calves received an individual allowance of 25 kg of milk replacer dry matter during the first 42 days with ad libitum access to a concentrate ration from day 0 to 63. The jackets were removed from the calves on day 42. Live-weight gain from day 0 to day 63 of the study was not significantly different between treatments (J, 0.79; NJ, 0.80; I, 0.80 kg). Sixty percent of the J calves and 53% of the NJ calves required four or more antibiotic treatments for respiratory disease while corresponding treatments were required for 97% of the I calves. The incidence of diarrhoea was significantly higher in both outdoor treatments compared to the I treatment. There was no significant difference in white blood cell counts or in serum immunoglobulin concentrations between treatments on days 0, 21, 42 and 63 or in in vitro interferon-\u03b3 production on day 63. It is concluded that using calf jackets on calves reared outdoors had no beneficial effect on calf performance or immune status. The incidence of respiratory disease was higher and diarrhoea incidence was lower in calves reared indoors compared with calves reared outdoors. There was no significant difference in incidences of diarrhoea and respiratory disease between the two outdoor treatments.\n      </p>", "Fieldwork is an integral component of the geography degree. It is perceived by lecturers and students alike as an enjoyable, valuable learning experience outside in the real world. But what determines the type of field experiences we offer? To what extent is the fieldwork experience informed by best practice in pedagogy, research location and field, institutional practice/constraints, leader's outdoor experience, or a combination of all these and more? This paper offers a personal reflection on physical geography fieldtrip design in New Zealand, Britain and Spain involving New Zealand and British students over a period of 14 years, spanning two contrasting university systems and two institutions. A range of learning experiences is considered: residential and day trips, Cook's Tours and detailed investigations. These cover a range of academic and altitudinal levels from first year to final year undergraduate and from sea level to mountain top. Key drivers in the design and development of these field courses are considered in order to explore the reason for taking students to a plethora of 'high places', defined not only in the sense of altitude, but also in the sense of perceived intrinsic geographical value. The role played by the 'great outdoors' in fostering development of geographical knowledge is discussed by considering the notion that taking students outside to learn in 'high places' will automatically be of a cognitive advantage and intrinsically foster deeper levels of learning. The outdoor environment has much to offer the development of geographical knowledge among student cohorts, but care is required to maximise its potential.\n      </p>", "Diarrhoea, abdominal pain, malaise and fever affected 75 of the 88 conscript soldiers in Utti, Finland after an outdoors infantry drill. Campylobacter jejuni, heat-stable serotype 3/43/59, was isolated from 37 out of 63 men investigated. A clear serological response was evident in the risk group and negligible in the control group. The entire population at risk was interviewed. The outbreak was associated with the consumption of untreated surface water. C. jejuni, heat-stable serotype 3/43/59, was isolated on two occasions from the water source.\n      </p>", "Machines that provide people with nearby sources of outdoor warmth have become increasingly popular in the UK as a crop of mushroom-shaped technologies has started to spring up outside many public houses and private homes in this country. Yet this development has also received considerable condemnation from advocates of sustainable consumption, who have seemingly been disgusted by the societal selfindulgence that they see in these devices. Moving away from these more immediate forms of outrage, this paper enriches our understanding of their arrival by considering these heaters in terms of cultural conventions of thermal adaptation and the changing geographies that can be attached to them. Through these means, it is argued that a more nuanced understanding of why these technologies have become prevalent is produced and that an existing disciplinary interest in embodied outdoor experience is taken towards some important new spaces for study.\n      </p>", "           ", "Learning Landscapes is a place-based education and stewardship program established in rural, mountainous northeastern California.

Human and physical geographers have pursued different paths of academic research on the outdoors, ranging from 'objective' empirical epistemologies to understandings of outdoor spaces as socially constructed. The special section highlights that more-than-representational accounts and more-thanscientific encounters have the potential to bridge human and physical geographies and lead to new understandings of the outdoors. In this editorial overview we argue for the outdoors as a site of boundary crossing between human and physical, and between 'academic' and 'explorer', geographies.\n      </p>", "Patterns of leaf carbohydrate partitioning and nodule activity in soybean plants grown under natural conditions and the irradiance level required to produce sufficient carbohydrate to obtain maximum rates of apparent N2-fixation (acetylene reduction) were measured. Soybean plants, grown outdoors, maintained constant levels of leaf soluble sugars while leaf starch pools varied diurnally. When root temperature was kept at 25\u00b0C and shoot temperature was allowed to vary with ambient temperature, the plants maintained constant rates of apparent N2-fixation and root+nodule respiration. Results from a second experiment, in which the entire plant was kept at 25\u00b0C, were similar to those of the first experiment. Shoot carbon exchange rate of plants from the second experiment was light saturated at photosynthetic photon flux densities between 400 and 600 micromoles per square meter per second. When plants were subjected to an extended 40-hour dark period to deplete carbohydrate reserves, apparent N2-fixation was unaffected during the first 10 hours of darkness, decreased rapidly between 10 and 16 hours, and plateaued at one-third the initial level thereafter. After the extended dark period, plants were exposed to photosynthetic photon flux density from 200 to 1000 micromoles per square meter per second for 10 hours. Photosynthetic photon flux densities of 200 micromoles per square meter per second and greater resulted in maximum leaf soluble sugar content and nodule activity. Leaf starch content increased with irradiance levels up to 600 micromoles per square meter per second with no further increase at higher irradiance levels. Results presented here indicate that maximum nodule activity occurs at irradiance levels that do not saturate the plant's photosynthetic apparatus. This response would allow for maximum N2-fixation to occur in a nodulated legume during periods of inclement weather.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

This article discusses the transformative role of studying nature outdoors (turning novices into naturalists) in eighteenth-century Sweden, using the littleknown journeys of Carl Back (1760-1776), Sven Anders Hedin (1750-1821) and Johan Lindwall (1743-1796) as examples. On these journeys, through different parts of Sweden in the 1770s, the outdoors was used, simultaneously, as both a classroom and a space for exploration. The article argues that this multifunctional use of the landscape (common within the Linnaean tradition) encouraged a democratization of the consumption of scientific knowledge and also, to some degree, of its production. More generally, the study also addresses issues of how and why science and scientists travel by discussing how botanical knowledge was reproduced and extended 'on the move', and what got senior and junior students moving.\n      </p>", "Drawing on an ethnographic account of a Mountain Rescue training exercise, this paper uses Halfacree's threefold model of rurality in an effort to reconcile structural and experiential research on the outdoors.
