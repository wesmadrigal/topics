The introduction of the sugarbeet from Europe supplied not only a source of sugar and income, but also a sense of dignity and independence to early Mormon pioneers seeking refuge from intense religious persecution. As the major cash crop in early Mormon settlements, cultivation of sugarbeet directly provided security for farmers, and indirectly the economic foundation for workers in many other areas. However, in the last three decades, changes in world and U.S. sugar prices have rendered sugarbeet cultivation in some areas of the Intermountain West economically untenable, and the crop has been commercially abandoned. /// Beta vulgaris L. jug\u00f3 un papel econ\u00f3mico de suma importancia en Utah entre 1852 a 1979.

This approach is then applied to the corpus of Mormon scripture. The historical foundation of the Mormon Church, in particular the church's dependence on the authenticity of the story of Joseph Smith and the genesis of the Book of Mormon, has become increasingly subjected to the stress of open inquiry. This paper contributes to this questioning of the origins of the Mormon faith by assessing the stylometric evidence for or against multiple authorship of the Book of Mormon itself.\n      </p>", "The Central-hall house was brought into the American West by Mormons, members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This house type has two basic floor plans, the narrow \"I\" and the wider \"Four over Four\" types. The Central-hall plan has a rich folklore in Mormon Country. Although some \"Gentiles\" built this type, it was generally outmoded by the time the West was opening up. Gentile settlements were dominated by Victorian and other stylistic influences which the Mormons rejected for religious and cultural reasons. The Central-hall house, along with other cultural elements, is helpful in detecting areas of the West settled by the Mormons.\n      </p>", "Swarming and mass migration are spectacular and sometimes devastating features of the biology of various animal species. These phenomena are typically associated with actual or anticipated depletion of food resources after an increase in population density, but the mechanisms driving such collective movements are poorly understood. Here we reveal that insects in large, coordinated migratory bands consisting of millions of Mormon crickets in western North America were deprived of two essential nutritional resources: protein and salt. The insects themselves provided a major source of these nutrients, and cannibalism was rife. We show that protein and salt satiation reduced cannibalism and that protein satiation inhibited walking. Additionally, experimentally reducing the motility or mobility of crickets substantially increased their risk of being cannibalized by other band members. As a result, the availability of protein and salt in the habitat will influence the extent to which bands march, both through the direct effect of nutrient state on locomotion and indirectly through the threat of cannibalism by resource-deprived crickets approaching from the rear. The crickets are, in effect, on a forced march. Migratory band formation and subsequent mass movement, therefore, are manifestations of specific tradeoffs between the costs and benefits of group living. Bands afford antipredator benefits to individual group members. Group movement then mitigates the resulting costs of intraspecific competition, namely local depletion of nutritional resources and the associated increased risk of cannibalism.\n      </p>", "Mulberry trees in Northern Utah were located by historical references to local sericulture and by examining vegetation in proximity to pioneer-era two-story houses. It was usually in the upstairs bedrooms of these larger homes where silkworms were raised, and many of these houses planted one or two mulberry trees in their yards. Although mulberry planting and sericulture were once advocated by early Mormon leaders as a means to achieve economic self-sufficiency, ultimately this social and economic experiment failed, leaving relic mulberry groves dotted throughout Utah. Most of these groves have now disappeared in the wake of urban expansion. Preservation of a few relic trees is proposed as a means of preserving cultural ties to the past. /// Les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00e0 la s\u00e9riculture dans les histoires locales et l'analyse de la v\u00e9g\u00e9tation pr\u00e8s des maisons \u00e0 deux \u00e9tages de l'\u00e9poque des pionniers r\u00e9v\u00e8lent l'existence des m\u00fbriers dans le nord de l'Utah.

This article shows that successful Mormon colonization of the Little Colorado River Basin had an ultimate ecological basis: the redistribution of surplus resources among settlements situated in dispersed and functionally independent local environments. Two systems of resource redistribution among 19th-century Little Colorado Mormon settlements are examined, showing that ecological considerations explain their differential success as adaptive mechanisms contributing to the success of this local colonization effort. The article concludes by suggesting that general ecology provides a useful theoretical framework for explaining successful Mormon colonization in this region and elsewhere.\n      </p>", "By describing the ecological implications of Mormon settlement in the Little Colorado River Basin, the paper demonstrates: (1) the application of general ecological concepts in human ecology, (2) the ecological basis for the evolution of complex human communities, (3) the interactive, hierarchical relationship between community diversity and environmental stability, and (4) the positive contribution that human ecology can make to the general discussion of diversity and stability in ecological systems. The paper gives a brief description of Mormon colonization in the Little Colorado River Basin. Local differences in community development are then related to environmental variation within the basin and compared to general ecological research expectations. The implications of community development in this region for explaining the relationship between diversity and stability in ecological systems are discussed.\n      </p>", "Possessions may be a burden to nomadic people of the present and past, but for those moving to more permanent dwellings, possessions offer a means to shed, transport, or create meanings across locales. Mormon pioneer diaries and other historical personal documents are used to assess the meanings and importance of the possessions these pioneers brought on their journey. Computer-assisted qualitative analyses of these documents suggested five major categories of possession symbolism: (1) sacred meanings, (2) material meanings, (3) personal meanings, (4) familial meanings, and (5) communal meanings. Within some of these categories of meaning there are notable differences between men and women. Even though the present findings are based on a particular group and time period, it seems likely that these types of symbolic possession meanings are also to be found in other moves.\n      </p>", "Ten preceramic archaeological sites were located and extensively surface collected during July, 1970, as the result of a survey of the proposed realignment of the Flagstaff-Clints Well Highway. Based on an analysis of projectile point styles, all of the sites appear to date to late preceramic times, although the general area was probably inhabited during both earlier and later periods. The sites are grouped into two functional categories: possible hunting blinds overlooking Mormon Lake, and campsites where initial processing of game and vegetal food resources may have taken place.\n      </p>", "John Nicholson's The Preceptor is the first book dedicated to an explicitly Mormon rhetorical theory, which he attempts to employ in the troubled landscape of LDS missionary training. This essay examines Nicholson's advice to missionaries, and argues that The Preceptor links logos and the Holy Spirit together in homiletic division of labor, connecting traditional Christian preaching with indigenous Mormon style and theology. By studying The Preceptor we can gain an appreciation for how rhetorical theories develop specific features that reflect a particular culture's location in history and society, and examine a rhetoric that served as an alternative to mainstream American religious and secular rhetorical development.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

We modeled cricket respiration at the ecosystem level using air and body temperatures and insect gas exchange measurements. Cricket CO\u2082 efflux values were compared to ecosystem CO\u2082 flux from eddy covariance measurements in 3 Great Basin ecosystems: a juniper woodland, a sagebrush shrubland, and a crested wheatgrass pasture.

During outbreak years, annual losses attributed to it have amounted to millions of dollars. Nonchemical controls are needed for environmentally sensitive areas \u2014 an increasing concern. Myco-insecticides are available but show an unpredictable and unexplainable lack of effect on Mormon crickets. This research sought to understand performance of Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium brunneum under field conditions, compared to studies showing excellent performance under laboratory conditions. Our objectives were: (1) to evaluate B. bassiana GHA and M. brunneum F52 for potential use against Mormon crickets; (2) to compare spray and bait formulations of each fungus against immature and adult Mormon crickets; and (3) to understand the effect of Mormon-cricket body temperatures on the speed of efficacy by the two fungi. No mortality of 3rd-instar Mormon crickets was detected in the field 14 d after treatment with fungal baits or sprays of either B. bassiana Strain GHA or M. brunneum Strain F52. Unexpected bait aversion may have adversely affected the success of the bait treatments. Lack of spray efficacy was also unexpected, given the laboratory infectivity of both fungi for the Mormon cricket. Possible body temperatures were estimated by thermal surrogates located on the ground and in the plant canopy within field cages. Surrogate temperatures below 18\u00b0C, as well as above 30\u00b0C, were common during the study. When cumulative amount of time at temperatures optimal for fungal growth (18 to 30\u00b0C) was calculated for the duration of the post-treatment observation period, there was an insufficient number of fungal growth hours to produce mortality within the 14-d post-treatment period. Our data suggest that at least 32 to 43 d (M. brunneum) or 58 to 75 d (B. bassiana) should have been required for insect mortality to occur under the conditions of the test. In a second test, targeting seventh-instar nymphs and adults, the in-field mortality was not followed, but treated individuals were incubated both indoors and in outdoor cages. Infections by B. bassiana and M. brunneum in the indoor-incubated insects caused 69 and 100% mortality (corrected for untreated controls) respectively, with 71 and 80% mycosis in cadavers. Mormon crickets in outdoor cages succumbed to unexpected high temperatures. Our data illustrate the importance of Mormon cricket body temperatures and their effects on fungal infection. Because physical location and thermoregulation may alter the environ inside the insect, at least a month may be required after treatment for infections by B. bassiana GHA and M. brunneum F52 to cause mortality. Future studies should take this longer observational time into account. There is some potential for faster fungal growth in Mormon crickets under natural conditions, as opposed to our experimental cages, particularly in the immature stages. Mormon crickets aggregate in sheltered locations under inclement weather and at night. This behavior may conserve and actually promote body temperatures more favorable to fungal development. The potential value of this aspect of Mormon cricket behavior will require additional study.\n      </p>", "Divorces among Mormon, non-Mormon, and mixed couples were compared by administering a questionnaire to their children at two Western universities.

The leaders selected the Salt Lake Valley as a destination on the basis of reports of explorers, and their perception of the region was formed before they ever saw the West. The central feature of the leaders' perception was the idea that the division between the then Oregon and California territories at the 42 parallel marked a climatic divide. Believing it was too cold for crops north of that boundary, Mormon leaders directed their settlement efforts southward from the Salt Lake Valley for three decades. Because the regions to the south were arid and only marginal for settlement, the leaders faced a constant struggle in convincing migrants they should attempt their settlement. To convince prospective settlers that they could successfully occupy the marginal sites of the Southwest, the leaders in their public statements transformed the Mormon perception of the Salt Lake Valley. The initially favorable reaction to the valley was ignored as leaders maintained that the Wasatch Oasis had been a desert just like the desert areas the settlers were encouraged to occupy. The transformation of the original Mormon perception of the environment served the short-term goal of directing settlement south, but in the process the originally favorable view was lost.

Commitment rhetoric is measured by calculating \"salience scores\" based on a content analysis of a representative sample of Mormon General Conference addresses. Major findings are: 1) There are consistent differences in the relative salience of commitment categories, but the ordering of these differences changes over time. 2) Transcendence is by far the most salient category of commitment rhetoric during every period of Mormon history. 3) There is a pronounced curvilinear relationship between all categories of commitment and the passage of time.

These references are limited to the English language citations in the major bibliographic reference works such as the International Index to the Social Sciences, the Social Science Citation Index, Sociological Abstracts, and the indexes to the major scholarly journals of religion not cited in these general reference works. During the first half of the twentieth century, scholarly literature on the Mormons dealt primarily with historical and contemporary studies of social geography, rural sociology, agricultural economics, the family, and fertility among the Mormons. Although these topics continue to be studied, since mid-century new foci of interest have appeared in the literature, including the impact of modernization and secularization upon the Mormon subculture and religion; shifting public images of Mormonism; Mormon involvement in politics; Mormon relationships with ethnic groups, especially with blacks; sex roles and the position of women within the Mormon subculture; and the growth of Mormonism outside North America. A somewhat less prominent, but also important, emphasis in the more recent literature is Mormon religiosity and its consequences. Among the potentially interesting topics scarcely addressed in any of the literature on Mormons are social stratification and the distribution of power within the Mormon Church and communities; parent-child relationships (despite a fairly large extant literature on other family topics); deviant behavior, singleness and divorce, the erosion of patriarchy, and internal efforts to deal with these phenomena; plus proselyting, conversion, defection, and schisms within the Mormon movement. Much could also be learned from more extensive studies of the consequences of the large-scale \"exportation\" of Mormonism now underway, especially in the Third World, given the recent observation by prominent non-Mormon scholars that Mormonism may be on the verge of mushrooming into the first new world religion since Islam.\n      </p>", "Mormon religious and economic self-sufficiency throve best on isolation, yet Brigham Young hailed the coming of the railroad.

Glock and Rodney Stark in their recent book, Christian Beliefs and Anti-Semitism. The Mormon study used a questionnaire and a theoretical model which were very similar to those of Glock and Stark. The results of the study showed Mormons less likely than any of the other denominations to hold secular anti-Jewish notions, such as that Jews cheat in business or are disloyal and unpatriotic. While Mormons did tend to believe in certain negative religious ideas about Jews (such as that God was punishing them for their unfaithfulness), these ideas were \"neutralized\" by a simultaneous belief in the doctrine of \"Semitic identification,\" and thus were not carried over in the form of negative secular ideas about Jews, as was the case with other denominations.

Howsepian accuses Mormons of crude polytheism and of conceiving of their divinities as capable of progression. In reply, it is pointed out that Howsepian frequently misrepresents Mormon theology. Once a distinction is made between divine persons (which may be multiple) and divinity itself (which is one but may be manifest in a community of divine persons), Mormon theology can be seen to be theistic if orthodox trinitarian Christianity is theistic. Mormon beliefs do recognize potentiality and change in deity, but in this they are like other 20th century religious systems which have rejected Greek metaphysics as a basis for theism.\n      </p>", "Mormon fertility is responsive to both religious and socioeconomic pressures; while maintaining itself at a level significantly above that of the rest of the nation, it is, at the same time, paralleling the general downward trend.

Most North American species of Ephedra are dispersed by seed\u2010caching rodents, and this mode of dispersal is not represented in Ephedra from other continents (i.e., arid portions of South America, North Africa, Europe, Asia), perhaps because of a more diverse assemblage of seed\u2010caching rodents in North America than in these other regions.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

We hypothesize that Mormons are likely to \"follow their leaders\" on political questions when two conditions hold: (1) official endorsement of a position by LDS church leaders; and (2) internal agreement among those leaders. Each is necessary, but neither is sufficient alone. In 1933, only one of these two conditions held; in 1968 both did. Using ecological inference to generate estimates of individual-level behavior of Mormon and non-Mormon voters in Utah, we find that Mormon voters were significantly more likely to vote in accordance with the Mormon Church's official position in 1968 than in 1933.

The practice of plural marriage, however, remained statistically rare, hierarchical, and rooted in Victorian marriage and family norms. Moreover, the struggle took place as Mormon communities and businesses gradually assimilated to mainstream institutional and political economics. This article asks why, in light of such ambiguities, the Latterday Saints defended plural marriage with such vigor, capitulating only in the face of the most aggressive federal anti-polygamy legislation. I argue that plural marriage was a vital symbol of early Mormon sectarian identity, and that sustained activism in support of the principle allowed Mormons to embody the radical \"peculiarity\" of the church's charismatic origins. This has theoretical implications for an understanding of charisma as a complex and fundamentally socio-cultural phenomenon.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Using the Mormon rhetorical mode of performed testimony, the monologists critiqued the facets of their patriarchal church that prohibit women from speaking publicly about sex and sexual experiences; simultaneously, the Monologues created a \u201csacred space\u201d in which those testimonies\u2014or seximonies\u2014were valid and celebrated. This article argues that the Mormon Vagina Monologues captured the concept of the \u201cutopian performative,\u201d a category within performance studies that describes work filled with promise, potential, and possibility. A number of monologues are examined here, divided into two groups: first, the voices of heterosexual women trying to navigate patriarchal authority while seeking sexual self-expression, and second, the voices of lesbian and transsexual male-to-female Latter-day Saints striving for acceptance and the right to enjoy intimate relationship.\n      </p>", "A local tithing office or bishop's storehouse was found in every Mormon settlement of the Mountain West during the nineteenth century.

It served as communal receiving and disbursing agency, warehouse, weighing station, livestock corral, general store, telegraph office, employment exchange and social security bureau.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze the practice of Mormon polygyny from a theoretical perspective. After analyzing the literature relating to Mormon polygyny, as well as first hand accounts of this practice, I conclude that these three justifications have little to offer in terms of explaining why the Mormons practiced polygyny. The impetus for polygyny among the Mormons appears to have been ideological, while its demise appears to have been related to material factors. The theoretical ideas of the Weberian tradition offer a more useful explanation for Mormon polygyny.

Apres avoir analis\u00e9 la literature a propos de la polygamie chez les Mormons et egalmente les histoires des premieres personnes au sujet de cette practique, je conclurais en disant que ce trois explications n'ont pas beaucoup a offrir pour expliquer pourquoi les Mormons ont practique la polygamie.

The potters and workers left scant records that reveal how their wares fit into Utah's theocratically organized economy. Potters and potteries of 19th-century Utah and the Mormon Domain were part of an archaeological survey conducted between 1999 and 2000. The research project yielded examples of kiln wasters that could be subjected to instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). The results demonstrate the utility of integrating primary records and archaeometric tools in the study of historical era economic processes. Data also indicate the applicability of the approach for potteries in close geographic proximity and to determine patterns of variation within site assemblages. The authors propose an anthropological research program to explore the economics of religion in Mormon Utah, combining the analytical power of archaeometry with the contextualized questioning possible in historical archaeology.\n      </p>", "We used data from a population-based case-control study conducted in Utah from 1984 to 1987 to determine whether the low incidence of cervical carcinoma in Mormon women can be explained by adherence to their religious teachings, which proscribe smoking and extramarital sexual relations.

The protective effect disappeared after controlling for differences in age, sexual behavior, and smoking (OR = 1.22; 95% CI = 0.80-1.87).\n      </p>", "Among modern Western religions, Mormon belief is quite distinctive in its inclusion of a Heavenly Mother figure among its divine personages. This paper examines some of the historical and theological background of the Mormon \"Mother in Heaven.\" We assess different explanations accounting for this belief and show its logical consistency with other aspects of Mormon doctrine. Further, we look at the politics associated with the Mother In Heaven belief which bear on feminist issues among Mormons. In recent times we find that the existence of a divine female has become a rallying symbol for some Mormon feminists within an incipient \"grass roots\" movement aimed at acquiring greater power and equality within the church. We note how this belief in a female deity has primarily functioned in conservative ways to sustain certain institutional ends rather than feminist concerns. Considering the prospects for change in Mormonism's position on the role of women, we conclude that the presence of a goddess in the pantheon is no guarantee of sexual equality in the real world.\n      </p>", "The transformation of Mormonism from a small, persecuted sect into an established, global faith has attracted scholarly attention for decades. By all accounts, the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were critical for the church\u2019s evolution and modernization. The rapidity of the change, however, leaves nagging questions. After years of costly, principled resistance, how could Mormons, with any semblance of dignity and self-respect, suddenly embrace the institutions and values of their tormentors? How did members of the nineteenth century\u2019s \u201cmost despised large group\u201d become so loyal to the United States in the twentieth?\n         This essay explores the unique, crucial role that American universities played in fostering Mormon-Gentile reconciliation. Right when the animosities were at fever pitch\u2014in the decades between the death of Brigham Young (1877) and Utah\u2019s admission into the Union as the forty-fifth state (1896)\u2014the American university became a liminal, quasi-sacred space where Mormons experienced a radical transformation of consciousness and identity. In the process, they developed an enduring devotion to non-Mormon institutions and deference to non-Mormon expertise. These extra-ecclesial loyalties would dismantle the ideological framework of Mormon separatism and pave the way for Mormons\u2019 voluntary reimmersion into the mainstream of American life.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Thomas F. O'Dea's classic The Mormons identified \"Mormonism's encounter with modern secular thought\" as perhaps the church's greatest problem. In line with secularization theory, O'Dea predicted an attenuation of traditional Mormonism, and an adaptation and gradual liberalization of Mormon theology as the literal interpretation of Mormon origins \"dissolved\" in the solvent of modernity. O'Dea's views on the crisis facing Mormonism were based, in part, on ethnographic field work in Salt Lake City in the summer of 1950, as interpreted by a modernist Catholic sociologist. A review of his field notes suggests that key informants who \"hosted\" much of O'Dea's research activity were liberal Mormon academics who defined the church's traditional theology as a problem. This viewpoint agreed with O'Dea's preconceptions about the \"education and apostasy\" dilemma. A comparison of O'Dea's published \"reading\" of his field notes with the notes themselves suggests the plausibility of alternative readings. One such alternative is offered here, an interpretation of the interplay of education, Mormon theology, and Mormon intellectualism drawn from O'Dea's field notes, but with a different emphasis from that of his essay. Finally, reverting to a modernist perspective, I offer some hints from survey research suggesting that the predicted liberalization of Mormon theology has yet to occur.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
