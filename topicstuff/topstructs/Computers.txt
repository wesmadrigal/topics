The International Data Corporation (McGovern 1980) estimates that the number of desktop computers is increasing by approximately 53,000 each month. Because of the projected widespread use of desktop computers and anticipated improvements in hardware, the potential for impressive statistical computing on these devices is exciting. Two features of desktop computers will be particularly important for those doing statistical analyses: (a) the ease-of-use of the computers, and (b) their extensive graphics capabilities. The author suggests that sophisticated statistical software will be available in the near future on many different models of desktop computers. Indeed, several of the manufacturers provide high-quality software at the present time. The implications for statisticians of a rapid growth rate for desk-top computers are discussed for data analysis, software development, graphics, and instructional usage.\n      </p>", "This retrospective on statistical analysis of literature in the first twenty-four years of Computers and the Humanities divides the essays under review into four groups: the philosophical, the statistical analyses of language, the statistical analyses of literary texts, and the statistical analyses of themes. It begins with the question: must valid statistical analysis of any literary text be based on a complete linguistic description of the language of the text? It summarizes and evaluates over forty essays, giving details on works discussed, sample sizes used, statistical methods applied, and quotations from the researchers. The essay ends with a polemical summary of what has been done and what the future holds. It emphasizes the importance of extended pre-computational stages of learning about language and discourse analysis; reading previous research, building on and challenging theory; and the use of carefully crafted, small databases to test specific questions.\n      </p>", "This paper asks the question: what difference did access to computers make to the first generation of scientists to use them? While we do know something about the use of computers in particular scientific specialities, a comparative perspective across disciplines is revealing. So this paper casts the net wider, not only revisiting microphysics and X-ray crystallography, but also examining natural history and the implicit social science of government administration. It focuses on the period when computers were first introduced, since the novelty of the techniques caused scientists to reflect on the changes. This has the advantage, too, of bringing to light the important relationship between routinization of scientific work prior to computerization and computerization itself.\n      </p>", "The advent of information technology and computers in medicine two decades ago posed a new set of ethical problems. In recent years, these problems have been compounded by the increasing use of computers for supporting clinical decisions as well as administration and record keeping. This presentation considers some of the problems which are raised by the use of computers to support clinical decisions, under the various headings of beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy and justice. For each aspect the problems raised are described and the implications discussed.\n      </p>", "This study estimates quality-adjusted price indexes for personal computers. Three separate hedonic models are estimated using data from 1,841 personal computers over the period 1984-1991. In addition to the traditional linear model, a nonlinear model is developed and estimated. The nonlinear model is parsimonious in parameters, allows time-varying attribute prices, and can be estimated using a pooled data set. The results indicate that nominal quality-adjusted prices of mail-order firms declined at an average annual rate of 24.62%; quality-adjusted prices of major manufacturers declined at a slower rate.\n      </p>", "This study explored the efficacy of promoting a beginning chemistry teacher's curriculum development and teaching practices through the use of computers. Using pictorial analogies, historical cases of science, and discrepant events in a web site designed by the researchers as curricular samples, the beginning teacher was asked to develop similar curriculum for his own teaching. After taking the researchers' advice into account and making adjustments, the beginning teacher implemented the curriculum in his classroom teaching and shared his experience with the researchers by e-mail communications. The teacher's teaching practices both before and after the web site treatment were observed and analyzed. It was found that before the treatment the teacher used the textbook as the only resource of his teaching. Extra curriculum was rarely seen, there were not many student-teacher interactions, and analogies or examples used in his explanation of abstract concepts were not preorganized. On the other hand, after the treatment, the teacher was able to develop suitable curricula by himself for the purpose of increasing student involvement. He also explained the applications of chemical concepts in daily lives and his analogies and demonstrations were well organized. Although the beginning teacher was able to develop curricula after the treatment, many aspects of his teaching can be improved, especially in the areas of student-teacher interaction and the implementation of students activities in science teaching.\n      </p>", "In recent years, much research has shown that technology is not being used in the majority of the nation's classrooms. However, these findings have often failed to include foreign-language teachers and may now be outdated due to the ephemeral nature of technology. Further, research has established that teachers' beliefs may be one of the most effective influences on practices. This study surveyed 340 K-12 Spanish teachers about their use of and beliefs about computers that included questions related to administrative and pedagogic uses of computers as well as beliefs about computers. The survey found that Spanish teachers are using computers administratively on a regular basis and are also reporting some pedagogical use in the classroom. The respondents' knowingly plan their use of computers to emphasize particular language skills and report strong beliefs about the potential of computers for language learning.\n      </p>", "The use of computers in science assessment is viewed through the eyes of the program evaluator by examining six considerations: (1) purpose of computer use in assessment, (2) value of program evaluation models, (3) possible harmful side effects of assessment, (4) nature of imbedded questions, (5) definition of treatment, and (6) computers and the classroom context. Following a discussion of the considerations, four recommendations are offered in regard to continuing to study the use of computers for assessment (examples provided), utilizing the ideas contained in program evaluation models, capitalizing on several interesting, novel possibilities for evaluation design, and combining qualitative and quantitative techniques (mixed methodologies) into the evaluation procedures.\n      </p>", "In this work we review the present status of numerical methods for partial differential equations on vector and parallel computers. A discussion of the relevant aspects of these computers and a brief review of their development is included, with particular attention paid to those characteristics that influence algorithm selection. Both direct and iterative methods are given for elliptic equations as well as explicit and implicit methods for initial-boundary value problems. The intent is to point out attractive methods as well as areas where this class of computer architecture cannot be fully utilized because of either hardware restrictions or the lack of adequate algorithms. A brief discussion of application areas utilizing these computers is included.\n      </p>", "Summary points Handheld computers are suited to clinical practice because they are small, affordable, and easy to use; can read handwriting; and have a long battery life They can run a wide range of medical software The devices support clinical teamwork by making it easy to share information with other clinicians' PCs and handheld computers Ensuring security of your patients' data is vital and requires some effort Make sure your budget includes money for software, textbooks, and hardware expansions\n      </p>", "This paper considers the incomplete Choleski conjugate gradient method for symmetric positive definite linear systems. The goal is to obtain implementations of this method suitable for vector computers which require long vectors for efficiency. This is achieved by a multicoloring strategy which allows efficient solution of the triangular systems of the preconditioning as well as efficient matrix vector multiplication. Numerical results are given for three model problems on a CYBER 205.\n      </p>", "The paper examines exposure, gender, use and organisational level as correlates of Attitudes Toward Computers (ATC) among bank employees in India. The ATC scale and a demographic profile were administered to a sample of 213 bank personnel. The study found no relationship of exposure and gender to ATC. Use of computers was related with ATC. Organisational level showed a strong relationship with ATC, with bank officers holding a much more positive attitude towards computers than clerks. Implications for research and practice are discussed.\n      </p>", "The implementation on vector computers of the $\\mathrm{QR}$ algorithm and of iterative schemes based on obtaining the determinant and its derivatives by Hyman's method are presented. It is shown that iterative schemes based on Hyman's method will probably be more efficient than the $\\mathrm{QR}$ algorithm on vector computers for large matrices. A theoretical comparison of the Laguerre iterative scheme with the $\\mathrm{QR}$ algorithm is presented using the latest available CDC STAR-100 instruction execution times. In addition, the results of several test cases run on the Laguerre-Hyman algorithm on a serial computer are reported.\n      </p>", "Interval arithmetic versions of cyclic reduction algorithms are introduced for tridiagonal systems of equations with interval coefficients on vector computers. Similarly to the solution of noninterval problems, cyclic reduction is used to replace the recursive Gauss algorithm by a method with some parallelism. Interval arithmetic methods require the discussion of properties which are unknown or irrelevant for the usual real floating-point methods. In addition, the vectorization and the numerical behaviour of interval cyclic reduction differ from those of corresponding noninterval methods. Results of numerical experiments on a CRAY X-MP/24 are included.\n      </p>", "A network of minicomputers and satellite distributed control multiplexers (DCUs) form the basis of an integrated process monitoring and control system. Each DCU controls a plant area. A central operations system (COS) interfaces between the process control and monitoring system and the management information processing system (MIPS). The MIPS retrieves data from the process and control and monitoring system and can generate operations, laboratory, and administrative reports. Maintenance, inventory, clerical, process control, and laboratory reports are also generated by a series of personal computers, one of which is networked to the COS. Reports, graphs, and data analyses are quickly and conveniently developed on the personal computers using commercially available software. A master plan for linking the data base at two major treatment facilities is described.\n      </p>", "Objective To examine doctors' perspectives about their experiences with handheld computers in clinical practice. Design Qualitative study of eight focus groups consisting of doctors with diverse training and practice patterns. Setting Six practice settings across the United States and two additional focus group sessions held at a national meeting of general internists. Participants 54 doctors who did or did not use handheld computers. Results Doctors who used handheld computers in clinical practice seemed generally satisfied with them and reported diverse patterns of use. Users perceived that the devices helped them increase productivity and improve patient care. Barriers to use concerned the device itself and personal and perceptual constraints, with perceptual factors such as comfort with technology, preference for paper, and the impression that the devices are not easy to use somewhat difficult to overcome. Participants suggested that organisations can help promote handheld computers by providing advice about purchase and usage, training, and user support. Participants expressed concern about reliability and security of the device but were particularly concerned about dependency and over-reliance as a substitute for clinical thinking. Conclusions Doctors expect handheld computers to become more useful, and most seem interested in leveraging (getting the most value from) their use. Key opportunities with handheld computers included their use as a stepping stone to build doctors' comfort with other information technology and ehealth\n      </p>", "Although mathematical models are routinely applied for management of water quality, decision makers seldom have direct, one-on-one interaction with these quantitative tools. User-friendly programs for personal computers permit use of coupled nonpoint source pollution and water quality response models. The user can manipulate data bases and review various management options in assessing the impact of land use changes and pollution control actions on water quality. Color graphics and animation may be used to communicate complex concepts and principles to nontechnical users. The technique is demonstrated here to evaluate the sensitivity of water quality in Green Bay to changes in land use patterns.\n      </p>", "Multis are a new class of computers based on multiple microprocessors. The small size, low cost, and high performance of microprocessors allow the design and construction of computer structures that offer significant advantages in manufacture, price-performance ratio, and reliability over traditional computer families. Currently, commercial multis consist of 4 to 28 modules, which include microprocessors, common memories, and input-output devices, all of which communicate through a single set of wires called a bus. Adding microprocessors together increases the performance of multis in direct proportion to their price and allows multis to offer a performance range that spans that of small minicomputers to mainframe computers. Multis are commercially available for applications ranging from real-time industrial control to transaction processing. Traditional batch, time-sharing, and transaction systems process a number of independent jobs that can be distributed among the microprocessors of a multi with a resulting increased throughput (number of jobs completed per unit of time). Many scientific applications (such as the solving of partial differential equations) and engineering applications (such as the checking of integrated circuit designs) are speeded up by this parallel computation; thus, multis produce results at supercomputer speed but at a fraction of the cost. Multis are likely to be the basis for the next, the fifth, generation of computers--a generation based on parallel processing.\n      </p>", "This summary essay comments on the contents of and issues raised by the special number of Computers and Humanities on Computers and the Teaching of Literature. It argues against the use of hypertextual resources without careful pedagogical understanding of the dangers they present of encouraging students to become passive consumers rather than active thinkers. It argues for the use of computer-mediated conversation, computer-modeling, and computer analyses of texts as appropriate applications in the literature classroom.\n      </p>", "The electronic computer techniques developed for the design of municipal sanitary wastewater collection systems include linked programs for estimation of design flows, design of sewers, computation of partial-flow characteristics, and estimate of costs. The system recently was applied to the design of the Merrick Harbor Collection District system in Nassau County, N. Y., which has an area of about 5 sq miles (12.7 sq km) and an ultimate population of 39,500 persons. The programs are applicable to any area, regardless of size, topography, configuration, or other special characteristics. Inputs include bases for estimating design flows, sewer design criteria, demographic, topographic, and geologic data, and sewer layout requirements. The program also accepts information about potential obstructions and locates sewers to avoid interference. The computerized procedure improved both quality and quantity of output and released engineering personnel from routine computations.\n      </p>", "Computers are now widely used in product design and in automation of selected areas in factories. Within the next decade, the use of computers in the entire spectrum of manufacturing applications, from computer-aided design to computer-aided manufacturing and robotics, is expected to be practical and economically justified.

Making use of this information, we designed an automatic coordinating system for each facility in the plant. We designed this system by dynamically updating previous schedules, taking into account every possible event or delay to create a complete and systematic schedule each heat should follow to avoid scheduling breakdowns.\n      </p>", "The new field of quantum error correction has developed spectacularly since its origin less than two years ago. Encoded quantum information can be protected from errors that arise due to uncontrolled interactions with the environment. Recovery from errors can work effectively even if occasional mistakes occur during the recovery procedure. Furthermore, encoded quantum information can be processed without serious propagation of errors. Hence, an arbitrarily long quantum computation can be performed reliably, provided that the average probability of error per quantum gate is less than a certain critical value, the accuracy threshold. A quantum computer storing about 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; qubits, with a probability of error per quantum gate of order 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt;, would be a formidable factoring engine. Even a smaller less-accurate quantum computer would be able to perform many useful tasks.

After addressing several econometric issues (mostly overlooked by previous literature) on the appropriate procedure for evaluating computer effects, we found that only for higher-level white collars the wage premium associated with computer usage is substantial; for lower qualifications, the effect vanishes. The use of computers at work increases the number of hours worked, although this effect is small. Moreover, since hourly wages have a negative impact on hours worked, computers seem to exert little, if any, impact on working time.\n      </p>", "Late in the 1980s, Hewlett-Packard (HP) faced inventories mounting into the billions of dollars and alarming customer dissatisfaction with its order fulfillment process. HP produces computation and measurement products whose supply chains include manufacturing integrated circuits, board assembly, final assembly, and delivery to customers. To reduce inventory and improve order fulfillment, HP called on an internal team of industrial engineers and management scientists augmented by academic collaboration. The team used an iterative process, enriched by the interaction of model development and application. HP reaped benefits well beyond its manufacturing operations, extending to diverse functions throughout the organization. Similarly, the academic partners have infused their research with real-life experience. The supply-chain methodology is now mature, and HP is transferring the technology into the product divisions.\n      </p>", "The main purpose of this report is to present the results of the special session, \"Computers in the Water Industry: The Next Five Years,\" held at the 1987 AWWA annual conference in Kansas City, Mo., and sponsored by AWWA's Computer Advances Research Committee.

If this could be reduced, benefits would include increased time for direct patient care and reduced costs. This paper describes a pilot study in the Dumfries and Galloway Health Board to see if computerized vehicle routeing could reduce the distance and time of travelling. It is concluded that problems with implementation and characteristics of nurses' journeys (particularly the short distances travelled between long stops) make it unlikely that net savings could be achieved using computers. Nonetheless, some benefits might be obtained by taking a rational look at aspects of nurses' travelling.\n      </p>", "Transcribing pollen counts from count sheets or mechanical counters into a micro- or mainframe computer is tedious, time-consuming and liable to error.

Similar systems have been available on microcomputers for several years but the unit cost of microcomputers is too great to allow one on the desk of each pollen analyst in a laboratory. Pocket computers can now be purchased and run for less than the cost of mechanical counters and with considerable advantages for the ease and efficiency of collecting and handling of palynological data.

Supposing that accentuation by secondary means reflects an underlying linguistic need, this study investigates the amount of pseudo-accentuation used and the types of marking most represented in Portuguese-language messages. Of 447 Internet postings analyzed, 38% contain no diacritics; the remainder contain some marking, usually in word-final position. Evidently, there exists a strongly felt need to mark accentuation where it is easy and attractive, and to avoid ambiguity, as at word end.

The theoretical lens helps us see how pre-computer punched-card tabulating technology and patterns of technology use in insurance operations structured or shaped the choice and use of computers by insurance firms in the early computer era, even in the presence of new technology advocates arguing for new models of technology and its use. This conservative influence of existing patterns is often underestimated, especially in the case of technologies popularly seen as new and innovative. While structuration leads us to expect reinforcement of existing structures or models most of the time, it also helps us to interpret the exceptions to these patterns that opened the way to new and innovative uses of computer technology in insurance.\n      </p>", "The present use of computers in biological teaching as well as future potential in all levels of biology is described.

Discussion with users entails repetitive rhetoric as they describe a landscape of boring beige boxes. The office PC is indeed a 'clone'-an identical, characterless copy of a bland original. Through the exploration of an archive of computer manufacturers' catalogues, this article shows how previous innovative forms of the computer, informed by cultural references as diverse as science fiction, accepted gender roles and the discourse of status as displayed through objects, have been systematically replaced by the adoption of a 'universal' design conveyed only by the nondescript, self-referential world of office equipment. The acceptance of this lack of innovation in the design of such a truly global, mass-produced, multi-purpose technological artefact has had an enormous effect on the conception, perception and consumption of the computer, and possibly of information technology itself.

A series of simple experiments is used to demonstrate to undergraduates that mental phenomena are real, that they can be studied experimentally, and that they can be modeled insightfully in computational - i.e., information-processing terms. Each experiment illustrates a basic fact or principle of cognitive science: the formal character of algorithms; creativity and the variants of the Turing test; limitations on human memories; the use of cognitive strategies; heuristic techniques of artificial intelligence; formal grammars and their associated parsers; social, societal, and anthropological dimensions of mind; and degrees of logicality in human reasoning.

While the laptop was a revolutionary product, such a narrative works to dismiss a series of products which predated the laptop but which had much the same aim, and to deny a social drive for such products, which had been in evidence for a number of years before the technology to achieve them was available. This article shows that the social drive for the development of portable computing came in part from the 'macho mystique' of concealed technology that was a substantial motif in popular culture at that time. Using corporate promotional material from the National Archive for the History of Computing at the University of Manchester, and interviews with some of the designers and engineers involved in the creation of early portable computers, this work explores the development of the first real laptop computer, the 'GRiD Compass', in the context of its contemporaries. The consequent trajectory of laptop computer design is then traced to show how it has become a product which has a mixture of associated meanings to a wide range of consumers.

While computers have mainly been employed to handle administrative routines, there is growing interest in the use of computers for research connected with policy development and for making \"non-programmed\" as distinct from \"programmed\" decisions. The growing use of computers has wide-ranging effects upon the structure of university administration. The possibility of a total information system threatens to erase traditional jurisdictional lines between organizational units.

Standard National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) measures of the computer capital stock, which are constructed by weighting past investments according to a schedule for economic depreciation (the rate at which capital loses value as it ages), are shown to be inappropriate for growth accounting because they do not capture the effect of a unit of computer capital on productivity. This is due to technological obsolescence: machines that are still productive are retired because they are no longer near the technological frontier, and anticipation of retirement affects economic depreciation. Using a model that incorporates obsolescence, alternative stocks are developed that imply a larger computer-usage effect. This effect, together with the direct effect of increased productivity in the computer-producing sector, accounted for the improvement in U.S. productivity growth over 1996-1998 relative to the previous twenty years.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Some criticize computer use because computers\u2014by their nature mechanistic and algorithmic\u2014support only uncreative thinking and production.

In this analysis of a representative sample of greater New York firms, we show that this use of computing is both widespread and applied to a wide variety of jobs. Contrary to some suggestions, it is does not occur exclusively in large firms with particularly high-tech computing applications. Instead, it appears in all kinds of firms, as an outgrowth of management efforts to control and rationalize work.

The firm had not resolved how many data-base servers would be needed. We partitioned the data bases across multiple servers on a single LAN and developed an analytical methodology to determine the minimum number of data-base servers needed. We showed that, at most, two servers were needed for any branch office.\n      </p>", "Computers are now widely used for monitoring and reporting of operating conditions of wastewater treatment plants.

In response to this dilemma, Soviet scientists developed two opposite discursive strategies. While some scholars 'ideologized' science, translating scientific theories into a value-laden political language, others tried to 'de-ideologize' it by drawing a sharp line between ideology and the supposedly value-neutral, 'objective' content of science. This paper examines how early Soviet computing was shaped by the interplay of military and ideological forces, and affected by the attempts to 'de-ideologize' computers.

There are three distinct costs involved in the hypercube scheduling problem: the cost of detecting a free cube (allocation), the cost of migrating jobs and merging the free spaces to accommodate a larger cube request (relocation) and the cost of not meeting the due date (tardiness). Traditionally, research in this area has focused on finding efficient algorithms for allocating a free cube (if any) in the hypercube system. The relocation cost has been treated as an independent cost metric. The role of scheduling has not received much attention and present subcube allocation methods assume a first-come-first-serve (FCFS) approach over the input job set. This paper considers the underlying scheduling issues in a hypercube processing system and shows how techniques other than FCFS scheduling of the incoming jobs can help in reducing the relocation cost and hence the overall subcube resource assignment cost. We discuss five simple and easily implementable dispatching heuristics, and compare their relative performance with the FCFS scheduling rule to demonstrate the advantages of scheduling in subcube allocation.\n      </p>", "A simulator is a parameter-driven simulation that requires no programming.

Trading volume increased sharply, with the number of shares changing hands on the New York Exchange growing from five million a day in 1965 to twelve million a day in 1968. This expansion overwhelmed the mechanisms brokers used to transfer securities and keep records, which relied heavily on paper and pen. They responded by purchasing computers, but these machines were expensive and demanded more sophisticated management than most firms could provide. Accordingly, many companies botched the process. Moreover, trading volume declined sharply in 1969 and 1970, cutting deeply into brokerage revenue. These factors combined to create a crisis that had, by the end of 1970, forced nearly a sixth of the nation's brokerage firms out of business.

A measure of attitudes toward working with computers was developed and tested on a sample of 284 white collar employee from three manufacturing organizations. The expected structure of `positive' attitudes and `negative' attitudes (concerns) about working with computers was confirmed. Following a review of the related literature five hypotheses were proposed. Use of computers and job involvement were predicted to be positively related to attitudes toward computers. And levels of job involvement were expected to moderate the relationship between usage of computers on the job and attitudes toward computers. Both hypotheses were confirmed, although different dynamics were observed with positive attitudes than with concerns. It was found that employees who use a computer to support their work hold more positive attitudes than employees who report very limited use of the computer. And employees who are highly involved in their jobs, or committed to their organization typically reported lesser concern about working with computers than employees at a low level of job involvement. Moreover, a significant interaction was observed between job involvement and usage of computers in their relationship to attitudes toward working with computers.
