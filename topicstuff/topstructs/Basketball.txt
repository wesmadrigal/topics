In this article, National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) regional basketball tournament data are used to develop simple linear regression and logistic regression models using seed position for predicting the probability of each of the 16 seeds winning the regional tournament. The accuracy of these models is assessed by comparing the empirical probabilities not only to the predicted probabilities of winning the regional tournament but also the predicted probabilities of each seed winning each contest.\n      </p>", "This paper presents a mathematical model for basketball free throws. It is intended to be a supplement to an existing calculus course and could easily be used as a basis for a calculus project. Students will learn how to apply calculus to model an interesting real-world problem, from problem identification all the way through to interpretation and verification. Along the way we will introduce topics such as optimization (univariate and multiobjective), numerical methods, and differential equations.\n      </p>", "The nine universities in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) have a basketball competition in which each school plays home and away games against each other over a nine-week period. The creation of a suitable schedule is a very difficult problem with a myriad of conflicting requirements and preferences. We develop an approach to scheduling problems that uses a combination of integer programming and enumerative techniques. Our approach yields reasonable schedules very quickly and gave a schedule that was accepted by the ACC for play in 1997-1998.\n      </p>", "This paper considers the problem of finding the optimal strategies for players involved in the Continental Basketball Association's shooting contest.

The model obtains a simple relationship between the home team's lead (or deficit) \u2113 at time t and the probability of victory for the home team. The model provides a good fit to the results of 493 professional basketball games from the 1991-1992 National Basketball Association (NBA) season. The model is applied to the progress of baseball scores, a process that would appear to be too discrete to be adequately modeled by the Brownian motion process. Surprisingly, the Brownian motion model matches previous calculations for baseball reasonably well.\n      </p>", "Predicting the outcome of a future game between two sports teams poses a challenging problem of interest to statistical scientists as well as the general public. To be effective such prediction must exploit special contextual features of the game. In this paper, we confront three such features and address the need to: (i) use all relevant sample information; (ii) reflect the home court advantage. To do so we use the relevance weighted likelihood of Hu and Zidek (2002). Finally we demonstrate the value of the method by showing how it could have been used to predict the 1996-1997 NBA Final series results. Our relevance likelihood-based method proves to be quite accurate.\n      </p>", "A number of hypotheses suggested by Blalock's discussion of competitive and pressure resources which minority groups can use to force occupational opportunities were tested with data from the professional basketball leagues. Specifically, we tested whether blacks had equal opportunity in professional basketball or whether only superior black performers were permitted to compete, and whether the discrimination of this form was negatively related to the number of blacks in the SMSAs in which professional teams were located. The data did not clearly support the hypothesis that only black \"stars\" were recruited and the second line positions were reserved for whites; however, there was evidence that mediocre white players remained in the league longer than mediocre black players. The proportion black in an SMSA had little effect on discrimination explaining for non-Southern cities only nine percent of the variation in the discrimination index.\n      </p>", "This study examines the shifting nature of the cultural practice of basketball as players move from middle school to high school play and related shifts in players' statistical evaluations linked to play. Thirty-four middle and high school African American basketball players were observed and interviewed as they participated in the practice of basketball. Results show that the practice of basketball differs at these two levels of play corresponding to differences in mathematics linked to play.\n      </p>", "College basketball fans often speculate on the extent and nature of the home-court advantage. In this article, it is shown how questions about the size of the home-court advantage and about team-to-team differences in the home-court advantage can be addressed by fitting three different linear models to the outcomes of college basketball games. This approach was applied to data from the 1991-1992 college basketball season. The advantage of playing at home (in relation to playing on a neutral court) was estimated to be 4.68 \u00b1 0.28 points. The effect of team-to-team differences in the home-court advantage was found to be relatively small.\n      </p>", "This study examines the symbolic politics associated with the adoption of the omnibus $30 billion federal crime bill of 1994. Based upon critical race theory and close readings of Congressional hearings and print media coverage, we argue that race was the key to midnight basketball's prominence in the legislative debates and that its introduction ultimately reduced prevention-oriented provisions included in the final legislation. The central empirical contribution is a content analysis that specifies how racially coded references to midnight basketball exerted their impact on the political process through the discursive framing of the bill. We find that while midnight basketball directly increased attention to race in the debates, its real impact was more indirect, serving to heighten fears of crime and produce images of criminals that made prevention appear misguided. In contrast to bottom-up theoretical approaches, these discursive shifts worked at the level of elite decision makers, the legislators themselves. The article concludes by drawing out the implications of this case study for theories of how the politics of race operate in the contemporary American political arena, especially those concerning crime control.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Systems for ranking college basketball or football teams take many forms, ranging from polls of selected coaches or members of the media to so-called computer-ranking systems. Some of these are used in ways that have considerable impact on the teams. The committee responsible for the selection and seeding of teams for the postseason National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I men's basketball tournament is influenced by various rankings, including ones based on the ratings percentage index (RPI). The Bowl Championship Series (BCS) rankings of NCAA Division I-A football teams determine which two teams compete in a postseason national championship game and determine eligibility for other prestigious postseason games. There are certain attributes that seem desirable in any ranking system to be used in selecting or seeding teams for postseason competition or that may have some other tangible or intangible effect on the teams. These attributes include accuracy, appropriateness, impartiality, unobtrusiveness, nondisruptiveness, verifiability, and comprehensibility. The polls, the RPI, and the BCS rankings are notably deficient in several of these attributes. A system having all of the attributes, except for unobtrusiveness, can be achieved by applying least squares to a statistical model in which the expected difference in score in each game is modeled as a difference in team effects plus or minus a home court/field advantage. The potential obtrusiveness of this approach can be circumvented by introducing modifications to reward winning per se and to eliminate any incentive for \"running up the score\" or for deliberately surrendering a lead so as to extend a game into overtime. The modified least squares system was applied to the 1999-2000 basketball and 1999-2001 football seasons. Its accuracy in predicting the outcomes of 73 postseason football games and 93 postseason basketball games was undiminished by the modifications and was comparable to that of the betting line.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Dans cet article, l'auteur se demande pourquoi, bien que ces deux sports soient \u00e9troitement li\u00e9s et fortement comparables, le korfball est rest\u00e9 un sport local, soumis \u00e0 la moquerie et \u00e0 la d\u00e9rision dans son pays d'origine, alors que le basketball a connu un essor mondial et prestigieux qui fascine les populations. En r\u00e9pondant \u00e0 la question, cette \u00e9tude a l'intention de donner une vision plus approfondie de la relation entre les r\u00e8gles fondamentales des sports et leurs diss\u00e9mination et signification diff\u00e9rentielles. On en conclut que les lois ont leur importance mais ne d\u00e9terminent pas la diffusion d'un sport. Le peuple s'en charge. Et le contexte social aussi. Ainsi, les explications concernant les diff\u00e9rences de diffusion des sports ne doivent pas \u00eatre cherch\u00e9es dans leurs propri\u00e9t\u00e9s intrins\u00e8ques statiques, mais dans leurs caract\u00e9ristiques sociales dynamiques. This paper explores the question why korfball has become a local sport, subject to mockery and derision in its country of origin, while basketball has grown out into a global, glamorous sport with mass appeal, although both sports are closely related and highly comparable. In answering this question, this study intends to develop more insight into the relationship between the constitutive rules of sports and their differential dissemination and meaning. It is concluded that rules matter, but do not determine the diffusion of sport. People do. And the social context does. Thus, explanations for differences in the diffusion of sports must not be sought in static intrinsic properties, but in their dynamic social characteristics. Der Autor des vorliegenden Beitrags hinterfragt, warum das Korfballspiel, das dem Basketballspiel doch sehr \u00e4hnlich ist, ein lokaler Sport geblieben ist, der selbst in seinem Heimatland vor Spott und Hohn nicht sicher ist, wohingegen Basketball weltweit erfolgreich ist und eine Vielzahl von Menschen fasziniert. Der Antwort auf diese Frage liegt eine Untersuchung zugrunde, die insbesondere die Beziehung zwischen den Spielregeln und ihrer unterschiedlichen Verbreitung und Bedeutung analysiert. Es zeigt sich, dass bestehende Regeln zwar von Bedeutung sind, dass sie einen Sport aber nicht an seiner Ausbreitung hindern. Daf\u00fcr sind das jeweilige Volk und der soziale Kontext verantwortlich. Mit anderen Worten, die unterschiedliche Verbreitung einer Sportart wird nicht durch bestimmte statische Merkmale der Sportart selbst beg\u00fcnstigt, sondern durch ihre dynamischen Sozialmerkmale.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "This paper estimates a production function for professional basketball teams.

A computer-assisted search of this configuration space yields a free throw shot most forgiving of error hence optimal.\n      </p>", "This article investigates racial differences in 1985-86 salaries of individual professional basketball players. White and black players earn similar mean compensation; however, controlling for a variety of productivity and market-related variables and for the endogeneity of player draft position, we find a significant ceteris paribus black compensation shortfall of about 20%. Further, we find that all else equal, including team performance and market factors, replacing one black player with an identical white player raises home attendance by 8,000 to 13,000 fans per season. The compensation and attendance results together are consistent with the idea of customer discrimination.\n      </p>", "Nemhauser and Trick presented the problem of finding a timetable for the 1997/1998 Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in basketball.

In organizing the tournament, the emphasis is typically on selection of the most deserving teams to participate and providing a fair, equitable environment in which to play that result in a true, undisputed champion for the season. However, there are growing concerns of dwindling actual attendance at tournament games and increasing financial burden on the NCAA related to reimbursable team travel expenses. In this paper, we describe the development of an integer program designed to optimize team assignments in the sense of minimizing the distance travelled by teams to game sites and the corresponding travel costs. The goal is to increase tournament accessibility to fans as well as lessen the financial impact to the NCAA while maintaining the integrity of the tournament. We test our model against actual tournament assignments from the past 5 years. Results show consistent and significant cost savings and reductions in distance travelled without compromising the fairness and structure of the tournament. Overall, we demonstrate the usefulness of the model in both operational and strategic business decisions.\n      </p>", "Empirical evidence suggests that in basketball, football, and hockey, the leader at the beginning of the final period (quarter or period) wins the game about 80% of the time. We discuss modeling of late-game reversals in NBA, NFL, and NHL sports. The models are built around the assumptions that basketball scores and football scores are normally distributed and hockey scores vary according to a Poisson distribution. The models also accommodate the proverbial home field advantage. We use data from the 1997-1998 regular seasons of the leagues to estimate the parameters for the models. Predictions from the probabilistic models are in excellent agreement with the actual outcomes.\n      </p>", "This paper uses the betting market for professional basketball games to address the issue of unexplained asset price volatility. A pricing model is presented which identifies two components in point spreads for professional basketball games. Both components--the market's estimate of relative team abilities and an idiosyncratic factor--are essentially unobserved, but can be identified ex post. The structure of this market enables tests of competing hypotheses about point spread variation. The tests reject the hypothesis that variation in the two components represents irrelevant noise. The hypothesis that unobserved fundamentals account for this variation is consistent with the data.\n      </p>", "While being a basketball player is an important identity for kids, it is also an abiding interest for some black men in Philadelphia. Identity is a collective action, created through group interaction and made public through interaction in which friends \"vouch\" for each other. The criteria for social position and having high social status do not always transfer across social spaces; rather, the space and those who interact in it negotiate and determine which social traits are salient and of high status. This article examines two different types of basketball identity or status-direct and borrowed identity-and explores the way in which those identities are created and used in negotiating group membership and social interaction.\n      </p>", "This study examined the relationships among strategy, human resources, and performance among National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) basketball teams. Results based on survey data and a widely used performance rating indicated that coaches' preferred strategies influence the characteristics that they look for in recruits. Also, teams implementing a strategy different from a coach's preferred strategy performed less well than those implementing the preferred strategy. Finally, human resource capacities interacted with strategy in determining team performance for two different measures of performance.\n      </p>", "A graphical summary of the scoring activity for a basketball game is presented. The summary is a real-time plot of the score difference versus the elapsed time. In contrast to the usual score by quarters (or by half in college play), the graph easily allows complete identification of items of interest, such as largest leads, lead changes, come-from-behind activity, and percentage of game time for which a particular team of interest held a lead. The technique is applied to professional and collegiate games, and several interesting features are noted.\n      </p>", "The spatial relations between players of team sports are illustrated using multidimensional scaling. Information about asymmetries in interaction are used to create a map of 'winds of influence' and a pressure field or 'forcing function' is inferred from this.

Data from the National Basketball Association for 1989-1990 and 1990-1991 strongly support the notion of a weak-form efficient point spread market for sports gamblers. Teams' performances against the point spread show no autocorrelation; previous outcomes are shown to bear no relationship to subsequent results. In addition, simple betting strategies based on the identity of the teams, location of the game, and size of the point spread are unlikely to be profitable. The point spread is unbiased with respect to these factors as a predictor of the actual result.\n      </p>", "The focus of tournament models has been rank\u2010order compensation schemes whereby participants receive higher payments for higher relative performance, either incrementally or winner\u2010takes\u2010all. Our research focuses on a unique tournament that offers rewards for both winning and losing, specifically the National Basketball Association\u2019s regularly scheduled season of games. We examine three NBA seasons to determine whether team performance responded to changes in the underlying tournament incentives provided by the NBA\u2019s introduction and restructuring of the lottery system to determine draft order. Our results yield strong evidence that NBA teams are more likely to lose when incentives to lose are present.\n      </p>", "In intercollegiate athletics, conference basketball schedules must satisfy several criteria to be acceptably fair to each team. Scheduling is often further complicated by building conflicts and agreements regarding televised games. Although these requirements make it tedious to develop feasible schedules by hand; they can readily be modelled as constraints in an integer programming formulation. Software has been developed that finds multiple feasible solutions to this integer program, where each solution corresponds to an acceptable schedule. By generating multiple schedules in a short period of time, the software allows conference personnel to quickly evaluate different scheduling scenarios (eg different TV games) and consider several alternatives. Thus, the software makes an important contribution to finding the most attractive schedule possible.\n      </p>", "Basketball coaches at all levels use shot charts to study shot locations and outcomes for their own teams as well as upcoming opponents. Shot charts are simple plots of the location and result of each shot taken during a game. Although shot chart data are rapidly increasing in richness and availability, most coaches still use them purely as descriptive summaries. However, a team's ability to defend a certain player could potentially be improved by using shot data to make inferences about the player's tendencies and abilities. This article develops hierarchical spatial models for shot-chart data, which allow for spatially varying effects of covariates. Our spatial models permit differntial smoothing of the fitted surface in two spatial directions, which naturally correspond to polar coordinates: distance to the basket and angle from the line connecting the two baskets. We illustrated our approach using the 2003\u20142004 shot chart data for Minnesota Temberwolves guard Sam Cassell.\n      </p>", "Following the announcement by the NCAA of the seeding and placement of men's basketball teams in the regional tournaments there is often much discussion among basketball afficionados of the fairness. A statistical analysis of simple regression models for the tournament games shows that indeed there is a strong association between the seed positions of the teams and the actual margin of victory; in fact, fairly reliable prediction models of actual margin of victory in tournament games can be achieved based primarily on the seed numbers alone.\n      </p>", "Several models for estimating the probability that a given team in an NCAA basketball tournament emerges as the regional champion were presented by Schwertman, McCready, and Howard. In this article we improve these probability models by taking advantage of external information concerning the relative strengths of the teams and the point spreads available at the start of the tournament for the first round games. The result is a collection of regional championship probabilities that are specific to a given region and tournament year. The approach is illustrated using data from the 1994 NCAA basketball tournament.\n      </p>", "Our article examines the responses of a group of women's basketball fans to an Internet posting that questioned the sexual orientation of women's basketball star Cheryl Miller. Miller arouses speculation because she seems to play with cultural markers of gender and sexuality. She wears ties and suspenders while working as a coach and a broadcaster. The norms of women's sport demand that women perform their heterosexuality in order to diffuse the \"gender ambiguity\" caused by competence in a \"masculine\" realm. Our analysis of 77 postings reveals that while some respondents are homophobic and/or heterosexist, other fans have a more sophisticated understanding of the sexual politics of women's sport and are supportive of lesbian participants. The latter group includes heterosexual men and women who \"came out\" in defense of lesbians and against the systematic homophobia and heterosexism of sport. Our findings also support the contention that discussions of sexuality preclude discussions of race.\n      </p>", "Qualitative interviews explore the meanings increased female participation in basketball have for a sample of basketball players from three high schools.

How do girls and boys give meaning to the successes and failures of girls' and boys' basketball teams and athletics? The social processes reproducing a twotiered basketball institution at the high school level are illustrated (i.e., emphasis on playing differences, undervaluing of girls' contributions, policing of normative gender expectations). This research suggests that both girls and boys are complicit in supporting the gender order.

The resulting model shows that players interact with norms in mind, but invoke those norms in strategic ways, which then are reconsidered (and sometimes reconfigured) by way of talk. This unified theory of norms offers new opportunities for reconciling sociological imagery.\n      </p>", "How does one measure the productivity of an individual participating in a team sport? The purpose of this inquiry is to answer this question via an econometric model that links the player's statistics in the National Basketball Association (NBA) to team wins.

Such a measurement is useful in answering the question offered in the title, or a broader list of questions posed by both industry insiders and other interested observers.\n      </p>", "Recent research suggests there is substantial wage discrimination against blacks in professional basketball, and that fans are the source of this discrimination. The use of multiple regression analysis does indicate a salary shortfall for black players of fourteen to sixteen percent compared with salaries of white players with comparable on-court performance. To see whether this shortfall is likely to be due to fan discrimination as the relatively scarce white talent is bid into cities with many white fans, the racial composition of teams is related to the proportion of black residents among the populations of franchise cities. There is statistically significant evidence of geographical sorting by race. Evidence of racial bias is less obvious in contexts where a team's performance would be jeopardized, however. Thus, no evidence is found that fan attendance moves inversely with the percentage of playing time accorded black players, and only weak evidence is found that black players have to be better than white players to enter the National Basketball Association (NBA).\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The term \"narrative\" points to the subjectively understood practical projects that people structure with beginnings, middles, and ends. All projects may be interrupted, and if social actors are to continue the narrative engagement they must treat the stoppage as a mere suspension. The work of suspending a game of informal pick-up basketball is examined in three phases: interrupting the game, treating the game as suspended, and resuming play. In each phase, players collectively resist the possibility of abandonment as an alternative to game resumption. While narrative structuring is a powerful locus of meaning across diverse social contexts, informal basketball games offer a particularly good setting for the study of narrative organization in social life.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

When a team scores a basket, we assume this team receives the ball on the next possession, a rule we call \"winners' out.\" This is, of course, the opposite of the usual \"losers' outs\" rule, where the opposite team receives the next possession. The implications of this rule are studied in the game where the first team to score a certain number of points wins and also in the game where the team that is ahead at the buzzer wins. In both games the main result, surprisingly, is that the probability that a given team wins remains essentially constant under the two sets of rules. That is, neither team should really care which set of rules is in effect.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "           ", "The costs of the current National Basketball Association (NBA) schedule have had deleterious effects on the financial position of the league. The 22 teams travel an unnecessary number of airline miles, resulting in increased fatigue for the players and dollar losses to the owners. We have considered several optimization methods to lower the total number of passenger miles the league travels. We have succeeded in developing efficient schedules, by a combination of these techniques, for the 1978-1979 and 1979-1980 seasons. These schedules satisfy the league's constraints and would have led to savings of $757,000 or 20.4% over the NBA's current schedule.

The results of our analysis depict the NBA as a racially equal labor market which experienced tremendous growth over this period. In contrast to studies using mid-1980's data which estimated a white advantage between twelve and twenty-five percent, we find that no significant racial wage differential exists. The convergence of the salary differential between 1984 and 1993 can be fully explained by a narrowing in the relative prices paid for additional production and an increase in the relative production of black players. Furthermore, a regression capturing customer preferences yields the result that customers, who during the mid-1980's preferred white players, no longer differentiate between white and black players.\n      </p>", "This article offers an investigation of the Women's National Basketball Association's marketing discourses and provides historical and contemporary contexts to illuminate the complex articulations of race and sexuality imagined via representations of the league and its players. Proposing to \"queer whiteness\" by deploying particular inflections of the word queer, this article makes visible the ways in which discourses related to heterosexuality and whiteness assist marketers in advertising the league as a \"mainstream\" and therefore salable event. Marketers thus participate in and advance a representational politics that elevates the importance of maternity and morality as emblematic of the WNBA's idealized image of the \"good girl,\" especially the \"good white girl.\" This constant emphasis on the players' moral attributes and family values helps to distance the league from projections of alleged deviance imagined to be embodied by \"fatal women\"\u2014that is, bodies marked as black and lesbian\u2014the alleged obverse of the \"good white girl.\"\n      </p>", "Using qualitative interviews with lesbian, bisexual, and heterosexual female Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) fans, I argue that the (perceived) large lesbian attendance at WNBA games enables the construction of a lesbian community by lesbian and bisexual fans in a site qualitatively different from traditional locations of lesbian community. Because the WNBA is not an explicitly lesbian or queer space, the process of speculating about which players, coaches, and fans are lesbians is a meaningful part of being a WNBA fan for many lesbian and bisexual fans. Fantasizing a large lesbian presence enables lesbian and bisexual fans to actively and interpretively create lesbian community at the games. The women socialize and connect with lesbian and bisexual women, construct lesbian ownership of WNBA games, and define WNBA games as a unique space that is different from lesbian bars and other traditional \"gay-only\" spaces.\n      </p>", "This study represents one of the first quantitative field tests of the sunk-cost effect. We tested whether the amount teams spent for players in the National Basketball Association (NBA) influenced how much playing time players got and how long they stayed with NBA franchises. Sunk costs were operationalized by the order in which players were selected in the college draft. Draft order was then used to predict playing time, being traded, and survival in the NBA. Although one might logically expect that teams play and keep their most productive players, we found significant sunk-cost effects on each of these important personnel decisions. Results showed that teams granted more playing time to their most highly drafted players and retained them longer, even after controlling for players' on-court performance, injuries, trade status, and position played. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for both sunk-cost research and the broader literature on managerial decision making.\n      </p>", "This essay positions sport as a pedagogical social institution from which people learn about race, gender, power, and privilege.

College basketball games were attended by investigators who used a behavior observation technique to isolate blocks of game time immediately following instances of sustained spectator protest. For both home and visiting teams four measures of performance occurring during these \"postbooing\" periods were compared with performance during normal crowd conditions. Analyses of variance on scoring, turnover, foul, and composite performance rates revealed that episodes of spectator protest were related to an increase in the performance advantages enjoyed by home teams. Subsequent to crowd protest there were slight improvements in the performance indicators of home teams, paralleled by more significant declines for visiting teams. These declines were statiscally significant for two of the four dependent variables-fouls committed, and composite performance. Two competing interpretations of these results were considered at length, and the conclusion that crowd noise had inhibited the performance quality of visiting teams was favored over the alternative interpretation that the judgment of game referees had been influenced. In either case, the data, appeared to be consistent with the belief that collective protest by sports crowds is an effective type of social support which can contribute significantly to the HA.\n      </p>", "We utilize the concepts of individualism and collectivism (or communitarianism) to understand group differences and longitudinal change in what it means to belong to a team, itself a communal context. Our setting is two multiethnic high school girls' basketball teams in southern California. Players were asked to keep journals documenting experiences of interpersonal harmony and conflict in the team setting. Earlier analysis indicated that the experience of playing on a team made players more collectivistic in response to a values questionnaire. How did this change come about? Here we use player journals to answer this question. The journals also show that the process of value change differs depending on whether players interpret the issues surrounding team building through an individualistic or a collectivistic lens. Individualistic journals were more likely to be written by players having at least one European American or African American parent and by Asian American and Latina players having at least one parent born in the United States, whereas they were less likely to be written by Asian American or Latina players from purely immigrant families. However, perhaps because of the situational press towards collectivism in the team context, a collectivistic orientation in player journals was not associated with a particular set of ethnic backgrounds.\n      </p>", "Objective\u2014To determine the acute injury profile in each of six sports and compare the injury rates between the sports. Design\u2014Analysis of national sports injury insurance registry data. Setting\u2014Finland during 1987-91. Subjects\u2014621 691 person years of exposure among participants in soccer, ice hockey, volleyball, basketball, judo, or karate. Main outcome measures\u2014Acute sports injuries requiring medical treatment and reported to the insurance company on structured forms by the patients and their doctors. Results\u201454 186 sports injuries were recorded. Injury rates were low in athletes aged under 15, while 20-24 year olds had the highest rates. Differences in injury rates between the sports were minor in this adult age group. Overall injury rates were higher in sports entailing more frequent and powerful body contact. Each sport had a specific injury profile. Fractures and dental injuries were most common in ice hockey and karate and least frequent in volleyball. Knee injuries were the most common cause of permanent disability. Conclusions\u2014Based on the defined injury profiles in the different sports it is recommended that sports specific preventive measures should be employed to decrease the number of violent contacts between athletes, including improved game rules supported by careful refereeing. To prevent dental injuries the wearing of mouth guards should be encouraged, especially in ice hockey, karate, and basketball.\n      </p>", "           ", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Conversely, I suggest that prior failure breeds current success because it increases the urgency of success. I test this argument with data on playoff games between professional basketball teams from 1947 through 1982.

As an initial strategy, events are scanned for expressions of I\u00f1upiaq Ilitqusiat values, and many of these are found within the context of the Christmas celebration. Christmas also contains two probable syncretic features from the precontact Feast of the Dead: the custom of giving presents to namesakes, and gift-giving by families to those who helped in the funeral of a loved one who had died that same year. The theme of competition in basketball and sled dog races, on the other hand, is best understood in terms of indigenization of a rivalry motif from the precontact Messenger Feast and trading fair. All three event types, when taken as a whole, project the meta-theme of a sense of place, underscoring the village as a prosperous and vital locale. The driving force motivating residents to invest time and energy into creating these events seem to derive from a kind of \"village imperative,\" in which community goals and status are ascendent over the goals and desires of individual residents.\n      </p>", "Heath-Carter somatotypes were determined on 127 of the 138 female members of 10 South Australian representative games squads (badminton, basketball, cricket, hockey, lacrosse, netball, soccer, softball, squash and volleyball).
