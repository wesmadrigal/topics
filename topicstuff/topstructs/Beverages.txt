{"total_words": 900, "documents": ["Flavored alcoholic beverages (FABs) were first introduced into the alcohol market in the early 1980s in the form of wine coolers. FABs are sweet, relatively low alcohol content beverages that are designed for \"entry-level\" drinkers. The alcohol industry has introduced new products and production methods to expand the category's popularity. Research suggests that they are popular with underage drinkers, particularly teenage girls, and that the industry uses marketing practices that appear to target youth. FABs are now marketed globally, and their production and marketing vary by country based on national regulatory restraints. In the United States, industry representations that the products are malt beverages for regulatory purposes appears to violate many state laws because the alcohol in the FABs is derived from distilled spirits. Recommendations for regulatory reform, including new legal definitions of FABs, increased taxes, and restrictions on availability, are applicable at both national and state levels.\n      </p>", "Objective We examined the associations between sweets, sweetened and unsweetened beverages, and sugars and pancreatic cancer risk. Methods We conducted a population-based case\u2013control study (532 cases, 1,701 controls) and used multivariate logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Because associations were often different by sex, we present results for men and women combined and separately. Results Among men, greater intakes of total and specific sweets were associated with pancreatic cancer risk (total sweets: OR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.0, 3.6; sweet condiments: OR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.2, 3.1; chocolate candy: OR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.1, 5.0; other mixed candy bars: OR = 3.3, 95% CI: 1.5, 7.3 for 1 + servings/day versus none/rarely). Sweets were not consistently associated with risk among women. Sweetened beverages were not associated with increased pancreatic cancer risk. In contrast, low-calorie soft drinks were associated with increased risk among men only; while other low-/non-caloric beverages (e. g., coffee, tea, and water) were unassociated with risk. Of the three sugars assessed (lactose, fructose, and sucrose), only the milk sugar lactose was associated with pancreatic cancer risk (OR = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.5, 2.7 comparing extreme quartiles). Conclusion These results provide limited support for the hypothesis that sweets or sugars increase pancreatic cancer risk.\n      </p>", "Background. There are few studies about the effect of alcoholic beverages in food-borne disease outbreaks. Methods. We studied this effect during an outbreak of Salmonella ohio infection that occurred in Castell\u00f3n (Spain) in May 2000. S. ohio was isolated in stools of patients and also in implicated foods. Results. Analysis was restricted to the group that was exposed to contaminated food (51 persons). We compared attack rates by level of alcohol intake (none, 1-40 gm, and &gt;40 gm). The adjusted relative risks in the two alcohol categories were 0.73 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.46-1.15] and 0.54 (95% CI = 0.31-0.96), respectively. Conclusions. We discuss the possible protective effect of alcoholic beverages in some food-borne infectious outbreaks.\n      </p>", "A number of writers have argued that differences in food consumption between the countries in Europe are declining. This article investigates the possibility of convergence in the consumption of alcoholic beverages. The combination of beverages consumed in 1895-97,1961-62 and 1994-95 is considered. This reveals three distinctive regions where wine, beer or spirits are the dominant drink. However, in this century the dominance of the staple drink has fallen and differences in total alcohol consumption have diminished, indicating convergence.\n      </p>", "", "", "", "Quantitative methods were used to review epidemiologic data relating consumption of alcoholic beverages to risk of colorectal cancer. The data (27 studies) supported the presence of a weak association. For consumption of two alcoholic beverages daily, on average the relative risk of colorectal cancer was 1.10 (95% confidence interval 1.05 - 1.14). Other findings were: (1) the association did not vary according to gender or site within the large bowel; (2) results from follow-up studies (relative risk 1.32, 95% confidence interval 1.16 - 1.51) suggested a stronger relationship than those from case-control studies (relative risk 1.07, 95% confidence interval 1.02 - 1.12); and (3) the evidence supporting beverage specificity was not conclusive, although the results were consistent with a stronger association with consumption of beer (relative risk 1.26, 95% confidence interval 1.13 - 1.41) than with consumption of wine (relative risk 1.11, 95% confidence interval 0.91 - 1.36) or liquor (relative risk 1.13, 95% confidence interval 0.99 - 1.29). Because the magnitude of the association between alcohol consumption and risk of colorectal cancer was small, the findings regarding a causal role of alcohol were inconclusive.\n      </p>", "Alcoholic beverages have antimicrobial effects against Helicobacter pylori in vitro. To elucidate the relation between alcohol consumption and current infection with H. pylori in vivo, we carried out a pooled analysis of three recent studies from Southern Germany, comprising 1410 adults age 15 to 69. Detailed information on consumption of various alcoholic beverages was collected through standardized questionnaires. Helicobacter pylori infection was measured by ${}^{13}{\\rm C}\\text{-urea}$ breath test. Overall, prevalence of current H. pylori infection was lower among subjects who consumed alcohol (34.9%) than among nondrinkers (38.0%). The adjusted odds ratio was 0.79, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.58-1.08. Furthermore, alcohol consumption showed a strong inverse relation to the result of the ${}^{13}{\\rm C}\\text{-urea}$ breath test, a semiquantitative measure of the bacterial load, among infected subjects. The inverse association between alcohol consumption and H. pylori infection was not monotonic, however. Odds of infection were lowest at moderate levels of alcohol consumption and increased at higher levels of alcohol consumption, regardless of the type of alcoholic beverages consumed. These results support the hypothesis that moderate alcohol consumption may favor suppression and eventual elimination of H. pylori infection. At higher levels of alcohol consumption, the antimicrobial effects of alcoholic beverages may be opposed by adverse systemic effects of drinking, such as adverse effects on the immune defense.\n      </p>", "Patterns of acquisition of alcoholic beverages by underage youth were studied, using focus group methods with a sample of midwestern youth. Results showed that the alcohol initially used by those in their early teens is obtained from parents' stocks or from older siblings and friends. By the mid-teens, parties at which alcohol (usually beer) is readily available become the major source. In the mid to late teens, young people purchase alcohol from commercial alcohol outlets, despite the fact that 21 is the legal age for purchasing alcohol. Factors reported to increase the rate of successful alcohol purchases include female buyer, male seller, young seller, and convenience store outlet. Results of focus group interviews revealed the easy accessibility of alcoholic beverages to underage youth. Further investigation into patterns of underage access to alcohol is recommended, with results from the focus group study guiding the design of probability sample studies to assess their generalizability.\n      </p>", "We estimate the total demand for alcoholic beverages with annual U. S. time-series data from 1940-80 using two alternative measures of alcohol consumption. By concentrating on the total demand for alcoholic beverages we subsume the cross-price effects. Our results indicate a price elasticity of (minus)0.5 and an income elasticity of 0.4 and weak evidence of a somewhat higher propensity to consume alcoholic beverages by those under 21. After correcting for heteroskedasticity, the estimates are found to be statistically stable over the sample period.\n      </p>", "We examined the relations between spontaneous abortion and the consumption of caffeine, individual caffeine-containing beverages (coffee, tea, and soda), and decaffeinated coffee in a prospective study of 5,144 pregnant women. We collected information about potential risk factors for spontaneous abortion, including consumption of caffeinated beverages and decaffeinated coffee before and during pregnancy, by interview in the first trimester. Neither total estimated caffeine nor individual caffeinated beverage consumption during the first trimester was associated with an appreciable increase in risk for spontaneous abortion. The adjusted odds ratio for consumption of greater than 300 mg per day of caffeine was 1.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.8-2.1] after adjustment for maternal age, pregnancy history, cigarette and alcohol consumption, employment, race, gestational age at interview, and marital and socioeconomic status. The adjusted odds ratio for spontaneous abortion related to consumption of three or more cups of decaffeinated coffee during the first trimester was 2.4 (95% CI = 1.3-4.7) in the same model. Although we could not demonstrate this with available data, we suspect that this association was due to bias resulting from the relations among fetal viability, symptoms of pregnancy such as nausea, and consumption patterns during pregnancy.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Cola beverages, in particular, contain phosphoric acid and have been associated with urinary changes that promote kidney stones. Methods: We examined the relationship between carbonated beverages (including cola) and chronic kidney disease, using data from 465 patients with newly diagnosed chronic kidney disease and 467 community controls recruited in North Carolina between 1980 and 1982. Results: Drinking 2 or more colas per day was associated with increased risk of chronic kidney disease (adjusted odds ratio = 2.3; 95% confidence interval = 1.4-3.7). Results were the same for regular colas (2.1; 1.3-3.4) and artificially sweetened colas (2.1; 0.7-2.5). Noncola carbonated beverages were not associated with chronic kidney disease (0.94; 0.4-2.2).

This question is approached first through a simple content analysis of qualitative data obtained from an empirical sociological study of inebriety in Norway in the 1850s by Norway's first sociologist, Eilert Sundt [1859], then by a time-series analysis of quantitative data on coffee and alcoholic beverages in Norway. The results confirm that coffee filled a cultural 'niche' created by the restrictive Norwegian alcohol policy in the nineteenth century. Sundt's qualitative data point clearly in this direction. Although the quantitative data -- particularly on coffee -- are far from ideal indicators of consumption, the results lend some credibility to the substitution hypothesis: The trends coincide fairly closely for the two beverages, and in the detrended series there are measurable signs of correlation when the confounding effects of economic development are controlled for. It is concluded that the political attempts to reduce alcohol problems in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, i.e. reduced availability and increased taxes, may have been alleviated by the growing popularity of coffee as an alternative, 'new' beverage for the population at large, and not just the higher social classes.\n      </p>", "Chemical analyses of ancient organics absorbed into pottery jars from the early Neolithic village of Jiahu in Henan province in China have revealed that a mixed fermented beverage of rice, honey, and fruit (hawthorn fruit and/or grape) was being produced as early as the seventh millennium before Christ (B.C.). This prehistoric drink paved the way for unique cereal beverages of the proto-historic second millennium B.C., remarkably preserved as liquids inside sealed bronze vessels of the Shang and Western Zhou Dynasties. These findings provide direct evidence for fermented beverages in ancient Chinese culture, which were of considerable social, religious, and medical significance, and help elucidate their earliest descriptions in the Shang Dynasty oracle inscriptions.\n      </p>", "Quarterly data for 1977-1994 on alcohol consumption and advertising are used to estimate a differential demand system, including explanatory variables for broadcast advertising and print advertising. The model explains the growth rate of per capita consumption dependent on explanatory variables for prices, real income, demographic changes, and real advertising by media and beverage. Empirical results also are reported for total consumption of pure alcohol. The results for the three beverages and total alcohol indicate that advertising has little or no effect on demand. The empirical evidence thus supports the notion that regardless of media, advertising affects mainly brand shares.\n      </p>", "The relationship between bladder cancer and alcohol consumption was investigated in a case-control study conducted in 506 patients (453 males and 53 females) with diagnoses of papillary urothelial carcinoma during 1978-1982 at \" La Paz \" hospital (Madrid), and an equal number of controls matched for age, sex and date of admission to the hospital. The results showed that the risk of bladder cancer does not increase with the intake of beer, wine and spirit beverages.

Alcohol consumption may therefore compromise the living conditions of Helicobacter pylori in the stomach. We assessed the relation of alcohol consumption with H. pylori infection among 1,785 participants ages 18-88 in the German National Health and Nutrition Survey. Detailed information on dietary and lifestyle habits was obtained in personal interviews using a standardized food frequency questionnaire. Serum samples were analyzed for H. pylori immunoglobulin G antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Overall prevalence of H. pylori infection was 39.2%. There was a clear inverse dose-response-relation between reported alcohol consumption and H. pylori infection. The relation persisted after control for potential confounding factors. The adjusted prevalence ratios (95% confidence intervals) for H. pylori infection among persons who consumed up to 10, 10 to 20, and more than 20 gm of alcohol per day compared with non-drinkers were 0.93 (0.77-1.13), 0.82 (0.65-1.04), and 0.71 (0.55-0.92). The inverse relation between alcohol consumption and H. pylori infection was even stronger when individuals with an indication of a recent change of alcohol consumption were excluded from the analysis. These findings support the hypothesis that moderate alcohol consumption may facilitate spontaneous elimination of H. pylori infection among adults.\n      </p>", "As an indicator of hospitalization costs, the number of hospitalized days among 82,430 white and black adult health maintenance organization (HMO) members was studied. Baseline data were collected at health examinations from 1978 to 1982. Using all hospitalizations from 1978 to 1983 that were not related to pregnancy and that occurred after examination, multiple regression analyses for each race-sex subgroup were controlled for alcohol use (eight categories), cigarette smoking (four categories), age (three categories), and period of observation. Estimates of hospital days associated with alcohol, age, and smoking were calculated for specific diagnostic categories and for all diagnoses by projecting observed days hospitalized of lifelong alcohol abstainers, persons less than 45 years old, and lifelong nonsmokers. Among men of both races, there was almost no increase in total hospital days associated with alcohol use when all levels of drinking were considered. Among women, because of the preponderance of lighter drinkers who had fewer hospitalizations, the overall percentage of total hospital days associated with alcohol was negative. Several trends were identified between alcohol use and hospital days for the diagnostic groups. Most notable were a deficit of hospital days for circulatory system problems and an excess of hospital days for all neoplasms. In summary, in this population of prepaid health-plan members, use of alcoholic beverages was only a minor factor in total hospitalization experience.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The analysis demonstrates the ways in which the structures of these chains reinforce the north-south dimension of international inequality and help to explain its persistence over time. It focuses on attempts by actors in the producing regions to move forward into the more advanced processing stages of the chains, in order to realize higher returns from their commodity exports. Comparisons across commodity chains identify structural features of the chains that set limits on, and open possibilities for, forward integration. Features considered include economies of scale in the early processing stages and the stage at which intermediate products first become storable and transportable. Comparisons across countries within commodity chains identify additional factors that help to explain successes or failures in individual cases: forms of state action, the strength of the local capitalist class and the size of the demestic market. Control over the consumption end of the commodity chain by transnational corporations is the most important factor limiting the benefits derived from forward integration strategies.\n      </p>", "Considerable controversy and debate surrounds the practice of slotting allowances, or fees, paid by manufacturers for obtaining the patronage of retailers. To date, regulators have yet to agree on public policy toward these practices; at least one federal antitrust agency suggests that slotting fees may be competitive, another has conducted investigations into these practices, and still another suggests banning them altogether. In this article, the authors examine the recent decision by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF) to prohibit slotting allowances in the retail sale of alcohol beverages. Focusing on the regulatory environment, industry structure, marketing practices, and consumer consumption behavior in the alcohol beverage industry, the authors analyze the BATF's decision and attempt to reconcile disparate public policy treatment of these practices. Implications for understanding slotting allowances and recommendations for further public policy development and research then are explored.\n      </p>", "Consumption of alcoholic beverages has been historically viewed not only in terms of its effect on individuals' utility maximization, but also in terms of its bearing on social concerns and government revenue. The estimation of demand elasticities and the effects of household characteristic variables on alcohol demand provide important information for the formulation of public policies. This article discusses the specification and estimation of a two-stage consumer demand for alcoholic beverages using the most recent United States Department of Agriculture household food consumption survey data. The upper-level first-stage budgeting decision is estimated using a double-hurdle model, where consumer decisions on whether to consume alcoholic beverages and how much to consume are defined separately. The lower-level second-stage budgeting decision allocates alcohol expenditure via a conditional synthetic demand system for beer, spirits, and wine. For the second stage, a level version synthetic system is constructed using a normalized linear combination of level Rotterdam, a Central Bureau of Statistics model, and an Almost Ideal Demand System equivalent model. The prices, calculated by dividing value by quantities, are quality adjusted, and selection biases are corrected. Results show that some household characteristic variables, as well as economic variables, have significant impacts on consumer demand for alcoholic beverages. Results of the two-stage budgeting model indicate that as a revenue generator, increasing excise taxes on alcoholic beverages is feasible. But, they are not necessarily reliable sources of revenue.\n      </p>", "This paper uses a disaggregated micro-model of the alcoholic beverage sector to investigate reforms of discriminatory pricing practices attributable to differential provincial markups and federal excise levies in Canada. The reform of markups has been demanded in a recent GATT ruling. We find that major changes in the structure of this industry could follow and that both provincial and federal government tax revenues respond to measures initiated by the other level of government. A cooperative tax reform strategy, which leaves each level of government with unchanged revenues, is then modeled. This entails major changes in trade patterns, relative outputs and producer revenues.\n      </p>", "Using scanner data, we estimated demand for nine nonalcoholic beverages under habit formation. We found strong evidence for habit formation. Although demand for sugar-sweetened beverages by lowincome households is less elastic to own-price changes compared with high-income households, there is evidence that high-income households consider beverages to be more substitutable than low-income households do. A half-cent per ounce tax on store-purchased sugar-sweetened beverages will result in a moderate reduction in consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages for both income strata. Because of habit formation, long-run national tax revenue from a sugar-sweetened beverage tax is about 15 to 20% lower than short-run revenue.\n      </p>", "Study objective-To examine the relation between alcohol and main alcoholic beverage consumption and subjective health in Spain. Design-Logistic regression analysis using a cross sectional survey based on self reported data on alcohol and alcoholic beverage consumption, subjective health and the principal confounding factors (age, sex, civil status, educational level, job status, social support, region of residence, size of town or city, tobacco consumption, physical activity during leisure time and work hours, and chronic disease). Setting-The 1993 Spanish National Health Survey. Participants-A 19 573 person sample, representative of the non-institutionalised Spanish population aged 16 years and over. Main results-Among Spaniards, 31.4% reported their health as suboptimal (fair, poor or very poor) and 56.9% consumed alcohol regularly, with the majority having a preference for wine. Light (1-2 drinks per day) or moderate consumption (3-4 drinks per day) was the most frequent pattern. After adjusting for confounding factors, a negative dose-response relation was observed between consumption of total alcohol, wine and beer, and prevalence of suboptimal health (linear trend: p&lt;0.001 for total alcohol, p=0.023 for wine, and p=0.030 for beer). In contrast, for consumption of spirits the prevalence of ill health in moderate drinkers was lower than in non-drinkers, with no clear relation at higher consumption. While persons reporting a preference for wine had a lower frequency of suboptimal health than did abstainers, they showed no difference in frequency of subjective ill health with respect to persons with preference for other types of drink or no preference whatsoever. Conclusions-The higher the consumption of total alcohol, wine and beer, the lower the prevalence of suboptimal health. These results differ from those obtained in several Nordic countries, where a \"J shaped\" relation has been observed for total alcohol and wine, and suggest that the relation between alcohol consumption and subjective health may be different in Mediterranean countries.\n      </p>", "The effect of color on the expected and experienced refreshment, intensity, and liking of lemon, mint, and vanilla beverages was studied. Subjects rated the expected and actual taste of brown lemon and mint solutions as less refreshing than the tastes of differently colored solutions of the same flavor. However, the refreshment ratings (expected and actual) of the brown vanilla beverage were not different from those of the vanilla beverages of other colors. Liking ratings also depended on color in a manner similar to that of the refreshment ratings. Intensity ratings also varied with color. However, unlike when subjects smell solutions rather than taste them, colored solutions were not judged as more intense than colorless ones. In fact, the clear solutions were judged as strongest.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "During the 1990s, a new kind of alcoholic beverage began to appear in Kenyan bars. The 'new generation' drinks, as they came to be known, disturbed an established boundary between the formal and informal sectors, and between legitimate enterprise and criminal endeavour. They invaded the formal spaces of licit drinking, finding their way on to the shelves of bars between the bottles of Tusker and Bond 7; they shamelessly appropriated the physical markers of respectable business, with labelled bottles and advertising. And they were cheap, since they avoided the burden of taxation which had pushed lager beer and whisky beyond the financial reach of many drinkers. Within a year or two, these brash new imitators had captured a considerable chunk of the drinking market. In campaigning against them, the formal drinks industry - already engaged in an internecine 'beer war' of its own - argued that the 'new generation' drinks were an active and direct danger to public health. In this the industry has, more than once, received the support of vocal sections of the populace and the press, enraged by a series of tragic poisonings associated with illicit beverages. But the 'new generation' drinks have not disappeared, nor has their production been prevented, even though some are made on an industrial scale in premises whose locations are well known (and, indeed, are advertised). Conflicting statements emerge from different organs of the state regarding the legality, and safety, of these beverages; bans are announced, and forgotten, and announced again: and the drinks continue to be sold. This article explores the origins of the 'new generation' drinks, and what their continued availability tells us about the definition of crime in modern Kenya.\n      </p>", "To examine the relation between alcoholic beverage consumption and risk of cancer of the right colon and rectum, 644 male cases and 992 male community controls were interviewed by telephone. The risks of cancer at these sites associated with alcohol consumption five years in the past were similar; using subjects with right colon cancer for reference, the adjusted relative risk (RR) of rectal cancer associated with five or more drinks per day was 0.9 (95% confidence limits = 0.4, 1.7). Alcohol consumption 20 years in the past was associated with a greater risk of rectal cancer (RR for five or more drinks per day = 1.8 [1.0, 3.3]). Analyses based on a community controls provided weaker evidence, consistent with previous findings, that heavy consumption of alcohol five years in the past, and possibly of beer in particular, was associated with moderately increased risk of colorectal cancer (RR of cancer of the right colon associated with consumption of five or more alcoholic drinks per day was 1.8 [1.0, 3.2], and of cancer of the rectum was 1.5 [0.9, 2.5]).\n      </p>", "", "", "", "Objective To examine the practice of concealing drugs in patients' foodstuff in nursing homes. Design Structured interview study with data collected by structured interview. Setting All five health regions in Norway. Participants Professional carers of 1362 patients in 160 regular nursing home units and 564 patients in 90 special care units for people with dementia. Main outcome measures Frequency of concealment of drugs; who decided to conceal the drugs; how this practice was documented in the patients' records; and what types of drugs were given this way. Results 11% of the patients in regular nursing home units and 17% of the patients in special care units for people with dementia received drugs mixed in their food or beverages at least once during seven days. In 95% of cases, drugs were routinely mixed in the food or beverages. The practice was documented in patients' records in 40% (96/241) of cases. The covert administration of drugs was more often documented when the physician took the decision to hide the drugs in the patient's foodstuff (57%; 27/47) than when the person who made the decision was unknown or not recorded (23%; 7/30). Patients who got drugs covertly more often received antiepileptics, antipsychotics, and anxiolytics compared with patients who were given their drugs openly. Conclusions The covert administration of drugs is common in Norwegian nursing homes. Routines for such practice are arbitrary, and the practice is poorly documented in the patients' records.\n      </p>", "This study reports the findings of a field trial designed to assess the extent of alcohol sales to minors in one county in northwest New Jersey. Two 19-year-old males were successful in purchasing alcoholic beverages in 27 of 46 (58.7 percent) establishments visited. On the following day, 23 of the establishments that sold the alcohol were visited again and, on this occasion, 18 (78.3 percent) sold alcohol to the minor. This study supports the findings from surveys that show that underage drinkers can obtain alcohol with ease. Many community groups are now taking action to rectify this situation, and data of the type reported in this paper can be used to assess the effectiveness of their actions.\n      </p>", "Muse is a personal investigation into the historical and contemporary correlations between pomegranates and hand grenades by the author, an artist based in the Midwest.

The protective effect of alcohol could be mediated through increased levels of HDL cholesterol (HDL-c). The aim of this study was to examine the relation between blood lipid levels and the consumption of different types of alcoholic beverages among 1581 men and 1535 women. Design: Data from representative cross sectional surveys (1994-1997) in three different regions of France were used. The consumption of the different types of alcohol was quantified using a recall method according to a typical weekly consumption. Main results: The median daily alcohol intake was 24 g for men and 4 g for women. After adjustment for confounders, total alcohol showed a positive and significant association with HDL-c and triglycerides (TG) in both sexes. In multivariate analysis, wine was positively associated with HDL-c. Beer was positively associated with HDL-c in men and with triglycerides in men and women. When taking drinking patterns into account, wine drinkers had higher HDL-c levels than non-wine drinkers. Differences became non-significant after adjustment for confounders and particularly for socioeconomic parameters. Conclusions: In a French population sample, total alcohol was positively associated with HDL-c and triglycerides. The specific influence of any particular alcoholic beverage on blood lipids was not clearly demonstrated but wine preference found in a group with higher lifestyle standards was associated with a more favourable blood lipid profile.\n      </p>", "Context: Dental and skeletal fluorosis is endemic in the Ethiopian Rift Valley. Children are especially vulnerable to excessive fluoride intake because their permanent teeth are still being formed. Strategies to reduce the total fluoride intake by children are thus warranted. Case presentation: By combining the results of field studies in Ethiopia, the relevant pathways for fluoride intake have been identified in 28 children 2-5 years of age living in two villages on the Wonji Shoa Sugar Estate in the Ethiopian Rift Valley. The focus of the present study was to simulate the fluoride intake of the children using the methods of material flow analysis (MFA) and substance flow analysis. Discussion: With a model based on MFA, we quantified the potential reduction in total fluoride intake given different scenarios\u2014for example, by reducing the fluoride intake from drinking water and cooking water. The results show clearly that only by removing fluoride completely from both drinking and cooking water does the probability of remaining below the daily tolerable upper intake level exceed 50%. Both prepared food and food ingredients must be taken into consideration when assessing the total fluoride intake by children living in high-fluoride areas. Relevance: This knowledge will help health personnel, the government, and the food authorities to give scientifically based advice on strategies for reducing the total fluoride intake by children living in high-fluoride areas in the Ethiopian Rift Valley.\n      </p>", "Objectives: To examine alcohol consumption in relation to prostate cancer incidence in the Netherlands Cohort Study. Methods: At baseline in 1986, 58,279 men aged 55-69 years completed a self-administered questionnaire on diet, consumption of alcoholic beverages and other risk factors for cancer. For data processing and analyses the case-cohort approach was used. After 6.3 years of follow-up, 680 incident primary prostate cancer cases were available for analysis. Results: In multivariate analyses adjusted for age, socioeconomic status and family history of prostate cancer, no association between total alcohol consumption, alcohol intake from beer and liquor and prostate cancer risk was found. Increased associations were found for alcohol from white wine and fortified wines compared to nondrinkers, but not for red wine. The RRs (95% CI) in the intake category of \u2265 15 g/day were 3.3 (1.2-9.2) and 2.3 (1.2-4.7), respectively, after additional adjustment for total alcohol intake. There was, however, no significant trend in risk. Alcohol intake was more strongly related with localized than with advanced prostate tumors. Conclusion: Our results do not support an important role for alcohol in prostate cancer etiology. Nevertheless, for specific types of alcoholic beverages, particularly wines, a positive association was suggested which needs examination in further studies.\n      </p>", "The authors examine the content of magazine advertising for cigarettes, beer, and nonalcoholic beverages from July 1996 to July 1997. A total of 476 advertisements (239 unique advertisements) from 12 different magazines were content-analyzed. In light of the ongoing debate and recent proposals over the regulation of tobacco and alcohol advertising aimed at young people, the purpose was to answer two principal questions: (1) whether the advertisements for cigarettes and beer contain more cartoons and animated characters than do advertisements for nonalcoholic beverages and (2) whether the presence of human models in an advertisement's visuals is an adequate way to operationalize a lifestyle advertisement. The authors also replicate and extend previous research regarding the amount and type of extrinsic appeal or lifestyle advertising found in these product categories. Significantly more lifestyle content appeared in cigarette advertisements than in nonalcoholic beverage advertisements. Furthermore, a disproportionate number of cartoon characters in cigarette advertisements appeared in magazines with a higher share of younger readers, consistent with policy concerns regarding the use of such cartoon characters to appeal to youth markets. Also, 8.8% of advertisements that were classified as lifestyle advertisements did not contain recognizable human models. An implication of this finding is that the original tobacco settlement proposal to eliminate lifestyle content of cigarette and beer advertisements simply by eliminating models was inadequate to achieve its intended purpose.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

We considered the association between carbonated drink consumption and pancreatic cancer risk in an Italian case-control study conducted in 1991-2008 on 326 pancreatic cancer cases and 652 matched controls. We also combined the results from all the studies on soft drinks or sweetened beverages and pancreatic cancer published before June 2010, using a metaanalytic approach. In the case-control study, compared with non-drinkers, the multivariate odds ratio was 1.02 (95% confidence interval, CI, 0.72-1.44) for carbonated drink consumers and 0.89 (95% CI 0.53-1.50) for regular consumers (at least one drink/day). Besides our study, from the literature search, we identified 4 other case-control (1,919 cases) and 6 cohort studies (2,367 cases). The pooled relative risks (RR) for soft drink consumers vs. non-consumers were 0.97 (95% CI 0.81-1.16) for case-control, 1.05 (95% CI 0.94-1.17) for cohort, and 1.02 (95% CI 0.93-1.12) for all studies.

Alternative long-run estimates are also obtained from cointegrating regressions. Estimates vary markedly across provinces and suggest that increases in price will reduce consumption of all beverages in the short run, but in the long run no evidence is found that spirits use is price-sensitive. Increases in the legal drinking age reduce consumption in the short run but there is little indication of a long-run effect. The estimated income elasticity of beer is small while the estimated income elasticities for spirits and wine are substantially larger, especially in the long run.\n      </p>", "In the United States, the incidence rates of multiple myeloma in Blacks are more than twice those in Whites, but the etiology of this cancer is poorly understood. A population-based case-control interview study of 571 subjects (365 White, 206 Black) with multiple myeloma and 2,122 controls (1,155 White, 967 Black) living in three areas of the United States (Georgia, Michigan, New Jersey) offered the opportunity to investigate the relationship with smoking and alcohol drinking and to evaluate whether these factors might contribute to the excess risk of multiple myeloma in Blacks. For Blacks and Whites of either gender, there were no significantly elevated risks associated with ever use of cigarettes or alcoholic beverages and no consistent patterns with either intensity or duration of use. These data support previous studies indicating that smoking and drinking are not related causally to the risk of multiple myeloma, and thus cannot account for the racial disparity in incidence rates.\n      </p>", "The argument that is put forward in this paper is that failure to represent stochastic trend and stochastic seasonality in an AIDS model leads to a misspecified and possibly structurally unstable model. This proposition is verified by estimating an AIDS model of the demand for alcoholic beverages in the United Kingdom. Three versions of the model are estimated, and it is demonstrated that the version allowing for stochastic trend and stochastic seasonality performs better than the other two versions of the model in terms of the diagnostics tests and goodness of fit measures. The best estimated model turns out to possess the properties of having common components and being homogenous. Further empirical testing reveals the presence of stochastic trends and cointegration between the budget shares of beer and wine. The results clearly indicate that there has been a shift away from the consumption of beer towards wine.\n      </p>", "Past studies of household food expenditure suggest that the effect of income on expenditure varies among households of different sizes and in different urbanization and region categories. No systematic investigation has been made, however, of these or other interactions among the independent variables used to explain household food expenditures. In this study, data from the 1955 USDA Household Food Consumption Survey are examined through the use of a special program developed by Sonquist and Morgan for the detection of interaction effects. Important interactions affecting expenditures for food and beverages consumed at home were found between household size and income, between household size and urbanization, and among household size, urbanization, and income.\n      </p>", "The alcoholic beverage parakari, a unique fermentation product of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) by the Wapisiana of Guyana, involves the use of a starch-hydrolyzing (amylolytic) mold (Rhizopus sp., Mucoraceae, Zygomycota) followed by a solid-state ethanol fermentation. A detailed study was made of the parakari manufacturing process in the Wapisiana village of Aishalton, South Rupununi, Guyana. Thirty steps were involved in parakari manufacture and these exhibited a high degree of sophistication, including the use of specific cassava varieties, control of culture temperature, and boosting of inoculum potential with purified starch additives. During the fermentation process, changes in glucose content, pH, taste, smell, and culture characteristics were reported for the fermenting mash. Parakari is the only known example of an indigenous New World fermentation that utilizes an amylolytic mold. Manufacture of parakari is analogous to similar dual fermentations of the Orient, yet independently derived.\n      </p>", "Objectives: Recent narrative reviews have concluded that there is no support for an association between alcohol consumption and urinary tract cancer. Many individual studies, however, have reported positive associations, although rarely statistically significant. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to summarize and quantify this relationship with more statistical power and to perform a sensitivity analysis on the study characteristics. Methods: We included 16 epidemiological studies published up to April 1999 and calculated summary odds ratios (SORs), both upgraded and adjusted for age, sex and smoking by meta-regression analyses. The age- and smoking-adjusted SORs (current alcohol drinking vs. non-drinking) were 1.3 (95% CI 0.9-2.0) for six studies with men and 1.0 (95% CI 0.4-2.6) for four studies with women. Results: The age-, sex- and smoking-adjusted SOR was 1.2 (95% CI 0.9-1.7) for seven studies with men and women combined. Conclusion: Even though studies differed in methodology, the results were rather consistent. Subgroup analyses by type or amount of alcohol were not possible due to sparse data. We conclude that the available data suggest a slightly increased risk of urinary tract cancer from alcohol consumption for men. The risk related to alcohol consumption for women and the influence of the amount and type of alcohol remain unclear.\n      </p>", "Objective Whether alcohol consumption influences ovarian cancer risk is unclear. Therefore, we investigated the association between alcohol intake at various ages and risk of ovarian cancer. Methods Among 90,371 eligible members of the California Teachers Study cohort who completed a baseline alcohol assessment in 1995-1996, 253 women were diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer by the end of 2003. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results Consumption of total alcohol, beer, or liquor in the year prior to baseline, at ages 30-35 years, or at ages 18-22 years was not associated with risk of ovarian cancer. Consumption of at least one glass per day of wine, compared to no wine, in the year before baseline was associated with increased risk of developing ovarian cancer: RR = 1.57 (95% CI 1.11-2.22), P trend = 0.01. The association with wine intake at baseline was particularly strong among peri-/post-menopausal women who used estrogen-only hormone therapy and women of high socioeconomic status. Conclusions Alcohol intake does not appear to affect ovarian cancer risk. Constituents of wine other than alcohol or, more likely, unmeasured determinants of wine drinking were associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer.\n      </p>", "Objective To investigate the association between consumption of alcoholic beverages and lung cancer risk. Methods Data were collected in two population-based case-control studies, conducted in Montreal (Study I - mid-1980s and Study II - mid-1990s). Study I included 699 cases and 507 controls, all males; Study II included 1094 cases and 1468 controls, males and females. In each study group (Study I men, Study II men and Study II women) odds ratios (OR) were estimated for the associations between beer, wine or spirits consumption and lung cancer, while carefully adjusting for smoking and other covariates. The reference category included abstainers and occasional drinkers. Results For Study I men, lung cancer risk increased with the average number of beers/week consumed (for 1-6 beers/week: OR=1.2, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.9-1.7; for \u22657 beers/week: OR=1.5, 95% CI: 1.1-2.1). For Study II men, beer consumption appeared harmful only among subjects with low fruit and vegetable consumption. In Study II, wine consumers had low lung cancer risk, particularly those reporting 1-6 glasses/week (women: OR=0.3, 95% CI: 0.2-0.4; men: OR=0.6, 95% CI: 0.4-0.8). Conclusions Beer consumption increased lung cancer risk, particularly so among men who had relatively low fruit and vegetable consumption. Moderate wine drinkers had decreased lung cancer risk.\n      </p>", "Food and beverage authentication is the process by which foods or beverages are verified as complying with its label description, for example, verifying if the denomination of origin of an olive oil bottle is correct or if the variety of a certain bottle of wine matches its label description. The common way to deal with an authentication process is to measure a number of attributes on samples of food and then use these as input for a classification problem. Our motivation stems from data consisting of measurements of nine chemical compounds denominated Anthocyanins, obtained from samples of Chilean red wines of grape varieties Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re. We consider a model-based approach to authentication through a semiparametric multivariate hierarchical linear mixed model for the mean responses, and covariance matrices that are specific to the classification categories. Specifically, we propose a model of the ANOVA-DDP type, which takes advantage of the fact that the available covariates are discrete in nature. The results suggest that the model performs well compared to other parametric alternatives. This is also corroborated by application to simulated data.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The decision appears to be a response to broadcast advertising expenditures on beer and wine and to the steady decline in the consumption of distilled spirits. Lifting the ban may result in the increased advertising of distilled spirits. Such advertising has been referred to as a political time bomb. Using historical industry data, I tested several related issues including the following: Do increases in beer and spirits advertising expenditures influence the share of distilled spirits consumption? Are such advertising expenditure increases associated with increases in absolute alcohol consumption? The findings of the study support the concerns of both distilled spirits marketing executives and public policymakers. For example, using shares of hard liquor and beer advertising to predict absolute alcohol consumed via spirits indicated significant influences: A 0.15% increase in absolute alcohol consumption was associated with a 1% share increase in hard liquor advertising, and a 0.25% decrease in absolute alcohol consumption was associated with a 1% share increase in beer advertising (adjusted R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = .93).

As public health studies expose the detrimental impact of SSBs, consumer protection and public health advocates have called for increased government control. A major focus has been on restricting marketing of SSBs to children, but many innovative policy options -legally defensible ways to regulate SSBs and support public health -are largely unexplored.

One of the mutagens was identified to be methylglyoxal. Methylglyoxal was present in various beverages such as black tea, whisky, and brandy. Methylglyoxal itself induced tumors in rats when administered by subcutaneous injection. However, the mutagenic properties of coffee were different from those of methylglyoxal. The mutagenicity of coffee was suppressed by catalase, and coffee was found to contain hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, coffee solution was found to have a hydrogen peroxide-generating system. Instant coffee (15 mg/mL) contains 130 \u03bcM hydrogen peroxide immediately after the dissolution of coffee powder in water at room temperature. The concentration of hydrogen peroxide increased with time. The mutagenicity of methylglyoxal was increased by the copresence of hydrogen peroxide. A maximum of 30-fold enhancement was observed. The mutagenicity of black tea but not that of whisky was suppressed by catalase.\n      </p>", "Age-specific consumption of beer, wine, and liquor was ascertained by telephone interview from 779 women in Wisconsin (United States) with newly reported diagnosis of carcinoma of the colon and rectum. Population controls (n = 2,315) interviewed for this case-control study were randomly selected from Wisconsin driver's license files and Health Care Financing Administration files. Overall, there was a modest indication that high levels of alcohol consumption (11 or more drinks per week) were associated with increased risk of large bowel cancer (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.47,95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 1.0-2.22). In site-specific analyses, only rectal cancer demonstrated a significant linear trend (P = 0.01) with increasing consumption. Significant beverage-specific effects were observed for liquor and colon cancer: the adjusted ORs for 1-2, 3-5, and 6 + drinks per week were 1.12, 1.68, 1.51, respectively (P trend = 0.01). Beer was associated significantly with rectal cancer: the adjusted ORs for 1-2, 3-5, 6-10, and 11 + drinks per week were 1.25, 1.25, 1.58, 2.42, respectively (P trend = 0.02). Wine consumption was associated inversely with these cancers. These relationships appeared to be consistent for recent, past, and total lifetime consumption, and were not attributable to differences in dietary habits.\n      </p>", "Consumption of mat\u00e9, a tea-like infusion of the herb Ilex paraguariensis, is common in South America. Drinkers have high risks of upper aerodigestive tract cancers, but it is conceivable that this high risk may be attributable to confounding by smoking, alcohol, and other exposures. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the data from a case-control study of upper aerodigestive tract cancers conducted in Southern Brazil. We matched noncancer controls (N = 756) to cases (N = 378) on the basis of age, sex, and period of admission. We estimated the effect of mat\u00e9 consumption by conditional logistic regression with adjustment for smoking, alcohol, sociodemographics, and several dietary items, considered as confounders. The unadjusted relative risk (RR) for all upper aerodigestive tract cancers was 2.1 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.6-2.7]. Some excess risk persisted after adjustment for potential confounders (RR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.2-2.2). Most of the excess risk for mat\u00e9 drinkers was for oral (RR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.1-3.3) and laryngeal (RR = 2.2; 95% CI = 1.1-4.5) cancers. There was no evidence of associations with coffee and tea drinking. We conclude that the association of mat\u00e9 consumption with upper aerodigestive tract cancer risk is unlikely to result from insufficient control of confounding by critical exposures. Owing to its high prevalence in Southern South America, mat\u00e9 drinking may be linked to as many as 20% of all cases occurring in this region.\n      </p>", "Mexico is building a legal framework to address its childhood obesity epidemic. Sugar sweetened beverages (SSB) in the school environment represent a major policy challenge. We addressed the following questions: What barriers inhibit political attention to SSB and childhood obesity? What political instruments, international and national, exist to guide agenda setting in Mexico? What opportunities exist for policy adoption? We conducted a systematic review of international and national legal instruments concerned with SSB consumption. We traced process, conducting interviews with key informants. Thematic analysis helped us identify barriers and opportunities for public health interventions. We found I I national policy instruments, but detected implementation gaps and weak fiscal policies on SSB consumption in schools: limited drinking water infrastructure, SSB industry interests, and regulatory ambiguities addressing reduction of sugar in beverages. Public policy should target marketing practices and taxation. The school environment remains a promising target for policy. Access to safe drinking water must complement comprehensive and multi-sector policy approaches to reduce access to SSB.\n      </p>", "Moderate alcohol consumption protects against coronary heart disease, but there is ongoing debate about whether the effects and the underlying mechanisms differ by type of alcoholic beverage. In our case-control study from Germany, we assessed and compared the effect of alcohol consumption from various sources on risk of coronary heart disease and its underlying mechanisms. The sample included 312 patients with clinically stable, angiographically confirmed coronary heart disease and 479 healthy controls. After control for potential confounding factors, the odds ratio for coronary heart disease was 0.55 (95% confidence interval = 0.37-0.83) for drinkers compared with nondrinkers. Risk reduction was particularly strong among the majority of study participants who reported drinking predominantly or exclusively beer. Alcohol consumption from various sources was consistently associated with a more favorable profile of lipids and hemostatic factors. Nevertheless, a strong inverse association persisted between beer drinking and coronary heart disease even after control for these \"intermediate variables.\" Our results support suggestions that the protective effect of moderate alcohol consumption against coronary heart disease is mediated in part by beneficial effects of ethanol on lipids and hemostatic factors. Additional mechanisms may account for the strong protective effect of moderate beer consumption.\n      </p>", "An increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage among heavy consumers of alcohol has been demonstrated in several epidemiologic studies. The effect of moderate or intermediate intakes is, however, unclear. Although several studies provide evidence for a protective effect, this conclusion may be spurious, resulting from the inclusion, within the zero intake (reference) group, of past drinkers who have recently abstained for health reasons. The present study describes the relation between alcohol consumption and intracerebral hemorrhage among 331 case-control pairs recruited in Melbourne, Australia. Heavy drinking was associated with an increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (odds ratio (OR) 3.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.4-8.4). The odds ratio of intracerebral hemorrhage with moderate drinking, when compared with never drinkers, was 0.7, (95% CI = 0.4-1.2) and was 0.6 (95% CI = 0.4-1.0) when compared with nondrinkers (never drinkers plus past drinkers). Wine drinkers were apparently protected from intracerebral hemorrhage (OR 0.5, 95% CI = 0.2-0.9). These results are consistent with the possibility that moderate drinking may confer protection from intracerebral hemorrhage, but this protection may be less than that previously reported.\n      </p>", "Both the incidence of and mortality from bleeding and perforated peptic ulcers are increasing. We assessed the association between smoking, intake of alcohol (including type of alcoholic beverage), and risk of a complicated peptic ulcer in a population-based study of 26,518 Danish subjects followed up for an average of 13.4 years. There were 214 cases of incident bleeding and 107 cases with perforated ulcers. We estimated relative risks (RRs) for incident bleeding and perforated peptic ulcers using Poisson regression analysis. Smoking more than 15 cigarettes per day compared with never smoking increased the risk of a perforated ulcer more than threefold [RR = 3.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.7-7.1)]. Drinking more than 42 drinks per week increased the risk of a bleeding ulcer fourfold (RR = 4.4; 95% CI = 2.3-8.3) compared with drinking less than one drink per week. Using the same comparison group, subjects who drank more than 21 drinks per week but no wine were at a higher risk of a bleeding ulcer (RR = 8.8; 95% CI = 2.2-35) than drinkers of the same amount of alcohol, but with more than 25% of their intake as wine (RR = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.0-6.0).\n      </p>", "Objective\u2014To examine the association between self reported alcohol intake and subsequent mortality from all causes and if the effect of alcohol intake on the risk of death is modified by sex, age, body mass index, and smoking. Design\u2014Prospective population study with baseline assessment of alcohol and tobacco consumption and body mass index, and 10-12 years' follow up of mortality. Setting\u2014Copenhagen city heart study, Denmark. Subjects\u20147234 women and 6051 men aged 30-79 years. Main outcome measure\u2014Number and time of deaths from 1976 to 1988. Results\u2014A total of 2229 people died, 1398 being men. A U shaped curve described the relation between alcohol intake and mortality. The lowest risk was observed at one to six alcoholic beverages a week (relative risk set at 1). Abstainers had a relative risk of 1.37 (95% confidence interval 1.20 to 1.56) whereas those drinking more than 70 beverages a week had a relative risk of 2.29 (1.75 to 3.00). Among the drinkers, the risk was significantly increased only among those drinking more than 42 beverages a week. Sex, age, body mass index, and smoking did not significantly modify the risk function. The risk among heavy drinkers was slightly reduced when smoking was controlled for. The risk function was similar in the first and second period of six years of observation. Conclusion\u2014Alcohol intake showed a U shaped relation to mortality with the nadir at one to six beverages a week. The risk function was not modified by sex, age, body mass index, or smoking and remained stable over 12 years.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The barley grains are predominantly sprouted and we argue that the assemblage represents the remains of deliberate malting. Malt was most likely related to beer-brewing. The neighboring oven could have been used to stop the germination process at the desired level by drying or roasting the grain.

About half the world's consumption of absolute alcohol comes from spirits, one third from beer, the rest from wine. Spirits are the leading drink in Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, Central and Northern America and most of Asia; wine in southern Europe, parts of South America and Central Asia; beer in northern Europe, North America and Australasia. The production of grapes from which wine is made is climatically limited and consumption is high only in the regions of production, i.e. mainly areas of Mediterraneantype climate. Beer production is much more widely distributed, and only a very small amount is exported. Spirits, unlike beer and wine, can be made from a wide variety of plants, and so their consumption is not limited to areas of production. Income per capita, religion, migration and several other factors influence the relative importance of the beverages in different parts of the world.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

We find that the presence of proscriptions on price advertising significantly increases market concentration at the state level, both absolutely and relative to a measure of national concentration. The evidence also indicates that banning local non-price advertising in addition to price advertising yields no marginal significant change in either measure of state-level concentration. Analysis of individual brewers' market shares suggests that large national brewers gain at the expense of smaller brewers when price advertising is restricted.\n      </p>", "This paper assesses the impact of alcoholic beverage warning labels through national surveys conducted in May 1989 and May 1990. The results show a slight increase in the public's perception of the risk level associated with consuming alcoholic beverages since the warning label became effective. They also show that, 35 percent of the sample responded that alcoholic beverage containers were \"very likely\" or \"somewhat likely\" to have warnings. About 11 percent of the sample was able to identify the specific pregnancy hazard warning. The awareness level was highest among younger adults and \"heavy\" alcohol consumers.\n      </p>", "Although various factors have been implicated in the aetiology of oesophageal cancer, one factor common to many countries is the consumption of alcoholic beverages. In England and Wales mortality from oesophageal cancer declined rapidly during the early part of this century but both mortality and incidence have increased in recent years. The generation of males born in 1906 had lower mortality than any preceding or succeeding generation. It is suggested that ages 20 to 30 may be critical in the development of oesophageal cancer and that the 1906 cohort was less exposed to alcohol than other generations. The international analysis suggests that ethyl alcohol itself rather than any specific alcoholic beverage is associated with this cancer.\n      </p>", "Caffeine drinks were unknown in Europe prior to the 16th century expansion of European colonial powers. Coffee, tea and cacao were the three caffeine commodities which, by the late 17th century, dominated European caffeine consumption habits. World systems models of mercantile expansion have emphasized European consumption as a driving force behind the development of plantation economies. The process by which these drinks gained prominence, however, was initially centred on regional production and consumption in the colonies themselves. The history of other caffeine beverages such as guayusa and yerba mat\u00e9 in South America provides a wider view. Such products never gained a market in the metropole, but illustrate the variables involved in the transition of caffeine plant domesticates from pre-colonial regional products to cosmopolitan, global commodities.\n      </p>", "Sales force deployment involves the simultaneous resolution of four interrelated subproblems: sales force sizing, salesman location, sales territory alignment, and sales resource allocation. The first subproblem deals with selecting the appropriate number of salesman. The salesman location aspect of the problem involves determining the location of each salesman in one sales coverage unit. Sales territory alignment may be viewed as the problem of grouping sales coverage units into larger geographic clusters called sales territories. Sales resource allocation refers to the problem of allocating scarce salesman time to the aligned sales coverage units. All four subproblems have to be resolved in order to maximize profit of the selling organization. In this paper a novel nonlinear mixed-integer programming model is formulated which covers all four subproblems simultaneously. For the solution of the model we present approximation methods capable of solving large-scale, real-world instances. The methods, which provide lower bounds for the optimal objective function value, are bench-marked against upper bounds. On average the solution gap, i.e., the difference between upper and lower bounds, is about 3%. Furthermore, we show how the methods can be used to analyze various problem settings of practical relevance. Finally, an application in the beverage industry is presented.\n      </p>", "We studied the relation between sexual and health behaviors of women and first-time urinary tract infection (UTI). The study population was women using a university health service who were unmarried, had no UTI history, and who had engaged in sexual activity at least once. We found 86 cases of UTI, defined as one or more urinary symptoms and \u22651,000 colony-forming units per ml urine of a known pathogen. We randomly sampled 288 controls from the student body. Vaginal intercourse increased the risk of UTI; this risk was further increased with condom use. After adjusting for vaginal intercourse with other birth control methods and recentness of current sexual partnership, a single sex act with a condom in the past 2 weeks increased UTI risk by 43%. Having a sex partner for less than 1 year vs 1 year or more, after adjustment for frequency of vaginal intercourse and birth control method, was associated with about twice the risk of UTI [odds ratio (OR) = 1.97; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-3.74]. After adjusting for frequency of vaginal intercourse, regular drinking of cranberry juice was protective against UTI (OR = 0.48; 95% CI = 0.19-1.02), whereas drinking carbonated soft drinks appeared to be associated with increased risk (OR = 2.37; 95% CI = 0.75-7.81). Using deodorant sanitary napkins or tampons was associated with a slight increase in risk of UTI (OR = 1.51; 95% CI = 0.74-3.06). Blacks had five times greater risk of UTI than whites after adjusting for frequency of vaginal intercourse (OR = 5.2; 95% CI = 1.89-24.63). We observed only modest differences in health behavior between racial groups.\n      </p>", "", "", "", "Background: Food items on a self-administered food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) may be left blank because the food was not consumed, because of difficulties remembering the frequency or amount of intake, or due to an oversight. Methods: We explored the predictors and frequency of consumption of omitted food items on an FFQ used in the Nurses' Health Study II. Of 87,676 women who returned a mailed 147-item FFQ in 1999, 34% completed the entire questionnaire, whereas 66% left at least 1 food item blank. Ten or more food items were omitted by 5% of participants. Foods were more likely omitted by women who were older or more physically active. We resurveyed 2876 participants who had left between 1 and 70 food items blank and asked them to fill in the blanks. Overall, 2485 participants provided complete responses. Results: In the resurvey, 64% of the formerly omitted foods were marked as consumed never or less than once per month, 20% as 1 to 3 times per month, 8% as once per week, and 9% as more than once per week. Commonly consumed foods and beverages were less likely omitted because they were not consumed than rarely consumed foods. The best estimate for the true intake value of an omitted food was 0.82 times the average population intake. Conclusions: While calculating nutrient intake, the assumption that items missing represent zero intake is reasonable. However, food items consumed more often in the population at large are less likely than rarely consumed food items to be left blank because they were not consumed.\n      </p>"], "words": {"mexico":
