A staple of American schools, American life, and popular culture, the cheerleader, however, has received scant attention in scholarly research. In this article, the authors argue that a feminist poststructuralist reading of cheerleading situates cheerleading as a discursive practice that has changed significantly in the past 150 years to accommodate the shifting and often contradictory meanings of normative femininity. They maintain that the ideal girl of the new millennium embodies both masculinity and femininity and that cheerleading offers a culturally sanctioned space for some girls to embody ideal girlhood. They argue that cheerleading is a gendered activity representing in some ways a liberatory shift in reconstituting normative femininity while simultaneously perpetuating a norm of femininity that does not threaten dominant social values and expectations about the role of girls and women in society.\n      </p>", "Cheerleading occupies a contested space in American culture and a key point of controversy is whether it ought to be considered a sport. Drawing on interviews with college cheerleaders on coed squads, as well as five years of fieldwork in various cheerleading sites, this paper examines the debate over cheerleading and sport in terms of its gender politics. The bid for sport status on the part of cheerleaders revolves around the desire for respect more than official recognition by athletic organizations; cheerleaders recognize the prestige associated with sport, a function of its historic association with hegemonic masculinity, and they claim that prestige for cheerleading by highlighting its recent transformation into a more athletic, competitive activity that is no longer \"just for girls.\" However, the support function of college cheerleading, combined with its \"feminine\" performance demands, make the bid for sport status controversial. Male cheerleaders in particular distance themselves from the feminine elements of cheerleading because they want to avoid being perceived as gay. The gender politics at work here illustrate both the elasticity of gender categories and the limits of that elasticity, as gendered boundaries are drawn and redrawn between what gets to count as sport and what does not, and as cheerleading simultaneously challenges and reinforces the notion of sport as a male preserve. Because masculinity and femininity are performed side-by-side in coed cheerleading, this research underscores the importance of relational analyses for examining and critiquing the construction of gender and sexuality. Keywords: gender, sport, performance, hegemonic masculinity, emphasized femininity.\n      </p>", "This article explores the cultural and structural forces that help influence the reproduction of sexist, misogynistic, and antifeminine attitudes among men in team sports. It first shows how the segregation of men into a homosocial environment limits their social contact with women and fosters an oppositional masculinity that influences the reproduction of orthodox views regarding women. However, this research also shows that when these same men compete in the gender-integrated sport of cheerleading, they positively reformulate their attitudes toward women. These findings therefore suggest that gender-integrating sports might potentially decrease some of the socionegative outcomes attributed to male team sport athletes, possibly including violence against women.\n      </p>", "Five years earlier, a Midwestern school board constructed policies to \"create an equal footing\" for girls of all races, ethnicities, and social classes to become cheerleaders. The policies were not successful. This qualitative study extends the work of critical feminist policy researchers by highlighting the importance of peer-group affiliation in adolescent girls' lives and how this marker of identity intersected with a cheerleading equity policy.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The Court sometimes injects itself into these disputes and through dicta and other inspirational activities becomes a cheerleader for one side. I consider the effectiveness of the Court's cheerleading in inspiring change in national policy following Roe v. Wade (1973) and Brown v. Board (1954), finding that judicial cheerleading was much more effective for achieving a consensus about desegregation than for achieving one about abortion rights. I conclude by arguing that the Court's cheerleading: (1) has the capacity to bring politico-moral issues to the front burner, (2) is more effective in supporting change rather than in defending the status quo, (3) does not frighten or shame the losing side into abandoning its cause, often having the opposite effect, and (4) must persuade the uncommitted within a decade if its cause is to be successful.\n      </p>", "Using in-depth interviews and participant observation from sixty-eight male cheerleaders and four selected cheerleading teams, this research examines the construction of masculinity among college-age heterosexual male cheerleaders. Whereas previous studies of men in feminized terrain have shown that hegemonic processes of dominance and subordination influence most men to bolster their masculinity through an approximation of orthodox masculine requisites, this research finds that heterosexual men in collegiate cheerleading today exhibit two forms of normative masculinity. One form retains most tenets of orthodox masculine construction, whereas the other is shown to be more inclusive. Men who subscribe to this inclusive form of masculinity do not respond to their transgression into feminized terrain in the same manner as has been shown in other investigations of men in feminized arenas because they are shown to accept feminine behavior and homosexuality among men. The emergence of this more inclusive form of masculinity is attributed to many factors, including the structure of the sport, the reduction of cultural, institutional, and organizational homophobia, and the resocialization of men into a gender-integrated sport.\n      </p>", "Both functionalist and conflict theories of sports suggest that participation in sports may have a positive influence on achievement in science, especially for young women. The research presented here found that young women's involvement in high school sports often has a strong and positive association with their success in science in their sophomore and senior years of high school, but that participation in cheerleading is usually negatively associated with success in science. It also found that involvement in sports is a factor in young African American women's success in science, but not always a positive factor. Comparable analyses for young men showed that sports activities are much less important in predicting their science experiences and that when these activities are significant, they have a negative influence.\n      </p>", "The authors examine children's access to and caregiver's satisfaction with organizations that provide leisure time activities for children on Saturdays. The authors argue that access and satisfaction are a function of families' financial, cultural, and social capital. Using data on 1,036 households in the Phoenix metropolitan area in 2003\u201304, the authors found that families' financial and cultural capital affected whether or not children participated in activities organized by organizations, but family ties to the organization directly (e.g., either worked there, volunteered, donated) resulted in caregivers being more satisfied with the services. The authors also found that the benefits of network closure (caregivers knowing the parents of the other children on site) were greater the riskier the activities of the child (e.g., sports or cheerleading). Contrary to the authors' expectations, having family or friends in the area did not affect caregiver's satisfaction with the child's provider.\n      </p>", "Much existing research documents the benefits gained by students when they participate in high school extracurricular activities (Camp, 1990; Eidsmore, 1964; Haensly, Lupkowski, &amp; Edlind, 1986; Holland &amp; Andre, 1987; McNeal, 1995; Yarworth &amp; Gauthier, 1978). However, we know little about the patterns of participation (i.e., who is more likely to participate in which activities?). A finding in this research was that extracurricular activities are not equitably participated in by various subgroups of the high school population. To some degree, members of various racial and ethnic minority groups have greater likelihood(s) of participating in all types of extracurricular activities studied (athletics, cheerleading, fine arts, academic organizations, newspaper/yearbook, student government/service organizations, and vocational activities). Girls have an increased likelihood of participating in all the activities except athletics, which are dominated by boys. Finally, evidence also supports the hypothesis that the high school extracurriculum is one arena in which students of higher socioeconomic standing and greater academic ability have a distinct advantage. Given the differential rates of participation, and specifically the increased rates by various minorities, restricting access to or eleminating specific activities may make student access, and the resulting benefits from participation (e.g., network, prestige, cultural capital), less equitably distributed among the student population.\n      </p>", "Critiques of American mainstream and conservative media for their often dubious cheerleading of the US war against Iraq have become familiar elements of recent public discourse. However, such analyses have not generated equivalent intellectual engagement with media representations of North Korea. Considering how difficult it has been to obtain accurate information on North Korea, this relative paucity is surprising. I address this lacuna by analyzing the role of the Japanese media, particularly television, in generating public perceptions of North Korea. Why did Japanese television coverage of North Korea reach saturation points following the 9/17 summit? Why were audiences so receptive? How did television shape public opinion? And how did domestic public opinion influence or constrict Japan's North Korea policy? In answering these questions, rather than simply observe that the abductions themselves have been the most important issue in Japan, or note that there have been temporary increases or decreases in Japanese media coverage of North Korea, I argue that television (and other forms of mass media) herded the public into a relatively constricted range of views through narrow, biased saturation coverage of the issue dujour. An intersection of structural concentration, content isomorphism, malleable audiences and domestic policy conflicts allowed the media not only to set agendas, but to prime the audience and frame the presentation of information. Public opinion, maintained by conservative political lobbies, viewer ratings responses and broadcasting strategies, ultimately constricted the government policy agenda, range and choice in dealing with North Korea, generating very predictable behaviours.\n      </p>", "           ", "           ", "           ", "           ", "           ", "           ", "This study examines the maintenance of gender and sexuality within a female-dominated sport, focusing specifically on men who cheer. Data were collected at a northeastern Ohio university using focus group discussions and one-on-one interviews. The interviews and discussions provided themes regarding stigmatization of male cheerleaders, the need to project a heterosexual image, and methods of saving face. Findings indicate that the gender and sexuality of men who cheer are called into question. In order to affirm their gender and sexuality as masculine and heterosexual, the men engage in behavior that sexualizes women and desexualizes their relationships with men.

In a suburban middle-class junior high school there is an important assumed congruence between the prestige of an individual's status category and the extracurricular activities in which she or he participates.

This article seeks to delineate the cultural meanings that provide the symbolic glue between status category and activity and make their incongruity so threatening.

The few studies that have examined gender socialization in schools have focused primarily on the role of textbooks and formal instruction in the promotion of traditional gender roles. Since most middle schools and high schools also sponsor extracurricular activities, it is important to determine the role these activities play in the promotion of gender differences in values and behavior. In this paper, we examine the effect of athletic-related activities on the peer-group culture of students at a predominantly working-class middle school. We find that certain extracurricular activities influence the predominant male and female cultures of early adolescents. Since male athletic events are the main social events of the school, both male athletes and female cheerleaders have considerable visibility and are likely to be members of the elite group. Males and females are exposed to very different values through these activities. Male athletes are encouraged to be achievement-oriented and competitive, and cheerleaders are reminded of the importance of appearance and emotion management. These values are incorporated into the informal peer culture of the school, where they are further refined and applied to specific situations and behaviors.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

We found that a system of social stratification developed during the middle school years, resulting in a clear, stable hierarchy of cliques by eighth grade. Friendships with popular girls became an important avenue for peer status. At the same time, however, many popular girls tended to avoid interactions with students of lower status, leading to strong feelings of resentment and dislike.
