A field experiment was conducted in the fall of 2005 and repeated in the fall of 2006 to investigate the effect of mulches alone or in combination with a reduced-risk insecticide, imidacloprid (Admire\u00ae 2F) on whiteflies and related problems in zucchini squash. UV-reflective mulch and the living mulch, buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench), with and without imidacloprid, were evaluated in a randomized complete block design with 4 replications. White mulch (standard) was included as a control in the experiment. Mulches in combination with imidacloprid resulted in fewer whiteflies per leaf than those without imidacloprid in 2005 and 2006. More whiteflies were recorded on zucchini plants growing on white synthetic mulch than all other treatments in both years. In the 2006 growing season, these plants also showed the first symptoms of viral infection caused by Cucurbit leaf crumple virus (CuLCrV), a whitefly-transmitted geminivirus. Both living and reflective mulches were more effective than white mulch in reducing the densities of whiteflies and the incidence of CuLCrV on zucchini plants. /// Bemisia tabaci biotipo B (Gennadius) (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae) tambi\u00e9n conocida como Bemisia argentifolii (Bellows and Perring) es una plaga principal del cultivo de calabac\u00edn (Cucurbita pepo L.) causando da\u00f1os directos e indirectos. En un experimento llevado a cabo en el oto\u00f1o del 2005 y repetido en la misma \u00e9poca en el 2006 investigo el efecto de coberturas solas o en combinaci\u00f3n con el insecticida de riesgo reducido imidacloprid (Admire\u00ae 2F) para el control de mosca blanca y otros problemas relacionados en calabac\u00edn. Coberturas UV-reflectivas, y coberturas naturales (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench), solas o en combinaci\u00f3n con imidacloprid fueron evaluadas usando el dise\u00f1o de bloques completos al azar con cuatro repeticiones. Tambi\u00e9n una cobertura blanca fue incluida como control del experimento. Coberturas combinadas con imidacloprid en el 2005 y 2006 tuvieron significativamente menos mosca blanca. La cobertura de pl\u00e1stico blanco mostro el mayor n\u00famero de mosca blanca en ambos a\u00f1os. En la temporada del 2006, las plantas mostraron los primeros s\u00edntomas de infecciones virales causadas por el virus del plegamiento de las hojas de calabazas (CuLCrV), el cual es un geminivirus transmitido por la mosca blanca. Coberturas vivas y reflectivas fueron m\u00e1s efectivas que las coberturas blancas en la reducci\u00f3n del n\u00famero de mosca blanca y la incidencia de CuLCrV en las plantas de calabac\u00edn.\n      </p>", "Optimal strategies for squash are presented assuming that the game can be modelled as a Markov chain. Further implications of this model are discussed in relation to handicapping and the correspondence between different scoring systems. The validity of the model is briefly discussed in the light of data.\n      </p>", "Alcohol precipitation and high speed centrifugation were used to purify and concentrate squash mosaic virus. Electron micrographs of a purified preparation showed the tendency of relatively uniform spherical virus particles to form aggregates having a rather uniform internal structure. An electron micrograph of a control preparation of a healthy zucchini squash plant showed irregular aggregates of particles unlike those of squash mosaic virus. Crystals of squash mosaic virus measuring 0.5 - 0.8 \u00d7 3-5 \u03bc were produced from the purified solution.\n      </p>", "\u2022 Compared with leaf-feeding herbivores, little is known about how sap-feeding herbivores affect plant growth, morphology and reproduction. This study examines effects of the sap-feeding squash bug (Anasa tristis) on watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) root, leaf and reproductive structures. \u2022 Plants at the four-leaf stage were exposed to different densities of caged squash bugs for 67 d (to plant maturity). \u2022 Initial effects were on roots. Herbivory was associated with a significant reduction in mean total root length, root surface area and number of root tips, as well as an increase in root diameters. Herbivore-exposed plants had significantly more leaves, although leaf lifespan was decreased. Both total plant dry mass and fruit dry mass per unit leaf area were significantly greater in controls. Significant effects of herbivores on plant reproductive traits included delayed flower formation (by 7-12 d), change in floral sex ratio (in favor of femaleness), increased fruit abortion, and smaller fruit size. \u2022 Developmental consequences were related to changes in plant water relations, including decreased water-use efficiency. Water use in treated plants was three to nine times greater per unit of plant dry mass than in controls.\n      </p>", "The relative tolerance of cucumber and squash to amiben was established for germinating seeds, and for young plants with both foliage and root applications. In all cases, the dosage required for 50% inhibition of growth was 6 to 8 times greater for squash than for cucumber. Root applications of carbon-14 labeled amiben on reciprocal grafts of cucumber and squash plants indicated that the shoots were spared in these experiments by differential blocking of amiben transport from the roots. Shoots of either species appeared tolerant on squash roots and susceptible on cucumber roots. Radioactivity in the shoots of both species was much greater when grafted on cucumber than on squash. Foliage applications of carbon-14 labeled amiben showed more entry into cucumber than squash, but little movement to untreated plant parts in either species.\n      </p>", "Response of 'Dixie', 'Lemondrop', 'Multipik', 'Superpik', and 'Seneca Prolific' summer squash to halosulfuron PRE or POST at 0.036, 0.053, and 0.072 kg ai/ha, or halosulfuron PRE fb halosulfuron POST at 0.018 fb 0.018, 0.027 fb 0.027, and 0.036 fb 0.036 kg/ha was field evaluated in 1997 and 1998. All halosulfuron treatments and rates reduced the height of cultivars 17-19% at 6 WAP (weeks after planting) and summer-squash injury (chlorosis and necrosis of crop foliage) was 6, 14, and 11% from halosulfuron PRE, POST, and PRE fb POST, respectively. Early summersquash flowering was reduced 32-82% by halosulfuron, resulting in reduced early yields. Dixie was the cultivar most tolerant to halosulfuron. Early flowering of Dixie was reduced 32-36% compared to 32-82% for the other cultivars. Marketable yield of summer squash was reduced 20-30% by all rates of halosulfuron when averaged over all application timings. Marketable yield of Seneca Prolific, Superpik, Dixie, Multipik, and Lemondrop was reduced 0-17% by halosulfuron PRE. Halosulfuron POST or PRE fb POST reduced marketable yield of all summer-squash cultivars by 25-46%. Thus, summer squash was not tolerant of POST halosulfuron; however, Dixie, Multipik, Seneca Prolific, and Superpik exhibited tolerance to halosulfuron PRE.\n      </p>", "Maternal-environmental effects on subsequent progeny life-history traits were evaluated in squash (Cucurbita pepo L.) in terms of the amount of time available for seed development, and the timing of fruit production. Progeny arising from three kinds of fruit were compared. Plants from which fruits were removed 3 d post-pollination throughout the growing season developed only `late' fruits (during 10-15 d) at the end of the growing season; on control plants both `early' and `late' fruits developed (both types allowed to ripen fully). Seed from each type of fruit was weighed individually and categorized into three size classes, then germinated and raised to maturity, including regular harvesting of all fruits 3 d post-pollination. Maternal effects were evident for both vegetative and reproductive traits and carried over to later stages. In contrast, effects due simply to seed size disappeared by day 30 for leaf variables and day 60 for male flower production. Within a seed-size class, progeny arising from fruit of treated plants produced significantly more leaves, with greater size, and more male flowers than those arising from fruit of control plants, while the reverse Was true for fruit number and fruit mass. This result is discussed in terms of possible gibberellic acid involvement. In control plants, progeny arising from seeds in the large, fully mature `early' fruits produced significantly more, and larger leaves by day 30 than did those from late fruits (suggesting differential provisioning in seeds during development). Male flower production had a highly significant positive correlation with vegetative mass and a significant negative correlation with fruit production.\n      </p>", "This study tests the hypothesis that feeding behavior in the herbivorous coccinellid Epilachna borealis is an effective adaptation for avoiding facultative chemical defenses in its cucurbit host plants. Chemical analyses, feeding preference tests, fitness evaluations, and cucumber beetle assays for cucurbitacins show that (1) beetle feeding damage to zucchini leaves triggers chemical change in damaged leaves and leaves adjacent to damaged leaves; (2) this change in leaf chemistry is sufficiently potent for beetles to detect and avoid; (3) induced changes in leaf chemistry negatively affect E. borealis fitness; (4) E. borealis trenching behavior blocks, at least temporarily, the translocation of cucurbitacin defenses to feeding sites, thus preserving the palatability and quality of food resources for beetles.\n      </p>", "Squash plants (Cucurbita pepo) placed in darkness, do not grow more than a few millimeters and die within 4-5 days. When their hollow petioles are injected with a 7 per cent sucrose solution, they not only remain alive in darkness for periods of at most 30 days, but their stems also elongate at a rate of maximally 50 mm. per day. This maximum growth rate is reached about one week after placing the plants in darkness. The optimum sugar concentration varies with age and vigor of the plants; usually it is about 7 per cent sucrose and an equal percentage levulose. Daily renewal of the sugar solution is best, since during the first week at least, a 7 per cent sucrose solution is reduced to 2-3 per cent in 24 hr. For best results it is necessary to add about 0.025 per cent sulfanilamide to the sugar, otherwise mold development occurs. Levulose is the most effective sugar; on a molar basis sucrose is almost as effective and produces more growth than dextrose. Whereas stem elongation is very marked in darkness, leaves do not enlarge beyond a size of about 10 mm. Injection of sugar, adenine and other nucleic acids, and amino acids failed to cause any further enlargement of leaves in darkness. Further expansion, to a very limited degree, was only obtained by exposing the etiolated leaf to strong light.\n      </p>", "The proteolytic activity of the cotyledons of squash (Cucurbita maxima Duchesne) increases several fold during germination. The different herbicides varied widely in their ability to inhibit this increase. An attempt was made to correlate this inhibition with inhibition of growth. A direct correlation was evident only when the inhibition of proteolytic activity was severe or very slight to nonexistent.\n      </p>", "Staminate flowers of the Acorn squash (Cucurbita pepo, cv. Table Queen) are initiated monosexually, pistillate flowers are initiated bisexually. Pistillate flower primordia are physiologically bisexual from a stage below 0.3 mm until they are 0.8 mm in width. Male and female floral buds were cultivated on White's medium, modified according to Galun et al. (1963). In excised female floral buds the relative development of stamens is better than in in-situ floral buds; the opposite relationship holds for ovary development. The smaller the bud at excision, the greater the stamen growth and the lesser the ovary growth, both in absolute and relative terms. Although smaller pistillate floral buds cultured in vitro showed a greater increase in maleness than larger ones, there was no difference in the percentage of female buds between explants of the two sizes when originating from the \"mixed\" stem region (that is, the stem region carrying male and female flowers). Addition of 3-indoleacetic acid and the anti-auxin p-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid to standard medium in equal amounts resulted in somewhat better development of excised floral buds than addition of each of these compounds alone. The percentage of female buds among explants originating from identical nodes was not significantly influenced by 3-indoleacetic acid or p-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid.\n      </p>", "Translocation of 14C-labeled assimilates in Early Prolific Straightneck squash (Cucurbita melopepo torticollis Bailey) through a 15-centimeter oxygen-deficient zone of the petiole was studied as a function of varying periods of anaerobiosis (N2 atmosphere). Initiation of anaerobic conditions caused an immediate and rapid decline in translocation to about 35 to 45% of the pretreatment rate within 30 to 40 minutes. This inhibition response (first inhibition response) was transient, however, and full recovery to the pretreatment rate occurred during the ensuing 60 to 90 minutes. Following this adaptation response to anaerobic conditions, translocation continued unimpaired for extended periods of time, approaching, and in some cases exceeding, 24 hours. The second inhibition response was permanent and could not be reversed by supplying air during a subsequent 20-hour period.\n      </p>", "Two streams of sugars moving in opposite directions in the petiole of a half-grown leaf were demonstrated by feeding tritiated glucose to a fully grown leaf of a squash plant (Cucurbita melopepo Bailey) and 14CO2 to the half-grown one. Autoradiographic evidence indicates that the movement of both streams occurred within the same sieve tubes. The data do not fit the mass flow theory of translocation which requires unidirectional flow of sugar solution in the lumen of the sieve tube.\n      </p>", "In etiolated squash (Cucurbita maxima L.) cotyledons, nitrate-inducible NADH:nitrate reductase activity and protein were increased in darkness by red light pulses with red/far-red photoreversibility. Continuous far-red light also led to increased levels of nitrate reductase activity and protein. Poly(A)+ RNA, which hybridizes to squash nitrate reductase cDNA, was also increased by light treatments. Thus, we found that after nitrate triggering, nitrate reductase expression appears to be regulated by light via phytochrome.\n      </p>", "Intact roots of boron-sufficient squash (Cucurbita pepo L.) plants, plants entering boron deficiency, and plants recovering from boron deficiency were exposed to tritiated thymidine at the end of the treatment period to label the replicating DNA of root tip cells. Using histological sections, autoradiographs of intact root meristems were prepared. The labeling pattern in +B root tips revealed the presence of a well defined quiescent center. The ability of root tip cells to incorporate label is correlated with the total root elongation during the -B treatment period. A greater amount of total root elongation during boron deficiency and recovery reflects the fact that root tip cells have retained their ability to synthesize DNA and enter mitosis for a longer time. In roots recovering from boron deficiency, cells of the quiescent center were seen to play no part in the recovery process in roots treated for as long as 20 hours in a --B nutrient solution. They were inactive before, during, and after the --B treatment. Cessation of mitosis occurs as early as 6.5 hours after boron is withheld from the nutrient solution while DNA synthesis can occur for as long as 20 hours after withholding boron. It was concluded that boron is essential for continued DNA synthesis and mitotic activity. The absence of boron results in the cessation of mitosis and DNA synthesis within 20 hours from the time boron is withheld.\n      </p>", "Elite breeding lines and susceptible varieties of Cucurbita pepo L. (zucchini and yellow crookneck squash) and accessions of two wild species, Cucurbita ecuadorensis Cutler and Whitaker and Cucurbita martinezii Bailey, were evaluated in spring and fall 1995 for resistance to silverleaf whitefly, Bemisia argentifolii Bellows &amp; Perring, and to squash silverleaf, a physiological disorder associated with feeding by B. argentifolii. Populations of whitefly and severity of silvering were greater in the spring season than in the fall. In general, the yellow squash variety, 'Supersett', and the two yellow squash breeding lines (A24-10 and K26-4) supported larger populations of whitefly than the zucchini variety, 'Elite', and A21-7 and Sunseeds 3, the zucchini breeding lines. However, whitefly populations within the yellow squash cultigens or within the zucchini cultigens did not differ significantly. In contrast, 'Elite' was severely in the spring (average rating of 4.8 at the end of the season) while Sunseeds 3 never exhibited silverleaf and only one plant of A21-7 exhibited slight silvering (rating of 1). 'Supersett' was usually significantly more silvered than the yellow squash breeding lines, but the lines nevertheless exhibited significant levels of silvering (average rating of 3.2 compared to 3.9 for 'Supersett' at the end of the spring season). Four accessions of the two wild species, C. ecuadorensis and C. martinezii, all supported moderate populations of whiteflies and developed silverleaf. In the case of the zucchini breeding lines, silverleaf severity was not related to numbers of immature whiteflies. Resistance to silverleaf in the zucchini breeding lines may be due to some form of tolerance to the effects of whitefly feeding. /// La resistencia a la mosca blanca, Bemisia argentifolii Bellows y Perring, y al plateado de la calabaza, un desorden fisiol\u00f3gico asociado con el ataque de B. argentifolii fueron evaluados en l\u00edneas promisorias y variedades susceptibles de Cucurbita pepo L. (zucchini y calabaza amarilla) y en accesiones de dos especies salvajes, Cucurbita ecuadorensis Cutler y Whitaker y Cucurbita martinezii Bailey, durante la primavera y el oto\u00f1o de 1995. Las poblaciones de moscas blancas y la severidad del plateado fueron mayores en la primavera que en el oto\u00f1o. En general, la variedad de calabazas amarillas 'Supersett' y las dos l\u00edneas de calabazas amarillas A24-10 y K26-4 soportaron mayores poblaciones de moscas blancas que la variedad 'Elite' y las lineas A21-7 y Sunseeds 3 de zucchini. Sin embargo, las poblaciones de moscas blancas en los cultigenes de calabazas amarillas o de zucchini no difirieron signifiacativamente. En contraste, 'Elite' fue severamente plateada en la primavera (grado promedio de 4.8 al final de la estaci\u00f3n) mientras Sunseeds 3 nunca mostr\u00f3 s\u00edntomas de plateado y s\u00f3lo una planta de A21-7 mostr\u00f3 plateado ligero (grado 1). 'Supersett' fue significativamente m\u00e1s plateada que las l\u00edneas de calabazas amarillas, pero las l\u00edneas sin embargo exhibieron niveles significativos de plateado (grado promedio de 3.2 comparado con 3.9 para 'Supersett' al final de la primavera). Cuatro accesiones de las dos especies salvajes, C. ecuadorensis y C. martinezii, resistieron poblaciones moderadas de moscas blancas y desarrollaron el plateado. En el caso de las l\u00edneas seleccionadas de zucchini, la severidad del plateado no estuvo relacionada con el n\u00famero de moscas blancas inmaduras. La resistencia al plateado en las l\u00edneas de zucchini podr\u00eda deberse a alguna forma de tolerancia a los efectos del da\u00f1o de las moscas blancas.\n      </p>", "Squash (Cucurbita pepo L. var. melopepo torticalis, Bailey) leaves were supplied with 14C-sucrose, then specific radioactivities of the glucose and galactose moieties of translocated stachyose were determined. In every case, the specific radioactivity of the galactose moiety was greater than that of the glucose moiety. It is concluded that the stachyose was not synthesized at either the phloem-loading site or subsequent to phloem loading, but rather in cells that were not a part of the translocation system, possibly the mesophyll cells.\n      </p>", "NADH:nitrate reductase (EC 1.6.6.1) from squash (Cucurbita maxima Duch., cv. Buttercup) can catalyze the reduction of a ferriphytosiderophore from barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Europa). Maximal activity occurs at pH 6, with an apparent Km and Vmax of 76 \u03bcM and 21 nmol\u00b7min-1\u00b7(mg protein)-1, respectively. The ferriphytosiderophore strongly inhibits nitrate reduction catalyzed by nitrate reductase at the optimal pH for nitrate reduction, i.e. 7.5. On the contrary, nitrate is a poor inhibitor of ferriphytosiderophore reduction catalyzed by nitrate reductase at the optimal pH for this reaction, pH 6.0. Thus, squash has the potential to assimilate the iron from a ferriphytosiderophore synthesized by another plant.\n      </p>", "In a study of residues from gourd and squash artifacts, we recovered starch grains from manioc (Manihot esculenta), potato (Solarium sp.), chili pepper (Capsicum spp.), arrowroot (Maranta arundinacea), and algarrobo (Prosopis sp.) from feasting contexts at the Buena Vista site, a central Peruvian preceramic site dating to \u22482200 calendar years B.C. This study has implications for the study of plant food use wherever gourds or squashes are preserved, documents the earliest evidence for the consumption of algarrobo and arrowroot in Peru, and provides insights into foods consumed at feasts.\n      </p>", "The influence of intercropping strips of non-crop vegetation on the above-ground arthropod community was assessed, including natural enemy populations and interference with pest colonization in an adjacent yellow squash crop (Cucurbita pepo L.). Four non-crop border treatments were evaluated including: sorghum \u00d7 sudangrass hybrid (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench \u00d7 S. sudanense (Piper) Stapf); pigeon pea, (Cajanus cajan (L.) (Millsp.); the native weed complex; and a bare ground control. Border treatments were established on both sides of experimental plots containing 'Early Crookneck' squash. Sticky cards, pitfall traps, pan traps, and in situ counts were used to assess differences in the arthropod community within each of the border treatments and the adjacent squash crop. Natural enemies were most abundant in the native weed complex and pigeon pea borders; however, the spill-over of natural enemies into the neighboring crop was only observed in 2008, when predatory Coleoptera were most abundant in both the sorghum-sudangrass treatment and adjacent squash. Border crops did not influence the movement of thrips and whiteflies; however, in situ aphid counts were lower on squash bordered by sorghum-sudangrass than in the control. Flea beetles (Altica spp.) were consistently most abundant in the bare ground border, but many arthropod groups were unaffected by the treatments. None of the border treatments could prevent a heavy infestation of melonworm (Diaphania hyalinata L.), which defoliated and killed many of the squash plants. Se evalu\u00f3 la influencia de mantener franjas de vegetaci\u00f3n limpias del cultivo en las orillas del cultivo sobre la comunidad de los artr\u00f3podos que viven sobre la tierra, incluyendo poblaciones de enemigos naturales y la interferencia con la colonizaci\u00f3n de la plaga con un cultivo de ayote amarillo (Cucurbita pepo L.) sembrado a la par. Cuatro tratamientos de plantas diferentes al cultivo sembrados en la orilla del campo fueron evaluados incluyendo: un h\u00edbrido de sorgo \u00d7 pasto de sudan (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench \u00d7 S. sudanense (Piper) Stapf); gandulas, (Cajanus cajan (L.) (Millsp.); el complejo de malezas nativas; y terreno sin vegetaci\u00f3n (el control). Los tratamientos de las orillas fueron establecidos en ambos lados de las parcelas experimentales de ayote de la variedad 'early crookneck'. Se usaron tarjetas pegajosas, trampas de ca\u00edda, trampas bandejas y conteos in situ para evaluar las diferencias en la comunidad de los artr\u00f3podos entre cada tratamiento de orilla y el campo cercano de ayote. Los enemigos naturales fueron mas abundantes en las orillas con el complejo de maleza nativa y gandulas; sin embargo, el derrame de los enemigos naturales en las orillas al cultivo vecino solamente fue observado en 2008, cuando los depredadores del orden Cole\u00f3ptera fueron mas abundantes en los tratamientos de sorgo-pasto de sudan y en el campo cercano de ayote. Los cultivos de la orilla no influenciaron el movimiento de los trips o de mosca blanca; sin embargo, los conteos de afidos hechos in situ fueron m\u00e1s bajos en campos de ayote con orillas de sorgo-pasto de sudan que en el control. Escarabajos pulgas (Altica spp.) fueron consistemente mas abundantes en la orillas sin vegetaci\u00f3n, pero muchos grupos de artr\u00f3podos no fueron afectados por los tratamientos. Ninguno de los tratamientos de las orillas del campo pudo prevenir la infestaci\u00f3n alta del gusano de mel\u00f3n, (Diaphania hyalinata L.), que deshoj\u00f3 y mat\u00f3 muchas de las plantas de ayote.\n      </p>", "Induction of nitrate reductase activity and mRNA by nitrate and light is prevented if chloroplasts are destroyed by photooxidation in norflurazon-treated squash (Cucurbita maxima L.) cotyledons. The enzyme activity and mRNA can be induced if norflurazon-treated squash seedlings are kept in low-intensity red light, which minimizes photodamage to the plastids. It is concluded that induction of nitrate reductase activity and nitrate reductase mRNA requires intact plastids. If squash seedlings grown in low-intensity red light are transferred to photooxidative white light, nitrate reductase activity accumulates during the first 12 hours after the shift and declines thereafter. Thus photodamage to the plastids and the disappearance of nitrate reductase activity and mRNA are events separable in time, and disappearance of the enzyme activity is a consequence of the damage to the plastids.\n      </p>", "The early development of agriculture in the New World has been assumed to involve early farming in settlements in the Andes, but the record has been sparse. Peanut (Arachis sp.), squash (Cucurbita moschata), and cotton (Gossypium barbadense) macrofossils were excavated from archaeological sites on the western slopes of the northern Peruvian Andes. Direct radiocarbon dating indicated that these plants grew between 9240 and 5500 ${}^{14}\\text{C}$ years before the present. These and other plants were recovered from multiple locations in a tropical dry forest valley, including household clusters, permanent architectural structures, garden plots, irrigation canals, hoes, and storage structures. These data provide evidence for early use of peanut and squash in the human diet and of cotton for industrial purposes and indicate that horticultural economies in parts of the Andes took root by about 10,000 years ago.\n      </p>", "This work establishes that cessation of root elongation of intact squash (Cucurbita pepo L.) plants is an early result of boron deficiency. Root elongation is slowed by 6 hours and is virtually stopped as early as 24 hours after boron is first withheld from the nutrient solution. As root elongation ceased, cell elongation progressed distally into the region normally occupied by the apical meristem and eventually the meristem became indistinguishable. Differentiation was determined by use of an elongation index in which cell length was compared to cell width. This index ranged from a low of 0.8 in boron-sufficient root meristems to a high of 3 in root meristems grown in a boron-deficient nutrient solution for 98 hours. It is concluded that a continuous supply of boron is not essential for cell elongation but is required for maintenance of meristematic activity. Boron may act as a regulator of cell division in this tissue.\n      </p>", "Peduncles of Cucurbita argyrosperma ssp. argyrosperma are present in collections of desiccated archaeological plant remains from at least seven prehistoric Ozark rockshelter sites. A radiocarbon date (Accelerator Mass Spectrometer method) on a fragment of one of these fruiting stems has a two-sigma calendric date range of A.D. 1280-1490. One C. argyrosperma ssp. argyrosperma peduncle excavated from the Cahokia site in Illinois was among contents of a sub-mound pit deposited during the 11th century A.D. Therefore, cushaw-like squashes were present in eastern North America before European contact, contrary to the long-held belief that Cucurbita pepo was the only prehistoric squash species in the region. Landraces of eastern North American cushaws were isolated from their Southwestern and Mexican argyrosperma progenitors for a longer period of time than previously believed. /// Ped\u00fanculos de frutos de Cucurbita argyrosperma ssp. argyrosperma se encuentran presentes en colecciones arqueol\u00f3gicas de residuos de plantas secas de por lo menos siete refugios rocosos prehist\u00f3ricos de Ozark. La fecha de radiocarbono (por el m\u00e9todo de Aceleraci\u00f3n con Espect\u00f3metro de Masa), aplicado a fragmentos de un ped\u00fanculo, da un rango de A.D. 1280-1490 despu\u00e9s de calibraci\u00f3n dendrocronol\u00f3gica.

We report here on archaeological investigations in a region of the Central Balsas located near the Iguala Valley in Guerrero state that show for the first time a long sequence of human occupation and plant exploitation reaching back to the early Holocene. One of the sites excavated, the Xihuatoxtla Shelter, contains well-stratified deposits and a stone tool assemblage of bifacially flaked points, simple flake tools, and numerous handstones and milling stone bases radiocarbon dated to at least 8700 calendrical years B.P. As reported in a companion paper (Piperno DR, et al., in this issue of PNAS), starch grain and phytolith residues from the ground and chipped stone tools, plus phytoliths from directly associated sediments, provide evidence for maize (Zea mays L.) and domesticated squash (Cucurbita spp.) in contexts contemporaneous with and stratigraphically below the 8700 calendrical years B.P. date. The radiocarbon determinations, stratigraphic integrity of Xihuatoxtla's deposits, and characteristics of the stone tool assemblages associated with the maize and squash remains all indicate that these plants were early Holocene domesticates. Early agriculture in this region of Mexico appears to have involved small groups of cultivators who were shifting their settlements seasonally and engaging in a variety of subsistence pursuits.\n      </p>", "Initial symptoms and increases in respiration, apparent free space, and rate of leakage of amino acids occurred concomitantly in squash (Cucurbita maxima Dene) hypocotyls infected by Hypomyces solani f. sp. cucurbitae Snyd. and Hans. Young, rapidly expanding lesions had greater respiratory rates and apparent free space than comparable tissues from healthy plants. Hypocotyl tissues above (1-45 mm) lesions possessed greater endogenous respiratory rates (2-3 times) and lower respiratory quotients than similar tissues from healthy plants. But no differences were found in membrane permeability to nonelectrolytes and water and in apparent free space between cells above lesions and healthy hypocotyls. Host cells contiguous to fungal hyphae at lesion margins were completely permeable to solutes and failed to accumulate neutral red or exhibit cyclosis.\n      </p>", "The cucurbit family includes a number of valuable crop species (melon, cucumber, squash/pumpkin, watermelon). Much of this review is concerned with transgenic resistance to viruses, shown to be the major application of biotechnology in the cucurbit family. Progress made with the production of transgenic cucurbit crops is discussed. Published data on field tests of transgenic cucurbits are reviewed, showing that much progress has been made with multiple virus-resistant cucurbit crops which can be productive without chemical control of insect virus vectors. Modes of virus resistance in transgenic cucurbits are discussed, as is the bio-safety of such crops. For the first time a detailed analysis has been made of world-wide and US field test applications for cucurbit crops. World-wide, most field test applications were for melon (54%), followed by squash (32%). World-wide most field test applications were for virus resistance (84%), and most applications (77%) were in the USA. Two transgenic multiple virus-resistant squash crops have been deregulated (released for sale). Additionally, the analysis shows that there are transgenic multiple virus-resistant crops in all major cucurbit species already available, for which several different companies have applied for field tests. This would imply that such crops are ready to be marketed should conditions permit, which would have an impact world-wide in reduction of ecological damage due to chemical control of the insect viral vectors.\n      </p>", "An electron microscope study shows that the squash mosaic virus has spherical particles with an average diameter of 30 m\u03bc.\n      </p>", "Although cessation of growth is the most apparent symptom of boron deficiency, the biochemical function of boron in growth processes is not well understood. We propose that the action of boron in root meristems is associated with ascorbate metabolism. Total inhibition of root growth in squash (Cucurbita pepo L.) plants transferred to boron-free medium coincided with a major decrease (up to 98%) in the ascorbate concentration of root apices. Under low-boron conditions, in which root growth was partially inhibited, ascorbate concentration declined in proportion to growth rate. The decline in ascorbate concentration in boron-deficient root tips was not related to ascorbate oxidation. Ascorbate added to the medium improved root growth in plants supplied with insufficient boron. Increasing concentrations of aluminum in the nutrient medium caused progressive inhibition of root growth and a parallel reduction in ascorbate concentration of root apices. Elevated boron levels improved root growth under toxic aluminum conditions and produced root apices with higher ascorbate concentrations. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a correlation between boron nutrition, ascorbate concentration in root apices, and growth. These findings show that root growth inhibition resulting from either boron deficiency or aluminum toxicity may be a consequence of disrupted ascorbate metabolism.\n      </p>", "Squash genes (SLW1 and SLW3) induced systemically after silverleaf whitefly feeding were identified. Differences in the local and systemic expression of SLW1 and SLW3 after feeding by the closely related silverleaf and sweetpotato whiteflies were observed. Temporal and spatial studies showed that SLW1 and SLW3 were induced when second, third, and fourth nymphal instars were feeding. Although only barely detected after wounding and bacterial infection, SLW1 and SLW3 RNAs were abundant during water-deficit stress. Treatments with wound/defense signal molecules showed that SLW1 RNAs accumulated in response to methyl jasmonate and ethylene, whereas SLW3 was not regulated by known wound/defense signals, suggesting utilization of a novel mechanism for defense signal transduction. SLW1 RNAs accumulated during floral and fruit development, whereas SLW3 RNAs were not detected during vegetative or reproductive development. The potential roles of SLW1, an M20b peptidase-like protein, and SLW3, a \u03b2-glucosidase-like protein, in defense and the leaf-silvering disorder are discussed.\n      </p>", "This paper treats the identification of modeled images of cucurbits-gourds and squash-in the ceramics of the Late Formative Era (or Chorrera culture) of coastal Ecuador (ca. 900 B.C. to 100 A.D.). These images provide good evidence for the sophisticated cultivation of cucurbits by the native peoples of the coast of South America from very early time periods in Ecuador. Their importance in the iconography of Late Formative cultures certainly demonstrates that the domestication of fruits with both hard and soft rinds must have been well established by the time ceramic production had begun. Depictions of combinations of animals with cucurbit-shaped bodies in the mortuary ceramics of the Late Formative period also demonstrate that cucurbits were an essential part of life (and death) on the coast of Ecuador.\n      </p>", "Observations were made and experiments conducted to ascertain if the specialized squash bee, P. pruinosa, is superior to the honey bee as a pollinator of summer squash. Three parameters contributing to pollination efficiency are: the number of visits necessary to achieve pollination, the preference of the bees for staminate or pistillate flowers, and the average time spent foraging on a flower. Results of bagging and controlled-visit experiments showed that individual visits to pistillate flowers by each species were equivalent. Honey bees displayed a significant preference for pistillate flowers; squash bees preferred male flowers. Squash bees worked the flowers more rapidly than did honey bees. When all parameters are considered, there appears to be little difference between the species as pollinators of squash. Where squash bee populations are strong, the use of honey bee colonies is superfluous. In this study most pollination was accomplished by squash bees before honey bees appeared in numbers on the planting.\n      </p>", "Sucrose-14C was fed to the leaf blades of squash plants (Cucurbita pepo L. var. melopepo torticallis Bailey) for 30 or 60 minutes. Petioles of treated plants were cut into sections and extracted. The majority of the 14C within the petiole was in sucrose rather than stachyose, the sugar that is transported by the squash plants when 14CO2 is supplied. This indicates that the phloem loading system of squash plants is not the system that specifies which sugar is transported.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

There was an inverse linear relationship between squash plant biomass and rate of halosulfuron (r2 = 0.70 to 0.92). With the exception of 'Supersett', the slopes from regression of all squash cultivars were equivalent. The estimated amount of halosulfuron required to reduce growth by 20%, based on regression, ranged from 8.2 to 45 g ai/ha (for Supersett and 'Dixie', respectively). Squash plant height was also reduced by halosulfuron, though plants began to recover from the injury by the end of the study. There was no effect of halosulfuron rate on cucumber plant biomass or height. Cucumber cultivars appeared to be more tolerant to halosulfuron than did squash cultivars.\n      </p>", "It was hypothesized that stachyose is translocated by squash because stachyose is supplied to the phloem loading system by the photosynthetic system. To test this hypothesis, 14CO2 was supplied to squash leaves. The nonphosphorylated sugars containing 14C were studied. A large proportion of 14C appeared in stachyose very early in the time sequence, tending to confirm the hypothesis.\n      </p>", "1. Glutamic acid decarboxylase is more abundant near the surface than in the central portion of the radish hypocotyl, and it accumulates in mature and senescent radish leaves. There was essentially no effect of boron nutrition on enzyme activity. 2. Squash decarboxylase was partially purified by lyophilization, freezing in solution, precipitation in cold acetone, ammonium sulfate precipitation, or by combinations of these. 3. The enzyme was irreversibly inactivated at pH values outside the range 5.7-6.2 and at temperatures above about 54\u26acC. 4. The enzyme lost coenzyme easily during processing or by dialysis but was reactivated with synthetic pyridoxal phosphate.\n      </p>", "One mature blade of each squash plant was continuously labeled with 14CO2 for 15, 30, or 70 minutes in light. The ethanol soluble materials from serial sections of petioles were extracted and separated by paper chromatography. The ratios of label in the various components of this fraction were determined. Stachyose, which contained the major portion of the label of this fraction, was hydrolyzed and the resultant hydrolysate was separated by paper chromatography. Specific activities of the hexoses derived from stachyose were determined. It was found that the glucose and fructose moieties of stachyose became labeled at the same rates; however, the galactose moiety became labeled more rapidly.\n      </p>", "The production of ethylene by mesocarp tissue of winter squash is induced by mechanical wounding. We isolated a cDNA fragment (WSACS2) from the wounded mesocarp tissue of winter-squash (Cucurbita maxima Duch.) fruit by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using primers that corresponded to two conserved amino acid sequences found in 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthases. The sequence of WSACS2 cDNA was almost identical to that of the cDNA for a wound-inducible ACC synthase (CM-ACS1) reported by N. Nakajima et al. 1990, Plant Cell Physiol 31: 1021\u20141029, with only one nucleotide difference. The expression of the WSACS2 transcript in tissue disks was examined by Northern blotting analysis. The accumulation of WSACS2 mRNA in the wounded tissue disks was inhibited by treatment with diphenyleneiodonium, which is known as an inhibitor of superoxide-generating NAD(P)H oxidases. The addition of xanthine and xanthine oxidase, which form a superoxide-generating system, strongly induced the accumulation of the WSACS2 transcript within 30 min and the level of the transcript fell thereafter. We measured levels of active oxygen species that were generated in the tissue disks by using chemiluminescence reagents and found that the chemiluminescence signal became apparent within a few seconds after wounding. The synthesis of the WSACS2 transcript was slightly inhibited by inhibitors of lipoxygenase, which is involved in the synthesis of jasmonic acid. Methyl jasmonate stimulated the synthesis of the WSACS2 transcript in the tissue disks.\n      </p>", "The records of the 118 patients treated at Southampton Eye Hospital during 1978-9 for injuries incurred while playing squash, badminton, tennis, table tennis, cricket, and football show that for squash the main cause of eye injury was the player being hit by the ball. Severe eye injuries\u2014those requiring treatment as an inpatient\u2014were rare but much more frequent than such injuries in other sports. Less serious injuries\u2014those requiring treatment as an outpatient\u2014were also rare, with a frequency comparable with that of similar injuries in football and badminton. Squash players are most unlikely to incur an eye injury, but should this occur it has far-reaching consequences both in the short and the long term. Each individual player must weigh these chances and consequences against the possible inconvenience of using some form of eye protection.\n      </p>", "The assimilation of nitrate in plants involves the reduction of nitrate to ammonia in two steps. The first step requires nitrate reductase, a nitrate-inducible enzyme. When seedlings of squash (Cucurbita maxima L.) were treated with nitrate, both nitrate reductase activity and protein were induced in the cotyledons. Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from cotyledons of nitrate-treated seedlings and was used to construct a \u03bb gt11 cDNA library. Using antibodies from mice immunized against purified nitrate reductase from squash, a recombinant \u03bb phage was isolated that encoded part of the nitrate reductase mRNA. The antigens produced by the recombinant phage were used to affinity purify anti-nitrate reductase antibody from ascites fluid of immunized mice. The purified antibody bound to nitrate reductase protein on immunoblots and immunoprecipitated the enzyme from squash protein extracts. The cDNA insert (1.2 kilobases) hybridized to a 3.2-kilobase RNA that was 120-fold more abundant in nitrateinduced cotyledons compared with the uninduced tissue.\n      </p>", "Boron is an essential micronutrient for plant growth and the boron content of plants differs greatly, but the mechanism(s) of its uptake into cells is not known. Boron is present in the soil solution as boric acid and it is in this form that it enters the roots. We determined the boron permeability coefficient of purified plasma membrane vesicles obtained from squash (Cucurbita pepo) roots and found it to be 3 \u00d7 10-7 \u00b11.4 \u00d7 10-8 cm s-1, six times higher than the permeability of microsomal vesicles. Boric acid permeation of the plasma membrane vesicles was partially inhibited (30%-39%) by mercuric chloride and phloretin, a non-specific channel blocker. The inhibition by mercuric chloride was readily reversible by 2-mercaptoethanol. The energy of activation for boron transport into the plasma membrane vesicles was 10.2 kcal mol-1. Together these data indicate that boron enters plant cells in part by passive diffusion through the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane and in part through proteinaceous channels. Expression of the major intrinsic protein (MIP) PIP1 in Xenopus laevis oocytes resulted in a 30% increase in the boron permeability of the oocytes. Other MIPs tested (PIP3, MLM1, and GlpF) did not have this effect. We postulate that certain MIPs, like those that have recently been shown to transport small neutral solutes, may also be the channels through which boron enters plant cells.\n      </p>", "Although aluminum (AL) toxicity has been widely studied in monocotyledonous crop plants, the mechanism of Al impact on economically important dicotyledonous plants is poorly understood. Here, we report the spatial pattern of Al-induced root growth inhibition, which is closely associated with inhibition of H+-ATPase activity coupled with decreased surface negativity of plasma membrane (PM) vesicles isolated from apical 5-mm root segments of squash (Cucurbita pepo L. cv Tetsukabuto) plants. High-sensitivity growth measurements indicated that the central elongation zone, located 2 to 4 mm from the tip, was preferentially inhibited where high Al accumulation was found. The highest positive shifts (depolarization) in zeta potential of the isolated PM vesicles from 0- to 5-mm regions of Al-treated roots were corresponded to pronounced inhibition of H+-ATPase activity. The depolarization of PM vesicles isolated from Al-treated roots in response to added Al in vitro was less than that of control roots, suggesting, particularly in the first 5-mm root apex, a tight Al binding to PM target sites or irreversible alteration of PM properties upon Al treatment to intact plants. In line with these data, immunolocalization of H+-ATPase revealed decreases in tissue-specific H+-ATPase in the epidermal and cortex cells (2-3 mm from tip) following Al treatments. Our report provides the first circumstantial evidence for a zone-specific depolarization of PM surface potential coupled with inhibition of H+-ATPase activity. These effects may indicate a direct Al interaction with H+-ATPase from the cytoplasmic side of the PM.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Larker) seeds during the first 2 days of germination was prevented by the presence in the culture solution of 10\u207b\u2074 M 7-oxabicyclo-(2.2.1)heptane-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (endothall), 3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzonitrile (bromoxynil), 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile (dichlobenil), or 3 amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben) and was not overcome by the simultaneous addition of gibberellic acid. The afore-mentioned herbicides did not inhibit gibberellic acid-induced amylase synthesis in de-embryonated halved barley seeds. The amiben and bromoxynil inhibition of barley germination was slightly reduced by the simultaneous addition of 10\u207b\u00b2 M glucose to the culture solution. Amiben and bromoxynil also inhibited the development of low levels amylase activity found in 2-day-old squash (Cucurbita maxima Duchesne, var. Chicago Warted Hubbard) cotyledons; however, added benzyladenine overcame the inhibition. In contrast to barley, benzyladenine was shown to induce the development of amylase activity in squash. Tolerance of squash and other seeds low in carbohydrates to amiben and bromoxynil during germination may be related to their independence from herbicide-inhibited carbohydrate degradation for energy and carbon source required for anabolic processes.\n      </p>", "Studies with caged gravid females of the pickleworm, [Diaphania nitidalis (Stoll.)], revealed that leaves of yellow squash (Curcurbita pepo L.) contain small (MW &lt;1000), non-volatile and highly polar amphoteric compounds which stimulate oviposition on artificial sites. Several compounds, extracted from paper chromatograms, caused moderate stimulation of oviposition. When these extracts were recombined, the mixture proved highly active. Addition of whole leaf volatiles to the active watersoluble fraction increased oviposition. The whole leaf volatiles mixture could be substituted with volatiles originating from leaf glandular trichomes. /// Estudios sobre el gusano de los pepinos [Diaphania nitidalis (Stoll.)] revelaron que las hojas de la calabaza (Cucurbita pepo L.) contienen peque\u00f1os (MW&lt;1000) compuestos anfot\u00e9ricos no vol\u00e1tiles y altamente polares que estimulan la ovoposici\u00f3n en sitios artificiales.

They are typically cultivated within maize fields where adjacent populations of a wild, close relative, C. argyrosperma ssp. sororia, occur. Consequently, there are ample opportunities for gene flow between domesticated and free-living Cucurbita populations. We used allozymes to examine genetic variation and gene flow among these three Cucurbita taxa in the state of Jalisco in Western Mexico. Twelve polymorphic allozyme loci were used to calculate genetic diversity for 16 populations of Cucurbita. We found high levels of genetic variation: polymorphism of 0.96, mean allelic diversity of 2.08, average expected heterozygosity 0.407, and little differentiation among conspecific populations (D = 0.081: $F_{ST} = 0.087$ : $N_cm = 5.22$ ). These findings indicate that Cucurbita possess a high pollen dispersal potential, a somewhat surprising result considering they have specialist pollinators. Unweighted pair group method with arithmetic means (UPGMA) analysis of allozymes suggests the existence of at least two distinct groups of populations, one consisting of both subspecies of C. argyrosperma and another consisting of C. moschata.\n      </p>", "A crude proteolytic enzyme preparation which hydrolyzes casein was isolated from the cotyledons of squash seedlings. The presence of ethylene diamine tetraacetate or cysteine did not appreciably affect the activity of the preparation. During the course of germination, the level of proteolytic activity increased in the cotyledons of intact embryos through the third day and then decreased. The presence of the embryonic axis during the first 32 hours of germination was a prerequisite for the development of maximum proteolytic activity. The presence of a cytokinin, such as benzyladenine, kinetin, BTP [6-(benzylamino)-9-(2-tetrahydropyranyl)-9H-purine], or phenyladenine, in the culture solution could reproduce the effect of the embryonic axis. Other growth regulators did not produce this stimulation. High concentrations (1 mM) of all growth regulators examined were inhibitory. Various combinations of growth regulators failed to produce any synergistic effects. 6-Methylpurine inhibited the development of proteinase activity, and this inhibition was only partially restored by benzyladenine. A proteinase was partially purified from the cotyledons of 2-day-old squash seedlings and its synthesis was shown to be under the control of the embryonic axis.\n      </p>", "The extended production of allelochemicals from a living mulch cover crop may potentially enhance weed management and crop productivity compared with traditional zucchini squash production systems. However, the efficacy of a living mulch cover crop in no-tillage (NT) systems with herbicides has not been determined for many vegetable crops. The objective of this research was to evaluate weed management and zucchini squash production using the combination of NT and a herbicide-suppressed winter rye cover crop with or without PRE herbicides. When used in combination with herbicides, the winter rye living mulch reduced the biomass of redroot pigweed compared to the herbicides applied alone, but did not influence the biomass of smooth crabgrass for any herbicide treatment. Visual estimates of weed control were similar for each herbicide treatment with and without the winter rye living mulch. The herbicide-suppressed winter rye resulted in excessive stunting of zucchini squash at 56 d after treatment which correlated with 20 and 50% squash yield reductions for the 2004 and 2005 growing seasons, respectively. Although some squash yield loss may have resulted from direct competition with the winter rye living mulch, yield reductions most likely resulted from allelopathy. The winter rye living mulch was the primary contributing factor for reduced squash yield and did not interact with herbicide treatment. All treatments containing herbicides resulted in yields similar to the weed-free treatment. Because of excessive zucchini injury, this research suggests that the use of herbicide-suppressed winter rye living mulch does not appear to be a feasible option for increased weed control in zucchini squash production regardless of the herbicide treatment.\n      </p>", "(1) Corn, beans, and squash were grown in pure stands and mixtures for three seasons in Costa Rica. Per plant vegetative biomass of beans and corn was not affected by treatment (i.e. pure stand or mixture) while squash plants were significantly smaller in mixtures with corn than in pure stands. (2) Bean plants initiated flowering later in mixtures with corn but total bean flower production was not significantly affected by treatment. Squash plants produced significantly fewer flowers in mixtures, while corn flowering was not affected by treatment. (3) Although intercropping significantly decreased per plant yields of corn and squash while significantly increasing it for beans, the total yield in terms of gross return ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (e.g. as Land Equivalent Ratio) was greater for all mixtures, with the exception of the corn-squash intercrop, than their respective pure stands.\n      </p>", "Light-induced modifications in lipoxidase metabolism and chlorophyll formation in the cotyledon of squash (Cucurbita moscata) seedlings were determined. The enzyme activity decreased as light intensity increased, but chlorophyll continued to accumulate long after lipoxidase activity had virtually disappeared. Considering the differences in the levels of irradiance required to manifest the optimal responses, and also from the results obtained with ultraviolet and red, far-red light treatments, any causal relationship between lipoxidase disappearance and chlorophyll synthesis was ruled out. The observed light-saturation phase in the chlorophyll synthesis, indicated that chlorophyll formation was initially controlled by the phytochrome system. No similar saturation stage for the enzyme responses was observed. The sensitivity of lipoxidase to prolonged light exposures suggested a strong correlation with the known photoreactions presumed to be controlled by the high energy reactive-phytochrome system. Lipoxidase metabolism is, therefore, suggested as a biochemical index for the photomorphogenic reactions similar to the ones induced by the high energy reaction.\n      </p>", "When 14C-sugar and THO were simultaneously introduced through a cut side vein or flap of a squash leaf (Cucurbita melopepo, Bailey cv. torticollis) concurrent translocation of 14C-sugars, T-photosynthates and THO with parallel, almost flat, gradients was observed in the petiole for periods of 1 to 3 hr. Parallel translocation gradients were not observed when 14C was introduced as 14CO2 and T by painting a leaf with THO. Autoradiography of frozen sections to locate the tissues in which THO was moving was unsuccessful. Steam-girdling blocked the movement of 14C and T when 14C-glucose and THO were introduced simultaneously by the flap-feeding technique. If THO moved as liquid water in the phloem along with the 14C-sugars, as blockage by steam girdling suggests, then solution flow of sugar cannot be excluded as a mechanism of translocation.\n      </p>", "The relation between tritium content of individual cells and grain count obtained in auto-radiographs of squashed cells was investigated. The tissues used were root meristems of Tradescantia paludosa and intestinal epithelium of the mouse. The relation between grain count and tritium content is affected by self-absorption which depends on the thickness of the labeled cell. Therefore, squashed preparations were sectioned to determine the uniformity of thickness of nuclei. In a preparation of mouse cells, thicknesses were 1.18 \u00b1 0.35 \u03bc, and in a preparation of Tradescantia cells, 2.97 \u00b1 0.35 \u03bc. The effects of similar and larger variations in thickness upon grain count were studied in material squashed with different pressures; no marked correlation was found. The lack of correlation is explained by the geometric relation between labeled nuclei and the emulsion. By counting grains and directly measuring tritium content in a glass proportional counting tube in the same preparation, the yield of grains per disintegration was measured in Tradescantia cells and found to be 1 grain for 10.9 disintegrations with AR 10 autoradiographic film and 1 grain for 19.3 disintegrations for NTB nuclear track liquid emulsion. Latent image fading may pose a problem with long exposures; the conditions of its occurrence are as yet not well known.\n      </p>", "The dipeptidase activity of the cotyledons of the squash (Cucurbita maxima Duch. 'Hubbard') increases during germination. Several herbicides inhibited this increase in various degrees. Those herbicides inhibiting the development of dipeptidase activity 70% or more were (2,4-dichlorophenoxy)-acetic acid (2,4-D), 3,6-dichloro-o-anisic acid (dicamba), (2,3,6-trichlorophenyl)acetic acid (fenac), and N-1-naphthylphthalmic acid (naptalam). Those inhibiting dipeptidase activity by 63 to 34% were 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram), 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile (dichlobenil), 3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzonitrile (bromoxynil), 3-amino-s-triazole (amitrole), 2-chloro-4-(ethylamino)-6-(isopropylamino)-s-triazine (atrazine), 7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1] heptane-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (endothall), and 5-bromo-3-sec-butyl-6-methyluracil (bromacil). Those causing only slight inhibition, 24 to 16%, were N,N-dimethyl-2,2-diphenylacetamide (diphenamid), isopropyl m-chlorocarbanilate (chlorpropham), and \u03b1,\u03b1,\u03b1-trifluoro-2,6-dinitro-N,N-dipropyl-p-toluidine (trifluralin); 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron) was essentially the same as the control.

When compared with previously reported herbicide activity on the proteinase activity, those herbicides which inhibited dipeptidase activity did not necessarily affect proteinase activity to the same degree.\n      </p>", "Field experiments were conducted in Georgia in 2004 and 2005 to evaluate the effects of S-metolachlor on summer squash fruit yield. Main treatment effects included summer squash cultivar (yellow or zucchini), planting method (seeded or transplanted) and herbicide program (nontreated control, S-metolachlor applied at planting and prior to transplanting [PRE] at 0.5 and 1.0 kg ai/ha, S-metolachlor applied postemergence [POST] 3 wk after planting [WAP] at 0.5 and 1.0 kg/ha, and S-metolachlor applied PRE at 0.5 kg/ha followed by POST at 0.5 kg/ha [PRE fb POST]). Fruit number and weight were measured 12 times during each growing season and the harvests combined into early (harvests 1 to 4), middle (harvests 5 to 8), late (harvests 9 to 12), and cumulative (harvests 1 to 12) yield categories. Mixed-models analyses were used to evaluate the effects of herbicide rate and timing, squash cultivar, and planting method on squash yield for each harvest period. Summer squash cultivar and planting method did not affect squash response to S-metolachlor. Averaged over squash cultivar and planting method, S-metolachlor applied PRE and PRE fb POST reduced fruit number and weight at the early harvest between 35 and 60%, middle harvest between 14 and 30%, and cumulative harvest between 14 and 22%. S-metolachlor applied POST at 0.5 kg/ha did not impact squash yield compared to the nontreated control at any harvest period, whereas 1.0 kg/ha reduced fruit number and weight at the middle harvest 14 and 20%, respectively. We propose that POST applications of S-metolachlor at 0.5 kg/ha or lower can be adopted for use in summer squash production in Georgia.\n      </p>", "This paper answers certain questions concerning the game of squash rackets, using stochastic analysis and linear regression to produce approximate formulae and relatively simple decision rules. Some exact mathematical analysis is performed for a special case. The model used is more complex, but more realistic, than those used by previous authors. This complexity is shown to be necessary.\n      </p>", "The effects of removal of marketable-sized fruits on investment toward male, female and vegetative activities were evaluated using two monoecious varieties of cultivated squash, Cucurbita pepo, cv. Striato d'Italia o di Napoli, and cv. Zucchini Black. Leaf and flower demography were used to examine potential trade-offs among these activities. Treated individuals produced more leaves, but individual leaf life expectancies were lower than those of controls. Fruit removal also significantly stimulated the production of male and female flowers, fruit and total above-ground biomass. By contrast, permitting the extended process of fruit maturation in controls significantly decreased the overall production of both male and female flowers. There was no significant difference in total fruit mass between treated and control individuals. However, production of female and male flowers was labile, and responsive to the resource relationships operating within the plant. Treated plants produced more female (potentially fruit-bearing) flowers as their fruits were harvested, and both groups of plants produced more male flowers at the end of the season. Overall, the squash cultivar produced almost twice as many male flowers as the zucchini cultivar; the harvesting treatment enhanced male flower production later in the season, and did so earlier in squash than in zucchini. Since reduced fruit production is achieved through reduced production of female flowers rather than through abortion of early fruits, and this precedes the period where resource limitation is anticipated, it is concluded that available resources do not directly prevent fruit development. The results are interpreted in the light of recent artificial selection for one to two large fruits per plant in the case of the squash cultivar, and many smaller fruits in the case of the zucchini.\n      </p>", "Information is presented on nest architecture, provisioning, ontogeny and certain other aspects of the natural history of the squash bee Peponapis utahensis (Cockerell) and compared with what is known about other species in the genus. /// Se presenta informaci\u00f3n sobre la arquitectura de los nidos, aprovisionamiento de la celda, ontogenia y otros aspectos de la historia natural de la abeja de la flor de calabaza Peponapis utahensis (Cockerell).

Since the availability of pyrimidine nucleotides is influenced by their rates of synthesis, salvage, and catabolism, we compared these activities in the terminal 3 centimeters of roots excised from boron-deficient and -sufficient squash plants (Cucurbita pepo L.). Transferring 5-day-old squash plants to a boron-deficient nutrient solution resulted in cessation of root elongation within 18 hours. However, withholding boron for up to 30 hours did not result in either impaired de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis or a change in the sensitivity of the de novo pathway to regulation by end product inhibition. Boron deprivation had no significant effect on pyrimidine salvage or catabolism. These results provide evidence that boron-deficient plants are not starved for uridine nucleotides collectively. Whether a particular pyrimidine nucleotide or derivative is limiting during boron deprivation remains to be examined.\n      </p>", "1. Squash and cucumber seeds were germinated in aqueous solutions of 1, 5, 10, or 15 p.p.m. of isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate (CIPC) in order to study the anatomical effects of the herbicide. 2. Squash seedlings exhibited little response at a concentration of 1, 5, or 10 p.p.m. CIPC; at 15 p.p.m. secondary roots were shorter. Cucumber seedlings, however, showed inhibition of shoot growth and of both primary and secondary root growth at all concentrations of CIPC used. The response was greater at higher concentrations and with longer treatments. 3. The root anatomy of untreated cucumber seedlings was similar in general to that of untreated squash seedlings. However, Casparian bands of the squash endodermis were broad in transection and appeared 800-2150 \u03bc from the root apex; those of cucumber were narrower and appeared 1740-5070 \u03bc from the root apex. 4. Anatomically, the squash roots showed little effect at a concentration of 1, 5, or 10 p.p.m. CIPC. Treatment with 15 p.p.m. resulted in radial elongation of the pericyclic and endodermal cells in the mature region of the root. With longer treatments, no greater response was evident. 5. The region of elongation in the cucumber root showed an effect at a concentration of 1 p.p.m. CIPC; at 5 p.p.m. the region of maturation was affected. The pericyclic and endodermal cells in treated seedlings were radially elongated, and many of the cells in the meristematic region were hypertrophied. Some enlarged cells, each having either several nucleoli or one large nucleolus in a nucleus, were observed. Abnormal wall thickenings appeared on some cells, and tissues matured nearer the root apex. Increased response occurred in the mature region with longer treatment. 6. The most important effects of CIPC are the apparent inhibition of mitosis, the enlargement of cells, and the maturation of tissues near the root apex. The broader Casparian bands, their appearance closer to the root tip, and the upward extension of the rootcap in squash (as compared with cucumber) might retard the penetration of CIPC into the root tissues.\n      </p>", "The activity of serine palmitoyltransferase (palmitoyl-coenzyme A [CoA]:L-serine [Ser]-C-palmitoyltransferase [decarboxylating], EC 2.3.1.50), the enzyme catalyzing the first step in the synthesis of the long-chain base required for sphingolipid assembly, has been characterized in a plant system. Enzyme activity in a microsomal membrane fraction from summer squash fruit (Cucurbita pepo L. cv Early Prolific Straightneck) was assayed by monitoring the incorporation of L-[3H]Ser into the chloroform-soluble product, 3-ketosphinganine. Addition of NADPH to the assay system resulted in the conversion of 3-ketosphinganine to sphinganine. The apparent Km for Ser was approximately 1.8 mM. The enzyme exhibited a strong preference for palmitoyl-CoA, with optimal activity at a substrate concentration of 200 \u03bcM. Pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate was required as a coenzyme. The pH optimum was 7.6, and the temperature optimum was 36 to 40\u00b0C. Enzyme activity was greatest in the microsomal fraction obtained by differential centrifugation and was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum using marker enzymes. Two known mechanism-based inhibitors of the mammalian enzyme, L-cycloserine and \u03b2-chloro-L-alanine, were effective inhibitors of enzyme activity in squash microsomes. Changes in enzyme activity with size (age) of squash fruit were observed. The results from this study suggest that the properties and catalytic mechanism of Ser palmitoyltransferase from squash are similar to those of the animal, fungal, and bacterial enzyme in most respects. The specific activity of the enzyme in squash microsomes ranged from 0.57 to 0.84 nmol min-1 mg-1 of protein, values 2- to 20-fold higher than those previously reported for preparations from animal tissues.\n      </p>", "Field experiments were conducted in 1999, 2000, and 2001 to investigate PRE and POST applications of halosulfuron-methyl in combination with clomazone plus ethalfluralin for control of sedge and smooth pigweed in summer squash. Halosulfuron was applied PRE or POST to summer squash at 9, 18, or 27 g ai/ha in combination with a PRE application of clomazone at 175 g ai/ha plus ethalfluralin at 630 g ai/ha. Smooth pigweed control by addition of halosulfuron at 18 and 27 g/ha in combination with clomazone plus ethalfluralin PRE was greater than 89% independent of application method. Yellow nutsedge control was greater than 83% with POST applications of halosulfuron at 18 and 27 g/ha in combination with clomazone plus ethalfluralin PRE. Yellow nutsedge control was greater than 60% from all POST halosulfuron applications at 9, 18, or 27 g/ha in the greenhouse. In a separate field study without ethalfluralin PRE, rice flatsedge control was more than 85% from halosulfuron applied POST at 18 and 27 g/ha. Yellow summer squash and zucchini squash were injured as much as 52 and 47%, respectively, from inclusion of halosulfuron PRE or POST at 27 g/ha in treatments. Summer squash yields were generally not affected by halosulfuron rate, and were comparable to or higher than summer squash treated by only the mixture of clomazone plus ethalfluralin. In these studies, summer squash were injured by halosulfuron applied at 9 to 27 g/ha PRE or POST, yet rapidly recovered, making this herbicide acceptable for use in combination with clomazone and ethalfluralin for controlling several common weed species.\n      </p>", "NADH:nitrate reductase (EC 1.6.6.1) was isolated and purified from the green cotyledons of 5-day-old squash seedlings (Cucurbita maxima L.). The 10-hour purification procedure consisted of two steps: direct application of crude enzyme to blue Sepharose and specific elution with NADH followed by direct application of this effluent to a Zn2+ column with elution by decreasing the pH of the phosphate buffer from 7.0 to 6.2. The high specific activity (100 micromoles per minute per milligram protein) and high recovery (15-25%) of electrophoretically homogeneous nitrate reductase show that the enzyme was not damaged by exposure to the bound zinc. With this procedure, homogeneous nitrate reductase can be obtained in yields of 0.5 milligram per kilogram cotyledons.\n      </p>", "Ornithine: 2-oxoacid aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.13) has been purified over 400-fold with a total recovery of 14% from acetone powders of cotyledons of germinating squash (Cucurbita pepo, L.) seedlings. The pH optimum of the transamination between L-ornithine and \u03b1-ketoglutarate is 8 and the Michaelis constants are 4.7 mM and 6.3 mM, respectively. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 48,000 as determined by gel filtration. The reaction is essentially specific for \u03b1-ketoglutarate as the amino group acceptor. The enzyme is inhibited very strongly by hydroxylamine, and less severely by NaCN and isonicotinylhydrazide. No inhibition is observed in the presence of 10 mM L-cysteine. The energy of activation is 7.6 kcal/mole. The stability of the enzyme preparation is enhanced by the presence of dithioerythritol and glycerol. The enzyme activity of the most purified fraction is stimulated 30% by the addition of pyridoxal phosphate; however, the evidence for the unequivocal involvement of pyridoxal phosphate was inconclusive.\n      </p>", "Rates of uptake of 3-o-methylglucose (MeG) by squash (Cucurbita maxima) hypocotyl sections from above lesions caused by Hypomyces solani f. sp. cucurbitae, race 1, are 2-fold greater than uptake by comparable tissues from healthy plants. Kinetic analyses indicate (i) that a single (constitutive) carrier system, with a Michaelis constant (Km) of 25 to 30 mM, mediates the transport of MeG into healthy hypocotyl cells and (ii) that an additional (inducible) system with a much lower Km (ca. 2 mM) is present in diseased hypocotyls. In both systems MeG uptake is inhibited competitively by glucose. The inducible transport system(s) in diseased tissues has a higher temperature coefficient, greater sensitivity to metabolic inhibitors and larger accumulation capacity than the one in healthy plants. While the nature of the constitutive system is ambiguous, the inducible carrier mechanism is a typical active transport system. These results indicate that increased rates of uptake and accumulation of metabolites by diseased tissues can be caused by new transport systems.\n      </p>", "The indoleacetic acid (IAA) oxidase activity of root tips of boron-sufficient, -deficient, recovering, and IAA-treated boron-sufficient squash plants (Cucurbita pepo L.) was determined. Apical and subapical root sections displayed an increase in IAA oxidase activity between 6 and 9 hours after boron was withheld, and after 24 hours the activity of the apical sections showed a 20-fold increase over +B controls. Root elongation of -B plants was inhibited before an increase in oxidase activity could be detected. Roots of plants subjected to 12 hours of -B treatment and then transferred to +B treatment for recovery regained normal elongation rates and oxidase activity within 18 to 20 hours. IAA treatment of +B plants increased IAA oxidase activity of apical and subapical root sections and also inhibited root elongation and caused symptoms similar to -B treatments. These results have demonstrated the earliest enzymic change for intact boron-deficient plants. The results are in agreement with the theory that boron deficiency symptoms may be the result of supraoptimal endogenous levels of IAA. These high levels of IAA may inhibit cell division and lead to an induction of the IAA oxidase enzyme.\n      </p>", "Lipoxidase, in the cotyledons of squash (Cucurbita moscata) seedlings grown in the dark, reached its peak activity on the fifth day and then declined to its lowest activity on the eighth day. Under continuous irradiation, the rate of enzyme disappearance was accelerated by red (655 m\u03bc) and was retarded by far-red (735 m\u03bc) radiation. Acceleration of enzyme disappearance caused by red light was reversed repeatedly by far-red light in seedlings that received an initial exposure to red radiation. These responses were independent of the duration of irradiation at each of the alternating wavebands. No change was observed when the white light was administered either 24 hours before or 24 hours after the red, far-red treatment. The lipoxidase system of the seedlings given an initial exposure to far-red radiation also responded reversibly to alternating far-red, red extended exposures, but it failed to respond reversibly when short exposures were employed. Similarly, no change occurred in these seedlings when either pre- or post-treatment with the white light was applied. These results demonstrate that the capacity of lipoxidase to act reversibly depends primarily on the duration of exposure and on the kind of light (red or far-red) to which the seedlings were exposed initially. In spite of these variations, lipoxidase metabolism can be considered an additional biochemical manifestation of red, far-red reaction that operates in the photomorphogenesis of plants.\n      </p>", "The expression of ascorbic acid oxidase was studied in zucchini squash (Cucurbita pepo L.), one of the most abundant natural sources of the enzyme. In the developing fruit, specific activity of ascorbic acid oxidase was highest between 4 and 6 days after anthesis. Protein and mRNA levels followed the same trend as enzyme activity. Highest growth rate of the fruit occurred before 6 days after anthesis. Within a given fruit, ascorbic acid oxidase activity and mRNA level were highest in the epidermis, and lowest in the central placental region. In leaf tissue, ascorbic acid oxidase activity was higher in young leaves, and very low in old leaves. Within a given leaf, enzyme activity was highest in the fast-growing region (approximately the lower third of the blade), and lowest in the slow-growing region (near leaf apex). High expression of ascorbic acid oxidase at a stage when rapid growth is occurring (in both fruits and leaves), and localization of the enzyme in the fruit epidermis, where cells are under greatest tension during rapid growth in girth, suggest that ascorbic acid oxidase might be involved in reorganization of the cell wall to allow for expansion. Based on the known chemistry of dehydroascorbic acid, the end product of the ascorbic acid oxidase-catalyzed reaction, we have proposed several hypotheses to explain how dehydroascorbic acid might cause cell wall \"loosening.\"\n      </p>", "The influence of O2 availability on the rate of protein synthesis, the levels of RNA and of adenylates, and the value of the energy charge in squash (Cucurbita maxima) cotyledons isolated from seeds germinated for 15 or 28 hours at different O2 concentration (3% or 20% O2) has been investigated. The rate of protein synthesis is five times lower in cotyledons maintained in 3% O2 than in those maintained in 20% O2. Also net RNA synthesis is almost blocked in 3% O2, while in 20% O2 it proceeds almost linearly for 48 hours. The different RNA contents cannot explain the different rates of protein synthesis. The results of shift experiments (cotyledons shifted from 20% to 3% O2 or vice versa) show that the rate of protein synthesis is strictly correlated with actual O2 availability and is largely independent of the one in the previous period. O2 controls the development of the adenylate pool and particularly the increase of ATP level. Thus, both the adenylate pool and the values of the energy charge ratio are lower in cotyledons grown in 3% than in 20% O2. The shifts of O2 availability induce rapid changes of ATP, ADP, and AMP levels and thus of the values of the energy charge, which are about 0.7 at 3% O2 and higher than 0.8 at 20% O2, independent of previous O2 availability. The rate of protein synthesis appears to be largely independent of the levels of the single nucleotides and better correlated to the energy charge values.\n      </p>", "The simple, efficient method described here for the study of ovule and megagametophyte development in angiosperms provides for the extension of investigation beyond the limits imposed by the traditional but arduous section technique. Excised pistils previously fixed in FPA50 and stored in 70 % ethanol are placed in a clearing fluid composed of lactic acid (85 %), chloral hydrate, phenol, clove oil, and xylene (2:2:2:2:1, by weight). After 24 hr, ovules dissected from the ovularies are transferred with some of the fluid to a slide, covered so that the cover glass is supported laterally by two permanently affixed covers, and examined with phase contrast optics. The unique action of the clearing fluid permits the study of cellular structure with the phase off objective focused at any focal plane within the ovule. Downward focusing thus reveals a series of optical sections in the sagittal, frontal, or transverse plane depending on the orientation of the ovule. Orientation can be altered by a slight shifting of the cover glass on the lateral support mounts. The ovules become quite fragile in the clearing fluid. Pressure applied to the cover glass gradually breaks the ovule apart without disrupting the structural integrity of individual cells. This squash procedure provides for extending observations to cytological features of megasporocytes, megaspores, and megagametophytes previously identified in intact ovules. The new method is applied here to the study of ovule development in two unrelated species, Cassia abbreviata Oliver var. granitica Bak. f. (Leguminosae) and Ludwigia uruguayensis (Camb.) Hara. (Onagraceae). For best results, the ovules of Ludwigia must be pretreated in lactic acid (85 %) for 24 hr prior to application of the clearing fluid. Other methods for pretreatment likely will be required as the technique is applied to a wider range of flowering plant species.\n      </p>", "Growth of squash (Cucurbita maxima Duch.) roots was significantly inhibited by 1 mM AlCl3 as early as 1 h after the treatment. The growth inhibition was confined to the elongating zone (1-6 mm from the root tip). Chemical analysis of cell-wall polysaccharides from roots revealed that aluminum increased pectin, hemicellulose, and cellulose contents after 3 h of treatment. The effect of aluminum on pectin content was found in the elongating zone including the root tip, whereas change in cellulose content was confined to only nonelongating zones. Hemicellulose content increased in all of the regions along the root axis. The increase in the pectin fraction was due to the increases in uronic acids, galactose, and arabinose constituents, whereas hemicellulose content changed due to increases in glucose, xylose, galactose, and arabinose. The results clearly indicate that aluminum rapidly reduced squash root growth by inhibiting cell elongation and altering metabolism of cell-wall polysaccharides in the nonelongating zone as well as in the elongating zone.\n      </p>", "The timing of the adoptions of maize and squash across eastern North America has been a topic of long-standing interest among archaeologists and paleoethnobotanists. The use of flotation for macrobotanical remains beginning in the 1960s and 1970s coupled with the application of accelerator mass spectrometry dating beginning in the 1980s has led to substantial revisions of knowledge about the history of these crops in the region. A complementary source of evidence for the crops' histories in the eastern North America comes from opal phytoliths. Analysis of phytolith assemblages recovered from charred food residues has shown that maize and squash were being used in central New York well before the macrobotanical record indicates. In combination with previously analyzed samples, 16 additional residue assemblages help to clarify the history of maize and squash in central New York.

Seedlings Grown Without an External Source of Nitrogen 1. Hubbard squash seedlings utilize their nitrogenous reserves in a somewhat different manner at opposite seasons of the year. Plants grown under the brilliant illumination of May and June and in days of normal length have short stems, large root systems, and relatively small, thick leaves. Plants similarly grown during November and December under light conditions typical in this latitude for this season of the year have much longer stems, smaller root systems, and large, thinner leaves, the third, fourth, and fifth leaves especially being much larger than the corresponding leaves of the May plants. 2. The formation of carbohydrates occurs much more rapidly in plants grown in June. Within a relatively short time cotyledons, stems, and leaves contain very large quantities of starch. Somewhat later large amounts of reducing substances accumulate. 3. The strengthening tissues are more developed in plants grown in June. 4. Processes that lead to what appear like symptoms of ageing advance much more rapidly in the June plants. The cotyledons of the June plants change relatively quickly from a green to a yellow-green color and their reserves of nitrogen are withdrawn very rapidly during this time. The cotyledons of the December plants lose their chlorophyll more slowly and there appears to be less modification of the green color previous to its disappearance. Leaves of the May seedlings also soon change from a green to a yellow-green color, the older leaves showing the change first. The green color continues to diminish until none is left. The leaves of the December plants grow for a longer time and the green color persists for a much longer time. During their later development the older leaves become somewhat greyish-green in color, and eventually the green color disappears. 5. The disappearance of green color from the leaves was accompanied by a depletion of the plasma content of the chloroplasts. Leaves of the May and June plants which had lost most of their greenness had many disintegrated chloroplasts, especially in the palisade tissue. 6. Analyses of the nitrogen content of June and December plants yielded evidence which supports the observations made by microscopic examination. Leaves of the December plants contained much more of the total nitrogen of the plants than those grown during May. The May plants contained much more nitrogen in their roots. 7. Leaves of the May plants had shiny upper surfaces, whereas those of the December plants had dull upper surfaces. Leaves of the latter plants also wilted more quickly when removed from the plants. B. Seedlings Grown With an External Source of Nitrogen 1. The effect of additional nitrogen on the growth of different organs of squash seedlings agrees with results reported earlier for many other types of seedlings, i.e., the growth of tops, particularly of the leaves, is stimulated more than growth of roots. 2. Addition of nitrogen results in increased green and dry weights of all organs but much more in the case of plants grown in June than in December. 3. It appears that shortage of carbohydrates may be a factor which limited the growth of the December plants. 4. The symptoms of early yellowing and dying of leaves of the June plants grown without additional nitrogen were not observed in the plants supplied with nitrogen. Microscopic examination of the leaves corresponding in age to those of the yellowing leaves of the un-nitrated plants showed that the cells of the palisade tissue contained rounded chloroplasts, with a relatively dense plasma content, and bright green in color. These results indicate that a supply of readily available nitrogen is necessary not only for growth of leaves in the light, but also for maintenance, especially if they are exposed to intense illumination for long periods.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The beetles include both generalist and specialist species and they damage the plants by consuming the flowers and leaves, by transmitting viral and fungal diseases, and by eating the roots of the plants. The numbers of beetles per unit plant biomass were determined at approximately six sampling times each season (for each crop type in each treatment). Whenever an intercrop contained at least one non-host plant for a given beetle species, the numbers of that beetle species per host plant in the intercrop were significantly reduced relative to the numbers in the monocrop. This pattern was generally observed for each of the species 40 and 60 days after planting and continued until the end of the season when the differences in the numbers of beetles per host plant between monocrops and intercrops were sometimes tenfold. In the cases when a given beetle species fed on both crop types in a dicrop and when there was no non-host plant present, the general intercrop effect was usually reversed: the numbers of beetles were significantly greater on one or both of the host plants in the dicrop relative to the numbers on the respective monocrops. The differences in beetle abundance appear to have been caused by differences in plant species richness of the plots per se rather than by differences in host plant or total plant density between the different treatments. Laboratory studies showed that beetles preferred to eat the more diseased squash leaves growing in the intercrops than the healthier leaves in the monocrops, so the decreased beetle abundance in intercrops does not conform with apparent differences in leaf palatability. Within squash monocrops the number of adult beetles was only weakly correlated with the size of individual plants. There were significantly more of several beetle species per unit squash biomass on smaller than larger plants so factors besides size of plant are important in determining beetle abundance within one cropping system. The effect of beetle damage could not be separated from the effects of root and shoot interactions of the crops. Yet considering the mechanisms and time at which the beetles typically cause economic damage to the crops, it is possible that decreased beetle abundance contributed to greater yields of the intercrops. The traditional practice of intercropping may therefore be a cultural method of pest control.\n      </p>", "Typical elongate, beaded chromosomes have been observed in squash preparations of testicular tissue of the butterfly Speyeria aphrodite (Fabricius), the first demonstration of relatively uncondensed chromosomes in the Lepidoptera.\n      </p>", "A study was made of some of the changes that occur in the composition of different parts of the summer squash (Cucurbita pepo) at various stages of development and at different ages, using one variety grown for one season. The moisture was highest in the petiole, lowest in the leaf blade, and intermediate in the stem, corolla, and fruit. The moisture in the leaf blade decreased considerably with age, but the changes were not very marked in the petiole and stem. In the fruit it increased to the nine-day stage and then decreased to the forty-day stage. Considered on the fresh weight basis, the alcohol soluble materials were highest in amount in the fruit and lowest in the petiole. They decreased with age in the petiole and leaf blade, but the changes in the stem were not very significant. In the fruit they were lowest in the very young and the very old material. The insoluble solids were highest in the leaf blade, lowest in the petiole, and intermediate in other parts. On the dry weight basis, they increased in all parts with age except in the stem, in which case the results were inconclusive. The total sugars were lowest in the leaf blade and highest in the fruit with intermediate values for the petiole and stem. The sugars decreased with age in all parts except the fruit, in which the sugars were lowest in the very young and the very old samples. The acid hydrolyzable polysaccharides were highest in the fruit and variable in the other parts, but generally lowest in the petiole. They decreased with age in all parts except the fruit, where they decreased to the six-day stage, then increased to the twenty-seven-day stage, when they again decreased to the forty-day stage. The differences in the fruit were not very significant and may have been due partly to climatic factors. The total titratable acidity was highest in the fruit and variable in the other parts, depending upon age and other causes. In the petiole and leaf blade the acidity decreased with age; in the fruit and the stem the results were inconclusive. The total astringency was very low, and variations may not be significant except in the leaf blade, where on the fresh weight basis it was considerably higher than in other parts. The nitrate nitrogen content was extremely variable, being much higher in certain samples of the petioles than in any other parts of the plant. Part of the variation was evidently due to changes in the amount available in the soil at different dates. In the leaf and the petiole there was a pronounced increase in the amounts present with age of the material. The vegetative parts of the summer squash were characterized by a low content of sugars, acids, tannins, and soluble organic constituents. The leaf blade was rather high in insoluble constituents, chiefly nitrogenous substances. The nitrate nitrogen accumulated in the petiole with increasing age when an ample or an excessive supply was available in the soil.\n      </p>", "1. Two ecological risks associated with the use of transgenic crops are transgene movement into wild populations and effects on non-target organisms, such as pollinators. Despite the importance of pollinators, and their contribution to the global food supply, little is known about how they are affected by transgenic crops. Pollinator preferences affect plant mating patterns; thus understanding the effects of transgenic crops on pollinators will aid in understanding transgene movement. 2. Honey bee and squash bee visit number and duration were recorded on conventional and transgenic virus-resistant squash Cucurbita pepo planted in a randomized block design. Floral characters were measured to explain differences in pollinator behaviour. The effect of Zucchini Yellow Mosaic Virus infection on pollinator behaviour was also examined. 3. Honey bees visited female conventional flowers more than female transgenic flowers. Conventional flowers were generally larger with more nectar than transgenic flowers, although floral traits did not account for differences in pollinator visitation. 4. Squash bees visited male transgenic flowers more than male conventional flowers; squash bees also spent more time in female transgenic flowers than in female conventional flowers. Transgenic flowers were significantly larger with greater amounts of sweeter nectar and they were present in greater number. Floral traits accounted for some of the variation in pollinator visitation. 5. Squash bee visit number and duration did not differ between virus-infected and healthy plants, but this may be because pollinator behaviour was observed early in the virus infection. 6. Synthesis and applications. Pollinator behaviour controls patterns of plant mating thus non-target effects of transgenic resistance, such as those observed here, may influence transgene movement into wild populations. These results suggest that transgenic crops should not be planted within the native range of wild relatives because pleiotropic effects may affect crop-wild hybridization and transgene introgression into wild populations.\n      </p>", "Few herbicides are available for weed control in vegetable production systems using low-density polyethylene (LDPE) plastic mulch. With the elimination of methyl bromide for pest management and subsequent use of various alternative fumigants, the need for herbicides in vegetable production systems has increased. An experiment was conducted to evaluate tolerance of transplant summer squash and tomato to carfentrazone, flumioxazin, glyphosate, halosulfuron, or paraquat applied to the mulch prior to transplanting. After applying herbicides overtop of the mulch but prior to vegetable transplant, the mulch was either irrigated with 1.0 cm of water or not irrigated. Carfentrazone did not affect either crop regardless of irrigation. Irrigation readily removed glyphosate and paraquat from the mulch, as there was no adverse crop injury in these treatments. In the absence of irrigation, glyphosate and paraquat reduced squash diameter and tomato heights 18 to 34% at 3 wk after transplanting (WAT). Squash and tomato fruit numbers and fruit biomass (yield) were reduced 17 to 37%, and 25 to 33%, respectively. Halosulfuron reduced squash diameter and yield 71 to 7A% and tomato heights and yields 16 to 37% when mulch was not irrigated prior to transplanting. After irrigating, halosulfuron had no affect on tomato, but reduced squash growth and yield 40 to 44%. Flumioxazin killed both crops when the mulch was not irrigated; and reduced squash yield 56% when irrigated. With irrigation, flumioxazin did not impact tomato fruit number, but did reduce tomato weight by 25%. These studies demonstrate the safety of carfentrazone, applied on mulch prior to transplanting either squash or tomato, regardless of irrigation, and also demonstrate the safety of glyphosate and paraquat if irrigated prior to transplanting. Conversely, flumioxazin should not be applied over mulch before transplanting either crop, regardless of irrigation. Halosulfuron application over mulch should be avoided before transplanting squash, regardless of irrigation, but can be applied prior to transplanting tomato if irrigated.\n      </p>", "\"font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold;\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: normal; line-height: 14px; font-size: 12px;\"><a class=\"newWindow\" href=\"http://www.press.uchicago.edu/journals/e-books/processor/an.html\" title=\"This link opens in a new window\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"border: solid thin green\" alt=\"\" src=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1334331794933/AmNat.epub.gif\" /></a></span></p>\n<a href=\"http://www.press.uchicago.edu/journals/e-books/processor/an.html\" target=\"_blank\">Free to ASN Members!</a>\n<br />\n", "\"font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold;\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: normal; line-height: 14px; font-size: 12px;\"><a class=\"newWindow\" href=\"http://www.press.uchicago.edu/journals/e-books/processor/an.html\" title=\"This link opens in a new window\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"border: solid thin green\" alt=\"\" src=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1334331794933/AmNat.epub.gif\" /></a></span></p>\n<a href=\"http://www.press.uchicago.edu/journals/e-books/processor/an.html\" target=\"_blank\">Free to ASN Members!</a>\n<br />\n", "", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
