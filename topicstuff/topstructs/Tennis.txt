Examples from a recent professional tennis tournament are given.\n      </p>", "We investigate four often-heard hypotheses relating to the service in tennis. They are as follows: in the men's singles the service dominance is greater than in the women's singles, a player is as good as his or her second service, there is a psychological advantage to serve first in a set and few breaks occur during the first few games in a match. Moreover, we show the effect of changing the rules of tennis by allowing for only one instead of two services. All items are investigated by using almost 90 000 points at Wimbledon.\n      </p>", "We analyse two often-heard hypotheses concerning tennis-balls. The first is: are new balls an advantage to the server? They are not (at least not at Wimbledon). However, they do affect the way that points are played. With new balls, more services are missed but this negative effect is compensated by winning more points if the second service is in. The second hypothesis is: did the softer balls in the 1995 Wimbledon championships result in lower dominance of service? The answer, again, is no. The dominance of service appears to have decreased over time even without special measures; the use of softer balls has had hardly any extra effect, at least not the balls used in 1995. If a faster decrease in the dominance of the service is deemed necessary, then stronger measures are called for. An obvious and easy-to-implement measure is to abolish the second service, which has the additional benefit of making matches more even and thus more attractive for spectators.\n      </p>", "Models are developed for each of the common tennis tiebreaker scoring systems based on a fixed probability for each player to win a point on his serve. The models are used to compare each scoring system. Assumptions about and predictions from the models are tested using data from actual tennis matches.\n      </p>", "A probabilistic model for table tennis is derived and probabilities of winning and expected durations are presented for a game and for a match. A simpler model, ignoring the effects of service, is compared with the complete model. /// Un mod\u00e8le probabiliste pour le tennis sur table est construit et les probabilit\u00e9s de gagner ainsi que la dur\u00e9e probable sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es pour une partie et pour le match.

We demonstrate that the outcome of tie-breaks, sets and matches can be independent of who serves first. These are corollaries of a more general invariance result that we prove for n-point win-by-2 games. Our proofs are non-algebraic and self-contained.\n      </p>", "The probability of winning a game, set, match, or single elimination tournament in tennis is computed using Monte Carlo simulations based on each player's probability of winning a point on serve, which can be held constant or varied from point to point, game to game, or match to match. The theory, described in Newton and Keller [Stud. Appl. Math., 114 (2005), pp. 241-269], is based on the assumption that points in tennis are independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. This is used as a baseline to compare with the simulations, which under similar circumstances are shown to converge quickly to the analytical curves in accordance with the weak law of large numbers. The concept of the importance of a point, game, and set to winning a match is described based on conditional probabilities and is used as a starting point to model non-i.i.d. effects, allowing each player to vary, from point to point, his or her probability of winning on serve. Several non-i.i.d. models are investigated, including the \"hot-hand-effect,\" in which we increase each player's probability of winning a point on serve on the next point after a point is won. The \"back-to-the-wall\" effect is modeled by increasing each player's probability of winning a point on serve on the next point after a point is lost. In all cases, we find that the results provided by the theoretical curves based on the i.i.d. assumption are remarkably robust and accurate, even when relatively strong non-i.i.d. effects are introduced. We end by showing examples of tournament predictions from the 2002 men's and women's U.S. Open draws based on the Monte Carlo simulations. We also describe Arrow's impossibility theorem and discuss its relevance with regard to sports ranking systems, and we argue for the development of probability-based ranking systems as a way to soften its consequences.\n      </p>", "We present a new system for rating the playing strength of table-tennis players. The system is based on Bayesian principles and is designed to handle a large changing population of players, where some players play frequently whereas other players play infrequently. The system takes into account the length of time since a player last played a tournament. When processing matches in a single tournament, the system takes into account how a player's opponents did in the same tournament. The system has been tested by processing data from 5$\\frac{1}{2}$ years of tournaments (15549 players and 330079 matches). The system could be adapted to other sports that involve head-to-head competition.\n      </p>", "A review of the etiology, occurrence and pathogenesis of \"tennis elbow\" is presented.\n      </p>", "This article tests whether points in tennis are independent and identically distributed (iid). We model the probability of winning a point on service and show that points are neither independent nor identically distributed: winning the previous point has a positive effect on winning the current point, and at \"important\" points it is more difficult for the server to win the point than at less important points. Furthermore, the weaker a player, the stronger are these effects. Deviations from iid are small, however, and hence the iid hypothesis will still provide a good approximation in many cases. The results are based on a large panel of matches played at Wimbledon 1992-1995, in total almost 90,000 points. Our panel data model takes into account the binary character of the dependent variable, uses random effects to capture the unobserved part of a player's quality, and includes dynamic explanatory variables.\n      </p>", "Professional tennis organizations, such as the United States Tennis Association (USTA), the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), the International Tennis Federation (ITF), and the Women's Tennis Association (WTA), host tennis tournaments throughout the world. At these tournaments, chief umpires assign and schedule line umpires for every match. For most tournaments, they perform this task manually, which can be cumbersome for large tournaments. For large tournaments, such as the US Open, they can use software developed to facilitate scheduling. Unfortunately, the software package currently available often creates suboptimal or infeasible schedules that must be manually adjusted. We developed a program based on optimization that automates the scheduling procedure. Our program consistently provides high-quality schedules in as little as 25 percent of the time taken with other methods.\n      </p>", "This paper presents a study of successive new product introductions in the mature tennis racket industry. The inquiry examines novel design's important role in strategic renewal, under the assumption that innovation includes not only the development, production, and launch of new products, but also communication between firms and market. We explore this industry's transformation through the strategic actions of innovative firms and subsequent competitive contagion. A tennis racket innovation triggers competitors' imitative reactions and sways the market toward a new de facto standard when the new product launch includes marketing such as product endorsement by high-profile professional players and advertising. Our results indicate that innovators should actively manage various industry participants as an integral part of their strategic renewal efforts, especially when facing rivalry with \"me-too\" peers. We suggest the interface between firms and consumers as a next focus for research on strategic renewal.\n      </p>", "Bernoulli-type models are adopted for the sequence of contested points between two players (or teams). In bipoints, there are two types of point--\"A serving\" and \"B serving\"--necessary for a realistic model of top (class) men's tennis. Unipoints is the special case of bipoints in which the probabilities that A (and hence B) wins each type of point are the same--a reasonable model for top men's squash rackets. Sports scoring systems based upon such play (\"uniformats\" and \"biformats\") may be regarded as sequential statistical tests concerning the identity of the \"better player\". Provided they satisfy certain fairness criteria, these tests are symmetric, with equal probabilities of type I and II error, and a unique efficiency \u03c1; then formally 1 - \u03c1 represents the average fraction of play being virtually wasted through the use of a suboptimal scoring system. Largely because in top men's tennis the proportions of service points won by both players are so high, the efficiency of traditional tennis scoring in such play is unduly low. Whilst the introduction of tiebreaker games has further reduced efficiency, it is shown how a simple entropy-increasing modification of the traditional scoring system serves to increase efficiency.\n      </p>", "Sport i rekreacija sastavni su dio suvremene turisti\u010dke ponude u kojoj je tenis jedna od najzastupljenijih sportsko-rekreacijskih aktivnosti.

Sport and recreation (leisure-time activities) are considered to be an integral part of the tourist offer where tennis appears to be one of the sports-recreational activities most frequently participated in. This paper analyses the interrelations between tourism and tennis, as well as the factors which affect the functioning of the supply of tennis-related activities in tourism. For the purpose of this paper 16 tennis centres that differed according to the quality of services rendered on the one hand and the realised profitability on the other were analysed. By means of monitoring and analysing their business effects the differences between the quality of the tennis centres in question were found. On the basis of these findings the criteria and the priorities were established that should be respected when devising the projects for the construction of new tennis centres in tourism. The results of this study may serve to help standardise the tennis centres, consequently enabling the supply of certain tennis centres in particular tourist destinations. Contemporary tennis centres may positively influence the promotion of the tourist offer whose effects may be followed through direct and indirect economic effects. Continuous growth of interest in tennis in tourism justifies the investments made into new tennis centres that will, taking into account their quality, satisfy the requirements of tourists. Investments into tennis halls may positively affect the prolongation of the tourist season of the Croatian tourism together with the prolonged utilisation period of tennis centres. One of the most important strategic goals of Croatian tourism is the improvement of the quality of services rendered, where tennis has an important role.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "We study strategic choice of effort in best-of-three contests between equally skilled players.

We test these predictions with data from professional tennis matches, using betting odds to identify equally skilled opponents. The empirical results support the theoretical predictions, suggesting players strategically adjust efforts during a best-of-three contest.\n      </p>", "This paper briefly reviews the present state of knowledge concerning the various factors involved in the aetiology of tennis elbow and the possible pathological lesions underlying the condition. Two series of cases are considered in greater detail. The first series, consisting of 37 cases, was treated by physical methods only, viz., manipulation, ultrasonic radiation, and short wave diathermy. The results were disappointing since little more than half the number were improved by sonation although subsequent diathermy did improve the majority of those who did not respond. But physical treatment is shown to be time consuming and variable in its results. The second series was treated by local infiltration of the painful area by hydrocortisone and, of the 38 cases, only one proved unsuccessful after one or two injections. The reduction in treatment-time and the fact that no special equipment is necessary are some of the obvious advantages in this form of treatment. The paper concludes with a discussion on the rationale of treatment and some additional aetiological factors which are in favour of an inflammatory, rather than a traumatic, basis for the condition.\n      </p>", "After a review of the diagram method for continuous-time random walks on graphs with cycles, the method is extended to discrete-time random walks.

Yet not much is known of the etiology of these diseases and, especially, of the role of mechanical factors in the etiology. The role of different causative factors is usually studied through comparison of the occurrence rates of the disease in differentially exposed working populations. However, not many such epidemiologic studies have been done. That repetitive movements in manual work may cause tenosynovitis or peritendinitis is generally accepted. Efforts to study further movements and the work positions at fault have, however, failed to show any single set of movements or hand positions. It is often postulated that movements such as repetitive dorsiflexions of the wrist and prosupinations of the forearm are causative for the tennis elbow syndrome, but there is no scientific proof for this argumentation. There are also several proposed mechanisms for the pathogenesis of the disease. In the treatment of the acute phase of these diseases in an occupational health setting, rest for the affected limb is essential. Prevention of the diseases and their recurrences probably requires changes in work conditions. Yet, at the moment, there is not much scientific basis for these measures.\n      </p>", "Paired comparison data in which the abilities or merits of the objects being compared may be changing over time can be modelled as a non-linear state space model. When the population of objects being compared is large, likelihood-based analyses can be too computationally cumbersome to carry out regularly. This presents a problem for rating populations of chess players and other large groups which often consist of tens of thousands of competitors. This problem is overcome through a computationally simple non-iterative algorithm for fitting a particular dynamic paired comparison model. The algorithm, which improves over the commonly used algorithm of Elo by incorporating the variability in parameter estimates, can be performed regularly even for large populations of competitors.

Extensive results have been obtained for both professional and amateur players, and indications are that eventually all serious tennis players may be rated by the same system.

Disagreements arise regularly, leading to disputes about decisions such as line calls. A number of factors must contribute to these disputes, including lapses in concentration, bias and gamesmanship. Fundamental uncertainty or variability in the sensory information supporting decisions must also play a role. Modern technological innovations now provide detailed and accurate physical information that can be compared against the decisions of players and officials. The present paper uses this psychophysical data to assess the significance of perceptual limitations as a contributor to real-world decisions in professional tennis. A detailed analysis is presented of a large body of data on line-call challenges in professional tennis tournaments over the last 2 years. Results reveal that the vast majority of challenges can be explained in a direct highly predictable manner by a simple model of uncertainty in perceptual information processing. Both players and line judges are remarkably accurate at judging ball bounce position, with a positional uncertainty of less than 40 mm. Line judges are more reliable than players. Judgements are more difficult for balls bouncing near base and service lines than those bouncing near side and centre lines.

Methods: Case-referent study of 267 new cases of tennis elbow and 388 referents from the background population enrolled from general practices in Ringkjoebing County, Denmark. Results: Manual job tasks were associated with tennis elbow (odds ratio (OR) 3.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9 to 5.1). The self reported physical risk factors \"posture\" and \"forceful work\" were related to tennis elbow. Among women, work involving performing repeated movements of the arms was related to tennis elbow (OR 3.7, CI 1.7 to 8.3). Among men, work with precision demanding movements was related to tennis elbow (OR 5.2, CI 1.5 to 17.9). Among both males and females, the results for work with hand held vibrating tools were inconsistent, partly because of few exposed subjects. A physical strain index was established based on posture, repetition, and force. The adjusted ORs for tennis elbow at low, medium, and high strain were 1.4 (CI 0.8 to 2.7), 2.0 (CI 1.1 to 3.7), and 4.4 (CI 2.3 to 8.7). Low social support at work, adjusted for physical strain, was a risk factor among women (OR 2.4, CI 1.3 to 4.6). Conclusion: Results indicate that being a new case of tennis elbow is associated with non-neutral postures of hands and arms, use of heavy hand held tools, and high physical strain measured as a combination of forceful work, non-neutral posture of hands and arms, and repetition. Furthermore, tennis elbow among women was associated with low social support at work.

This has now been extended to allow players to call upon technology to arbitrate when they disagree with the umpire's decision. Both tennis and cricket now allow the players to challenge a doubtful decision, which is reversed if the evidence shows it to be incorrect. However, the number of challenges is limited, and players must balance any possible immediate gain with the loss of a future right to challenge. With similar challenge rules expected to be introduced in other sports, this situation has been a motivation to consider challenges more widely. We use Dynamic Programming to investigate the optimal challenge strategy and obtain some general rules. In a traditional set of tennis, players should be more aggressive in challenging in the latter stages of the games and sets, and when their opponent is ahead. Optimal challenge strategy can increase a player's chance of winning an otherwise even five-set match to 59%.\n      </p>", "While the concept of population growth rate has been of central importance in the development of the theory of population dynamics, few empirical studies consider the intrinsic growth rate in detail, let alone how it may vary within and between populations of the same species. In an attempt to link theory with data we take two approaches. First, we address the question 'what growth rate patterns does theory predict we should see in time-series?' The models make a number of predictions, which in general are supported by a comparative study between time-series of harvesting data from 352 red grouse populations. Variations in growth rate between grouse populations were associated with factors that reflected the quality and availability of the main food plant of the grouse. However, while these results support predictions from theory, they provide no clear insight into the mechanisms influencing reductions in population growth rate and regulation. In the second part of the paper, we consider the results of experiments, first at the individual level and then at the population level, to identify the important mechanisms influencing changes in individual productivity and population growth rate. The parasitic nematode Trichostrongylus tenuis is found to have an important influence on productivity, and when incorporated into models with their patterns of distribution between individuals has a destabilizing effect and generates negative growth rates. The hypothesis that negative growth rates at the population level were caused by parasites was demonstrated by a replicated population level experiment. With a sound and tested model framework we then explore the interaction with other natural enemies and show that in general they tend to stabilize variations in growth rate. Interestingly, the models show selective predators that remove heavily infected individuals can release the grouse from parasite-induced regulation and allow equilibrium populations to rise. By contrast, a tick-borne virus that killed chicks simply leads to a reduction in the equilibrium. When humans take grouse they do not appear to stabilize populations and this may be because many of the infective stages are available for infection before harvesting commences. In our opinion, an understanding of growth rates and population dynamics is best achieved through a mechanistic approach that includes a sound experimental approach with the development of models. Models can be tested further to explore how the community of predators and others interact with their prey.\n      </p>", "Le tennis est un sport tr\u00e8s pratiqu\u00e9 par les aristocrates vers la fin du XIXe si\u00e8cle et il fait, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 cela, partie du programme olympique d\u00e8s les premiers Jeux en 1896. Pourtant, \u00e0 cause d'un conflit complexe et important entre le Comit\u00e9 international olympique et la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration internationale de tennis, ce sport est exclu de la comp\u00e9tition olympique en 1927 et ne r\u00e9appara\u00eetra que tardivement, aux Jeux de S\u00e9oul, en 1988. Cet article pr\u00e9sente les raisons de ce conflit, ainsi que ses principaux acteurs, Henri de Baillet-Latour, pr\u00e9sident du CIO, et Albert Canet, pr\u00e9sident de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration internationale, dans le contexte particulier des ann\u00e9es 1920. Si la question de l'amateurisme semble \u00eatre au c\u0153ur de cette affaire, on d\u00e9couvre, \u00e0 travers la correspondance, d'autres enjeux inavou\u00e9s: commerciaux et \u00e9conomiques, mais aussi symboliques et sociaux. Pour ces raisons, le conflit entre les deux institutions est repr\u00e9sentatif des probl\u00e9matiques qui ont anim\u00e9 le milieu sportif mondial de l'entre-deux-guerres. /// Thanks to the popularity of tennis in the end of the nineteenth century, the sport was immediately part of the first Olympic games in 1896. Nevertheless, tennis was dropped from the Olympic competition in 1927 because of a complex and important conflict between the International Olympic committee and the International federation of tennis. It only reappeared as a medal sport in Olympics at Seoul, in 1988. This article provides explanations of this conflict in the particular context of the twenties and to present its main actors: Henri de Baillet-Latour, president of the IOC, and Albert Canet, president of the International federation. Whereas the issue of amateurism seems to be first, others unconfessed stakes - commercial and economic, symbolic and social - emerge through the analysis of the correspondence. Finally, this conflict between the both institutions symbolized the main interests of the world sport movement during the interwar period.\n      </p>", "Objective To investigate the efficacy of physiotherapy compared with a wait and see approach or corticosteroid injections over 52 weeks in tennis elbow. Design Single blind randomised controlled trial. Setting Community setting, Brisbane, Australia. Participants 198 participants aged 18 to 65 years with a clinical diagnosis of tennis elbow of a minimum six weeks' duration, who had not received any other active treatment by a health practitioner in the previous six months. Interventions Eight sessions of physiotherapy; corticosteroid injections; or wait and see. Main outcome measures Global improvement, grip force, and assessor's rating of severity measured at baseline, six weeks, and 52 weeks. Results Corticosteroid injection showed significantly better effects at six weeks but with high recurrence rates thereafter (47/65 of successes subsequently regressed) and significantly poorer outcomes in the long term compared with physiotherapy. Physiotherapy was superior to wait and see in the short term; no difference was seen at 52 weeks, when most participants in both groups reported a successful outcome. Participants who had physiotherapy sought less additional treatment, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, than did participants who had wait and see or injections. Conclusion Physiotherapy combining elbow manipulation and exercise has a superior benefit to wait and see in the first six weeks and to corticosteroid injections after six weeks, providing a reasonable alternative to injections in the mid to long term. The significant short term benefits of corticosteroid injection are paradoxically reversed after six weeks, with high recurrence rates, implying that this treatment should be used with caution in the management of tennis elbow.\n      </p>", "We study professional tennis players' decisions of whether to challenge umpires' calls using data on over 2,000 challenges in 35 tennis tournaments. The decision to challenge, which is simple to characterize, trades off reversing the umpire's call against losing subsequent challenge opportunities. Qualitatively, players are more likely to challenge when the stakes are greater and when the option value of challenging is lower, as theory predicts. Quantitatively, players' actual behavior is close to an optimal challenging strategy prescribed by a simple dynamic model. Our findings illustrate that professional decision makers develop decision rules that can approximate optimal behavior quite well.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Statistical methods can be useful in rating non-elite tennis players. This paper shows how clubs can use simple optimization techniques to rate their club's players in doubles tennis competitions. Even though clubs lack all relevant information, the effects of home advantage, position played, partner and strength of team opposition can be taken into account and evaluated. The results from all competing clubs, available to the body organizing the competition, are used to rate all players in the competition, and validate the results that were obtained with limited information. We show a home ground advantage exists in non-elite doubles tennis. A simple exponential smoothing method of rating players is then tested, and shown to produce reasonable results.\n      </p>"], "words": {"rating": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05},
