{"total_words": 1375, "documents": ["The study determined how students assess the various components of their science laboratory environment. It also identified how the laboratory environment affects students' learning outcomes. The modified ex-post facto design was used. A sample of 328 randomly selected students was taken from a population of all Senior Secondary School chemistry students in a state in Nigeria. The research instrument, Science Laboratory Environment Inventory (SLEI) designed and validated by Fraser et al. (Sci Educ 77:1-24, 1993) was administered on the selected students. Data analysis was done using descriptive statistics and Product Moment Correlation. Findings revealed that students could assess the five components (Student cohesiveness, Open-endedness, Integration, Rule clarity, and Material Environment) of the laboratory environment. Student cohesiveness has the highest assessment while material environment has the least. The results also showed that the five components of the science laboratory environment are positively correlated with students' academic performance. The findings are discussed with a view to improving the quality of the laboratory environment, subsequent academic performance in science and ultimately the enrolment and retaining of learners in science.\n      </p>", "The issue of environmentally significant consumption is closely linked to population-environment relationships, but with some exceptions the two literatures have proceeded along separate tracks. We explore three consumption-environment research agendas: household-level consumption; ecological footprints and material flow accounting; and values, attitudes, behaviors and lifestyles. In each of these we note areas of overlap with the population-environment literature, and ways in which the population-environment literature might benefit or borrow from conceptual or methodological approaches in the consumption-environment literature. We also propose ways in which consumption research might be integrated into the largest (in terms of funding) of the population-environment research agendas, land-use and land-cover change research. In the concluding section we present a conceptual framework for understanding the population-environment literature that incorporates production and consumption into the model, and we propose some population-consumption-environment (PCE) research areas to which the population-environment research community could make significant contributions.\n      </p>", "Objectives: We introduce and describe the Breast Cancer and the Environment Research Centers (BCERC), a research network with a transdisciplinary approach to elucidating the role of environmental factors in pubertal development as a window on breast cancer etiology. We describe the organization of four national centers integrated into the BCERC network. Data Sources: Investigators use a common conceptual framework based on multiple levels of biologic, behavioral, and social organization across the life span. The approach connects basic biologic studies with rodent models and tissue culture systems, a coordinated multicenter epidemiologic cohort study of prepubertal girls, and the integration of community members of breast cancer advocates as key members of the research team to comprise the network. Data Extraction: Relevant literature is reviewed that describes current knowledge across levels of organization. Individual research questions and hypotheses in BCERC are driven by gaps in our knowledge that are presented at genetic, metabolic, cellular, individual, and environmental (physical and social) levels. Data Synthesis: As data collection on the cohort, animal experiments, and analyses proceed, results will be synthesized through a transdisciplinary approach. Conclusion: Center investigators are addressing a large number of specific research questions related to early pubertal onset, which is an established risk factor for breast cancer. BCERC research findings aimed at the primary prevention of breast cancer will be disseminated to the scientific community and to the public by breast cancer advocates, who have been integral members of the research process from its inception.\n      </p>", "This paper discusses the problems of environment and development in Sikkim Himalaya. Two features of Sikkim, the fragile mountain environment and the very rapidly growing population, are crucial in formulating future development plans. An integrated approach to development and environmental conservation is suggested.\n      </p>", "The coevolution of environment and living organisms is well known in nature. Here, it is suggested that similar processes can take place before the onset of life, where protocellular entities, rather than full-fledged living systems, coevolve along with their surroundings. Specifically, it is suggested that the chemical composition of the environment may have governed the chemical repertoire generated within molecular assemblies, compositional protocells, while compounds generated within these protocells altered the chemical composition of the environment. We present an extension of the graded autocatalysis replication domain (GARD) model-the environment exchange polymer GARD (EE-GARD) model. In the new model, molecules, which are formed in a protocellular assembly, may be exported to the environment that surrounds the protocell. Computer simulations of the model using an infinite-sized environment showed that EE-GARD assemblies may assume several distinct quasi-stationary compositions (composomes), similar to the observations in previous variants of the GARD model. A statistical analysis suggested that the repertoire of composomes manifested by the assemblies is independent of time. In simulations with a finite environment, this was not the case. Composomes, which were frequent in the early stages of the simulation disappeared, while others emerged. The change in the frequencies of composomes was found to be correlated with changes induced on the environment by the assembly. The EE-GARD model is the first GARD model to portray a possible time evolution of the composomes repertoire.\n      </p>", "Most psychology begins with a distinction between organism and environment, where the two are implicitly (and sometimes explicitly) conceptualized as flipsides of a skin-severed space. This paper examines that conceptualization. Dewey and Bentley's (1949) account of firm naming is used to show that psychologists have, in general, (1) employed the skin as a morphological criterion for distinguishing organisms from backgrounds, and (2) equated background with environment. This two-step procedure, which in this article is named the morphological conception of organism, is shown to inform the writings of the well-known psychologist B. F. Skinner. A review of difficulties with the morphological conception is followed with a review and preliminary integration of four attempts at an alternative conception of organism, and thus environment. Together, these four attempts converge on an analysis of living systems as transdermal (through and across skin) processes only within which organism and environment are distinguishable as complementary phases. The notion of a biological total process, or bioprocess, is employed to clarify this alternative analysis, in which an organism is an ongoing organization rather than a skin-bound body.\n      </p>", "R\u00e5de considered a parallel system with n components in a random environment. The shocks cause the components to fail with certain probabilities. This paper considers the replacement policy for the above system in which it is exchanged before failure if the total number of failed components is more than k, and it is replaced if all of n components have failed. An optimum number of k which will minimize the expected cost is obtained. A numerical example is finally presented.\n      </p>", "Background: Urbanization has been correlated with hypertension (HTN) in developing countries undergoing rapid economic and environmental transitions. Objectives: We examined the relationships among living environment (urban, suburban, and rural), day/night land surface temperatures (LST), and blood pressure in selected regions from the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort. Also, the linking of data on blood pressure from REGARDS with National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) science data is relevant to NASA's strategic goals and missions, particularly as a primary focus of the agency's Applied Sciences Program. Methods: REGARDS is a national cohort of 30,228 people from the 48 contiguous United States with self-reported and measured blood pressure levels. Four metropolitan regions (Philadelphia, PA; Atlanta, GA; Minneapolis, MN; and Chicago, IL) with varying geographic and health characteristics were selected for study. Satellite remotely sensed data were used to characterize the LST and land cover/land use (LCLU) environment for each area. We developed a method for characterizing participants as living in urban, suburban, or rural living environments, using the LCLU data. These data were compiled on a 1-km grid for each region and linked with the REGARDS data via an algorithm using geocoding information. Results: REGARDS participants in urban areas have higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure than do those in suburban or rural areas, and also a higher incidence of HTN. In univariate models, living environment is associated with HTN, but after adjustment for known HTN risk factors, the relationship was no longer present. Conclusion: Further study regarding the relationship between HTN and living environment should focus on additional environmental characteristics, such as air pollution. The living environment classification method using remotely sensed data has the potential to facilitate additional research linking environmental variables to public health concerns.\n      </p>", "The ability of populations to undergo adaptive evolution depends on the presence of genetic variation for ecologically important traits. The maintenance of genetic variation may be influenced by many variables, particularly long-term effective population size and the strength and form of selection. The roles of these factors are controversial and there is very little information on their impacts for quantitative characters. The aims of this study were to determine the impacts of population size and variable versus constant prior environmental conditions on fitness and the magnitude of response to selection. Outbred and inbred populations of Drosophila melanogaster were maintained under benign, constant stressful, and variably stressful conditions for seven generations, and then forced to adapt to a novel stress for seven generations. Fitness and adaptability were assayed in each replicate population. Our findings are that: (1) populations inbred in a variable environment were more adaptable than those inbred in a constant environment; (2) populations adapted to a prior stressful environment had greater fitness when reared in a novel stress than those less adapted to stress; (3) inbred populations had lower fitness and were less adaptable than the outbred population they were derived from; and (4) strong lineage effects were detectable across environments in the inbred populations.\n      </p>", "Although previous research has noted that children of divorce tend to fare less well than peers raised in families with two biological parents, much less is known about how parents' marital disruption affects children as a continuous process in its different phases. Based on two waves of a large, nationally representative panel, this study demonstrates that even before the disruption, both male and female adolescents from families that subsequently dissolve exhibit more academic, psychological, and behavioral problems than peers whose parents remain married. Families on the verge of breakup are also characterized by less intimate parent-parent and parent-child relationships, less parental commitment to children's education, and fewer economic and human resources. These differences in family environment account for most well-being deficits among adolescents in predisrupted families. Furthermore, the deterioration in different domains of the family environment appears to be associated with maladjustment in different aspects of children's lives. The postdisruption effects on adolescents can either be totally or largely predicted by predisruption factors and by changes in family circumstances during the period coinciding with the disruption. Finally, the analyses indicate that female adolescents are as likely to be affected by the parental divorce process as male adolescents.\n      </p>", "This article describes experiences of 610 Dutch students and 241 students from other European countries who studied at least three months abroad within the framework of an international exchange program. The Dutch students went to a university in another European country and the foreign students went to a Dutch university. By means of a questionnaire students' perceptions of three main characteristics of the university learning environment were measured concerning the home university, the host university and the ideal learning environment. The students were also asked about their way of learning at the home university and at the host university, in particular about the extent of constructive learning and reproductive learning. Evidence was found for the influence of aspects of the learning environment on the two learning approaches; e.g., a learning environment characterized as student-oriented discourages reproductive learning and promotes constructive learning, especially when conceptual and epistemological relations within the learning domain are stressed. The learning environment preferences of the students were partly related to their learning orientations at the home university, but they were strikingly similar for students from different countries. There was a strong preference for those learning environment aspects that promote constructive learning.\n      </p>", "Results from a programme level survey at a university in Hong Kong were used to select six departments which had good records in developing graduate capabilities. Focus group interviews were conducted with students in the departments to discover which capabilities students thought were important, how the capabilities were nurtured and the influence of the teaching and learning environment on their development. Analysis of the data showed that the findings were consistent with a previous quantitative model. Capabilities were developed if the curriculum made demands on students to practise the use of the capability. Intellectual capabilities were nurtured through active learning experiences, performed in class or for assessment, which required the practise of the capability. Communication and teamwork skills developed through group projects and activities in which communication was practised.\n      </p>", "The magnitude of inbreeding depression in small populations may depend on the effectiveness with which natural selection purges deleterious recessive alleles from populations during inbreeding. The effectiveness of this purging process, however, may be influenced by the rate of inbreeding and the environment in which inbreeding occurs. Although some experimental studies have examined these factors individually, no study has examined their joint effect or potential interaction. In the present study, therefore, we performed an experiment in which 180 lineages of Drosophila melanogaster were inbred at slow and fast inbreeding rates within each of three inbreeding environments (benign, high temperature, and competitive). The fitness of all lineages was then measured in a common benign environment. Although slow inbreeding reduced inbreeding depression in lineages inbred under high temperature stress, a similar reduction was not observed with respect to the benign or competitive treatments. Overall, therefore, the effect of inbreeding rate was nonsignificant. The inbreeding environment, in contrast, had a larger and more consistent effect on inbreeding depression. Under both slow and fast rates of inbreeding, inbreeding depression was significantly reduced in lineages inbred in the presence of a competitor D. melanogaster strain. A similar reduction of inbreeding depression occurred in lineages inbred under high temperature stress at a slow inbreeding rate. Overall, our findings show that inbreeding depression is reduced when inbreeding takes place in a stressful environment, possibly due to more effective purging under such conditions.\n      </p>", "The recommendation of new plant varieties for commercial use requires reliable and accurate predictions of the average yield of each variety across a range of target environments and knowledge of important interactions with the environment. This information is obtained from series of plant variety trials, also known as multi-environment trials (MET). Cullis, Gogel, Verbyla, and Thompson (1998) presented a spatial mixed model approach for the analysis of MET data. In this paper we extend the analysis to include multiplicative models for the variety effects in each environment. The multiplicative model corresponds to that used in the multivariate technique of factor analysis. It allows a separate genetic variance for each environment and provides a parsimonious and interpretable model for the genetic covariances between environments. The model can be regarded as a random effects analogue of AMMI (additive main effects and multiplicative interactions). We illustrate the method using a large set of MET data from a South Australian barley breeding program.\n      </p>", "The question of the \"insertion\" in space of public housing into the surrounding urban environment is not new. It has often been examined from the perspective of the social environment, but more rarely from that of the physical environment and the accessibility of public and private services and facilities. To qualify the immediate urban environment around Montr\u00e9al's public housing buildings in its complexity, we are proposing a methodological approach based on the use of several spatial databases in GIS: (1) the Montr\u00e9al public housing database, (2) individual census data for the Montr\u00e9al CMA, (3) a satellite image, (4) a land use map, and (5) location data on a series of public and private services and facilities. Use of these spatial data enables us to identify various combinations of advantages and disadvantages within the urban living environment in which Montr\u00e9al's public housing buildings have been located, according to three dimensions: the social environment, the physical environment, and the accessibility of services and facilities. Our final results show that only a small proportion of public housing tenants (7%) live in residual spaces, that is, in quite unattractive areas of the city which combine a number of urban disadvantages: a degraded physical environment, a high level of social deprivation, and few or no services and facilities.\n      </p>", "We have recently discussed the replacement problem of a parallel system in a random environment. This paper extends the same replacement problem for the following two cases which are more plausible: (i) The probability that an operating component fails by the jth shock depends on the number j. (ii) The replacement cost is a linear function of failed components. The expected cost of the above model is obtained. A numerical example is finally presented when the probability of failure time of a component is a negative binomial distribution.\n      </p>", "Background: Research on neighborhood effects increasingly includes the influences of the built environment on health and social well-being. Objectives: In this population-based study in a low-socioeconomic-status (SES), Hispanic neighborhood, we examined whether architectural features of the built environment theorized to promote direct observations and interactions (e.g., porches, stoops) predicted Hispanic elders' social support and psychological and physical functioning. Methods: We coded built-environment features for all 3,857 lots in the 403-block area of an urban Miami, Florida, community. We then conducted three annual assessments of social support, psychological distress, and physical functioning in a population-based sample of 273 low-SES Hispanic elders (70-100 years of age). We used structural equation modeling analytic techniques to examine hypothesized relationships between the built environment and elders' social support, psychological distress, and physical functioning over a 3-year period. Results: After controlling for age, sex, and income, architectural features of the built environment theorized to facilitate visual and social contact had a significant direct relationship with elders' physical functioning as measured 3 years later, and an indirect relationship through social support and psychological distress. Further binomial regression analyses suggested that elders living on blocks marked by low levels of positive front entrance features were 2.7 times as likely to have subsequent poor levels of physical functioning, compared with elders living on blocks with a greater number of positive front entrance features [b = 0.99; $\\chi ^{2}$ (1 df) = 3.71; p = 0.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-7.3]. Conclusions: Architectural features that facilitate visual and social contacts may be a protective factor for elders' physical functioning.\n      </p>", "This article furthers the argument for a stakeholder theory that integrates into managerial decision-making the relationship between business organizations and the natural environment. The authors review the literature on stakeholder theory and the debate over whom or what should count as a stakeholder. The authors also critique and expand the stakeholder identification and salience model developed by Mitchell and Wood (1997) by reconceptualizing the stakeholder attributes of power, legitimacy, and urgency, as well as by developing a fourth stakeholder attribute: proximity. In this way, the authors provide a stronger basis for arguing for the salience of the natural environment as the primary and primordial stakeholder of the firm.\n      </p>", "Background: Qualitative studies of the nursing home work environment have long suggested that attributes such as leadership and communication may be related to nursing home performance, including residents' outcomes. However, empirical studies examining these relationships have been scant. Objectives: This study is designed to develop an instrument for measuring nursing home work environment and perceived work effectiveness; test the reliability and validity of the instrument; and identify individual and facility-level factors associated with better facility performance. Research Design and Methods: The analysis was based on survey responses provided by managers (N = 308) and direct care workers (N = 7418) employed in 162 facilities throughout New York State. Exploratory factor analysis, Cronbach's alphas, analysis of variance, and regression models were used to assess instrument reliability and validity. Multivariate regression models, with fixed facility effects, were used to examine factors associated with work effectiveness. Results: The reliability and the validity of the survey instrument for measuring work environment and perceived work effectiveness have been demonstrated. Several individual (eg, occupation, race) and facility characteristics (eg, management style, workplace conditions, staffing) that are significant predictors of perceived work effectiveness were identified. Conclusions: The organizational performance model used in this study recognizes the multidimensionality of the work environment in nursing homes. Our findings suggest that efforts at improving work effectiveness must also be multifaceted. Empirical findings from such a line of research may provide insights for improving the quality of the work environment and ultimately the quality of residents' care.\n      </p>", "International differences in how market exchanges are conducted (e.g., the mode of entry, level of ownership, and conflict resolution) have been attributed mainly to national culture and cultural distance. However, the cultural arguments cannot explain why economies/countries with similar cultural backgrounds (e.g., Hong Kong and China) exhibit differences in exchange arrangements. Thus, the cultural arguments provide little strategic guidance to multinational corporations (MNCs) in international marketing. We propose that in addition to culture, the governance environment in a country, namely, the political, economic, and social institutions that facilitate or constrain the choice of governance mechanisms, influences the way organizations conduct market exchanges. This important factor heretofore has been ignored. Specifically, we introduce a typology of rule-based and relation-based governance environment to explain how the environment affects marketing channel behaviors, such as barriers to entry, channel exclusivity, information access, trust, and dispute resolution. We analyze the diamond industry in the rule-based governance environment in the U.S. and in the relation-based governance environment in China, and using the diamond industry in Hong Kong as a validation, to develop theoretical propositions and strategic implications for MNCs.\n      </p>", "It is widely recognized that communications that activate social norms can be effective in producing societally beneficial conduct. Not so well recognized are the circumstances under which normative information can backfire to produce the opposite of what a communicator intends. There is an understandable, but misguided, tendency to try to mobilize action against a problem by depicting it as regrettably frequent. Information campaigns emphasize that alcohol and drug use is intolerably high, that adolescent suicide rates are alarming, and--most relevant to this article--that rampant polluters are spoiling the environment. Although these claims may be both true and well intentioned, the campaigns' creators have missed something critically important: Within the statement \"Many people are doing this undesirable thing\" lurks the powerful and undercutting normative message \"Many people are doing this.\" Only by aligning descriptive norms (what people typically do) with injunctive norms (what people typically approve or disapprove) can one optimize the power of normative appeals. Communicators who fail to recognize the distinction between these two types of norms imperil their persuasive efforts.\n      </p>", "A growing number of managers believe that addressing environmental impacts in product-design decisions has tangible advantages to firms. Yet many firms struggle to diffuse design-for-environment (DfE) practices across their product-development teams. Four leading electronics firms' attempts to adopt DfE suggest that the establishment of highly interconnected, internal information networks may be a robust diffusion strategy. Technically competent centers acting as clearinghouses of companywide information relevant to environmental design and coordinated with specialists on individual product-design teams seem to be an effective organizational structure for diffusing DfE. Internal information networks reduce the cost to designers of assessing environmental costs and benefits and thus lower the motivational barriers of product managers. Environmental design tools may be a component of successful DfE practice but do not seem to be sufficient in themselves. The complexity of environmental issues requires an approach that continually generates new information. Dense information networks allow pockets of expertise to form in response to ever-changing needs.\n      </p>", "Vertebrates have regular patterns and routines that involve obtaining food and carrying out life-history stages such as breeding, migrating, molting, and hibernating. These are generally regulated by predictable changes in the environment, for example, seasons. Superimposed on these are unpredictable challenges, for example, storms and natural disasters, which have great potential for stress. The concept of allostasis, maintaining stability through change, has been introduced as a fundamental process through which organisms actively adjust to both predictable and unpredictable events. This process considers the predictable and unpredictable components of the environment as a continuum and includes the effects of body condition (parasites and injuries), experience, and habitat configuration. It combines classical homeostasis with anticipatory responses, stress, and social status. By using the balance between energy input and expenditure as the basis for applying the concept of allostasis, 2 types of allostatic overload have been proposed. Type 1 allostatic overload occurs when energy demand exceeds supply, resulting in activation of the emergency life-history stage. This serves to direct the animal away from normal life-history stages into a survival mode that decreases allostatic load and regains positive energy balance. The normal life cycle can be resumed when the perturbation passes. Type 2 allostatic overload begins when there is sufficient or even excess energy consumption accompanied by social conflict and other types of social dysfunction. The latter is the case in human society, and in some situations affecting animals in captivity and possibly in natural conditions as well. In all cases, secretion of glucocorticoids increases with allostatic load, but if it is chronically high, then pathologies develop. Curiously, type 2 allostatic overload does not trigger an escape response, and can only be counteracted through learning or changes in social structure.\n      </p>", "Superprocesses are idealized models for the evolution of a population with geographical structure/motion and (unisex) reproductive behaviour. In this paper, the reproductive behaviour, in particular the offspring distribution, is related to an exterior process (the environment). We characterize these superprocesses as the unique solution of certain evolution equations. We also prove that they can be obtained as limits of systems of branching particles with minimal variance branchings and faster (non-classical) branching rates.\n      </p>", "A conditioning and martingale method is used to relate the asymptotics of uniformly integrable general branching processes in varying environment to the behaviour of their expectations.\n      </p>", "We show that random walk in uniformly elliptic i.i.d. environment in dimension \u2265 5 has at most one non zero limiting velocity.

The shocks cause the components to fail with certain probabilities. First we study the case when the components fail independently of each other with the same probability. For this case simple closed expressions for the Laplace-Stieltjes transform and expectation of time to system failure are derived. Then a case of dependent components is studied: the probability of failure of a component depends on the number of functioning components. Some extensions are mentioned.\n      </p>", "The \"immigrant health paradox\" has captured the attention of researchers struggling to understand why immigrants to the United States appear to have health advantages that would not be predicted by their socioeconomic position. This research extends prior analyses through examination of the potential role of environmental factors in explaining the immigrant health paradox. We use data from the Phoenix Area Social Survey, a survey conducted in 2006 of approximately 800 individuals. Multilevel ordered logistic models examine three health outcomes: self-rated health, heat stress, and asthmatic symptoms. An innovation is our multiple considerations of contextual factors, including neighborhood amenities, disorder, traffic counts, and the heat index. We have three key findings: (1) frequent local migration has negative impacts on health, (2) the local neighborhood environment partially mediates differences between US-born non-Hispanic Whites and foreignborn Hispanics, and (3) subjective measures of the local environment tend to have greater effects than objective measures. In sum, our analyses suggested a need for studies of place and health to consider migration and residential history as a factor shaping health outcomes. Further, regarding the immigrant paradox, the results suggest the need to move beyond a dichotomous measure of immigration contrasting international migrants with native-born residents.\n      </p>", "Objectives. The author reports on the development and the psychometric properties of the Ethics Environment Questionnaire (EEQ), an instrument by which to measure the opinions of health-care providers about ethics in their clinical practice organizations. The EEQ was developed to increase the number of valid and reliable measures pertaining to ethics in health-care delivery. Methods. The EEQ is a 20-item self-administered questionnaire using a Likert-type 5-point format, offering ease of administration. It is applicable to a cross-section of health-care practitioners and health-care facilities. The mean administration time is 10 minutes. The EEQ represents testing on 450 respondents in acute care settings among a cross-section of acute care facilities. Results. Internal consistency reliability using Cronbach's alpha coefficient is 0.93, and the test-retest reliability is 0.88. Construct, content, and criterion validity are established. The scale is unidimensional, with factor loadings exceeding the minimum preset criterion. Mean score is 3.1 out of 5.0, with scores of 3.5 and above interpreted as reflective of a positive ethics environment. Conclusions. The EEQ provides a measure of ethics in health-care organizations among multi-practitioners in clinical practice on a valid, reliable, cost effective, and easily administered instrument that requires minimum investment of personnel time.\n      </p>", "St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.) is a medicinal plant used in the treatment of neurological disorders and has been recently shown to have anticancer potential. The principle medicinal components of St. John's wort are hypericin, pseudohypericin, and hyperforin. One of the problems associated with medicinal plant preparations including St. John's wort is the extreme variability in the phytochemical content, mostly due to environmental variability, and biotic and abiotic contamination during cropping. The current study was undertaken to transplant St. John's wort plants from in vitro bioreactors in a closed controlled environment system (CCES) with CO2 enrichment for the optimized production of biomass and phytochemicals. The growth and levels of hypericin, pseudohypericin, and hyperforin in plants grown in CCES were compared with those of the greenhouse and in vitro-grown plants. The environmental parameters in the greenhouse were found to be variable whereas in the CCES these parameters were controlled. Generally, all the growth parameters and hypericin and pseudohypericin levels were significantly higher in the plants grown in the CCES. These results provide the first indication that growing St. John's wort plants under CO2 enrichment in a closed environment system can enhance the biomass and medicinal contents. The adaptation of this growing system may be useful for the production of optimized products of St. John's wort and other medicinal species.\n      </p>", "An interactionist approach provides a relevant point of view on human\u2013natural environment relations. This essay draws on an interactionist approach from a Meadian, pragmatic, social constructionist perspective. In the context of grounded distinctions for interpreting \"natural environment,\" this discussion considers instances of human intervention and levels of responses, for example, individual, social, cultural, historical, and utopian, as variant, even conflicting, reconstructions of the foundational relationship of human\u2013natural environment interaction.

Under some mild assumptions on the environment, we prove equivalence between the decay rate of the partition function and some natural localization properties of the path; some quantitative estimates of the decay of the partition function in one or two dimensions, or at sufficiently low temperature; and the existence of quenched free energy. In particular, we generalize to general environments the results recently obtained by Carmona and Hu for a Gaussian environment. Our approach is based on martingale decomposition and martingale analysis. It leads to a natural, asymptotic relation between the partition function, and the probability that two polymers in the same environment, but otherwise independent, end up at the same point.\n      </p>", "This paper examines the relationship between the environment and the practice of geomancy in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Taiwan. Citing such legal records as rulings, contracts, and deeds, it demonstrates that the geomantic approach to the environment, which emphasized conservation of the \"numinous\" landscape, frequently came into conflict with the opposite, utilitarian approach, which treated nature as an exploitable economic resource. However, it also shows that, despite frequent confrontations, the two approaches could in fact be fruitfully reconciled under certain circumstances. Thus geomancy in premodern Taiwan was not an unbendable ideology, but was amenable to practical compromises that took into account both the geomantic and the economic interests of the people involved.\n      </p>", "Organisms' environments are thought to play a fundamental role in determining their fitness and hence in natural selection. Existing intuitive conceptions of environment are sufficient for biological practice. I argue, however, that attempts to produce a general characterization of fitness and natural selection are incomplete without the help of general conceptions of what conditions are included in the environment. Thus there is a \"problem of the reference environment\"\u2014more particularly, problems of specifying principles which pick out those environmental conditions which determine fitness. I distinguish various reference environment problems and propose solutions to some of them. While there has been a limited amount of work on problems concerning what I call \"subenvironments\", there appears to be no earlier work on problems of what I call the \"whole environment\". The first solution I propose for a whole environment problem specifies the overall environment for natural selection on a set of biological types present in a population over a specified period of time. The second specifies an environment relevant to extinction of types in a population; this kind of environment is especially relevant to certain kinds of long-term evolution.\n      </p>", "We obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the interaction between a service system and an external environment under which the stationary joint distribution of the set of busy channels and the state of the external environment is given by a product-form formula.\n      </p>", "An important question guiding research on the origin of life concerns the environmental conditions where molecular systems with the properties of life first appeared on the early Earth. An appropriate site would require liquid water, a source of organic compounds, a source of energy to drive polymerization reactions and a process by which the compounds were sufficiently concentrated to undergo physical and chemical interactions. One such site is a geothermal setting, in which organic compounds interact with mineral surfaces to promote self-assembly and polymerization reactions. Here, we report an initial study of two geothermal sites where mixtures of representative organic solutes (amino acids, nucleobases, a fatty acid and glycerol) and phosphate were mixed with high-temperature water in clay-lined pools. Most of the added organics and phosphate were removed from solution with half-times measured in minutes to a few hours. Analysis of the clay, primarily smectite and kaolin, showed that the organics were adsorbed to the mineral surfaces at the acidic pH of the pools, but could subsequently be released in basic solutions. These results help to constrain the range of possible environments for the origin of life. A site conducive to self-assembly of organic solutes would be an aqueous environment relatively low in ionic solutes, at an intermediate temperature range and neutral pH ranges, in which cyclic concentration of the solutes can occur by transient dry intervals.\n      </p>", "Much has been researched and said about the impacts of international trade liberalisation at the country level; but little is known about its social and environmental local-level impacts. Since national averages can mask the existence of winners and losers, national-level studies may be a poor guide to addressing the plight of the rural poor and the environment that are at the core of the agenda of the social and conservation movement. This article compares the international trade-liberalisation debate with the findings of local rural-based case studies in seven countries, co-ordinated by WWF and the World Bank during 2004\u20132007. It discusses some actions that the conservation and social movement could take to improve the discussion and the practice of trade liberalisation, poverty alleviation, and environmental conservation.\n      </p>", "Forty-four family day-care providers participated in a study of the relationships between the quality of the day-care program, the level of cognitive stimulation in the caregivers' home, and the social-emotional climate of the caregiver's own family life. Data were collected using Caldwell and Bradley's (1979) Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) Scale; Moos's (1986) Family Environment Scale (FES); and Harms, Clifford, and Padan-Belkin's (1983) Day Care Home Environment Rating Scale (DCHERS). HOME and DCHERS scores were highly correlated and yielded a total \"quality\" score in subsequent factor analyses. HOME, DCHERS, and the Quality scores all correlated highly with FES subscales on Organization, Independence, Active-Recreational, and Intellectual-Cultural orientations. The implications of these findings for day-care providers, trainers, and consultants to caregivers and parents are discussed.\n      </p>", "This study examines how joint venture partners' opportunism is influenced by environmental volatility in a drastically changing emerging economy. Building on transaction cost and information-processing theories, we develop the hypothesis that opportunism increases to cope with industry structural instability, information unverifiability, and law unenforceability, the three interrelated yet distinct characteristics that jointly describe environmental volatility in an emerging economy. Our analysis of 188 foreign joint ventures in an emerging market suggests that opportunism increases with information unverifiability and law unenforceability. These relationships are even stronger when joint ventures depend more on the host country environment, but weaker when joint ventures operate in faster-growing industries. Finally, opportunism is found to play a mediating role in the relationship between environmental volatility and joint venture performance.\n      </p>", "We consider a Markov process (\u03b7\u03bc t)t \u2208 R+ on (NS (S = Zd) with initial distribution \u03bc and the following time evolution: At rate b\u2211y q(y, x)\u03b7(y) a particle is born at site x; at rate d\u0303\u03b7(x) a particle dies at site x. All particles perform independent from each other continuous time random walk with kernel p(x, y) and rate m. All particles at a site x die at rate D(x). Here D(x) are random variables taking the values D1, D2 (D2 \u2265 D1 \u2265 0). We assume {D(x)}x \u2208 S to be stationary and ergodic. This paper studies the features of the model for p(x, y), q(x, y) symmetric. We calculate the exponential growth rate \u03bb of \u1ebc(\u03b7\u03bc t(x)) (with \u1ebc denoting conditional expectation with respect to the environment) and show that \u03bb is nonrandom and strictly bigger than b - d\u0303 - E(D(x)), if $D_2 &gt; D_1$ .

Collectively the cases presented in this issue explore connections between international and national policy, government action or sanctioned action, and human environmental crises. Cultural notions are seen to play a key role in influencing social relations, legitimizing power relations, and justifying the production and reproduction of human environmental crises.

The River Environment Classification (REC) is an alternative approach to landscape-scale river classification. The REC classifies individual sections of river networks according to the climate, topography, geology, and land cover of the unique upstream watershed of each section. The classification is hierarchical and is based on the assumption that climate, topography, geology, and land cover are dominant causes of spatial variation in physical and biological characteristics of rivers at 4 spatial scales. The ability of the REC to explain variation in invertebrate samples collected from 237 sites in New Zealand was compared to that of region-based classifications using classification strength tests. Classifications with differing numbers of classes were compared using relative classification strengths calculated by expressing absolute classification strength as a proportion of the classification strength reached by an a posteriori classification with the same number of classes. The a posteriori classifications were derived by clustering sites by their invertebrate assemblage, so the classifications were close to the maximum possible strength attainable for a set number of classes. The relative classification strength of the REC was compared with an existing ecoregion classification and with classes that were defined by clustering sites based on intersite distances. The relative classification strength of the REC was higher (&gt;55% of maximum attainable) than the strengths of classifications based on ecoregions (45%) or distance-based classes (&lt;47%) when presence/absence data were used. The relative classification strength of the REC also was higher (&gt;28% of maximum atainable) than the strengths of classifications based on ecoregions (22%) or distance-basedt classes (&lt;24%) when relative abundance data were used. The higher classification strength of the REC was attributed to its explicit consideration of the causes of spatial variation in ecological characteristics of rivers. In addition, the REC was more likely than ecoregion classification to differentiate among geographically close sites that had contrasting watershed conditions because the REC represented the network spatial structure of rivers. However, the classification strength of the REC was low, indicating that it provided a general representation of ecological patterns, but could not be used to predict assemblage characteristics reliably for a specific site.\n      </p>", "The published literature on attitudes toward environment and space has neglected ambiguity and ambivalence, an aspect of human psychology which we all recognize, but one which is difficult to measure. Three conditions promote ambiguity and ambivalence: 1) complex environments (stimuli); 2) the discrepancy between the mind's search for symmetry and life's bias in favor of movement and of certain psychological values; and 3) the tendency for feelings and primitive concepts to polarize.\n      </p>", "1. Declines in abundance and diversity of bumble bees (Bombus spp.) in Europe have been linked to agricultural intensification and the resulting loss of suitable foraging and nesting habitats. Environmental Stewardship (ES) is a new scheme in England offering the opportunity to restore habitats of value for these important pollinators to agricultural land. Scientific evaluation of the options prescribed within the scheme is essential to ensure that their objectives are met and that the benefits can be realized by the full bumble bee species assemblage. 2. We compared the efficacy of different ES options for field margins on arable land in enhancing the abundance and diversity of flowering resources and foraging bumble bees. Our study was conducted over 3 years using a multisite experiment. 3. Overall, uncropped margins sown with mixtures containing nectar and pollen-producing plants were more effective in providing bumble bee forage than margins sown with a grass mix, allowed to regenerate naturally or managed as conservation headlands. 4. A mixture of agricultural legumes established quickly and attracted on average the highest total abundance and diversity of bumble bees, including the rare long-tongued species Bombus ruderatus and Bombus muscorum. However, marked differences were observed between species and sexes in their responses to field margin management over time. 5. A diverse mixture of native wildflowers attracted more of the shorter-tongued Bombus spp. and provided greater continuity of forage resources, especially early in the season. Allowing Cirsium spp. to flower on such margins also increased their attractiveness to male bumble bees. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that the legume-based 'pollen and nectar flower mix', as prescribed under Entry Level Stewardship in England, can quickly provide a highly attractive forage resource for bumble bees, but that issues of seasonal flowering phenology and longevity of the mixture need to be addressed. Establishment of 'floristically enhanced margins' under Higher Level Stewardship will be important to provide diverse perennial communities of forage plants and to support a greater range of Bombus spp. and other pollinators. The population-level responses of bumble bees to introduced seed mixtures and other agri-environment options require further study in order to maximize the benefits of such schemes in intensively farmed landscapes.\n      </p>", "In this paper, we study a regular rooted coloured tree with random labels assigned to its edges, where the distribution of the label assigned to an edge depends on the colours of its endpoints.

Against the background of the characteristics of the environmental movements, O'Riordan examines the ways in which environmental considerations can be incorporated into major projects. He argues that environmental and social issues should be considered and costed as part of the project, and where necessary environmental compensatory measures should be included so as to achieve a net environmental benefit to all projects. His views are summarized in a 'code of practice' for major project managers. This advocates 'protection of heritage', 'baseline surveys', 'environmental auditing' and 'environmental enterprise'. Goodland provides a detailed account of the World Bank's approach to incorporating environmental considerations into their major projects. He shows that they are paying increased attention to environmental aspects both at the project level and at the national level. The World Bank ensures that the environment is integrated into project design, and usually establishes an environmental unit within each major project. More recently the Bank has also been fostering the participation of Non-Government Organizations. For the future, the Bank sees the need to include the integration of environmental issues into the economic dialogue with all member governments, and to revise the economic appraisal of projects to include concepts of externalities and sustainability.\n      </p>", "The popularity of the work Guns, germs and steel (GGS) has served to bring the question of human-environment connections once again to the forefront of popular thought. We assert that the recent success of GGS represents both a persistence of environmental determinist logic and a contemporary trend that privileges the environment as the primary influence on human-environment relationships. The historical development of the human-environment field is reviewed from the cultural and political ecology (CAPE) perspective, with particular attention to illustrating the varying emphasis between humans and their environment. GGS is situated within this developing field through a critical analysis of the arguments and methods forwarded by Jared Diamond. The book is found to mirror earlier environmental determinism by failing to take into account many of the advances in human-environmental thought since the early twentieth century. Its popular success suggests the pitfalls of failures to acknowledge the complex, intertwined and indivisible relationship that exists among humans and their environment. Furthermore, there is evidence that the environmental determinism espoused in GGS has caught the attention of international development policymakers potentially influencing future outlays of aid and assistance to the developing world. These conclusions raise cautionary flags against repeating past theoretical mistakes by accepting simplistic, causal explanations based largely on a deterministic conception of the natural environment.\n      </p>", "This paper considers conceptual, analytic and policy issues concerning US population, immigration and environment. The policy question guiding the analysis is whether the environmental impact of immigration is proportional to its numbers, i.e., additions to the population, or does immigration have a disproportionate effect on the environment, i.e., above or below what would be expected on additional numbers alone? If the effect is proportional, then policy issues concerning the environmental impact of immigration become centered on population policy and programs, and the relative benefit of manipulating immigration as a component of population growth to achieve national environmental (or other) goals. If, however, immigration has a disproportionate effect, thus an effect on the environment beyond the contribution to population growth, then US immigration policy and its administration have unique environmental implications which may be appropriately addressed through immigration policy reform. The IPAT model is presented as a general framework for establishing the proportionality of the environmental effects of US immigration. Given the demands of theory and limitations of data, the framework is decidedly 'ideal' and is offered as a long range proposal for policy relevant research on US population, immigration and environment. In order to move to act on the proposed research agenda, however, several important analytic components of national population and environmental research must be strengthened. First, more accurate and comprehensive measurement of the components of US population growth is critical. Second, analysis of population, immigration and environmental processes must occur over time and across regions and local communities in the US. Third, a process of interpreting research results which is both inter- and multi-disciplinary, and is inclusive of national, regional and local concerns must be organized to wisely interpret findings within the context of national goals and traditions.\n      </p>", "We prove a quenched central limit theorem for random walks with bounded increments in a randomly evolving environment on &lt;tex-math&gt;${\\Bbb Z}^{d}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;.

Unlike previous studies that view joint venture contractual governance as a unidimensional construct (clause specificity), thus causing a debate upon whether IJV contracts should be more specific, contractual governance herein is defined as a three-dimensional construct that includes the extent to which contractual terms are clearly specified (term specificity), possible contingencies are accounted for (contingency adaptability), and joint venture parties are legally bound to the contract (contractual obligatoriness). Our analysis of IJVs in China suggests that term specificity and contractual obligatoriness increase when the proprietariness of resources to be invested in the IJV or the incompieteness of the host country's legal system increase. Contractual obligatoriness appears to be an increasing function of economic exposure and environmental volatility, whereas contingency adaptability in a contract rises when interparty dependency, investment uncertainty, and knowledge proprietariness intensify or when environmental hazards escalate. These results suggest that an IJV contract, if structured multidimensionally as above, can curtail opportunism and guide venture evolution at the same time. These contractual dimensions should not be prefixed but properly aligned with transactional and institutional characteristics. This alignment has strong implications in reducing transaction costs and spurring IJV evolution in the complex and volatile institutional environment.\n      </p>", "Three decades ago, planned obsolescence was a widely discussed ethical issue in marketing classrooms. Planned obsolescence is topical again today because an increasing emphasis on continuous product development promotes shorter durables replacement and disposal cycles with troublesome environmental consequences. This paper offers explanations of why product obsolescence is practiced and why it works. It then examines the ethical responsibilities of product developers and corporate strategists and their differing responses to this problem. Pro-environment product design and marketing practices and innovative government policies may alleviate the problem over time. However, given the current lack of understanding about consumer replacement and disposal behavior, it is questionable as to whether these practices and policies will be sufficiently informed to be effective. Thus, marketing scholars have a significant opportunity to contribute to sustainable durables product development.\n      </p>", "By making the time parameters of a birth and death process random variables, we create a continuous-time analogue of random walk in a random environment.

From these bounds, necessary and sufficient conditions are established for such a process to become extinct with probability one.

We say that (x, t) and (y, s) are connected (or in the same cluster) if there is a path from (x, t) to (y, s) made out of uncut segments of vertical lines and bridges. If we consider only oriented percolation, we have the graphical representation of the (inhomogeneous) d-dimensional contact process. We consider these percolation and contact processes in a random environment by taking \u03b4 = {\u03b4(x); x \u2208 Zd} and \u03bb = {\u03bb(x,y); x,y \u2208 Zd, |x - y|2 = 1} to be independent families of independent identically distributed strictly positive random variables; we use \u03b4 and \u03bb for representative random variables.

In this study, we investigate environment and strategic adaptations 12 years after Tan and Litschert examined these issues in 1990. Following a staged model, the study found that (1) organizational environment and firm strategic adaptations have co-evolved over time, (2) a new configuration has emerged and is related to improved performance, and (3) such a relationship is moderated by the stage during transition in which firms were founded. Specifically, firms founded since 1990 are more proactive and innovative than firms that had existed in the previous stage.\n      </p>", "Within the realm of active living in urban neighborhoods in the United States, only a few studies have addressed the factors that promote or inhibit active living among residents in public housing. This paper examines the environmental and interpersonal factors associated with active living and health in public housing. We specifically examine the environmental predictors of fear of crime, and whether fear is related to moderate physical activity, and in turn, health and obesity. The analysis drew upon data from a sample of 328 African-American residents living in two severely distressed public housing developments in 2007. Structural equation modeling was used to calculate a path model of direct and indirect effects. Perceptions of violence were positively associated with fear, and both fear and physical activity predicted health. However, neither fear nor physical activity was associated with obesity. We discuss the implications of these findings for improving the quality of life of disadvantaged residents living in high-crime neighborhoods.\n      </p>", "Solving the problem of the adverse impact of human numbers on the natural environment is a collective action problem and, if we are to understand it fully, we need good interdisciplinary research which includes work by demographers and sociologists.

There is also little encouragement for such research from political leaders or the public.

The explanation for this might lie in the fact that mixing of reproductive individuals whose development has been influenced by genotype-by-environment interactions (GEIs) can blur the relationship between the individual male genetic quality and phenotype as perceived by females. Strong GEIs can generate an ecological crossover, where different genotypes are superior in environments that are separated either in space or time. Here, we use a stochastic simulation model to show that even a weak GEI, which does not generate an obvious ecological crossover, can neutralize or even reverse the relationship between genetic quality and sexual trait size in the presence of environmental heterogeneity during development. Our model highlights the importance of developmental selection in evolution of traits and allows us to predict the situations in which sexual displays might not be reliable indicators of genetic quality.\n      </p>", "Natural populations vary tremendously in their susceptibility to infectious disease agents. The factors (environmental or genetic) that underlie this variation determine the impact of disease on host population dynamics and evolution, and affect our capacity to contain disease outbreaks and to enhance resistance in agricultural animals and disease vectors. Here, we show that changes in the environmental conditions under which female Daphnia magna are kept can more than halve the susceptibility of their offspring to bacterial infection. Counter-intuitively, and unlike the effects typically observed in vertebrates for transfer of immunity, mothers producing offspring under poor conditions produced more resistant offspring than did mothers producing offspring in favourable conditions. This effect occurred when mothers who were well provisioned during their own development then found themselves reproducing in poor conditions. These effects likely reflect adaptive optimal resource allocation where better quality offspring are produced in poor environments to enhance survival. Maternal exposure to parasites also reduced offspring susceptibility, depending on host genotype and offspring food levels. These maternal responses to environmental conditions mean that studies focused on a single generation, and those in which environmental variation is experimentally minimized, may fail to describe the crucial parameters that influence the spread of disease. The large maternal effects we report here will, if they are widespread in nature, affect disease dynamics, the level of genetic polymorphism in populations, and likely weaken the evolutionary response to parasite-mediated selection.\n      </p>", "More than just being cumulative, the health effects of environmental pollutants and stresses are both additive and dynamic, resulting in conditions which are more than the sum of their individual effects. These may have far-reaching implications. Air pollution has several primary health effects, as evidenced by \"killer smog\" episodes, and by additional long-term disease-producing effects into which research efforts are now probing. It also has secondary effects such as use of private and public funds to undo pollution-caused damage which could be used instead for other, more constructive purposes; and \"dynamic\" effects or interrelationships, such as those between air pollution, solid waste disposal, and water pollution problems. These are in addition to cumulative hazards which the public encounters in the work place, at home, and while going about normal activities.

The outdoor and greenhouse treatments also included adjacent shaded (50%) seedlings. The effects of growth environment on needle epicuticular wax production and morphology, and on needle wettability were investigated. Red and black spruce exhibited free growth in addition to determinate growth, but only in the greenhouse. Although relative growth rate was significantly lower for seedlings grown outdoors, there were no differences in wax morphology between outdoor- and greenhouse-grown seedlings. Wax deposits on controlled environment seedlings were significantly more crystalline. Wax tubes were crystallized in 'tufts'. There were significant differences in wax amounts recovered between species and treatments. Wax amounts relative to needle dry weights decreased in the order greenhouse &gt; outdoors &gt; controlled environment. Shaded red and black spruce produced significantly more wax than unshaded. Needles from seedlings grown in controlled environment chambers had the largest needle/droplet contact angles. These data indicate that seedling growth environment affects needle epicuticular wax characteristics and wettability.

However, few have examined environmental factors affecting turnover. Applying event history analysis to a random sample of California hospitals, we find that poor performance prompts executive turnover and that the legal environment impacts turnover in three ways. First, the legal form of hospitals shapes evaluation and replacement of executives. Second, a shift in the legal definition of not-for-profit hospitals affects turnover. Finally, turnover increases when hospitals change from for-profit to not-for-profit and vice versa.

High- and low-pollen-hoarding strains and unselected wild-type bees were co-fostered in pairs of colonies manipulated to differentially stimulate high and low pollen foraging. The high-pollen-foraging stimulus consisted of high amounts of larvae, a known stimulus for pollen foraging, plus low amounts of pollen, known to induce pollen foraging. The low-pollen-foraging stimulus consisted of low amounts of larvae plus high amounts of pollen. We estimated the median age at which bees initiated foraging, determined forage choice, and the quality and quantity of resources collected. High-strain bees consistently foraged at younger ages than workers from the other sources. High-strain bees appeared to be more sensitive to the pollen-foraging-stimulus treatments, showing greater differences in foraging age and behavior. Three-way interactions of genotype, pollen foraging stimulus, and colony pair (replicate) were statistically significant for most foraging variables measured suggesting that additional, unknown environmental factors also affect foraging behavior. Our results suggest there is a functional relationship between age of first foraging and forage choice with a strong genetic component that is modulated by colony environment.\n      </p>", "Recent advances in human genomics have made it possible to better understand the genetic basis of disease. In addition, genetic association studies can also elucidate the mechanisms by which 'nongenetic' exogenous and endogenous exposures influence the risk of disease. This is true both of studies that assess the marginal effect of a single gene and studies that look at the joint effect of genes and environmental exposures. For example, gene variants that are known to alter enzyme function or level can serve as surrogates for long-term biomarker levels that are impractical or impossible to measure on many subjects. Evidence that genetic variants modify the effect of an established risk factor may help specify the risk factor's biologically active components. We illustrate these ideas with several examples and discuss design and analysis challenges, particularly for studies of geneenvironment interaction. We argue that to increase the power to detect interaction effects and limit the number of false positive results, large sample sizes will be needed, which are currently only available through planned collaborative efforts. Such collaborations also ensure a common approach to measuring variation at a genetic locus, avoiding a problem that has led to difficulties when comparing results from genetic association studies.\n      </p>", "Behavior genetics has demonstrated that genetic variance is an important component of variation for all behavioral outcomes, but variation among families is not. These results have led some critics of behavior genetics to conclude that heritability is so ubiquitous as to have few consequences for scientific understanding of development, while some behavior genetic partisans have concluded that family environment is not an important cause of developmental outcomes. Both views are incorrect. Genotype is in fact a more systematic source of variability than environment, but for reasons that are methodological rather than substantive. Development is fundamentally nonlinear, interactive, and difficult to control experimentally. Twin studies offer a useful methodological shortcut, but do not show that genes are more fundamental than environments.\n      </p>", "This study examined differences in students' college experiences and learning outcomes using Biglan's typology of pure and applied disciplines. It was expected that students in applied disciplines would have more positive perceptions of the college environment, be more involved, and report greater gains in learning and intellectual development than students in pure disciplines. An analysis of data from one university identified significant differences in the college experiences and learning outcomes of students in pure and applied disciplines; however, differences in reported learning seemed to be related to disciplinary content, rather than Biglan's pure and applied topology.\n      </p>", "In most analyses performed on consumer behaviour in a competitive environment, it is assumed that discretionary buying power devoted to a certain product category exists in a trade area. The goal is to estimate how this buying power is distributed among competing retail facilities in the area. In this paper, we assume that in many competitive situations not all the buying power is spent at the competing facilities because there are other facilities that offer substitute products. These substitute products are not as desirable as the product in question, but customers will purchase the less desirable substitutes if they are more conveniently available. We construct a model that considers a decline in demand as a function of the distance to competing facilities. If the competing facilities are close to the customers, a larger portion of the buying power will be spent at these facilities. Two objectives are considered. One is the maximization of the buying power spent at all competing facilities, and the second is the maximization of the buying power captured by one's chain of retail facilities. Solution methods for the location of one facility are proposed and computational experiments with these methods are reported.\n      </p>", "Background: Differences in the neighborhood food environment may contribute to disparities in obesity. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine the association of neighborhood food environments with body mass index (BMI) and obesity after control for neighborhood walkability. Methods: This study employed a cross-sectional, multilevel analysis of BMI and obesity among 13,102 adult residents of New York City. We constructed measures of the food environment and walkability for the neighborhood, defined as a half-mile buffer around the study subject's home address. Results: Density of BMI-healthy food outlets (supermarkets, fruit and vegetable markets, and natural food stores) was inversely associated with BMI. Mean adjusted BMI was similar in the first two quintiles of healthy food density (0 and 1.13 stores/km\u00b2, respectively), but declined across the three higher quintiles and was 0.80 units lower [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.27-1.32] in the fifth quintile (10.98 stores/km\u00b2) than in the first. The prevalence ratio for obesity comparing the fifth quintile of healthy food density with the lowest two quintiles combined was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.78-0.97). These associations remained after control for two neighborhood walkability measures, population density and land-use mix. The prevalence ratio for obesity for the fourth versus first quartile of population density was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.73-0.96) and for land-use mix was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.86-0.97). Increasing density of food outlets categorized as BMI-unhealthy was not significantly associated with BMI or obesity. Conclusions: Access to BMI-healthy food stores is associated with lower BMI and lower prevalence of obesity.\n      </p>", "The National Children's Study will be the largest long-term study of children's health and development ever to be conducted in the United States. By tracking 100,000 children from before birth to age 21, the study will seek to better understand the links between the environments in which American children are raised and their physical and mental health and development. The study will produce information around multiple concerns, including pregnancy-related outcomes; injury; asthma; obesity, diabetes, and physical development; and child development and mental health. For the study, the \u201cenvironment\u201d is defined broadly, to include physical surroundings; biological and chemical factors; geography; and social, educational, behavioral, family, and cultural influences. This article provides an overview of the goals and objectives of the study, how and where environmental exposures will be defined and captured, the priority health outcome themes to be studied, how participants will be recruited, and study challenges.\n      </p>", "The variability of morphological and life-history traits in Drosophila melanogaster and D. subobscura, two sympatric Drosophila species of different climatic origin, were investigated with regard to seasonal and daily temperature and humidity fluctuations to assess thermal sensitivity and the responses of free-living organisms to oscillating temperatures. Temperature and humidity were measured continuously at the site where Drosophila were observed throughout the day, and thus represent a realistic picture of the temperature environment of these animals. A phenotypic model (gaussian curve) of temperature performance was fitted to daily fecundities and provided estimates of the position of temperature optimum and of the maximum and the breadth of performance for both species. D. melanogaster had a higher optimum temperature than D. subobscura. A trade-off between the maximum and the breadth of performance was detected both within and between the species.\n      </p>", "In order to document the natural CO\u2082 environment of the moss Hylocomium splendens, and ascertain whether or not the moss was adapted to this, and its interactions with other microenvironmental factors, two studies were carried out. Firstly, the seasonal variations of CO\u2082 concentration, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), tissue water content and temperature were measured in the natural microenvironment of H. splendens in a subarctic forest during the summer period (July-September). Secondly, the photosynthetic responses of the species to controlled CO\u2082 concentrations, PAR, temperature, and hydration were measured in the laboratory. CO\u2082 concentrations around the upper parts of the plant, when PAR was above the compensation point (30 \u03bcmol m-2 s-1), were mostly between 400 and 450 ppm. They occasionally increased up to 1143 ppm for short periods. PAR flux densities below saturating light levels for photosynthesis (100 \u03bcmol m-2 s-1), occurred during 65% (July), 76% (August) and 96% (September) of the hours of the summer period. The temperature optimum of photosynthesis was 20\u00b0 C: this temperature coincided with PAR above the compensation point during 5%, 6% and 0% of the time in July, August and September, respectively. Optimal hydration of tissues was infrequent. Hence PAR, temperature and water limit CO\u2082 uptake for most of the growing season. Our data suggest that the higher than normal ambient CO\u2082 concentration in the immediate environment of the plant counteracts some of the limitations in PAR supply that it experiences in its habitat. This species already experiences concentrations of atmospheric CO\u2082 predicted to occur over the next 50 years.\n      </p>", "A sample of 159 Russian adolescents was surveyed at a suburban Moscow secondary school in 1992. The purpose of this study was: (a) to explore the relation of Russian family environment with adolescent substance use and depression, and (b) to use cross-national research methods for replicating and confirming U.S. studies of family environment, substance use, and depression. Many of the findings were similar to studies with U.S. youth: (a) Russian youth who viewed their families as conflictual, non-supportive, and without close relationships with their parents reported feeling more depressed; and (b) substance users were not as close to their parents and families as non-users. There were also findings which may be unique to Russian youth that warrant further research. The findings have implications for family policy, family research, and the future development of cross-national studies.\n      </p>", "Environmental problems in Poland were highlighted during the 1980s, although discussion of the causes and consequences was discouraged. With the round table meetings and the ending of the communist Government, concern about the environment reached a new high point. Decisions were taken to close certain enterprises which were particularly damaging to the environment, and to try to clear up the damage left by the former regime. However, when the recession of the early 1990s began to bite, public concern about rising unemployment downgraded the environment as an issue, with the result that some of the condemned businesses were reprieved, at least temporarily. In the public sector, work on cleaning up and on remedying deficiencies in infrastructure (such as building municipal sewage works) has proceeded more slowly than might have been expected. This paper surveys the progress made in Poland over the past eight years, and looks at the prospects for sustainable development in the future. Examples are drawn from all over Poland, but with a particular emphasis on the city of Torun.\n      </p>", "We study the sample path asymptotics of a class of recurrent diffusion processes with random potentials, including examples of Sinai's simple random walk in random environment and Brox's diffusion process with Brownian potential. The main results consist of several integral criteria which completely characterize all the possible Levy classes, therefore providing a very precise image of the almost sure asymptotic behaviors of these processes.\n      </p>", "Repeated attempts to establish a monistic description of geography ignore the essential pluralism of our four traditions. From the 1960s on, the spatial tradition came to dominate the field. Thus following the environmental revolution in the late 1960s, the man-land or human environment tradition in geography was too small to provide the training and leadership for the increasingly professionalized movement despite high levels of scientific leadership and interdisciplinary competence evidenced by many individual geographers. The great enduring, scientific challenges of the human environment persist, and new opportunities are offered geographers to use their skills, knowledge, and values for human survival. These challenges include the Malthusian dilemma of population and resources, the nature and determinants of the human transformation of the earth, and the sustainable development of the biosphere. I describe a brief intellectual history of these problems, offer selective examples of work underway, and suggest opportunities for geographic participation.\n      </p>", "There is a long history of debate about the changing Hindu Kush-Himalaya (HKH) environment, but with important disjunctures between research, international environmental agendas and institutions, and various different domestic policies at the national level. Within academe, a retreat from the Theory of Himalayan Environmental Degradation (THED) since the late 1980s has not been reflected to any degree in domestic policy agendas of India and China. Here, we make a comparative analysis of the \"upstream downstream\" debates (which claim that the resource use practices of upstream users have serious detrimental costs to those downstream) in two of the most powerful and populous countries of the HKH region: India and China. We find that the rejection of THED is, on the whole, contradicted but sometimes appropriated by different national players within important political arenas, and in this sense it becomes a discursive pawn in \"games of the state.\" Parts of the retreat from THED are simply ignored, and others are actively resisted. Set against these discursive maneuvers within domestic politics, the academic \"state of the game\" has undergone profound changes, shifting away from technically derived and science-led imperatives of environmental management toward issues of plural environmental truths, environmental justice, and hybrid knowledge. However, national debates have taken their individual routes, shaped largely by national political events. Thus, the poststructuralist turn in the social sciences in the academy and in some policy arenas, too-the deconstruction of one grand environmental narrative after another (e.g., deforestation, the wood fuel crisis, overstocking), the faltering claims of positivist science to deliver truth, and growing attacks of uncertainty-all this has had a contingent, but usually peripheral, impact upon national academic, political, and policy agendas in China and India. Some conclusions about policy studies are drawn.\n      </p>", "The following two papers result from a meeting at the Society's House on 14 November, 1988. Against the background of the characteristics of the environmental movements, O'Riordan examines the ways in which environmental considerations can be incorporated into major projects. He argues that environmental and social issues should be considered and costed as part of the project, and where necessary environmental compensatory measures should be included so as to achieve a net environmental benefit to all projects. His views are summarized in a 'code of practice' for major project managers. This advocates 'protection of heritage', 'baseline surveys', 'environmental auditing' and 'environmental enterprise'. Goodland provides a detailed account of the World Bank's approach to incorporating environmental considerations into their major projects. He shows that they are paying increased attention to environmental aspects both at the project level and at the national level. The World Bank ensures that the environment is integrated into project design, and usually establishes an environmental unit within each major project. More recently the Bank has also been fostering the participation of Non-Government Organizations. For the future, the Bank sees the need to include the integration of environmental issues into the economic dialogue with all member governments, and to revise the economic appraisal of projects to include concepts of externalities and sustainability.\n      </p>", "Green product development, which addresses environmental issues through product design and innovation as opposed to the traditional end-of-pipe-control approach, is receiving significant attention from customers, industries, and governments around the world. In this paper we develop a quality-based model for analyzing the strategic and policy issues concerning the development of products with conflicting traditional and environmental attributes. On the demand side of the problem, we use the framework of conjoint analysis to structure the preferences of the ordinary and green customers. On the supply side, we apply the theories in optimal product design and market segmentation to analyze the producer's strategic decisions regarding the number of products introduced and their prices and qualities. On the policy side, we evaluate the effects of environmental standards on the economic and environmental consequences of green product development. By jointly considering the interactions among the customers' preferences, the producer's product strategies, and the environmental standards imposed by governments, we present some interesting findings that can be used to manage and regulate the development of green products. Two major findings show that green product development and stricter environmental standards might not necessarily benefit the environment.\n      </p>", "The impact of university student living groups on freshmen students' personal and social development was assessed. The social environments of 42 student living groups were measured by the University Residence Environment Scale, which assesses 10 salient dimensions of the social environment. Indices of student personal and social growth were assessed by a biographical and experience questionnaire at the beginning and the end of the freshman year. The social environments of the living groups had differential impacts on student interactions and activities and student self-descriptions and feelings. For example, living groups that emphasized academic achievement facilitated negative affect and exhaustion and inhibited artistic appreciation and impulsive-deviancy. Student living groups constitute important subenvironments which should be assessed in future college impact studies.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Focusing on crop choices and the domestic textile industry, it explores how villagers reacted to the environmental change caused by extensive dike construction and frequent inundation in the Jianghan plain in the Qing and the Republic and how they contended with the worsening problems of waterlogging. The article argues that under these circumstances, the environment, rather than the market, was the paramount factor in shaping peasants' economic behavior in the Jianghan plain.\n      </p>", "This paper examines the way 'environment' has been conceptualized within the British planning system from the 1940s to the 1990s. Drawing on texts of development plans and related planning strategy statements, it identifies a shift from a view of the environment as setting, to a stronger interest in active environmental care which in turn has been challenged by an emphasis on marketable assets. Although there are now efforts to develop more complex conceptions of environmental care related to the notion of environmental sustainability and to use these as policy principles in development plans and development regulation, it is argued that the system has persistently enabled economic and material policy preoccupations to prevail. This could also be the fate of the environmental sustainability agenda. Nevertheless, the rhetoric of sustainable development could challenge this and help to transform concepts, techniques and forms of argumentation in the planning system.\n      </p>", "Children's intellectual development is influenced by both genetic inheritance and environmental experiences. Breastfeeding is one of the earliest such postnatal experiences. Breastfed children attain higher IQ scores than children not fed breast milk, presumably because of the fatty acids uniquely available in breast milk. Here we show that the association between breastfeeding and IQ is moderated by a genetic variant in FADS2, a gene involved in the genetic control of fatty acid pathways. We confirmed this gene- environment interaction in two birth cohorts, and we ruled out alternative explanations of the finding involving gene-exposure correlation, intrauterine growth, social class, and maternal cognitive ability, as well as maternal genotype effects on breastfeeding and breast milk. The finding shows that environmental exposures can be used to uncover novel candidate genes in complex phenotypes. It also shows that genes may work via the environment to shape the IQ, helping to close the nature versus nurture debate.\n      </p>", "It has often been argued that an organization's strategy and structure must be tailored or matched to the challenges posed by its environment. Our research shows that this match is less likely to be achieved by long-tenured CEO's than by their counterparts with less tenure. It also suggests that the failure to match strategy and environment hurts financial performance. More specifically, CEO tenure related inversely to the prescribed match between organization and environment, especially in uncertain settings and where ownership was concentrated. The match between environment and strategy was in turn positively related to financial performance.\n      </p>", "Male guppies, Poecilia reticulata, have color patterns that result from a balance between natural selection for crypsis to avoid predators and sexual selection for bright, complex patterns that attract females. Males use displays to show off these patterns to potential mates, but their conspicuousness also depends on the light environment in which they are viewed. We investigated variation in natural underwater guppy light environments in Trinidad, West Indies, and found that mating behavior is correlated with both the 'quantity' (total irradiance) and 'quality' (spectral composition) of light: light intensity and the proportion of ultraviolet light were negatively related to display rates. Experimental manipulation of light environment to mimic natural daily changes demonstrated that these relationships are causal and are independent of time of day effects. At lower light levels, when guppies are less detectable by visually hunting predators, females had more opportunity for active mate choice, because males displayed more. However, these light conditions may reduce the ability of females to accurately discriminate between males. Guppy mating behavior is therefore strongly affected by light environment, and this may have important effects on sexual selection.\n      </p>", "A model of foraging in a stochastic environment is presented. Drawing on statistical decision theory, this paper suggests that maximization of expected utility may be a useful optimization criterion for ecological problems. The common notion of feeding preferences is extended to preferences over the probability distributions of net energetic benefits associated with available resources. By incorporating a forager's response to environmental variation, the model can lead to predictions that contrast with those of most deterministic feeding models.\n      </p>", "Premise of research.\u2003This study demonstrates that carryover effects from differences in early-life environmental conditions influence patterns of mortality, natural selection, and late-life phenotype.\n         Methodology.\u2003Using the annual species Agrostemma githago, an experimental design was established to create different early-life environments and a common late-life environment. Genotypes from a paternal cross design were replicated across three environmental treatments and two seasons, for a total of six different early-life environments, and then they all shared a common late-life environment.\n         Pivotal results.\u2003ANOVA revealed significant G \u00d7 E interactions for size within early environment treatments. Effects of early-life environment were observed throughout the life cycle, and these effects extended to late life stages when all individuals were living in the common environment. Variation in phenotypic selection was also influenced by early-life environment, and this variation was caused by viability selection and a mismatch between early- and late-life environments.\n         Conclusions.\u2003Plastic responses to early-life environment explained differences in adult phenotype and determined the outcome of selection and survival in a common late-life environment.\n      </p>", "The primary objective of this paper is to examine more closely the complex nature of the natural environment dimension of community attachment using the narratives of local community members. This work seeks to build and elaborate on previous quantitative analyses that demonstrated two distinct dimensions of community attachment\u2014social and natural environment. The findings reveal several distinct facets of the natural environment dimension of community attachment and demonstrate both a discreet perception of the natural environment in terms of community attachment as well as one that is more embedded within the social context of a particular lifestyle. The findings further demonstrate the need to include consideration of the natural environment in the broader assessment of community attachment and bolster previous quantitative research findings.\n      </p>", "Matched sampling of Escherichia coli from broiler house litter and bird lesions of either cellulitis or colibacillosis was conducted to investigate the relationship of pathogenic E. coli to those found in the environment. Isolates were collected from six broiler flocks representing six geographically disparate ranches. Isolates were compared by flock for similarity in serotype and genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Serotyping revealed a considerable dissociation between the two groups of isolates. The prevalence of pathogenic E. coli that matched the environmental isolates from the same house was 0 to 3%. Statistical analysis of the serotype data showed a strong dependence of serotype on isolate source, indicating a high probability that a particular serotype would be found among lesions or litter but not in both groups. Genotyping of isolates on two farms supported the results of serotyping and provided differentiation of isolates that could not by typed by serology. These results suggested that the prevalence of pathogenic E. coli in the broiler house was independent of the prevalence of other commensal or environmental E. coli. Understanding the composition of E. coli populations in commercial poultry production may have bearing on the epidemiology and control of E. coli related diseases. /// Se tomaron muestras pareadas de Escherichia coli a partir de la cama de galpones de pollo de engorde y de lesiones de celulitis o colibacilosis en aves con el fin de investigar la relaci\u00f3n existente entre el E. coli pat\u00f3geno y el presente en el medio ambiente. Se tomaron aislamientos de 6 lotes de pollos de engorde representando 6 granjas geogr\u00e1ficamente separadas.
