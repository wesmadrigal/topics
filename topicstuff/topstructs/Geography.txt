{"total_words": 1466, "documents": ["Against a background of recent work in the history of geography and of geographical knowledge, the paper considers evidence for the place of geography within British universities before the formal establishment of the first departments of geography. Attention is paid to geography's discursive connections with other subjects within given university curricula, and to the values placed upon its teaching by contemporaries. The paper argues that extant historiographies for British geography should be revised in the light of such evidence. More importantly, the paper raises questions about the sites and intellectual spaces in which geography has been situated and about the content, nature and purpose of writing geography's 'disciplinary' history.\n      </p>", "How did colonial and tropical geography as practiced in the aftermath of World War II become development geography by the 1970s? We excavate the genealogy of development geography, relating it to geopolitical, economic, and social traumas of decolonization. We examine how revolutionary pressures and insurgencies, coupled with the eclipse of formal colonialism, led to the degeneration and displacement of a particular way of writing geographical difference of \"the tropics.\" A key objective here is to complicate and enrich understandings of paradigmatic shifts and epistemological transitions, and to elaborate archaeologies of development knowledges and their association with geography. While interested in such a big picture, we also approach this story in part through engagements with the works of a series of geographers whose scholarship and teaching took them to the tropics, among them Keith Buchanan, a pioneering radical geographer trained at the School of Geography of the University of Birmingham, England, who later worked in South Africa, Nigeria, London, Singapore (as an external examiner), and Aotearoa/New Zealand.\n      </p>", "The tripartite division of physical geography into geomorphology, climatology and biogeography is still often quoted, but developments in the last two decades have resulted in restructuring of the discipline. Significant publications by physical geographers now occur dominantly in multidisciplinary rather than in core geography journals. Analysis of the contents of ten journals and of the submissions to the 1996 UK Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) demonstrate the current pre-eminence of two sub-disciplines: geomorphology with hydrology, and Quaternary environmental change. Complementing research in the sub-disciplines, six trends towards a more integrated physical geography are identified as indicators of restructuring that has already occurred. Three futures are suggested for physical geography. The first, the status quo, is thought to be unlikely. The second, the disappearance of physical geography into other disciplinary areas would leave holistic investigations to other disciplines and so is undesirable. Thus, the third alternative, a renaissance of a more integrated physical geography, provides the most likely future. It is supported by existing integrative trends, provides a natural sequel to reductionist specialization, reflects the strong identity for the geographical approach to the earth and environmental sciences and the spatio-analytical approach integrating deductive and inductive studies, and it focuses on human-environmental interactions that could have implications for geography as a whole.\n      </p>", "The history of academic geography before 1945 has been explored in outline but the institutional setting of the new subject has been unduly neglected. The five 'redbrick' universities, established in the first years of the twentieth century, form a coherent group of institutions for which a comparative survey of the establishment of geography as an honours subject is presented. The links between the early teachers in these departments are explored and the influence of the RGS and the Geographical Association is assessed. The early years of geography at Birmingham are treated in greater detail to exemplify these themes.\n      </p>", "Recent theoretical and empirical work in economic geography has experienced what might be termed a 'relational turn' that focuses primarily on the ways in which socio-spatial relations of economic actors are intertwined with processes of economic change at various geographical scales. This phenomenon begs the questions of whether the 'relational turn' is simply an explicit reworking of what might be an undercurrent in economic geography during the late 1970s and the 1980s, and whether this 'turn' offers substantial advancement in our theory and practice. In this paper, I aim to evaluate critically the nature and emergence of this relational economic geography by revisiting its antecedents and conceptual frameworks. This evaluation opens up some significant conceptual issues that are further reworked in this paper. In particular, I argue that much of the work in this 'relational turn' is relational only in a thematic sense, focusing on various themes of socio-spatial relations without theorizing sufficiently the nature of relationality and its manifestation through power relations and actor-specific practice. This paper thus illuminates the nature of relationality and the multiple ways through which power works itself out in 'relational geometries', defined as the spatial configurations of heterogeneous power relations. As a preliminary attempt, I first conceptualize different forms of power in such relational geometries and their causal effects in producing concrete/spatial outcomes. I then show how this relational view can offer an alternative understanding of a major research concern in contemporary economic geography - regional development.\n      </p>", "An active learning project in an introductory graduate course used multidimensional scaling of the name index in Geography in America at the Dawn of the 21st Century, by Gary Gaile and Cort Willmott, to reveal some features of the discipline's recent intellectual structure relevant to the relationship between human and physical geography. Previous analyses, dating to the 198os, used citation indices or Association of American Geographers specialty-group rosters to conclude that either the regional or the methods and environmental subdisciplines bridge human and physical geography. The name index has advantages over those databases, and its analysis reveals that the minimal connectivity that occurs between human and physical geography has recently operated more through environmental than through either methods or regional subdisciplines.\n      </p>", "French academic geography achieved remarkable success during the 1920s making Paris an appropriate location for the XIIIth International Geographical Congress to meet in 1931. These scholarly activities were counterpoised by expressions of an exotic 'popular geography' at the great Exposition Coloniale staged in the French capital at the same time. At the Congress, French academics displayed their research achievements in denudation chronology, rural settlement studies and cartography, extending their work from the Hexagon to parts of the Empire. Patronage by leading professors in Paris and Grenoble clearly played a vital role in shaping the discipline. The location and content of excursions for visiting scholars also highlighted French achievements and suggested what remained to be done. Scrutiny of activities at the XIIIth IGC reveals a profession whose official pronouncements appear isolated from the momentous economic and political changes triggered by global depression at that time.\n      </p>", "The paper presents a citation analysis of articles published in economic geography (broadly defined) in the period since the 1980s, with a supplementary analysis of significant books in the field. The overwhelmingly Anglocentric character of 'international' economic geography is reaffirmed, as both journal publishing and the citation 'market' are dominated by authors from the UK, US and Canada. There is some evidence, however, that the field is beginning to internationalize, just as there are also indications that the reach of economic geography, qua 'exporter', is extending into other parts of the social sciences.\n      </p>", "We develop a Ricardian trade model that incorporates realistic geographic features into general equilibrium. It delivers simple structural equations for bilateral trade with parameters relating to absolute advantage, to comparative advantage (promoting trade), and to geographic barriers (resisting it). We estimate the parameters with data on bilateral trade in manufactures, prices, and geography from 19 OECD countries in 1990. We use the model to explore various issues such as the gains from trade, the role of trade in spreading the benefits of new technology, and the effects of tariff reduction.\n      </p>", "Histories of American geography have tended to concentrate on geographic thought and on the men who have been seen as major figures in research. In contrast, I examine the careers of women geographers and of professional practices in American geography in the 20th century. My approach reflects thinking in feminist studies and the social studies of science, which acknowledge the existence of multiple histories and the importance of paying attention to contexts. Before 1950, values linking prestige and masculinity resulted in the exclusion of women geographers from university professorships though they found opportunities in teacher education and outside academia. In the post-World War II era, even as higher education expanded rapidly, women's representation in the profession declined substantially, influenced by the social climate that promoted women's domesticity and priorities for recruiting men. Academic practices and the consciousness of the few women graduate students reflected this gendered culture. Whether women geographers have valued particular aspects of their work and created distinctive knowledge pose questions for further exploration. A brief look at the practices and meanings of field education over the century suggests that such experience has been important to women, even when attempts have been made to exclude their participation. There are also indications that women geographers disproportionately bring social concerns to the discipline. The paper calls for reflection on the implications of our histories for the profession's future, especially for graduate education.\n      </p>", "The institution of the Readership in Geography at Oxford in 1887 neither represented the commencement of geographical study in the university, nor confirmed the subject in a secure position thereafter. The significance of the Readership lay in the creation of a platform for a charismatic pioneer who, together with others, strove for the revival of geography and the promotion of the subject as an intrinsic element in the country's educational system. Halford Mackinder, with his intuitive conception of a unifying geographical philosophy, presented an account of the scope and methods of geography which promised to furnish the discipline with an independent existence and a robust constitution. His vision has not been realized because geographers have violated the unity of the real world and fragmented their subject. Instead of addressing inherently geographical questions, they have tended to play safe and seek scientific respectability and personal recognition through differentiating between physical and human geography, specializing by subject matter, studying geographical aspects of other disciplines, and inclining towards systematic research pursued by dominantly inductive methods.\n      </p>", "With reference to the history of modern geography in Britain and from assessment of the archives of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS), this paper examines the role of the BAAS in promoting geography from the Association's foundation in 1831 to the 1930s. Particular attention is paid to BAAS Section E (Geography) in the period after 1851. Geography's place is considered with respect to its funding, content and relationship with other sciences, to shifts in its focus - from exploration to what contemporaries termed 'scientific' geography and to the attendant decline in audiences at BAAS geography sessions - and to moments of 'crisis' in geography's epistemological status. In examining extant work on geography's role in the BAAS, a case is made for revision of the current historiographies of 'modern' British geography and questions are raised about the connections between geography and science and the writing of geography's 'disciplinary' and institutional history in the modern period.\n      </p>", "Geographers have paid little attention to the study of federalism, despite the fact that it is the most geographically expressive of all forms of government, and spatial interactions in the functioning of federal States are most easily recognized.Though a particularly complicated form of government based on Western-style democracy, federalism is a dynamic process and not a static phenomenon. Although specially relevant to political geographical study, federalism seems of interest also to social, economic, and historical geographers. Here is a research frontier which provides great scope both for students of regional political geography and for theory-minded political geographers who want to think in terms of concepts.\n      </p>", "Fears have been expressed about the integration of human and physical geography. The arguments for separation include the supposed irrelevance of the physical environment in spatial analysis, the alleged decrease in the importance of the physical environment for human affairs, the increasing need for specialization, the advantages to be gained from outward links, and the lack of success achieved by physical geographers in integrating human processes. These arguments have limited utility, go against many of the traditions of geography and would cause a reduction in the contribution that geographers could make to fundamental world problems.\n      </p>", "Geography, like all other academic disciplines, is fragmented into a large number of specialist communities, within which research occurs and individual careers are structured: Geography is characterized by at least four cleavages. Such fragmentation is necessary to scientific progress, but threatens the discipline's status and funding within academia, hence the attempts to defend Geography's territory within the academic division of labour. Geography's situation may be more acute than that for many other disciplines, because of its multifarious external links.\n      </p>", "Despite the presence of two of the most highly regarded figures in American geography, the geography departments of Columbia University and Teachers College, Columbia did not expand and remain competitive with other geography departments in the first half of the twentieth century. J. Russell Smith of Columbia University and Richard Dodge of Teachers College helped the cause of geography in general in the United States through their excellent textbooks, while neglecting personal research and their own departments. This behaviour established a precedent which continued long after their retirements, causing geography to exist in a dangerous intellectual and political vacuum which eventually resulted in the closure of both departments.\n      </p>", "The National Geographic Society's effort to improve American geography education began in the mid-1980s, fueled by surveys and other evidence of an alarming lack of geographic knowledge among young people. The Geography Education Program has been a multi-pronged campaign that supports, trains, and empowers teachers to make a difference in their own states. It is based on five key strategies: 1) a grassroots network of state alliances of teachers, geography professors, and educational administrators; 2) teacher training at Society- and alliance-sponsored institutes and workshops; 3) development of innovative educational materials; 4) outreach to decision-makers; and 5) increasing public awareness through such vehicles as Geography Awareness Week and the National Geography Bee. The Society also has enlisted other geography organizations, such as the Association of American Geographers, to further their mutual goal. After 10 years of effort and 80 million-dollars spent, the Society is encouraged by many signs of progress, the most significant of which was the October 1994 publication of Geography for Life, National Geography Standards 1994. Its Chairman and President, Gilbert M. Grosvenor, has pledged to continue the campaign until geography illiteracy is eradicated.\n      </p>", "Although mountains have been studied for centuries, they are the subject of only a slender body of formal literature. Instead, those who study high places in specific regions construct working definitions and continually recraft bibliographies. Studies of mountains often focus on comparatively limited themes: physical processes, ecology, or sacred spaces, for example. As scholars become interested in environmental degradation and the development of mountains, there is all the more need to develop a mountain geography literature that expands the study of mountains to include the political, economic, cultural, and social dimensions of their environments and peoples. Three areas-cultural geography, political ecology, and conservation theory-are suggested for additional research.\n      </p>", "Until the 1960s Canadian school geography suffered from inadequate textbooks and a lack of trained teachers. After that date the growth of university geography departments, the establishment of geography teachers' associations, and the publication of many good textbooks and other teaching materials ensured geography an important role in the high schools of most provinces. New geography curricula built on established strengths in regional geography rather than reflecting developments in spatial theory. A comparison of the high school geography programs of Ontario and Quebec illustrates two different but equally valid approaches toward curriculum planning. In Ontario, the Ministry of Education establishes broad guidelines within which teachers are expected to develop distinctive courses. The Quebec Ministry of Education is more prescriptive and defines programs in terms of detailed objectives. In both places, as in several other Canadian provinces, geography's strength derives from the commitment of geography specialists working as teachers and as Ministry program planners.\n      </p>", "Geographers have a six-fold responsibility: to truth and scientific integrity; to the discipline of geography, a body of knowledge and a corps of people; to the physical environment; to our communities; to our society; and to humanity. Those responsibilities are difficult to keep, and the attempt to do so may engender personal and disciplinary conflicts.\n      </p>", "This article addresses and connects two areas of controversy within contemporary geography: the parochialism of contemporary human geography and the gulf between university and non-university geography. It is argued that we can find the cause of the latter phenomenon in the origin of the former, namely in academic geography's unwillingness to re-imagine the 'global claim' that it has inherited from its imperial past. This difficulty has created the conditions for the representation of popular geography as intrinsically dated, as politically suspect and/or as mere 'traveller's tales'. It is suggested that geography cannot escape the burden of its global claim. Rather it needs to critically engage this formerly imperial paradigm and, in so doing, re-ignite geography's role in public debate and as public knowledge.\n      </p>", "This paper reflects on the postmodern challenge to human geography. We add another voice to the conversation, namely Ludwig Wittgenstein. We discuss his philosophy in terms of its application to human geography.\n      </p>", "Today's distinctive environmental consciousness, and the requirements of the National Curriculum in geography that partly stem from it, make it more important than ever for geographers to tackle the research problems on the common ground where human and physical geography overlap. Amongst many research imperatives, there are at least three that geographers can and should embrace enthusiastically on the basis of their skills and experience: the exploration and audit of environmental conditions prior to environmental policy formulation; the study of human-physical links relating to environmental issues within institutional contexts; and the evaluation of historical environmental change and management.\n      </p>", "Humanistic geography is often criticized for its weak methodology. I shall argue that pragmatism, a neglected humanistic philosophy, can provide a sound epistemological framework in which to organize and strengthen this methodology. Pragmatism influenced Robert Park, an important figure in the history of urban social geography, whose tentative methodological beginnings can be traced to their more logical exposition in British social anthropology. The development of pragmatic method also proves significant for four related concerns central to human geography. They are the structure-agency debate and the notion of structuration, the ethics of inquiry, the relationship between experience and action, and the tenuous link between intellect and the world of common sense.\n      </p>", "The primary argument put forth is that the employment and research frontier for geography lies in the non-academic sectors of the economy-local and federal employment, the private sector and the school system. To expand opportunities in those sectors, as well as to strengthen academic geography, the profession must create an unambiguous image through relevant, clearly written research on significant issues. Geographers in all sectors must play a role in exploring the frontier by appropriately training students, applying our tools and methods to significant problems, heightening awareness of the value of geographical analysis among decision-makers in non-academic sectors, and creating a clear and important image of geography for the Public.\n      </p>", "The fortieth anniversary of Ralph Brown's Historical Geography of the United States provides an appropriate occasion to review some of the accomplishments and status of North American historical geography. This small but expanding field has produced a very substantial literature, including several new landmark publications during the past year. Historical geographers have earned high respect in the large world of historical scholarship and are participating in the general reassessment of national histories. They have also been successfully reaching out to a broader public. However, despite such accomplishments and recognition outside geography, historical geography is seriously underrepresented in academic departments. Overcoming that incongruity is one of the obvious and essential ways of strengthening the dangerously weak field of American geography in general.\n      </p>", "This article examines how the practice of learning geography, and the arenas in which knowledge-making takes place, can be usefully positioned within changing histories of the discipline. It contends that networks of action - understood through the intersection of social sites, subjects and sources - present a conceptual framework and narrative focus for the re-consideration of specific episodes from geography's past. The interventions made here are informed and illustrated by a 'small story' about the doing of geography. Based on different personal accounts, the story revives a series of events, encounters, dialogues and images dating back to the winter of 1951 at Glenmore Lodge, Scotland. This educational institution in the Cairngorm mountains offered children from urban areas the opportunity to learn field studies and the skills of 'outdoor citizenship\". Initially, the focus falls on Margaret Jack, a 14-year-old field-course participant. Her learning experiences are traced through personal letters, a diary and a field journal dating from that time, and her recent recollections of this event. Margaret's account dovetails with the story of her field studies instructor, Robin Murray. Robin's role is traced through his learning experiences as a geography undergraduate at Aberdeen University, and the recent recollections of Catriona Murray, his wife.\n      </p>", "Drawing directly on the simplistic core-periphery development model, it is argued that British Geography has been characterized by essentially similar dichotomous thinking. Thus, that part of Geography which deals with the Euro-North American orbit has implicitly been defined as the 'core', whilst the study of poorer societies has been assigned the status of 'periphery'. It is shown that this unproductive schism has been apparent over the last 50 years and displays little sign of abatement as we enter the new millennium. Four key requirements for the emergence of much-needed enhanced links between development geography and other areas of the discipline are enumerated. In conclusion, the concept of 'responsibility to distant geographies' is advanced.\n      </p>", "After modest but optimistic expansion in the 1940s, the geography program at Harvard University was suddenly terminated in 1948, touching off a widely publicized \"academic war over the field of geography.\" It was a severe blow to the discipline, not only because of Harvard's position in American education but because in the course of the closure the President of Harvard University suggested that geography was not an appropriate university subject. The disciplinary history of the Harvard episode is dominated by oral accounts and discussions of personalities, but a more detached archival reconstruction of events is necessary today, if only to reclaim what actually occurred and thereby to allow us to understand it less defensively. For whatever the role of specific personalities, and Isaiah Bowman appears to have been more instrumental than is generally realized, there is a larger question concerning the vulnerability of geography, at Harvard and elsewhere. In the course of the termination and reconsideration of geography at Harvard, several key issues emerged concerning the efficacy of the discipline, and these are still relevant today. While this is mainly a historical reconstruction, therefore, it also touches on themes of contemporary relevance. For it may be that today as well as in Harvard in 1948, the discipline itself bears some responsibility for the failures that occur.\n      </p>", "Economic geographies of Asia are highly fascinating, not the least because Asia has increasingly emerged as a significant economic player in all spheres of global competition: production, consumption, and circulation. This dynamic mosaic of economic landscapes in Asia was further complicated during the 1997-1998 economic crisis and thereafter. While some aspects of these economic geographies of Asia have already received research attention, many complex economic geographic processes in Asia have been undertheorized in the literature. This agenda-setting article makes two critical observations. First, the theorization of dynamic economic changes in Asia needs to be more critical of economic geography theories developed elsewhere in the Anglo-American context. The Asian case may significantly challenge existing theories in economic geography. Second, certain geographic processes in Asia require fundamentally new approaches to theorization that may contribute to the development of broader theories in economic geography. The economic dynamism of Asia has provided a useful site for the development of theory and empirical understanding in contemporary economic geography. To support our arguments and observations, we discuss the situatedness and specificity of influential theories of economic geography and offer some constructive suggestions for an intellectual agenda for developing new theories in economic geography.\n      </p>", "This paper considers alternative ways to approach teaching and researching the history and philosophy of geography. While exploring the geography department as a previously marginalized space in accounts of disciplinary change, three different types of source are identified: first, less formal kinds of documentation; second, material sites; and third, a bodily archive of action, gesture and movement. In combination, these are shown to open up new possibilities for localized, grass-roots versions of geography's pasts and presents.\n      </p>", "The development of the 5-16 National Curriculum for England and Wales, 1987-95, is described with particular reference to the position of geography. An original formulation for geography was altered by an incoming Minister; general concerns about the curriculum led to a subsequent overall review led by Sir Ron Dearing. The benefits and disadvantages of the Revised National Curriculum are considered for geography; the Dearing revision which excludes geography from Key Stage 4 (14-16) may have serious long-term consequences for the subject.\n      </p>", "In this paper, I argue in favour of regarding human geography as part of the social theory movement. By confronting the intellectual disarray in human geography, and addressing the challenge of postmodernism and deconstruction, the discipline could attain a pivotal role in the social sciences and humanities.\n      </p>", "An analytical objective human geography is possible without theory. The idealist philosophy can be used to draw a sharp distinction between the explanation of rational human actions and other phenomena. A rational human action is explained by reconstructing the thought behind it. The human geographer has no need of his own theories, because he is concerned with the theories expressed in the actions of those being investigated. Procedures for testing the worth of an idealist interpretation of a set of actions are just as appropriate, objective, rigorous, and intellectually responsible as those advocated by positivist philosophers for theoretical explanations.\n      </p>", "In seventeenth-century England, education was the prerogative of a nascent gentleman, so that he might, in Henry Peacham's words, make himself \"beneficiall and usefull to his Country.\" In such an education, according to John Locke, \"the reading of history, chronology and geography are absolutely necessary.\" I describe the content and place of geographical education as they were understood by seventeenth-century writers such as Peacham, Locke, and John Milton and relate them to the political economy of seventeenth-century England. I argue, in Thomas Hobbes's words, that \"knowledge of the face of the earth\" assumed its modern importance because the size and geographical complexity of states increased and that attainment of this knowledge was, as it remains, a prerequisite for access to political power.\n      </p>", "Debate continues about the inter-relationships between human and physical geography and their different research and publication practices. Relatively little data about these are available, however. Using an analysis of all publications submitted by UK geographers to the 2001 Research Assessment Exercise, this paper identifies a substantial difference between human and physical geographers in their publication strategies. Most physical geographers place their research papers in specialized inter-disciplinary journals and make relatively little use of geography outlets: most human geographers, on the other hand, publish in geography journals. Comparisons with other disciplines - in the earth and environmental and social sciences respectively - also identify differences between geographers and their peers. The overall conclusion is that, with regard to research and publication at least, UK geography cannot be presented as a single academic community with strong internal ties, but rather as a conglomerate of separate communities writing for different audiences.\n      </p>", "I study a model of geopolitical organization endogenizing the size of nations, their public spending and their degree of openness. The optimal geography may not be a stable equilibrium and a bias toward too many countries tends to emerge. An exogenous increase in openness tends to reduce the size of countries but also to increase the size of their public sectors. When openness is endogenous there can be multiple equilibria, some with globalization backlash associated with large nations and small governments and others with smaller countries, bigger governments and high openness. However, stable equilibria may imply excessive globalization, too many countries and too much government spending.\n      </p>", "This paper is a short report on concepts, methods, definitions and fields of geographical research into tourism and recreation in the GDR. Main centres of research are the Dresden College of Transport, the Dresden College of Education and the Geography sections of the Universities of Berlin and Greifswald. After the Dresden Conference on Geography of Tourism in 1965 the Greifswald Geographical Symposium on Recreational Geography in 1978 was the second decisive GDR conference. Than it became quite clear that the emphasis in research has shifted from tourism to territorial problems of recreation, primarily the various forms of outdoor recreation. The theoretical approach is shown as Greifswald model of recreational geography (Fig 1).\n      </p>", "At the annual conference of the Institute in January 1986, held at the University of Reading, the History and Philosophy of Geography Study Group organized a symposium on the subject of 'The Unity of Geography', at which four papers were presented and discussed.

Readers can thereby appreciate the full context of the individual papers, and can respond to them as a whole as well as a set of parts.\n      </p>", "If the social relations and inherited configuration of production were at the core of economic geography a decade ago, these aspects of the world are increasingly taken for granted. The global scope of industry and corporate strategy has claimed increasing attention over the past decade. And while any 'new' economic geography must have something to say about the nature of human agency and the role of institutions in structuring the landscape, care must be taken not to exaggerate their significance for constructive interaction. In point of fact, the global finance industry is an essential lens through which to study contemporary capitalism from the top-down and the bottom-up. If we are to understand the economic landscape of twenty-first century capitalism, it should be understood through global financial institutions, its social formations and investment practices. This argument is developed by reference to the recent literature on the geography of finance and a metaphor - money flows like mercury - designed to explicate the spatial and temporal logic of global capital flows. Some may dispute this argument, but in doing so they lament the passing of an era rather than advancing a convincing counterclaim about how the world is and what it might become. All this means that we have to rethink the significance of geographical scale and organizational processes as opposed to an unquestioned commitment to localities.\n      </p>", "In every theory and worldview there are subjective and contextual elements. While knowledge is embedded and rooted in socio-spatial contexts, it is also located in the bodies of researchers and travels with them. A travelling theory of knowledge is based on several context-sensitive theories and concepts.

Kant as a person and his work is seen in the Estonian societal and academic context.\n      </p>", "The 1988 Education Reform Act established geography as a 'foundation subject' in the 5-16 National Curriculum. In so doing it reversed a long decline in school geography. This new and generally favourable position for the subject was achieved by dint of unprecedented political exertions on the part of the whole geographical community and particularly through interventions by The Geographical Association in the national debate about education which began in 1976. This paper places that debate in the perspective of educational developments since the 1944 Education Act. It argues that the changing fortunes of school geography in this period resulted from the provisions of that Act, from the reorganization of teacher training and from the timing of reforms within geography itself. The value of modern geography as a medium of general education is explained; and some observations are made which may be useful in promoting the cause of geography in schools in a still-uncertain future.\n      </p>", "Geography has already had a substantial impact on national policymaking, but the unrealized potential is even greater. Since World War II, geographers have played important roles in a great many federal agencies, and other geographers outside the federal service have been leaders in such arenas as environmental and urban policy. Besides some personal characteristics that make many geographers useful, the main reason is that public policymaking in the United States is exquisitely geographic at the national level. As it is presently structured, however, our policymaking system has a limited capacity to find out the geographic import of the policy options it considers; this complicates interactions between the executive and legislative branches of the government. At a time when society expects policy to be arrived at pluralistically and when a great many of our policy debates involve relationships between one's location and one's legitimate vested interest, geographers have a remarkable opportunity to build roles for their perspectives and skills into new policymaking structures that are evolving.\n      </p>", "British human geographers have disengaged themselves from the study of large areas of the world: they have become parochial and myopic in their research and teaching. This must be changed, and more work must be done on other societies, to reduce geographical ignorance within society and thereby promote world understanding. To do this, regional geography must be revived, not it its traditional focus on singular places but through the study of the unique characteristics of regions that result from the interaction of general economic processes with individual decision-making agents acting in their cultural contexts.\n      </p>", "Domosh (1991) proposes that a specifically feminist historiography of geography needs to be developed. In support, in addition to general remarks about 'the post-modern turn', she cites several women travellers who made no contribution in their time to the emergence of the discipline and most of whom are long forgotten. There are several mainstream women professional geographers who repay investigation, but there is no advantage in labelling such studies 'feminist' simply because the subjects are women. The case for a feminist historiography of geography has not been made.\n      </p>", "This paper is a sociological study of British geography in the mid-1990s. Drawing upon interviews with 40 academic geographers, it considers themes of competition and regulation, and disciplinary and patriarchal power.

This picture brings into focus the North/South gap that has yet again emerged, this time in gender differences in mortality. Particular attention is given to mortality from those causes that would appear to depend on the geographical context and that have a greater role to play in overall mortality differences. We then define which causes of death have changed the geographic pattern in the period considered.

We explore these experiences through interviews and surveys with a sample of early-career faculty in postsecondary American geography. Our analysis reveals that teaching is the primary source of anxiety among new professors, many of whom begin their first academic positions with little or no preparation in learning theory, course design, or pedagogy. Many new faculty members struggle to maintain healthy personal and family lives, while adjusting to unfamiliar norms of their new institutions. New professors benefit from support offered by their department chairpersons and from working in collegial environments. Among women, we found a greater sense of self-doubt about their scholarly abilities and futures despite having records comparable in accomplishment to their male peers. Many women cope with this sense of marginalization by forming supportive mentoring relationships with other women faculty on campus and through disciplinary specialty groups. Networking with colleagues on campus and at academic conferences enhances the job performance and satisfaction of all faculty members irrespective of gender. Our findings underscore the importance of examining the social, professional, and disciplinary contexts of higher education to acquire a broader understanding of faculty development. This knowledge can help departments prepare new faculty for successful and satisfying academic careers.\n      </p>", "Data on United States college level enrollment in all geography courses and in Latin America regional courses were extracted from Schwendeman's Directory of College Geography of the United States. A preliminary analysis indicated that, while total geography enrollment between 1977 and 1989 increased by 8.3 percent, the number of students in courses titled The Geography of \"South America,\" \"Middle America and/or Caribbean,\" or \"Latin America\" expanded by 39 percent. Most of the growth took place because of greater numbers at established programs. Of the observations included in the study, the number of schools offering courses on Latin America decreased from 101 in 1977 to 88 in 1989.\n      </p>", "In this paper, I argue that 'new models' of human geography have produced a one-sided account of society and space; and that this is because of their conceptual splitting of 'the social' into structure and agency. The essay begins with a discussion of the search for the self conducted by humanistic geographers, then describes the marginalization of this search in the early 1980s and the subsequent development of humanistic and historical materialist geography. I show that each has developed its own variant of the same understanding of the relationship between structure and agency. I suggest that it is inconceivable that the self can be understood, and therefore that a truly human geography can be imagined, without drawing on the insights of psychoanalysis because it offers a theory of the self which neither denies, nor relies on, a structure-agency dichotomy. Finally, I demonstrate psychoanalysis's deeper understanding of the self by returning to themes already raised by geographers, but concentrating on two aspects of the (fragmented) self: the 'unknowing' subject, and subject formation.\n      </p>", "In the middle of this century, there was considerable support for the identification of Geography as the study of landscape. Subsequently, Geography and landscape history have developed close yet separate existences, with landscape history flourishing as an 'interdisciplinary discipline'. During the second half of the twentieth century, several of the landmark articles appeared in The Geographical Journal, where the key books were generally reviewed. This paper serves as a retrospective, charting the contribution of the Journal in the development of landscape history, outlining the current interpretations applied to rural settlements, colonization and field systems, and tracing the development of landscape studies.\n      </p>", "In this article, I reflect upon and attempt to understand the changing theoretical nature of post-World War II Anglo-American economic geography. In particular, I contrast the kind of theorizing that first occurred in the discipline during the 1950s with the very different kind now carried out under what has been called the \"cultural turn\" or the \"new economic geography.\" I argue that, during this transition, not only did the use of specific theories alter, but the very idea and practice of theorization also changed. I characterize the phases of this movement by using the terms \"epistemological\" and \"hermeneutic theorizing,\" defined on the basis of works by pragmatist philosopher Richard Rorty and science studies writer Donna Haraway. I argue that \"epistemological theorizing\" best describes the first period of theorization in the discipline around the quantitative revolution of the late 1950s and early 1960s, and that it is bound by the quest for accurate (mirror) representation. In contrast, hermeneutic theorizing describes the kind of theorizing found in the new economic geography, marked by an interpretive mode of inquiry that is reflexive, open-ended, and catholic in its theoretical sources.\n      </p>", "This article examines the development of the World Social Forum (WSF) using theoretical arguments that have emerged from the new economic geography. In particular, it draws on the critique of economistic accounts of globalization by Richa Nagar, Victoria Lawson, Linda McDowell, and Susan Hanson to evaluate how far the WSF serves to move beyond institutional, spatial, and personal barriers that often limit academic debate over neoliberalism and global economic change. Following this critique, the authors evaluate how far the criticisms of neoliberalism that have been articulated at the WSF transcend traditional barriers to inclusion in debates and struggles over globalization. As such, the article examines the degree to which the WSF allows for (1) informal economic spheres to be considered and connected to formal economic developments, such as the Free Trade Area of the Americas; (2) excluded spaces and places to be discussed and involved; and (3) excluded actors and subjects to be both represented and included in the debates. The conclusions point to the limits of what has been accomplished at the WSF, but also underline the progress that it represents toward modeling a more socially, culturally, and internationally inclusive critique of neoliberal globalization for economic geographers.\n      </p>", "Recent attempts to contextualize the history of geography have ignored the gendered construction of much of that history, while arguments for a post-modern human geography have ignored feminist theory. By examining the stories of Victorian women explorers, this essay suggests how women have contributed to the formation of geographic knowledge, and, by implication, asks what can be learned by considering the contribution of women's ways of knowing to our reconstruction of human geography.\n      </p>", "The recent decline in fieldwork provision in UK schools has partly been attributed to false perceptions of risk among teachers. This paper examines a case study based on geography teachers' perceptions from six state secondary schools in a northern English city. The research shows that owing to the inherent subjectivity of risk perception, these teachers' perceptions of fieldwork risk cannot be dismissed as false. Furthermore, it is argued that owing to the implicit, but powerful, spatialities of teachers' imaginations of fieldwork, these teachers will first need to re-evaluate the role and value of fieldwork before they are willing to re-enter the field.\n      </p>", "In the changed intellectual climate since historical geography emerged as a substantial geographical subfield, issues of power and modernity have come much to the fore. For Michel Foucault, power is less a property than a strategy and is widely distributed in cultural discourses and their settings. For Jurgen Habermas, modernity imposes a distinctive context of communications that undermines the stability of traditional lifeworlds and holds out a largely unfulfilled promise of rationality. For Anthony Giddens, the agency and settings of power cannot be conceptualized separately, nor can the emergence of modernity be understood apart from the changing reach and geographical configuration of power. For Michael Mann, a history of social power turns necessarily on an analysis of power's networks, logistics, and spatial contours. Such ideas about power and modernity emphasize the importance of a historical geography that is both immersed in data and sensitive to general literatures. A growing conversation between historical geography and parts of social theory would enrich both, while drawing historical geography into much closer association with the rest of human geography.\n      </p>", "A discipline's changing agenda involves the introduction of new practices which challenge those already deployed and may at least partly replace them. Historians of human geography have identified several major changes over recent decades but have been less successful in accounting for them. This paper adopts a recently-formulated model of disciplinary change, to which it adds a missing political element. It argues for the importance of mobilizing support for a new agenda among students and other new entrants to the discipline, in which textbooks can play a substantial role. Several recently-published texts are analysed to illustrate their use as political tools in attempts to promote particular visions of human geographical practices.\n      </p>", "The increasing concentration of power in academic disciplines with the introduction of Research Assessment Exercises is noted.

Too much fantasy, however, can lead to isolation, to a frivolous and-ultimately-insane existence. Art, history, and geography are three intellectual-imaginative projects, all of which are imbued with varying degrees of realism and fantasy. Art, predictably, is most favorably inclined toward the uninhibited imagination: we see fantasy in the paintings of young children and playfulness in much of the works of contemporary artists. Nevertheless, in the West, art has also favored realism-that is, optical fidelity-throughout the early modern period. Treatments of the past come second in their hospitality to flights of the imagination: a consciousness of the past may give rise in one people to realistic narratives (history), but in another people, it can generate fantastic myths and legends without risking their physical survival or even their cultural efflorescence. Geography, in contrast to representational art and accurate history, is necessary to survival. Geography is universally realistic. Yet it is also rich in fantasy. Realism and fantasy are constituent elements of the human world. Geography, for all its realism, would be a sterile subject without the occasional tug of fantasy and a useless subject without, in some sense, a prognostication of \"utopia\" in it. The nature of geography can be illuminated in a variety of ways. One way is to compare it with the aspirations and achievements of art and history.\n      </p>", "Geography as an integral branch of knowledge has suffered by an increasing division both between physical and human geography and between specialisms within each. It is argued that neither physical nor human geography has a viable independent existence, but in the absence of a unified geography will disintegrate into component specialisms at risk of absorption by neighbouring disciplines. The case is made for a unified geography, derived from Forster and reinforced by the social commitment of Kropotkin, and the argument is illustrated by a consideration of population, resources and environmental hazard in coastal Bangladesh, the geography of which cannot be comprehended without a simultaneous consideration of both physical and human conditions. The nature of a unified and committed geography provides criteria for the selection of significant and critical problems for research, in place of the trivia too often studied, and thus supplies an agenda for the future.\n      </p>", "Cultural geography might benefit from consideration of radical behaviourism and from interpretation and application of the concepts of behaviour analysis. The basic concept is that of operant conditioning, referring to the environment reinforcing behaviours that are most adaptive and effective in achieving reinforcers and avoiding aversive stimuli. The concept of rule-governed behaviour facilitates incorporation of cognition into behaviour analyses, accommodating the fact that many consequences are delayed. These concepts are applied in an analysis of nineteenth-century Mormon settlement in the American West. This argument for an objectivist approach is laden with social scientific baggage not favoured in contemporary cultural geography.\n      </p>", "Fieldwork in geography has come under close scrutiny from feminist and postcolonial scholars in recent years. In relation to physical geography, commentators have pointed to a range of practices and images (notably the 'heroic', masculinist 'ideal') that have acted to deter and exclude women, from undergraduates to senior academics. For some, fieldwork is one of the key sites of gender discrimination for women in physical geography. This paper starts from a position of agreement with many of these critiques, but also seeks to 'reclaim' some more positive accounts and perspectives on the subject. In doing so, it aims to critique and disrupt the dominant image of physical geography fieldwork as essentially a masculinist endeavour, and encourage a wider view of the challenges and pleasures of fieldwork for women in physical geography.\n      </p>", "This study explores the disjunction between notions of religious space in the textual tradition and the construction of sacred geography on the ground. It does this by examining some elements that make up the sacred geography of medieval Ballabgarh, the northern segment of Faridabad which shares its northern border with Delhi. The paper argues that religious structures like temples and mosques which are generally regarded as constituent components of Hindu and Muslim sacred geography were not an integral part of village geography. Where they were present, the components of commemoration could be varied, animated by elements of local and clan history, rather than scriptural notions of cosmic space. Moreover, much of what was central to folk worship - open air village shrines, anonymous graves of pirs, 'miraculous' trees, a local goddess of the floods - is not textually imaged. Consequently, Ballabgarh's religious geography can be constituted only through the microcosm of archaeology and oral history.\n      </p>", "Some characteristics of geography within the UK Higher Educational system are described, using data from both sides of the binary line. It is shown that the subject is dominated by attention to teaching, and that much greater emphasis is needed on research if it is to continue to be well-resourced in the next decade. Several suggestions are made for action by the Institute towards this end. Finally, attention is drawn to the support which can be offered by past geography graduates.\n      </p>", "The subject of geography is declining in popularity at secondary school level and recent developments following the 'cultural turn' in Higher Education have had little impact in revitalising it.

Commendably, these writers have advanced cultural research in several important ways, yet in the process their critique of their academic forebears has increasingly moved off-the-mark. The leaders of the new cultural geography depict the scholarship of the Berkeley school as static, empiricist, and obsessed with relict land-scapes and material artifacts, when in fact it was, and is still, dynamic, predominantly historicist, and interested primarily in the relationships between diverse human societies and their natural environments. Furthermore, despite the claims of their detractors, few if any \"traditional\" cultural geographers have ever conceptualized culture as a superorganic structure. Cultural geography-old-fashioned or avant-garde-has always been a pluralistic endeavor ultimately oriented to empirical issues. In the end, only a genuine acceptance of methodological and thematic diversity will allow a true revitalization, rather than a reinvention, of the field.\n      </p>", "Little is known about housing market processes and residential patterns in North American cities, 1900-1940. The experience of Toronto, Ontario contradicts the prevailing assumption that in this period suburbs were middle class and that low income households occupied older housing that had filtered down. In Toronto, rapid growth after 1900 created a pattern in 1913 whereby workers were concentrated in the old city core and in a new suburban ring. Filtering was of limited extent. Encouraged by extensive land subdivision and the absence of building regulation, workers' families built their own homes beyond city limits. The residential and tenurial instability of these unplanned suburban districts point to future problems. Toronto's experience was typical of Canadian cities west of Quebec, of US cities in the western and midwestern states, and of cities in Australia and Argentina. It challenges us to be more flexible in the way we conceptualize the housing market under capitalism and to be more specific about the contexts within which particular theories are valid.\n      </p>", "In this paper I describe and question some of the basic premises, beliefs, and values implicit in the geography of crime. The critique focuses on the analytic separation of crime and the control of crime, a separation that has informed most geographic research on crime. Using an instrumentalist methodology, geographers have studied crime, law, and the judicial system without any systematic consideration of the impact of the control system on crime patterns. A discussion of interactionist and critical perspectives in criminology raises questions about the correctionalist impulse of much of the geography of crime, the prima facie interpretation of official crime statistics guiding it, the hypostatization of criminal behavior informing it, and the general consequences of a perspective that abstracts crime from its sociolegal context. The paper outlines several strategies for developing an integrated analysis of crime and control.\n      </p>", "Geography has a relatively modest role in adult education; many geographers would argue unjustifiably so in view of its potential contribution to the liberal education of adults. Adult education courses in geography focus on traditional areas like the physical basis of the landscape and the development of the human landscape but more courses could be run in these and other areas. There are problems of both demand and supply: the public image of the subject limits demand; and too few geographers offer courses. Individual geographers, geography departments and professional associations all have a part to play in promoting the subject.\n      </p>", "This article considers something of the relationships between the ordering of geographical knowledge, classification as an intellectual enterprise and the place of geography in (the) Enlightenment. Particular consideration is given to the situated position of geography within the two major modern encyclopaedias of the eighteenth century: Ephraim Chambers' Cyclopaedia (1728) and Diderot and d'Alembert's Encyclop\u00e9die (1751-65). A final section examines connections between encyclopaedism, geography and 'high' modernism in the writing of H G Wells. Three principal claims are made and examined: the ontological ordering of the discipline in encyclopaedias, dictionaries and universal grammars should be considered an important part of geography's history; ideas of reasoned utility and modernity that have been held to distinguish 'the Enlightenment project' must themselves be historically and socially situated; and the 'universal geography' texts of the 1700s should be seen as part of attempts to order all knowledge as socially useful.\n      </p>", "Changes in British government transport policy since 1979 are likely to have significant effects on transport geography. The policies of privatization and deregulation are analysed with respect to land-based transport industries against the background of financial constraints on transport operators and local authorities.

The subsequent use of this enumeration geography for diverse purposes has been problematic but unavoidable. This paper examines how new digital spatial data and GIS technology are making possible the creation of separate geographies of the 2001 Census for data collection, validation, output, specification and use. The paper explores the implications of these changes for the development of a national spatial data infrastructure and for geographical research involving the census more generally.\n      </p>", "This paper provides a discussion of Massey's (1999) account of the role of space-time in human and physical geography. Recognizing the relative (but not absolute) paucity of comment from physical geographers on questions of approach and method, the paper seeks to demonstrate three things. First, it casts a history of a narrow part of geomorphology in a similar vein to a part of human geography to demonstrate that it is possible to find strong shared characteristics in the ways in which the two subjects are being approached. This emphasizes the importance of analyses that recognize both space and time in seeking explanation in physical geography and which has important implications for: (i) the nature of laws and processes in geomorphology; and hence (ii) the interpretation of specific landforms and their histories. Second, the paper argues that much of what Massey addresses relates to the closure required to make things amenable to study, something that is characteristic of almost every type of research. This has long been acknowledged in science in general and in physical geography in particular, but is often forgotten. Third, the paper uses this consideration of closure to address the issue of the relational nature of different sorts of space-time models. Following Massey's argument that the sort of space-time model that we adopt needs to be informed by the entities that we study, the paper concludes that some of the space-time models that Massey critiques (e.g. classical Newtonian mechanics) may still be fundamental to what we do, and in no sense necessarily ahistorical.\n      </p>", "Aim: To distinguish the effects of physical geography and socioeconomic conditions on the extinction of butterflies in European states, and to compare patterns influencing extinctions with patterns influencing species richness. Location: Europe. Method: Per-state species richness and extinctions were taken from the Red Data Book of European Butterflies, and their relationships with physical geography and socioeconomic predictors were analysed using regression analysis. Two hypothesis were explored: (1) extinctions are related primarily to identical physical geography factors that influence species richness; and (2) extinctions are influenced primarily by human pressure on natural biotopes and follow correlates of modern land use. Results: Extinctions and richness are not correlated. Richness increased towards low latitudes and with biotope and topographic heterogeneity, and decreased in states affected by Quaternary glaciation and on islands. The only socioeconomic correlate was human density, exhibiting a weak negative effect. Extinctions were negatively correlated with area and with biotope and topographic heterogeneity. They peaked in regions with mild climate in central latitudes. The strongest socioeconomic correlate was high density of railways, interpreted as a proxy of early industrialization. Further correlates were human density and urban employment. Main conclusion: Topographic and biotope heterogeneity predicts both high species richness and low extinction rates. Losses of butterflies result from a complex interplay of geography and relatively recent economic history, as low topographic heterogeneity and flat relief favoured the early advent of industrialization and intensive land use.\n      </p>", "Geography's voice within the debates on cosmopolitan citizenship initiated by Martha Nussbaum's 1994 restatement of Stoic cosmopolitanism has been strangely muted, especially given the significance of spatiality and cultural specificity within recent geographical theory. David Harvey's (2000) contribution is an exception, but while his argument that geographical education should be propaedeutic to cosmopolitanism is politically powerful and timely, his presentation of it begs some historical questions. The principal ones concern his neglect of the neo-Stoic tradition in Renaissance geography and his narrow embrace of geography as a political project. This article addresses these issues through an examination of Abraham Ortelius's Theatrum Orbis Terrarum (1570), a distinctly Renaissance cosmographic project of representing the world's unity and diversity. The work is placed in the context of sixteenth-century neo-Stoicism, humanist rhetoric, and the metaphor of the world theater as a moral space. Knowledge of the world theater involves various forms of \"distanciation,\" promoting a quest for wisdom and tolerance of difference. Such geography is primarily a moral project that emphasizes the poetics as much as the politics of reason and understanding. Philosophical ideas and practices relating to global knowledge and vision, molded in the context of the early Roman empire, were reworked in the early years of European (especially Iberian) oceanic empire, and also in the context of religious intolerance within Europe itself. The article argues that geography's own contributions to cosmopolitanism are deeper and more complex than a reading confined to post-Enlightenment disciplinary geography would suggest.\n      </p>", "As part of its work to reform geography teaching in the French state school system, the Commission de l'Enseignement de la G\u00e9ographie (1871-75) collected reports on the nature and status of geography teaching in the schools of several other, mainly European, countries. The information provided by the French Consulate in London is reproduced and discussed as a commentary on the state of geography teaching in Britain at that time. From the information contained in this report and in the minutes of the meetings of the Commission, an attempt is made to identify some of the geography texts and atlases in use in English schools during this period of the nineteenth century.\n      </p>", "Many histories of Geography have documented the successful promotion of the subject by the pioneers, but they provide only one perspective. Confidential internal memoranda of the Board of Education at the Public Record Office give a totally different picture of the struggle. Herbertson, secretary of the Geographical Association, aided by other geographical societies, finally gained recognition for geography in secondary schools in 1905. In 1917 the newly appointed Professor Roxby sought recognition for geography as an advanced subject, but internal memoranda show why his proposal was rejected. Fleure took up the challenge and his successful campaign in 1925 heralded an unparalleled growth of geography in the universities. In the present struggle to retain geography in the curriculum some lessons may be learned from the pioneers' early successes. The Board of Education's memoranda help to remind us of the debt we owe to pioneers such as Herbertson, Roxby and Fleure.\n      </p>", "The geography of gender has become an accepted field of study, but it still lacks a regional approach and has yet to be included in regional geography. From the locality to the world scale, it is desirable for geographers to set gender in its geographical context: regional description and regional comparison are required. In support of existing intensive research, there will be a need for the establishment of systematic data and for some organizing framework such as patriarchal bargains or spatial divisions of labour. Case studies, of the gendering of economic activity and of sex ratios, illustrate both the difficulties and the potential of a regional approach to gender.\n      </p>", "In response to the recent moves by a number of writers to begin the process of deconstructing and postmodernizing contemporary human geography, the paper seeks to caution against the fatal seduction radiated by the twin pillars of interpretation: hermeneutics and dialectics. Drawing upon the work of Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Derrida and F\u00e9lix Guattari, the paper argues that the current fascination with the quadratic nightmare of relativism, textualism, nihilism and perspectivism derives from a confused analysis of narration and signification. The root of this confusion lies in the persistent inability of human geographers to grasp, write and perform the movement of difference. Rather than decompose things, subjects and events into differential fragments, the paper suggests that writing must strive to immerse itself in a myriad of heterogeneous flows. Several consequences erupt from this immersion: first, writing must flatten the feigned separation of world and text by emphasizing its materiality (anti-representation); secondly, writing must hollow the apparently solid and stable ground upon which it rests through the proliferation of fractal and colloidal concepts (anti-hermeneutic); and thirdly, writing must eschew the herding of events into signs through an interminable interruption of narration and signification (antidialectical). As a general principle, the paper attempts to disrupt the rule of representational thought through a performative decompression, deconstruction and provocation of a paranoid called geography.\n      </p>", "The reconceptualization of 'culture' in the 'new cultural geography' has been important for turning attention to processes, politics and interrelationships with other 'spheres' of social life. But for all the important theoretical and empirical advances this reconceptualization has induced, cultural geography still reifies 'culture' and assigns it an ontological and explanatory status. In this paper I argue that such a reification is a fallacy and that cultural geography would be better served by following the 'new cultural geography' to its logical conclusion: a recognition that there is no such (ontological) thing as culture. I argue instead for a focus on the material development of the idea (or ideology) of culture. Such a further reconceptualization of the object of study in cultural geography may be undertaken in many ways but, by way of example, in this paper I suggest only one: how the idea of culture functions within systems of production and reproduction in the contemporary city. Through this example and the discussion that precedes it, I show that the recognition that there is no such thing as culture allows us better to theorize the workings of power in systems of social reproduction.\n      </p>", "Theorizing in economic geography has focused on core regions, industrial and non-industrial, old and new. Indeed, contemplation of the idea of globalization has reinforced this quest. This paper disputes this blinkered thinking that peripheralizes resource peripheries, and seeks to re-position and emphasize resource peripheries within economic geography's theoretical agenda, specifically that associated with the new 'institutional' approach. A truly 'global' economic geography cannot afford to ignore resource peripheries. In particular, we argue that characterizing resource peripheries, and making them distinct from cores, is the intersection of four sets of institutional values or dimensions which we summarize in terms of industralism (economic dimension), environmentalism (environmental dimension), aboriginalism (cultural dimension) and imperialism (geopolitical dimension). This admittedly preliminary framework underlies our hypothesis that resource peripheries around the world have become deeply contested spaces, much more so than those found in cores.\n      </p>", "The evolution of the polytechnics is outlined and the generally accepted aims of polytechnic education summarized. Results of a detailed survey indicate the existing role and status of geography in the polytechnics at the commencement of the 1970-1 academic year. The survey includes data on staffing, students and types of course. Geography varies greatly in importance from one institution to another and a regional imbalance is detected. The resent significance and function of geography are compared with its potential development in polytechnics. There appears to be ample opportunity for expansion of geography especially if it is adapted to varied and vocationally orientated studies as an applied, relevant and integrating subject discipline.\n      </p>", "Although the \"new\" economic geography has explored links between the subdiscipline's traditional areas of study and cultural, institutional, and political realms, environmental issues remain comparatively underresearched within the subdiscipline. This article contends not only that the environment is of key importance to economic geography, but also that economic geographers can make an important contribution to environmental debates, through providing not just a better analysis and theoretical understanding, but also better policy proscription. Rather than claim new intellectual territory, the intention is to suggest potential creative opportunities for linking economic geography's strengths with those insights from other theoretical perspectives. In particular, this article focuses upon linking insights from ecological modernization theory, developed by environmental sociologists, with regulationist approaches.\n      </p>", "We estimate the respective contributions of institutions, geography, and trade in determining income levels around the world, using recently developed instrumental variables for institutions and trade. Our results indicate that the quality of institutions \"trumps\" everything else. Once institutions are controlled for, conventional measures of geography have at best weak direct effects on incomes, although they have a strong indirect effect by influencing the quality of institutions. Similarly, once institutions are controlled for, trade is almost always insignificant, and often enters the income equation with the \"wrong\" (i.e., negative) sign. We relate our results to recent literature, and where differences exist, trace their origins to choices on samples, specification, and instrumentation.\n      </p>", "Knowledge-which is closely linked to firm innovativeness-is accessed across organizational boundaries and geographic space via networks operating at different levels of analysis. However, we know tantalizingly little about the comparative influence of geography on knowledge flow across organizational boundaries over different types of ties, despite warnings that research needs to account for the geographic context of ties to fully understand causal relationships. Using a combination of primary and secondary data on 77 Canadian mutual fund companies, we find that institutional-level ties are valuable in knowledge transmission only when such ties are geographically proximate. Organization-level ties fail to act as transmitters of knowledge, regardless of geographic location. Interestingly, we find that geographically distant individual-level friendship ties are superior conduits for knowledge flow, which suggests they span \"geographic holes.\"\n      </p>", "This paper examines the progress of education publishing for geography over the past 30 years. It traces the evolution and interaction of a series of philosophical, moral and technological movements including the rise of positivism and quantitative geography, humanism, radicalism and computers. It also devotes attention to the key roles played by certain individuals, publishing houses, journals that came (and went) and curricularprojects like the American High School Geography Project and Geography for the Young School Leaver. The prospect for the 1990s is one of greater government involvement, as exemplified in the National Curriculum.\n      </p>", "This critical history of geography looks to the political concepts that historical actors held and analyzes the incorporation of these concepts into geography. Peter Heylyn, who politicized his geographical books Microcosmus (1621) and, still more, Cosmographie (1657), followed William Laud's characteristic brand of High Church Anglicanism, avowedly hostile both to Roman Catholicism and to Calvinist forms of Protestantism, while upholding an ideal of the Church of England as both independent and apostolic. Further, Laudians were stalwart defendants of monarchy as a divine institution. This Laudian vision of church and state informed Heylyn's geographical works, which goes against a received wisdom that they are divorced from his polemical historical, political, and theological tracts. We thus recover the politics of early modern geography as contemporaries might have understood them.\n      </p>", "This essay considers the 'geographical imagination' in inter-war Britain, focusing on the movement for regional survey inspired by Patrick Geddes. After arguing that this movement and period has been inadequately considered in most histories of geography, Geddes' Outlook Tower in Edinburgh is described to introduce the broader themes of 'outlook geography' with which the essay is concerned. The history and aims of regional survey are then explored, and the means used to present the survey are detailed. The particular kind of 'local knowledge' embodied by the survey and the kind of citizenship it was intended to promote are outlined. The essay concludes with some broader considerations of the role of geography as a social practice and the particular geographical imagination suggested by survey.\n      </p>", "The field of academic geography is poised at a pivotal moment-a moment compounded of equal measures of crisis, challenge, and opportunity-as it redefines its relationship to the American educational system, pre-school through post-collegiate. The crisis is reflected in the murmur of threats to the survival of geography departments in American colleges and universities; the challenge is presented by the widespread public acceptance of the need for increased geographic understanding and the opportunity comes from the development and implementation of voluntary National Geography Content Standards for K-12 geography education. If we, as professional geographers, are to respond convincingly to the federal mandated education goal that all American students demonstrate competency in geography by the year 2000, then we must understand the processes of being and becoming a geographer. Systematic (i.e., empirical and theoretical) understanding of those processes is in large measure lacking. Therefore, if professional geographers wish to meet the challenge and take advantage of the opportunity, we must develop and execute a program of research on developing competency in geography. Using Carl Sauer's classic article, The Education of a Geographer, as a foil, I present a research agenda for geography education. The agenda uses two frameworks-life-span development and novice-expert mastery-to define competency as geographic expertise and to identity six research questions about the character, genesis, nature, ontogenesis, identification, and the training of geographic expertise. I draw upon ideas from developmental psychology, cognitive science, education, and geography to analyze the meaning, significance, and implications of each question for understanding what is entailed in being and becoming geographically competent. Shaping the next generation of geographically competent people requires that we, as professional geographers, commit ourselves now to a systematic program of research in geography education. Such a commitment is in our communal self interest for survival and growth as an academic field, and of personal interest for understanding how and why we became professional geographers.\n      </p>", "One of the many key questions in the political economy of globalization concerns the implications of this broad trend for forms of collective identity and the associated shapes and strengths of communities in the contemporary world system. Globalization - conceived here in a distinctly geographical sense as the rise of supraterritoriality - has contributed to a general shift over recent decades away from a situation thoroughly dominated by national identities. Globalization has helped to reinvigorate or newly invent a host of substate localisms as well as a diverse array of transborder solidarities. Concurrently, recent moves away from territorialist geography have in other respects reproduced the nationality principle and have also prompted a number of nationalist reactions. These different and often contradictory tendencies have resulted in widespread fragmentation of identities in the world political economy of the late twentieth century. The article concludes with some (admittedly problematic) suggestions for the construction of fluid, post-nationalist global communities of difference.\n      </p>", "Geographers concerned with rural development in the Third World have no difficulty in perceiving the unity of their discipline. International biological and ecological projects have emphasized the inter-dependence of environment, people and technology in rapidly growing low-latitude cities. Answers to the complex problems of such communities will not be found by a partial investigation from the standpoint of a sector of a discipline or any selective approach based on western paradigms. Concern for the coherent overview has passed from geographers to biologists in terms of ecoscience and environmental studies. Yet geography has a unique range of skills which enables to make outstanding contributions to global, regional and local problems. More geographers should be active in the big, fundamental issues in which the unity of geography is obvious.\n      </p>", "Over half the departments of geography in polytechnics are small and have a range of problems associated with their size. This paper identifies basic aims which should underlie all geography course development, and indicates the ability of even the smallest department to attain them. The case study is geography at Oxford Polytechnic, which has moved from a weak position to one of relative strength through the \"polytechnic-wide\" modular structure. The flexibility and adaptability of the modular system give students considerable freedom to design their own programmes, enable geography to exploit its academic \"centrality\" in relation to other subject areas and permit speedy response to changes in the nature of geography as well as developments in higher education. While suitable for specialist geographers, the \"open\" nature of most modules makes them available to non-specialists, and so obviates the need for duplication of staff effort in producing \"service\" elements.\n      </p>", "Qualitative methods have been gaining increasing recognition in geography. Yet, unlike quantitative techniques, there has been little discussion among geographers of the research process in which they participate. This is perhaps surprising because the researchers intend, by using qualitative methods, to be less authorial, authoritative and authoritarian. Specifically, this paper explores issues relating to the power relations between the researcher and the researched and the methodology of interpretative geography. In this exploration, the notion of a 'research alliance' is introduced to suggest that power is operating in complex ways. Similarly, I assess the usefulness of the concepts of transference and counter-transference for talking about what goes on in interpretative research. However, on their own these ideas are not enough to cope with an analysis of power, they must be embedded in a self-reflexive epistemology, like 'scenic understanding'. I conclude by arguing that the grounds for an interpretative geography need to be shifted onto the intersubjective relationship between researcher and researched; thus, interfering with that distinction.\n      </p>", "This brief paper considers recent debates about the public policy relevance of geography. Previous writings on the topic have highlighted problems in the discipline itself as well as criticizing the lack of policy relevance of much geographical research rather than offer up much in the way of remedy or prescription. This paper argues that an experimental approach to geographical research design could help make the discipline more policy relevant.\n      </p>", "Contemporary geographic thought finds scientific approaches triangulated by critiques launched by various political economy, feminist, and poststructuralist positions. In aiming their conceptual arsenal at fixed understandings of scientific geography, however, such critiques run the danger of essentializing their intended target. Moreover, in the consequent stabilization of the trajectories taken by these critiques, the process of criticism itself becomes an unreflexive exercise. In this paper we deploy the resources of poststructuralism to achieve an antiessentialist reading of scientific geography that moves beyond mere repudiation and seeks instead to identify a redemptive moment within this constellation of ideas and practices. To do so, we draw upon a modern-day parable-Mary Poppins-whose film version we read as offering a panoramic on theoretical divisions in geography. Though ostensibly a story about an all-too-perfect nanny, the film's key protagonists serve as allegorical figures animating our analysis. Fortunately for all concerned, the banker/patriarch comes to the realization that he too can countermand rather than reproduce the fixed spaces of everyday life.\n      </p>", "Geography and feminism are two powerful intellectual forces at large today. Are they forces that can communicate effectively with each other to build a richer understanding of life on earth or are they two alien worlds in collision? I explore three core analytic traditions that I see as common to geography and feminism: finding significance in everyday life, appreciating the importance of context, and thinking about difference. With examples from local labor market studies, I then illustrate how the collision between geography and feminism has not ignited a destructive explosion but instead has illuminated how we think about gender, how we think about place, and how we think about work. I argue that because geography and feminism share certain intellectual traditions, the two areas of inquiry should, once they begin to open up to and learn from each other, not only transform each other but also contribute powerful new insights about the world.\n      </p>"], "words": {"government,": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "essay": {"number": 1, "prob":
