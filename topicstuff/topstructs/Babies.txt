{"total_words": 608, "documents": ["In much anthropological literature infants are frequently neglected as outside the scope of both the concept of culture and disciplinary methods. This article proposes six reasons for this exclusion of infants from anthropological discussion. These include the fieldworker's own memories and parental status, the problematic question of agency in infants and their presumed dependence on others, their routine attachment to women, their seeming inability to communicate, their inconvenient propensity to leak from a variety of orifices, and their apparently low quotient of rationality. Yet investigation of low infants are conceived of beyond the industrialized West can lead us to envision them far differently from how they are conceived in the West (including by anthropologists). Confronting such comparative data suggests the desirability of considering infants as both relevant and beneficial to the anthropological endeavor.\n      </p>", "Objective\u2014To review the outcome of liver transplantation in babies aged less than 1 year. Design\u2014Prospective evaluation of survival, clinical complications, and nutritional and developmental status before and one year after liver transplantation. Setting\u2014The Children's Hospital and Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham. Subjects\u2014All 25 babies who received liver transplantation from January 1989 to December 1992 were included. Median age was 9 months and median weight was 7.0 kg. Seven babies were assessed but were not given transplants because they died while on the waiting list (two) or had severe extrahepatic disease (five). Results\u201424 babies had severe decompensated liver disease and 20 were severely malnourished despite nutritional support. Six babies received a whole liver graft and 19 received a reduction hepatectomy. Postoperative complications included primary nonfunction of the transplanted liver (one baby), hepatic artery thrombosis (two), biliary obstruction (seven), acute and chronic rejection (six), and sepsis (18). Three babies required a second transplant; all survived. Three babies, two of whom presented with fulminant hepatic failure, died. The overall actuarial survival rate (4 months to 4 years) is 88%. Review at 12 months showed a dramatic improvement in growth (p &lt; 0.001) and normal psychosocial development with good quality of life. Conclusion\u2014The improvement in survival rates and quality of life in this group of very sick babies is related not only to the development of reduction hepatectomy but also to advances in medical and nursing expertise. Early referral for liver transplantation is justified even if babies are critically ill.\n      </p>", "Ordinal logistic regression analysis was used on a sample of 1007 babies under 6 months of age seen at home and in hospital to identify the symptoms and signs of serious illness. A model with seven symptoms and 12 signs was used as the basis for a scoring system where each symptom and sign was assigned an integer score proportional to its regression coefficient. A baby's illness score was then the sum of scores for any signs or symptoms that were present, asymptomatic babies scoring 0. The scoring system gave a sensitivity (score 13 or more) of 92.1%, specificity (score less than 8) of 98.3% and positive predictive value (score 20 or more) of 98.0% when applied to a notional community sample. The system has been made into a score card called Baby Check, designed for use by parents and health professionals to quantify the severity of a baby's illness. Baby Check indicates when the baby's condition warrants further assessment or treatment.\n      </p>", "The adult weight and height of first generation Israeli-born European and Near-Eastern Asian Jewish women was similar to that of women who immigrated from Europe or Asia, respectively. Women of European descent were, however, on the average 4 cm taller and 5 kg heavier than women of Asian descent (p &lt; 0.001). The Asian women were of lower socioeconomic status, however, the shorter adulthood stature of the first generation Asian women was a better indicator of their life-long low socioeconomic level in Asia or in Israel. There were no apparent differences in the birth weight of first and second generation Israeli babies of Asian or European descent. Infant's birth weight associated positively with their mother's height and weight, and males were heavier. However, for babies of Asian origin, and with more highly educated fathers, there was a negative association with their birth weight.\n      </p>", "This paper deals with the selection of predictors for indirect assessment of birth weight from three important anthropometric measurements (viz. length, head and chest circumferences) taken at birth. The technique of multivariate regression analysis has been applied for examining the separate effects of each of the three concomitant variables on birth weight of 1644 Indian newborn babies. The head and chest circumferences were identified as the most appropriate predictors of birth weight in view of the simplicity and noninvasiveness of measuring these two body circumferences. A nomogram has been constructed to predict birth weight from head and chest circumferences for better practical utility of the regression equation.

In the 4 years since its creation, the Coalition has grown in scope and size, established an Executive Secretariat, and begun activities directed at breastfeeding, substance use, injury prevention, genetics, oral health, adolescent pregnancy, and motivation of low-income women. National Coalition educational materials on these subjects are produced by representatives of the national organization members contributing time and their organization's resources. In addition, member organizations sponsor the publication of a quarterly newsletter and other coalition-building materials including an exhibit, slide-tape show, television production kit, and a community organization guide. Combined with State and community enthusiasm for the Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies concept, technical assistance from national members has led to the formation of coalitions in many States--more than 40 States have designated contacts with the national coalition. The State coalitions have undertaken a variety of campaigns; the achievements in 12 States are outlined. Of high priority during the next year will be support of these developing State coalitions through co-sponsorship of regional conferences. The national Coalition will also continue to recognize innovative programs through annual national achievement awards. The Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies Coalition is dedicated to continued development and promotion of educational programs for pregnant women, those planning a pregnancy, and their caregivers until 1990, in support of the health Objectives for the nation.\n      </p>", "Objective: To investigate the changing prognosis for babies of less than 28 weeks' gestation. Design: A prospective, collaborative, population based survey. Setting: The former Northern Regional Health Authority. Subjects: All the births between 1983 and 1994 at 22 to 27 completed weeks' gestation to women normally resident in the region. Main outcome measures: Miscarriage, stillbirth, death in the first year of life, and disability in survivors. Results: There were 479 070 registered births in the study period. No baby of 22 weeks' gestation survived; only eight (4%) of the 197 babies of 23 weeks who were alive at the onset of labour survived for a year-a proportion that did not change during the study period. Survival among other babies of less than 28 weeks improved progressively between 1983-6 and 1991-4, but administration of artificial surfactant to babies requiring ventilation from mid-1990 was associated with further improvement in survival only in those over 25 weeks' gestation. Babies of 24 weeks required three times as much high dependency care per survivor as babies of 27 weeks (76 v 26 days). The rate of severe disability in the one year survivors of less than 26 weeks' gestation (30/123; 24%) was similar to that seen in the sampled survivors of 26 and 27 weeks (29/108; 27%); the proportion disabled did not change significantly during the study period. All the children born in 1983, 1987, and 1991 were later reassessed in greater detail: 10% (13/136) seemed destined for a continuing life of total dependency. Conclusions: Gestation, if accurately assessed, can give a woman facing very preterm delivery a clear indication of the prognosis for her baby and help her judge the appropriateness of accepting obstetric intervention and sustained perinatal support.\n      </p>", "The notion of 'quality of life' frequently features in discussions about how it is appropriate to treat folk at the beginning and at the end of life. It is argued that there is a disjunction between its use in these two areas (1). In the case of disabled babies at the very beginning of life, 'quality of life' considerations are frequently used to justify enforced death on the basis that the babies in question would be better off dead. At times, babies with severe disabilities are thus allowed to die or even killed. In the case of terminally ill people 'quality of life' is also important in guiding the actions of doctors. However, in the case of individuals who do not wish to live any longer because their quality of life is so poor that they would rather be dead, quality of life is likely to be dropped as a guiding principle. Thus patients who wish to die and ask to be killed, will most often be forced to endure enforced life.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Common exposure to PCBs, DDT, and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), the most stable metabolite of DDT, may influence children's neurodevelopment, but study results are not consistent. Objectives: We examined the associations between lactational exposure to PCBs, DDT, and DDE and infant development at 12 months, using data from the Pregnancy, Infection, and Nutrition Babies Study, 2004-2006. Methods: We measured PCBs, DDT, and DDE in breast milk at the third month postpartum. Lactational exposure of these chemicals was estimated by the product of chemical concentrations and the duration of breast-feeding. Infant development at 12 months of age was measured by the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (n = 231) and the Short Form: Level I (infant) of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Indices (n = 218). Results: No consistent associations were observed between lactational exposure to PCBs, DDT, and DDE through the first 12 months and the measures of infant development. However, DDE was associated with scoring below average on the gross motor scale of the Mullen among males only (adjusted odds ratio = 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.3). Conclusion: Infant neurodevelopment at 12 months of age was not impaired by PCBs, DDT, and DDE at the concentrations measured here, in combination with benefits from long duration of breast-feeding in this population.\n      </p>", "Interest in babies was studied in 120 young adult males and females belonging to 4 stages of life: cohabiting singles, childless-married, those expecting their first child, and parents of an infant. Measures included responsivity to an unfamiliar baby in a waiting-room situation, interest in pictures of babies, and a sex-role self-concept inventory. Stages in the family life-cycle were of no relevance to males' interest in babies but were found to trigger females' interest. Specifically, mothers of infants were more responsive to babies than were childless subjects. Sex differences in responsiveness to babies were absent for the 3 childless groups but emerged at parenthood, reflecting the increased sensitivity of new mothers to babies. Femininity scores from a sex-role self-concept correlated modestly with interest in babies, as did experience with infants. The findings are discussed in terms of differential role demands and contact with babies.\n      </p>", "This production history records the planning, filming, and initial distribution of \"ALL MY BABIES,\" a 1952 documentary film designed as \"an educational tool to improve the services of midwives.\" The paper describes the conditions of filming in rural Georgia and relations between the white film crew and black cast members.

Design Analysis of trends in infant death rates from 1975 to 1996 for the three groups. The data source was the national linked infant mortality file, containing all records of infant death in England and Wales linked to the respective birth records. Setting England and Wales. Participants All live births (n = 14.3 million) from 1975 to 1996; all deaths of infants from birth to 12 months of age over the same period (n = 135 800). Main outcome measures Death rates in the perinatal, neonatal, and postneonatal periods and for infancy overall. Results For the babies of lone mothers infant mortality has fallen to less than a third of the 1975 level, with a clear reduction in the gap between the mortality in these babies compared with all couple registrations: the excess mortality in solely registered births was 79% in 1975 reducing to 33% in 1996. Most of the narrowing of the sole-couple differential was associated with the neonatal period, for which there is now no appreciable gap. For couple registrations analysed by social class of father, infant death rates have more than halved in each social class from 1975 to 1996. The reductions in mortality were greater in the late 1970s and early 1990s. Infant death rates in classes IV-V remained between 50% and 65% higher than in classes I-II. Differentials between social classes were largest in the postneonatal period and smallest in the perinatal and neonatal periods. The gap in perinatal and neonatal mortality between the babies of lone mothers and couple parents in social classes IV-V has disappeared. Conclusions The differential in infant mortality between social classes still exists, whereas the differential between sole and couple registrations has decreased, showing positive progress in the reduction of inequalities. As the reduction in the differential was confined to the neonatal period these improvements may be more a reflection of healthcare factors than of factors associated with lone mothers' social and economic circumstances.\n      </p>", "Objectives To examine trends in mortality among babies registered solely by their mother (lone mothers) and to compare these with trends in infant mortality for couple registrations overall and couple registrations subdivided by social class of father.

Design Randomised controlled switchback trial. Setting Postnatal wards in a teaching hospital in north east Scotland. Participants All infants delivered at the hospital between March 1993 and February 1995. Intervention A policy of one neonatal screening examination compared with a policy of two. Main outcome measures Congenital conditions diagnosed in hospital; results of community health assessments at 8 weeks and 8 months; outpatient referrals; inpatient admissions; use of general practioner services; focused analysis of outcomes for suspected hip and heart abnormalities. Results 4835 babies were allocated to receive one screening examination (one screen policy) and 4877 to receive two (two screen policy). More congenital conditions were suspected at discharge among babies examined twice (9.9 v 8.3 diagnoses per 100 babies; 95% confidence interval for difference 0.3 to 2.7). There was no overall significant difference between the groups in use of community, outpatient, or inpatient resources or in health care received. Although more babies who were examined twice attended orthopaedic outpatient clinics (340 (7%) v 289 (6%)), particularly for suspected congenital dislocation of the hip (176 (3.6/100 babies) v 137 (2.8/100 babies); difference -0.8; -1.5 to 0.1), there was no significant difference in the number of babies who required active management (12 (0.2%) v 15 (0.3%)). Conclusions Despite more suspected abnormalities, there was no evidence of net health gain from a policy of two hospital neonatal examinations. Adoption of a single examination policy would save resources both during the postnatal hospital stay and through fewer outpatient consultations.\n      </p>", "What factors influence the choice of babies' sleep environments? What options do parents have in choosing unique sleep environments for their infants? Is there a relation between babies' sleep environments and subsequent sleep problems?

While the earlier competitions were concerned for physical and mental standards, the latter contests collected data on a broad range of presumed hereditary characters. The complex behaviors thought to be determined by one's heredity included being generous, jealous, and cruel. In today's context, the popular media often interpret advances in molecular genetics in a similarly reductive and determinist fashion. This paper argues that such a narrow interpretation of contemporary biology unnecessarily constrains the public in developing social policies concerning complex social behavior ranging from crime to intelligence.\n      </p>", "We study the relationship between the unemployment rate at the time of a baby's conception and parental characteristics, parental behaviors, and babies' health. Babies conceived in times of high unemployment have a reduced incidence of low and very low birth weight, fewer congenital malformations, and lower postneonatal mortality. These health improvements are attributable both to selection (changes in the type of mothers who conceive during recessions) and to improvements in health behavior during recessions.

They prepare the baby for the journey by giving any urgent treatment required, for procedures are difficult to carry out in a moving ambulance. Babies who are likely to become apnoeic are intubated before transport so that ventilation can be started immediately if required. The baby travels in a portable incubator, and special attention is paid to prevention of hypothermia, adequate oxygenation, and respiration. Altogether 122 babies were transferred in 1969, the main reasons being prematurity, hyaline membrane disease, and apnoeic attacks. Five improved during the journey, 102 did not change significantly and 15 became worse. There was no evidence that travel per se harmed any of the babies, though in a few cases deterioration might have been prevented had observation and treatment been easier in the ambulance. Fifty-eight (47%) of the babies eventually died, but the group was a highly selected one with a high proportion of small, immature, and ill babies. We conclude that for very ill newborn babies the advantages of transfer to an intensive care unit probably outweigh the disadvantages of transport, provided that the precautions described here are taken.\n      </p>", "Mothers who have big babies may have had abnormal glucose tolerance during pregnancy.

Patients\u2014Requests for transfer of 675 babies to the regional perinatal centre (prenatally and postnatally) were made from hospitals in Northern Ireland between January 1984 and December 1986. In all, 343 babies were refused admission to the centre, and complete data were available for 332 of them. These babies were either admitted to other neonatal intensive care units (261 babies) or remained in hospitals with only special care cots (71 babies). Main outcome measure\u2014Short term mortality. Results\u2014Seventy of the 332 babies refused admission to the centre died compared with 51 of the 333 who were admitted. Multivariate analysis based on a logistic model showed a non-significant increase in mortality among babies treated in other intensive care units compared with babies treated in the centre (relative odds 1.2; 95% confidence interval 0.7 to 1.9). The increase in mortality in babies who remained in a special care baby unit, however, was significant (3.5; 1.7 to 7.0). This increase was particularly significant in babies born at \u226432 weeks' gestation and who weighed less than 1500 g (8.4; 2.5 to 28.1). Conclusions\u2014The results of the study confirm the benefits of neonatal intensive care and its particular value in improving survival in babies of low birth weight. As the babies were refused admission to the regional perinatal centre because intensive care cots were not available this deficiency should be corrected.\n      </p>", "Eleven premature babies developed necrotizing enterocolitis in an epidemic of gastroenteritis and salmonella infection. This occurred in one of two premature baby wards over a period of 10 weeks. All affected babies had severe gastroenteritis and six had salmonella infection. No cases of necrotizing enterocolitis occurred in the unaffected ward during the same period. All other possible factors which might have predisposed to necrotizing enterocolitis occurred with equal frequency in both wards.

They were also given Piaget-type tasks assessing physical conservation-identity (Clay), physical causality (Origin of Night), and a new social identity task (Lemke 1973). Performance on all tasks systematically increased with age, intercorrelations were high, and children tended to perform at the same absolute cognitive level on each task. Children's concepts of how people get babies appears to follow a Piagetian developmental sequence embedded in a matrix of social and physical causality and identity concepts. There also appears to be a consistent developmental lag in which physical causality precedes physical conservation-identity, which in turn precedes social identity: the Origin of Babies appears to be the most developmentally difficult of the 4 tasks. A qualitative analysis supported Piaget's interactive theory of development. Sex information is not simply taken in by children; it is assimilated (transformed) to the child's present cognitive level.\n      </p>", "M.

Those babies who did not acquire their maternal faecal flora acquired strains of E. coli belonging to a small number of the possible serotypes. Moreover, the same serotypes were found in several babies and other mothers, suggesting spread within the ward. These few strains included some of the O groups which had previously commonly been found as urinary pathogens. These strains may have increased potentialities for colonization of human bowel. Antigenic and biochemical variation was observed among the strains.\n      </p>", "The stools of 37 newborn babies born in hospital were examined for the presence of virus. An extract of every stool passed by each baby was examined in the electron microscope and inoculated into cell cultures. The babies were delivered in four separate maternity units (A-D). All the babies from units A and C (9 babies) were found to be excreting rotavirus though none showed any evidence of diarrhoea. Two of the babies also excreted astrovirus. Subsequently unit A was closed for cleaning and, on reopening with more restrictions on visitors, a further 19 babies were examined. No virus was found in any of their stools, nor was virus observed in the stools of babies from units B and D, where visiting was also more restricted. Visiting restrictions in these units excluded older siblings of the babies.

Trait theory and sociobiology predict stable sex differences across adolescence, whereas role theory anticipates sex differences during early to mid-adolescence which phase out by late adolescence. In line with role theory, there was an absence of sex differences among college students in their responses to pictures of babies and to a live baby. It was the low level of interest exhibited by high school males (e. g., physical contact, touches baby, talks to infant, disinterest in baby) that accounted for the sex differences found among high school students and the age differences apparent among males. Findings were discussed in terms of role demands for males and females at different junctures of adolescence as a function of the development and consolidation of sex-role identity.\n      </p>", "With the advent of elective induction of labor, the management of an obstetrical practice has assumed the problem of scheduling the delivery of babies.

Cultures taken from 1090 babies shortly after birth showed that 65 (6%) were colonised with the streptococcus. Thirty of these babies were assigned to group 1. Bacteriological samples were taken from babies and mothers at birth and at four, eight, and 12 weeks, and also from fathers and siblings. Fifty uncolonised babies and their families were similarly studied and served as controls (group 2). In group 1, 28 of the 30 mothers and 14 of the 28 fathers examined were colonised by group B streptococci. In group 2 the streptococci were isolated from three babies, 12 mothers, and 11 out of 45 fathers during follow-up. These findings suggest that group B streptococci are carried predominantly in the lower gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. Most families are lightly colonised, but in others maternal colonisation is stable and heavy and the incidence of paternal colonisation high. Results of serotyping suggest that sexual transmission occurs, which may explain the difficulty in eradicating the organism during pregnancy.\n      </p>", "Objective\u2014To explore the attitudes of parents to measuring their babies' rectal temperature.

Setting\u2014One inner city general practice in Newcastle upon Tyne. Subjects\u201442 parents of 34 babies under 6 months old. Results\u2014Parents were reluctant to measure rectal temperature in their babies; 37 parents spontaneously raised concerns. Fifteen did not undertake measurement, 16 did so once only, and 11 did so more than once. Parents' concerns included a fear of hurting their child, anxieties about sexual intimacy and abuse, difficulty in comforting their child, and concern for their child's feelings. Most (33) substituted axillary measurement. Conclusions\u2014Parents' preference for the axillary method of measuring temperature and resistance to using a rectal method in their children was based on several concerns. If parents are to be encouraged to use the rectal method of measuring temperature in sick babies any benefits must be set against the generation of considerable parental anxiety and the resources that would be necessary to negotiate with parents and change their views.\n      </p>", "A controlled investigation of 214 parents of battered babies shows that they were young and predominantly of lower social class.

Twenty-nine per cent. had a criminal record. Recidivism is an associated feature. The risk of battering possibly diminishes with time.

Seventeen infants who were breast-fed received their first solid food at a mean age of 13\u00b78 weeks, compared with 8\u00b73 weeks for the 33 bottle-fed infants. Most (38) mothers weaned because they thought their babies were hungry (crying after a feed or demanding more frequent feeds, or both). The age of weaning did not influence weight gain, growth in length, or change in skinfold thicknesses. The results suggest that the \"4-month rule\" for weaning is unrealistic.

Subjects-Subjects comprised 1544 babies born in Burnley, Pendle, and Rossendale Health District, and 1025 babies born in Salisbury Health District. Main outcome measures-Birthweight, length, head, arm and abdominal circumferences, and placental weight were determined. Results-Compared with babies born in Salisbury, Burnley babies had lower mean birthweight (difference 116 g, 95% confidence interval (CI) 77, 154), smaller head circumferences (difference 0\u00b73 cm, 95% CI 0\u00b72, 0\u00b74), and were thinner as measured by arm circumference (difference 0\u00b73 cm, 95% CI 0\u00b73, 0\u00b74), abdominal circumference (difference 0\u00b75 cm, 95% CI 0\u00b74, 0\u00b76) and ponderal index (difference 0\u00b78 kg/m\u00b3, 95% CI 0\u00b76, 1\u00b70). The ratio of placental weight to birthweight was higher in Burnley (difference 0\u00b76%, 95% CI 0\u00b74, 0\u00b79). These differences were found in boys and girls and did not depend on differences in duration of gestation or on the different ethnic mix of the two districts. Mothers in Burnley were younger, shorter in stature, had had more children, were of lower social class, and more of them smoked during pregnancy than mothers in Salisbury. These differences did not explain the greater thinness of their babies. Conclusions-Babies born in Burnley, an area with high perinatal mortality, are thin. The reason is unknown. Poor maternal nutrition is suspected because Burnley babies have a higher ratio of placental weight to birthweight. The greater thinness at birth of Burnley babies could have long term consequences, including higher rates of cardiovascular disease.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Thomas' experimental work led to a surgical solution for a life-threatening heart defect, called tetralogy of Fallot. Children with this condition lack sufficient oxygenation and were referred to as 'blue babies'. Following Thomas' research trajectory and his relationship with surgeon Dr Alfred Blalock, I review the conditions under which differing expectations towards race and occupation clashed, creating a status dilemma for Thomas. While the torsion originated in the laboratory where technical skills are valued, the research locale also facilitated a temporary, fragile solution for the status dilemma, because it separated Thomas from public view. Yet, Thomas' dexterity as a laboratory researcher enhanced his dilemma, because credit kept eluding him. In order to track the dynamics of race and occupational subordination as lived experience in the laboratory, I argue for an analysis of the process of crediting people for their scientific accomplishments.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "The effect of maternal abuse of heroin on newborn babies was studied in 25 babies born during 1982-6 to 23 heroin users, most of whom smoked the drug. Nineteen of the babies developed withdrawal symptoms, which in 12 were severe enough to require treatment. Five babies were born prematurely; 17 were adequately grown for their gestational age. Four mothers successfully established breast feeding. Twenty two infants were discharged from the hospital into their mother's care with support from the family and community services; at the end of the study only six were living in families in which the parents were married or had a stable relationship. Withdrawal symptoms were short lasting and often self limiting, and no evidence of adverse effect on postnatal growth and development was found.

Frequent real time ultrasound examinations of the brain were made in each baby during the first week and less frequently thereafter. In babies under 32 weeks' gestation the incidence of intraventricular haemorrhage was lower in supplemented babies (18.8%) compared with the controls (56.3%). On days 0, 1, 2, and 3 median plasma vitamin E concentrations in babies without haemorrhage and in those with subependymal haemorrhage only were similar.

In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the Beng posit a radically different theory of cognitive development: adults say that the younger the child, the keener the memory. Moreover, such recall is of a specific sort - infants allegedly hold strong memories of a previous existence before birth (wrugbe), where people reportedly live harmoniously and there is never material want. Nevertheless, remembering this space of plenitude can prove agonizing for babies, making their hold on life precarious, and a distressing array of culturally shaped diseases threaten their survival. Protecting against illness requires an elaborate bathing, jewellery and make-up routine twice daily that begins at birth and continues for the first year. All this somatic activity is meant to lure the child fully and definitively into this world, and to counteract the strong call of the afterlife that adults say is created by the infant's own memories. Why is wrugbe, as purportedly remembered by infants, envisaged as a place of plenitude? And why is it located in an historically identified past? In this essay - which is necessarily to some extent speculative given its subject of infant memory - I explore the allegorical implications of the Beng afterlife, suggesting that the attribution of heightened infant memory of an idyllic wrugbe serves as an indirect critique of French colonialism and its aftermath. I conclude by discussing the ways in which memory and forgetting are mutually constructed, with the Beng model offering substantial support for the contention that reproduction in general - and babies in particular - are crucial to this intertwined process./La m\u00e9moire est souvent consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme le monopole des adultes et des enfants plus \u00e2g\u00e9s: plus l'enfant est jeune, plus sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 se souvenir diminue.

N\u00e9anmoins, le souvenir de cet espace de pl\u00e9nitude peut \u00eatre cause de tourment chez les b\u00e9 b\u00e9s, alors qu'ils exercent leur emprise sur le pr\u00e9caire de la vie et que tout un \u00e9ventail de maladies culturellement form\u00e9es menace leur survie. Pour prot\u00e9ger le b\u00e9b\u00e9 contre la maladie, on le soumet \u00e0 une routine faite de bains \u00e9 labor\u00e9s, de bijoux et de maquillage deux fois par jour, pendant un an d\u00e8s la naissance. Toute cette activit\u00e9 somatique est cens\u00e9e attirer pleinement et d\u00e9finitivement l'enfant dans ce monde, et contrer l'appel fort de la vie apr\u00e8s la mort que les adultes disent cr\u00e9\u00e9 par les souvenirs de l'enfant. Pourquoi wrugbe, tel que s'en souviennent pr\u00e9tendument les jeunes enfants, est-il envisag\u00e9 comme un lieu de pl\u00e9nitude? Et pourquoi se situe-t-il dans un pass\u00e9 historiquement identifi\u00e9? Cet article, n\u00e9cessairement sp\u00e9culatif puisque traitant de la m\u00e9moire des jeunes enfants, examine les implications all\u00e9goriques de la vie apr\u00e8s la mort chez les Beng, en sugg\u00e9rant que l'attribution du souvenir accentu\u00e9 d'un wrugbe idyllique chez les jeunes enfants sert de critique indirecte du colonialisme fran\u00e7ais et de ses cons\u00e9 quences. Il conclut en \u00e9voquant les modes de construction mutuelle de la m\u00e9moire et de l'oubli, le mod\u00e8le beng servant \u00e0 appuyer l'affirmation selon laquelle la reproduction en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et les b\u00e9b\u00e9s en particulier jouent un r\u00f4le essentiel dans ce processus interd\u00e9pendant.\n      </p>", "Previous work showed that on the basis of O serotyping alone of Escherichia coli, the majority of babies acquired the same O serotype as was found in the stools of their respective mothers. Further characterization of the E. coli by H serotyping, determination of their antibiotic resistance and ability to ferment six carbohydrates showed that in the majority of cases the previous results were confirmed. In a minority of cases this further testing showed that the strains were not identical. In some instances a number of strains isolated from the same pair showed different combinations of the markers used.\n      </p>", "A group of small-for-dates full-term babies whose intrauterine growth was followed by serial ultrasonic cephalometry were examined at a mean age of 4 years. Those children whose skull growth had begun to slow in utero before 34 weeks' menstrual age were more likely to have a height and weight less than the 10th centile. When the onset of growth failure had occurred before 26 weeks there was a lower developmental quotient at follow-up using the Griffiths extended scales. Prolonged slow growth in utero therefore seems to be followed by slow growth and development after birth.\n      </p>", "Twenty-seven babies from one deprived housing area in Glasgow were followed-up regularly, for periods varying between 2 months and 11 months (mean 7 months), in a prospective study of the viruses to be found in their stools by electron microscopy. Weekly stool specimens were collected in the home together with a history of the baby's health. Additional stool specimens were obtained, up to a maximum of one per day, during admissions to hospital. Over 500 specimens were obtained at home and another 320 in hospital. A wide variety of viruses (over 200 recognizates) were detected and it has been possible to plot their temporal relation to disease episodes. It became apparent that virus excretion was frequently unaccompanied by evidence of illness and it has not been possible to describe a typical illness syndrome associated with any of the morphological types of virus observed. The results suggest that, in one area of Glasgow at least, patterns of virus excretion in young babies are complex and will need further elucidation before the need for a vaccine to prevent infantile diarrhoea could be defined.\n      </p>", "Chronic viraemia has been detected in 10 out of 12 rubella syndrome babies at periods ranging from 1 to 196 days. The virus was found to be associated with leucocytes, and it is assumed that removal of neutralizing antibody is the most likely explanation for the high success rate in detecting viraemia. The findings are discussed in relation to diagnosis by virus isolation, to pathogenesis, and to the possible significance in explaining the failure of the foetus to develop a tolerance to rubella virus. Several published reports of viraemia in the acute exanthematous disease are contrasted with the less frequent reports of viraemia in the chronic disease of early postnatal life.\n      </p>", "Research findings from several studies have recently corroborated what many parents know from practical experience. Namely, that nonsoothable babies place enormous stress on family functioning. In spite of these empirical data and everyday observations little systematic aid is available to infant-trapped families. A CrySOS clinic, designed to draw together relevant perspectives, has been established to meet this community need. Following a general statement the present paper introduces theoretical as well as empirical backgrounds to the CrySOS clinic, indicates ground rules accepted by clinicians, outlines procedures followed at a typical first meeting, and, finally, shows some current developments.\n      </p>", "Aim To compare perinatal morbidity and mortality for babies delivered in water with rates for babies delivered conventionally (not in water). Design Surveillance study (of all consultant paediatricians) and postal survey (of all NHS maternity units). Setting British Isles (surveillance study); England and Wales (postal survey). Subjects Babies born in the British Isles between April 1994 and March 1996 who died perinatally or were admitted for special care within 48 hours of birth after delivery in water or after labour in water followed by conventional delivery (surveillance study); babies delivered in water in England and Wales in the same period (postal survey). Main outcome measures Number of deliveries in water in the British Isles that resulted in perinatal death or in admission to special care within 48 hours of birth; and proportions (of such deliveries) of all water births in England and Wales. Results 4032 deliveries (0.6% of all deliveries) in England and Wales occurred in water. Perinatal mortality was 1.2/1000 (95% confidence interval 0.4 to 2.9) live births; 8.4/1000 (5.8 to 11.8) live births were admitted for special care. No deaths were directly attributable to delivery in water, but 2 admissions were for water aspiration. UK reports of mortality and special care admission rates for babies of women considered to be at low risk of complications during delivery who delivered conventionally ranged from 0.8/1000 (0.2 to 4.2) to 4.6/1000 (0.1 to 25) live births and from 9.2 (1.1 to 33) to 64/1000 (58 to 70) live births respectively. Compared with regional data for low risk, spontaneous, normal vaginal deliveries at term, the relative risk for perinatal mortality associated with delivery in water was 0.9 (99% confidence interval 0.2 to 3.6). Conclusions Perinatal mortality is not substantially higher among babies delivered in water than among those born to low risk women who delivered conventionally. The data are compatible with a small increase or decrease in perinatal mortality for babies delivered in water.\n      </p>", "From 1971 to 1981, 98 babies born with meningomyelocoele at the North Staffordshire Hospital Centre's district maternity hospital, were thought not suitable for surgery. Sixty three survived for more than one week. Over the period the hospital's policy changed: initially all such babies were kept in hospital, but later parents were given the choice of taking their baby home for palliative and terminal care. In an attempt to determine parents' views on the care of their baby the parents of 44 of the babies who survived to one week were traced in 1985-6, five to 14 years later; 80 of them were asked how they felt about the lives and deaths of their babies. Eighteen babies had been taken home, and they had lived longer than the 26 who had been cared for in hospital. Parents whose baby had remained in hospital were sadder than those who had taken their baby home when they looked back at their experiences, and they also considered that their baby's life had been of poor quality. Most of those who had taken their baby home had a more positive view of their child's life. The figures suggest that the bereavement process after a baby's death is longer than has been thought, but despite residual sadness just over half of the parents interviewed thought that something positive had come out of their experience.\n      </p>", "Vitamin D deficiency is common in pregnant Asian women. The effect of maternal vitamin D deficiency on fetal skeletal mineralisation was assessed by measuring the bone mineral content of babies born to 45 Asian women, 19 Asian women who had received 1000 units of vitamin D during the last trimester, and 12 white women. The mean cord blood concentrations of 25-hydroxy vitamin D in the three groups were 5.9\u00b1SE 0.9 nmol/1 (2.4\u00b1SE 0.4 ng/ml), 15.2\u00b13.2 nmol/1 (6.1\u00b11.3 ng/ml), and 33.4\u00b13.6 nmol/1 (13.4\u00b11.4 ng/ml), respectively. Despite this wide variation in values there was no significant difference in the bone mineral content (as assessed by photon absorptiometry) of the forearms of babies born to these women. This suggests that mineralisation of the fetal skeleton is not impaired in maternal vitamin D deficiency. Craniotabes (skull softening) was present in seven of the 64 Asian babies. The bone mineral content in these babies was not significantly different from that of babies without this sign, and craniotabes should not therefore be taken as an indication of a generalised impairment in skeletal mineralisation.\n      </p>", "A retrospective study of babies weighing less than 2000 g at birth admitted over a four-year period to Nottingham City Hospital Neonatal Unit showed a higher incidence of lower Apgar scores and the need for intubation in babies born by caesarean section and breech deliveries. Mortality in those delivered by the breech (35%) was statistically higher than those by caesarean section (10%) or vertex (14%). It is concluded that small babies born by breech delivery have a higher mortality than when delivered vaginally and should have the benefit of caesarean section.\n      </p>", "Anthropologists have neglected a significant dimension to religion by ignoring the spiritual lives of a society's youngest members. In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Beng infants are said to lead a profoundly spiritual existence. Indeed, until the age of five or so, Beng children are said to live at least part of the time in the spiritual other world (wrugbe) they inhabited before being reincarnated. Exploring both ideology and praxis, the author probes the consequences for the daily experiences and care of Bang babies, including umbilical cord care, enemas, crying, adornment, naming, personality development, and infant disease and death. The author concludes by considering the implications of a full-blown treatment of infants for the practice of anthropology.\n      </p>", "One of Howard Pyle's students became an illustrator of children's books and drew the creatures with gills that look like lace collars around their necks.\n      </p>", "Attempts were made to isolate viruses from babies' stools that contained adenoviruses detected by electron microscopy. One hundred and fifty-nine specimens from 71 children were studied and adenoviruses of established serotypes were isolated from 81 stools. Serial stool samples containing adenovirus particles were obtained from 35 children, and prolonged shedding of recognized serotypes was common. Simultaneous and sequential infections by different serotypes were also observed. Thirty-six children shed adenoviruses that could not be isolated using cell cultures normally used to detect adenoviruses, and nine of these children also shed adenoviruses of established serotypes. Passage in Chang conjunctival cell cultures allowed characterization of fastidious adenoviruses from 14 children as members of a previously unrecognized serotype.\n      </p>", "A protein free artificial surfactant (artificial lung expanding compound; ALEC) composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol was assessed for its effect on the main complications of prematurity in a prospective two stage randomised trial of 328 unselected babies delivered at between 25 and 29 weeks of gestation. Babies were randomised to receive approximately 100 mg artificial surfactant suspension or 1 ml saline. This was given at birth into the pharynx with up to three more endotracheal doses if the baby was intubated during the first day. Treatment with artificial surfactant reduced the neonatal mortality from 27% to 14%, the incidence of parenchymal brain haemorrhages from 24% to 16%, and the severity of the respiratory distress syndrome. In the first 10 days babies treated with artificial surfactant who survived averaged 19 hours less in &gt;30% oxygen, 20 hours less ventilation, and 17 hours less supplemental oxygen. Artificial surfactant had no effect on the incidence of pneumothoraces, pulmonary interstitial emphysema, patent ductus arteriosus, or postnatal infections and no serious side effects. Artificial surfactant (ALEC) given to very premature babies at birth significantly reduces their mortality and the respiratory support needed and should prove a valuable addition to treatment.\n      </p>", "In recent months there has been considerable discussion on the ethics of using organs from anencephalic babies for transplantation purposes. The heart of an anencephalic in Ireland was so used, but the recipient died very soon after the operation. Since this case came to light the Royal College of Physicians has imposed a ban on the use of these babies as donors while a working party investigates the issues involved. This article attempts to examine the problem and reaches the conclusion that in practice it is not ethical to use the organs of anencephalics for transplants.\n      </p>", "This paper investigates the usefulness of Carey's Revised Infant Temperament Questionnaire in the Chinese culture and uses the questionnaire to assess the temperamental characteristics of Chinese babies. The revised questionnaire was administered to the mothers of 349 4-8-month-old infants in Taipei, Taiwan. The face validity of the questionnaire was supported within the different context: the distribution of scores was normal, and the mothers had no trouble in answering the questions. While the general pattern of results was similar to those found in Carey's American sample, differences were found, which may be interpreted in terms of response biases, racial differences, or a combination of these 2 factors. The data are analyzed for possible effects of sex and socioeconomic status, and these findings are in turn compared to results of American studies. Observational studies are seen as necessary in the future to understand the nature of cultural differences in temperament. Follow-up studies will examine the different ways a given temperamental characteristic may be responded to by different cultural environments.\n      </p>", "The effect of stabilizing and directional selection on birth weight has been analyzed for Italian births from 1954 to 1994, a period of rapid improvement in environmental conditions. The population of newborns was subdivided according to gestational age, one of the main covariates of birth weight. In the last cohort of births, no selection at all (neither stabilizing nor directional) was found in full-term babies, which represent more than 95% of total deliveries. Preterm babies are still selected against, even if at lower rates than in the past. It can therefore be claimed that improved and widely available prenatal and neonatal care has dramatically changed the selection patterns previously associated with birth weight in the majority of the Italian population. The mortality rates associated with birth-weight variations lying in a wide interval (2.5 kg-4.5 kg) are nowadays very similar, and both stabilizing and directional selection have practically disappeared.\n      </p>", "We report an investigation of the development of visual expectancies in 3.5-month-old infants. One of the infant's eyes was videorecorded as the infant watched a series of slides that were presented noncontingent on behavior. Babies were presented an alternating and an irregular series of 30 slides with a 700-msec onset duration separated by an interstimulus interval (ISI). The ISI for the alternating series was 1,100 msec, whereas the slides for the irregular series were separated by 900, 1,100, or 1,300 msec, randomly ordered. One-half of the babies saw the irregular series first, and one-half saw the regular series first. Babies in both groups provided evidence that they developed expectations for the visual events in the alternating series. Their reaction times (RTs) declined significantly from 3-5 \"baseline\" presentations, and their RTs were reliably faster during the alternating than the irregular series. Additionally, babies in the alternating-late group had significantly more stimulus anticipations during the alternating than during the irregular series. These findings indicate that 3.5-month-olds can detect regularity in a spatiotemporal series, will develop expectancies for events in the series, and will act on the basis of those expectancies even when those actions have no effect on the stimulus events. We believe that infants are motivated to develop expectations for noncontrollable spatiotemporal events, because these expectations permit them to bring their visual behavior under partial internal control.\n      </p>"], "words": {"concept": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "birth": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "ith": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05},
