{"total_words": 782, "documents": ["The sport of baseball has used statistics to enhance understanding for fans for over a century, yet there is limited data on player careers. This study fills that void by examining the careers of baseball players over the last century. Between 1902 and 1993, 5,989 position players started their careers and played 33,272 person years of major league baseball. A rookie position player can expect to play 5.6 years; one in five position players will have only a single-year career, and at every point of a player's career, the chance of exiting is at least 11%. Position players who start younger and begin their careers in more recent decades all have longer and more stable careers; nevertheless, baseball careers are not compressed versions of normal careers, but are substantially skewed toward early exit.\n      </p>", "Numerous statistics have been proposed to evaluate offensive performance in baseball. Each statistic or estimator can be related to an explicit run production model. An evaluation of ten run production models is presented based on major league team run production in the period 1969-1976. The results are applied to evaluating individual players in both the American and National baseball leagues.\n      </p>", "The use of statistical modeling in baseball has received substantial attention recently in both the media and academic community. We focus on a relatively under-explored topic: the use of statistical models for the analysis of fielding based on high-resolution data consisting of on-field location of batted balls. We combine spatial modeling with a hierarchical Bayesian structure in order to evaluate the performance of individual fielders while sharing information between fielders at each position. We present results across four seasons of MLB data (2002-2005) and compare our approach to other fielding evaluation procedures.\n      </p>", "The distribution of the number of batters faced and the number of runs scored in an inning is fundamental to modeling pitcher performance in major league baseball. Until 1984 sufficiently detailed data on a play-by-play basis were available only for special games, for example, World Series games. Play-by-play data have become available for each league beginning with the 1984 season, and we use them for the 1990 American League season. We found that a minor change from the negative binomial model provided an adequate fit to the distribution of the number of batters faced. However, the distribution of the number of runs scored is complex and involves a convolution of the distribution of the number of batters faced and the conditional distribution of the number of runs scored given a specific number of batters faced. We modeled the latter by a truncated binomial distribution where the probability of a run scoring was a logistic function of the number of batters faced. The goodness of the fit of each of the models was tested on 77 starting pitchers who pitched in the first three innings of enough games to total at least 30 innings, all cumulating for these pitchers to 5,639 innings during the 1990 American League season.\n      </p>", "This article investigates the number of games of baseball that should be played (1) in a World Series competition, and (2) in a pennant race competition within each league, in order to have a reasonable level of confidence that the best team wins the competition. The current number of games played is found to be highly inadequate for the World Series and only barely sufficient for the pennant race.\n      </p>", "In this paper, we discuss the problem of devising a cost effective schedule for a baseball league. Sports scheduling is a notoriously difficult problem. A schedule must satisfy constraints on timing such as the number of games to be played between every pair of teams, the bounds on the number of consecutive home (or away) games for each team, that every pair of teams must have played each other in the first half of the season, and so on. Often, there are additional factors to be considered for a particular league, for example, the availability of venues on specific dates, home-game preferences of teams on specific dates, and balancing of schedules so that games between two teams are evenly-spaced throughout the season. In addition to finding a feasible schedule that meets all the timing restrictions, the problem addressed in this paper has the additional complexity of having the objective of minimizing travel costs. We discuss some structural properties of a schedule that meets the timing constraints and present two heuristics for finding a low-cost schedule. The methodology is used to develop an improved schedule for the Texas Baseball League.\n      </p>", "Most earlier mathematical studies of baseball required particular models for advancing runners based on a small set of offensive possibilities. Other efforts considered only teams with players of identical ability. We introduce a Markov chain method that considers teams made up of players with different abilities and which is not restricted to a given model for runner advancement. Our method is limited only by the available data and can use any reasonable deterministic model for runner advancement when sufficiently detailed data are not available. Furthermore, our approach may be adapted to include the effects of pitching and defensive ability in a straightforward way. We apply our method to find optimal batting orders, run distributions per half inning and per game, and the expected number of games a team should win. We also describe the application of our method to test whether a particular trade would benefit a team.\n      </p>", "Major league baseball in the United States is divided into two leagues and four divisions. Each team plays 162 games against teams in the same league. The winner in each division is the team winning the most games of the teams in that division. We wish to predict the division winners based on games played up to any specified time. We use a generalized choice model for the probability of a team winning a particular game that allows for different strengths for each team, different home advantages, and strengths varying randomly with time. Future strengths and the outcomes of future games are simulated using Markov chain sampling. The probability of a particular team winning the division is then estimated by counting the proportion of simulated seasons in which it wins the most games. The method is applied to the 1991 National League season.\n      </p>", "Much has been written about the home field advantage in sports. Baseball and softball are unusual games, in that the rules are explicity different for home versus visiting teams, since by rule home teams bat second in each inning (they have \"last licks\"). This is generally considered to be an advantage, which seems to be contradicted by the apparent weakness of the home field advantage in baseball compared to that in other sports. In this article we examine the effect of \"last licks\" on baseball and softball team success using neutral site college baseball and softball playoff games. We find little evidence of an effect in baseball, but much greater evidence in softball, related to whether a game is close late in the game. In softball games that are tied at the end of an inning, batting last seems to be disadvantageous later in the game, apparently related to the chances of the team scoring first to break the tie. Since the database also includes games where one team is playing on its home field, we are also able tp say something about benefits from playing at home that are not related to \"last licks.\"\n      </p>", "The difference between the home and visiting teams' scores in a sports contest is modeled as a Brownian motion process defined on t \u2208 (0, 1), with drift \u03bc points in favor of the home team and variance \u03c3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The model obtains a simple relationship between the home team's lead (or deficit) \u2113 at time t and the probability of victory for the home team. The model provides a good fit to the results of 493 professional basketball games from the 1991-1992 National Basketball Association (NBA) season. The model is applied to the progress of baseball scores, a process that would appear to be too discrete to be adequately modeled by the Brownian motion process. Surprisingly, the Brownian motion model matches previous calculations for baseball reasonably well.\n      </p>", "The author reviews and comments on his work in sports statistics, illustrating with problems of estimation in baseball's World Series and with a model for the distribution of the number of runs in a baseball half inning. Data on collegiate football scores have instructive distributions that indicate more about the strengths of the teams playing than their absolute values would suggest. A robust analysis of professional football scores led to widespread publicity with the help of professional newswriters. Professional golf players on the regular tour are so close in skill that a few rounds do little to distinguish their abilities. A simple model for golf scoring is \"base +X\" where the base is a small score for a round rarely achieved, such as 64, and X is a Poisson distribution with mean about 8. In basketball, football, and hockey the leader at the beginning of the final period wins about 80% of the time, and in baseball the leader at the end of seven full innings wins 95% of the time. Empirical experience with runs of even and odd numbers in tossing a die millions of times fits closely the theoretical distributions.\n      </p>", "This article considers the use of sports board games to introduce or illustrate a wide variety of probability concepts to introductory statistics students in an integrated manner. We demonstrate the use of a single game (Strat-O-Matic\u00aeBaseball) to introduce probability distributions, sample spaces, the laws of addition and multiplication of probabilities, independence, mutual exclusivity, randomization and independence, conditional probability, and Bayes' Theorem. Empirical and anecdotal evidence suggests that student comprehension and retention are enhanced by use of examples constructed from the simple and interesting contexts provided by a sports board game.\n      </p>", "The American game of professional baseball is presented as an ethnographic domain to test, in particular, the usefulness of componential analysis (CA) to discover and describe the semantic features necessary to satisfactorily account for the game. In so doing several general ethnographic procedures are pursued and applied, especially to the domain of basestealing. The semantic analysis of baseball is also evaluated in terms of general criteria proposed by Sternberg 1983.\n      </p>", "This article considers the problem of using batting average alone to estimate a baseball player's chance of getting a hit. This problem differs from typical proportion estimation problems because we know only the observed proportion of successes rather than both the number of successes and the number of trials. Our information is also restricted because the observed proportion of successes is reported to only three decimal places. We solve this problem in the context of present-day major league baseball by first developing a model for the joint distribution of hits, at bats, and chance of getting a hit. We then treat that model as a prior distribution and update the prior based on the observed batting average. One interesting result is that among batting averages likely to occur in practice, .334 leads to the highest posterior mean for true ability.\n      </p>", "We present a comparison of two voting models to forecast election into The National Baseball Hall of Fame by the Baseball Writers Association of America. Although both voting models provide similar predictions on which eligible players should be elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame, we believe that the voting model that uses individual performance variables rather than a single performance index is marginally better because it allows the data to determine the relative importance of the individual performance variables included in the single performance index.\n      </p>", "This paper asks whether stealing bases contributes to scoring runs and winning games in Major League Baseball. A successful attempt advances the runner to the next base, which raises his chances of scoring a run; being caught stealing results in an out. Exploiting a dataset that includes all professional MLB teams and 15 regular seasons of play (1990-2004), the empirical results suggest that players attempting to steal bases are successful two out of three times. On the average and other things being the same, a one-standard deviation increase in the number of stolen base attempts results in 3.65 more games won per season.\n      </p>", "We show that if f is a probability density on Rn wrt Lebesgue measure (or any absolutely continuous measure) and 0 \u2264 f \u2264 1, then there is another density g with only the values 0 and 1 and with the same (n - 1)-dimensional marginals in any finite number of directions. This sharpens, unifies and extends the results of Lorentz and of Kellerer. Given a pair of independent random variables 0 \u2264 X,Y \u2264 1, we further study functions 0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 1 such that Z = \u03c6(X,Y) satisfies E(Z\u2223 X) = X and E(Z\u2223 Y) = Y. If there is a solution then there also is a nondecreasing solution \u03c6(x,y). These results are applied to tomography and baseball.\n      </p>", "Recent analyses of baseball managers' performances have employed the so-called 'Pythagorean Theorem' of baseball. This 'theorem' states that the ratio of wins to losses can be approximated by the square of the ratio of team runs scored to opposition runs scored. Recent publications assume this approximate relationship can be used to evaluate managers; implicit is the additional assumption that the Pythagorean relationship constitutes a production process. It does not. This paper derives the exact relationship between the wins, losses, runs scored and runs allowed. The result is an identity. We conclude that application of the 'Pythagorean Theorem' for manager evaluation is inappropriate.\n      </p>", "This article develops a Bayesian model for the analysis of bidding behavior in final-offer arbitration. Posterior calculations are obtained using a Markov chain algorithm. An example is considered using salary data from Major League Baseball.\n      </p>", "The probability P(\u03bb,\u03bc) that a team with mean score \u03bb beats a team with mean score \u03bc, is calculated when the score of each team is Poisson distributed. It is found that \u2202 P(\u03bb, \u03bc)/\u2202\u03bb is equal to the probability of a tie. When this equality holds for any distribution of the score of the team with mean \u03bc, it is shown that the score of the team with mean \u03bb must be Poisson distributed. The Poisson distribution is shown to fit certain baseball data, and it is also applied to some soccer data.\n      </p>", "Throughout Southern California, Mexican Americans participated in baseball clubs, encouraged by employers and social reformers intent on controlling the immigrant population.

This article explores race within the context of the Spalding world baseball tour of 1888-89, a transnational enterprise that marketed the national pastime abroad and, in so doing, indicated the latent, private power behind the official policies of the United States. A rather unusual segment of society to be considered for such scholarly treatment, professional baseball elites nonetheless helped generate a racist imperial ideology and thus added to the voices that set racial parameters for the American empire when it was attained in 1898.

The present study provides experimental evidence that prior expectations significantly influence the timing of a baseball swing. A two-state Markov model was used to predict the effects of pitch sequence and pitch count on batting performance. The model is a hitting strategy of switching between expectancy states using a simple set of transition rules. In a simulated batting experiment, the model provided a good fit to the hitting performance of 6 experienced college baseball players, and the estimated model parameters were highly correlated with playing level.\n      </p>", "We examine the role of institutional settings in determining rent appropriation by employees. Based on an inductive historical study of owner-player relations in Major League Baseball from the inception of professional baseball to the present, we show that both formal and informal institutional rules can dramatically influence rent appropriation. We draw upon anthropology research on social relations to understand how differences in informal norms regarding the social relations between the owners and the players affect appropriation. Our findings show that when social relations are defined by authority ranking, pay is determined more by fiat than by market forces or bargaining.\n      </p>", "Final-offer arbitration is attracting attention as a means of resolving impasses in collective bargaining.

Baseball was introduced in Taiwan at the turn of the twentieth century, when the island was ruled by the Japanese. The practice meets a particularly favorable echo owing much to the affinities between its formal properties and local conceptions of space, time and individual and collective action. It is also associated with representations of modernity associated with the Japanese period. After wwii, Taiwan came under the control of the withdrawn Chinese Nationalists.

Specifically, the Blue Ribbon Panel argues that smaller-market teams now know before the season begins that there is little chance for post-season success. Such a finding is contrary to the findings of numerous economists who contend that Major League Baseball at the close of the twentieth century has never been more competitively balanced. The purpose of this work is to reconcile these disparate viewpoints via an analysis of the link between various definitions of market size and competitive balance. In general, our analysis of the 1990s reveals that market size, however it is defined, is not consistently related to the level of competitive balance in Major League Baseball.\n      </p>", "Baseball performances are an imperfect measure of baseball abilities, and consequently exaggerate differences in abilities.

Various researchers have previously attributed this improvement in competitive balance to the introduction of free agency, a narrowing of team market sizes, and a compression of baseball talent. Two models of competitive balance are presented and estimated in this paper, with results varying depending on the measure of competitive balance employed. If the degree of competitive balance is measured by the distribution of team winning percentages within a single season, none of the competing hypotheses is supported. If competitive balance is measured by the correlation of team winning percentages across seasons, however, all three of the competing hypotheses are supported.\n      </p>", "The competition for baseball play-off spots-the fabled pennant race-is one of the most closely watched American sports traditions. While play-off race statistics, such as games back and magic number, are informative, they are overly conservative and do not account for the remaining schedule of games. Using optimization techniques, one can model schedule effects explicitly and determine precisely when a team has secured a play-off spot or has been eliminated from contention. The RIOT Baseball Play-off Races Web site developed at the University of California, Berkeley, provides automatic updates of new, optimization-based play-off race statistics each day of the major league baseball season. In developing the site, we found that we could determine the first-place elimination status of all teams in a division using a single linear-programming formulation, since a minimum win threshold for teams finishing in first place applies to all teams in a division. We identified a similar (but weaker) result for the problem of play-off elimination with wildcard teams.\n      </p>", "This article explores the complex relationship between baseball and the American presidency from William Howard Taft to Richard Nixon.

Using public data for the 1986 and 1987 seasons, our basic answer is yes, major league salaries generally coincide with estimated marginal revenue products, though significant deviations exist. Experienced players are paid in accord with their productivity; young players, however, are paid less than their marginal revenue product, on average.

The hypothesis is examined by detailed analysis of 782 professional games, and a supplementary analysis of a further 1000 games. It is shown that the scoring does vary significantly in the early innings, so that the same distribution cannot be used for each inning.
