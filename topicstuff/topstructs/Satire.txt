I argue that the precise character of this role comes into relief only when satire is located among the strategies Eliot marshals to reconcile the conflictual poles of his poetics: the critical-historical and the creative, tradition and innovation. Satire appears in the drafts of \"The Waste Land\" as an immanent means of managing the excesses of literary history, as a way for the \"mature poet\" to recollect the past while distinguishing himself from it. Accordingly, I suggest, satire's disappearance from the final version of the poem, and its replacement by the so-called \"mythical method,\" signals satire's failure to accomplish the specific tasks that Eliot sets for it.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Jacob e Dulce by Francisco Jo\u00e3o da Costa (better known by his pen name, Gip) was first published in book form in 1896 after serialization in the Goan newspaper O Ultramar.

First, it dispels the notion that, on one hand, satire and the satyr are unrelated because of uncertain etymologies and, on the other, that satire is an inherently destructive critical enterprise. Myth is deployed as a constructive means of juxtaposing Burke's conceptualization of satyrs with that of Friedrich Nietzsche. The Helhaven satire and \u201cEpilogue: Prologue in Heaven\u201d are then presented as illustrations of the satyric lurking throughout Burke's philosophy. Ultimately, a case is made for the figure of the satyr as a mythic goad by which to revise our understanding of contemporary satire as a comic enterprise.

Is the word actually \"satire\" or \"satyr\"? What is the appropriate character for the imagined speaker of a satire? In what style should a satire be written? Contrary to Renaissance theories associating satire with comedy or tragedy, Dryden treats it as a nondramatic verse genre. Contrary to much picturesque and influential speculative etymologizing, Dryden follows Casaubon in clarifying the derivation of \"satire\" from Latin \"satur,\" not Greek \"satyros.\" Contrary to the Elizabethan freakstereotype of the satyr-satirist, Dryden presents his notably unfreakish friend and patron Dorset as an ideal satirist personality. And contrary to a strong tradition that roughness and obscurity were proper to satiric style, Dryden, influenced by Boileau and Vergil, elaborately analyzes meters and stylistic delicacies, associating satire with nonsatiric kinds of poetry. In most respects the Discourse both epitomizes Dryden's own practices and foreshadows Pope's.\n      </p>", "I provide advice on sources of material for research publications and factors to consider in writing and publishing research articles and demonstrate how to combine grocery list considerations and academic publishing aspirations.

The confrontation between Morris and Napoleon in Napoleon greift ein expresses the author's condemnation of power politics, whether waged with economic blackmail (Morris) or with naked force (Napoleon). The contrast between the peace-loving natives and the domineering Spanish explorers in the \"Christoph Kolumbus\" offers a tongue-incheek commentary on \"advanced\" societies seeking to impose their way of life on others. Excepting some barbs against Mussolini in Napoleon, both plays are free of direct reference to topical issues. But \"Konflikt in Assyrien,\" a parody of the Book of Esther, bitterly assails the Nazi regime.

To understand these configurations in the context of democracy, I will show how institutions invariably called \"joking kinships\", \"cathartic alliances\" and \"joking alliances\" are used and reappropriated in the Burkinabe public debate. This is an analysis of the references of political actors (in the large sense of the term) to \"joking kinship\" in the public debate with a particular emphasis on the written press. On the basis of a case study of the satirical weekly Journal du Jeudi (JJ), I will show how joking kinship is practiced simultaneously to entertain and criticize. One of JJ's editorial lines is to promote joking kinship and insult the \"joking relatives\" of the Fulani, especially the Bobo and the Yarse. Although this policy mostly takes the form of mere mockery, alluding to the Bobo's millet beer consumption or the Yarse's commercial spirit, jokes are instrumentalized to serve the political satire.

The aim of this paper is to explore more fully the satirical section of the poem and, in particular, the lines focusing on Roman vices which contain a striking attenuation of the topos of misogyny.

This paper begins with an examination of its negative counterpart, satire, and then goes on to look at the connection between satire and the fili, and the connection of satire with praise, before proceeding to discuss the evidence from the law texts, which shows that the composition of praise-poetry was indeed an important function of the fili. The striking contrast between the wealth of praise-poems from the post-Norman period in Ireland and the paucity of such poems surviving from the pre-Norman period has been commented on by a number of scholars, and various attempts have been made to account for this. In all of these attempts, the question of the role of the fili in composing panegyric naturally has had to be addressed. While actual surviving examples of panegyric verse will of course not be ignored in this paper, I propose to approach the question obliquely, as it were, and concentrate firstly on the role of the fili as satirist and secondly on what the law texts have to tell us about the role of the fili as praise-poet. In a society where honour was so valued, the weapon of der 'satire' was especially to be feared.2 Moreover, it is to be expected that the law would be concerned with controlling the use of this weapon and with laying down the proper procedure for its lawful use, whether on behalf of the poet himself or on behalf of others. Although it is clear that a certain amount of relevant material has been lost,3 the surviving law texts still provide a remarkably detailed source of information on the uses of satire in early mediaeval Ireland.4 The procedures relating to satire have recently been examined by the present writer (Breatnach, 2004), and it is important to note that the lawful use of satire as an ultimate sanction is the prerogative of the fili rather than the bard\u00b2\n      </p>", "In the eighteenth century a preference for Juvenal as a satirist eventually replaced the normal Augustan preference for Horace. But the post-Augustan image of Juvenal was selective and sometimes inaccurate. Critics emphasized his sublimity, his occasional pathos, and his supposedly rational piety, while ignoring his obscenity, wit, and rhetorical control. There are near parallels in post-Augustan satiric practice. In William Gifford, satire becomes invective; in Charles Churchill, declamation. The new satire borders on Richardsonian and even Gothic melodrama. Or, at the other extreme, it is pseudo-Horatian and almost at the vanishing point (Christopher Anstey's \"New Bath Guide\"). The mock-heroic dwindles into burlesque (Peter Pindar's \"The Lousiad\"). The breakdown of the Augustan equilibrium means, in satire, a progressive failure of irony and especially of ironic diminution. Churchill's \"Dedication to Warburton\" is an important exception. It uses the new image of Juvenal in the service of mock-panegyric and enforces the Augustan satirist's traditional view of evil as privation.\n      </p>", "Action Psychologique et Satire Dans le Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Malien.

Each centers about an incognito duke who exposes a lascivious court. Yet in its course of action and resolution The Fawn seems closer to The Dutch Courtesan, in which Marston's raillery gives way to a type of curative exuberance. The Fawn, in fact, might be called a saturnalian satire, in which a process of suppling replaces the satirist's more traditional lancet and invective is superseded by a rhetoric of increase. Duke Hercules, the play's protagonist, appropriately spans both modes, and in purging Gonzago's court while assuring the perpetuation of his own royal line, the Duke symbolically completes two Herculean labors that held particular significance for Marston: the cleansing of the Augean stables and the creation of a royal line in Beotia. There is, however, an overall unity to Hercules's dual function\u2014his satiric and saturnalian roles\u2014as those who have defiled the court have done so by committing crimes against procreation.

This article, written in response to the article by Paul Raffield in this issue, concentrates on some questions about the telos of the genre. It emphasizes the circular structure of satire: satire criticizing the courts seems only capable of erecting another court that is subject to parallel flaws. Satire denigrates but also imitates jurisdiction, it might even be considered its secret accomplice despite the habitual idealizations of early modern theater, for many dramatists couldn't help but supplement the powers that be. At best, satirical drama may be seen as a \u201ccompromise formation\u201d between opposing forces in society, positing and undermining all of them simultaneously.\n      </p>", "Although some of the satiric energy of the 1790s carried over into the first decades of the following century, by 1850 satire had been eclipsed by other forms. This essay traces steps in the process by which satire ceased to be a genre-determining force in graphic art and in narrative, focusing first on George Cruikshank's contributions to the Comic Almanack (1835-53) and then on William Makepeace Thackeray's contributions to Punch (1843-48). Partly as a result of Thackeray's own actions, Vanity Fair (1847-48) was the last major British work for a generation that was primarily satiric.\n      </p>", "One level of the world of meaning projected by Tung Y\u00fceh's vernacular novel, Hsi-yu pu, is that defined by its satire. After preliminary discussion of the general nature and basic theme of the work attention is focused on five elements in Chinese life which become objects of satiric attack: the imperial court, the imperial examination system, men of blind attachment, traitors to China, and the military establishment. Following this there is an analysis of the kinds of satire used based on formal and non-formal distinctions developed out of Western literary criticism. The work contains monologue, parody, as well as narrative satire, and there are distinctions here in tone or attitude which correspond to the entire range on the Horatian-Juvenalian scale. The paper ends with a discussion of recent views on the social and political significance of the work as an example of protest against conditions in seventeenth-century China.\n      </p>", "Elfriede Jelinek has indicated in a variety of interviews that the Austrian Jewish satiric tradition, and Karl Kraus in particular, constitute the major formative influence on her own satiric writing. Like Kraus, Jelinek uses her satire to expose the role of the media in sustaining the socio-economic status quo. However, Kraus was a modernist who believed his satire would redeem both the German language and the Austrian body politic, while Jelinek writes in an age she regards as marked by hopeless fragmentation. This fragmentation is reflected in her individual characters' cognitive dysfunc-tionalism and in her portrayal of Austrian society as an irredeemably diseased and divided macrocosm. The distinctions between Kraus and Jelinek indicate a general divergence between modern and postmodern satire.\n      </p>", "Isaak Babel' is the author of two stories, \"Iisusov grekh\" [The Sin of Jesus], 1921, and \"Pan Apolek,\" 1923, that are written in the tradition of menippean satire. These stories are filled with the kind of blasphemy, profanation, and desacrilization Mikhail Bakhtin describes as salient characteristics of menippean satire. \"Sin\" is a graphic example of the menippean sub-genre of \"fantasticheskii rasskaz\" [the fantastic tale], and \"Apolek\" has clear affinities with the ancient genre of \"Cyprian's Supper.\" \"Sin\" and \"Apolek\" highlight prominent menippean features that pervade Babel'' s fiction. His Odessa stories are filled with carnivalistic, scandalous, and grotesque motifs that are very much in the menippean spirit. Babel\" s contribution to the menippea is his creation of a multiplicity of different, even conflicting plausible texts within the body of a single story. For Babel', heretic and blasphemer, menippean satire is the perfect vehicle for expressing his contradictory relationship with the culture he lived in.\n      </p>", "In this article, the author shows how satire destabilizes the distinction between human and animal. He identifies two tendencies in satire, the horatian and the juvenalian, and links these to two genres, the mock-heroic and the travesty, which are illustrated with various examples from Swift, Carlyle, and others. The human is best understood as a dynamic category continually redefined by its relations to animality, relations which are played out in an exemplary way in satire.\n      </p>", "With a very few exceptions, Hardy is not in his prose fiction concerned with social reform or social satire in a pamphleteering sense. In The Hand of Ethelberta, however, a novel isolated in many ways from his others, he tells us that he is attempting a form of satire. The objects of this satire are people (ranging from rustic servants, the members of the Chickerel family, affected London society and county aristocracy) and the structures of social snobbery. The success of his satirical exposure is variable. There are presented, however, in this novel of very mixed quality, intrinsic ironies which are so characteristic of his more applauded writings. One consequence is that, despite many melodramatic moments, some of the characters achieve sporadic viability. (GW)\n      </p>", "In Vanity Fair Thackeray moves beyond the inherited traditions of moral and social satire as his vision of society darkens and as he realizes the anarchic potentials of laughter and satire. Examining not the particular ills of a certain society, but the diseased structures inherent in civilization itself, Thackeray creates a world defined by madness and emptiness; in it satire holds little sway. In trying to locate alternatives to or a way out of an apparently inexorable pattern of death and destruction, Thackeray looks, through the image of childhood, toward a pastoral vision, one that assumes various and yet similar configurations for those characters who travel into this visionary landscape. As Charlotte Bront\u00eb intuited, Thackeray's novel embodies both the impulses of the moral and social satirist and those of the visionary or prophet. It is the final irreconcilability of these double impulses that accounts for much of the power and haunting quality of Vanity Fair.\n      </p>", "In a classical understanding of satire, its secondary status\u2014giving in to literary distortions of an underlying reality\u2014leads to a paradoxical trap. Satire seeks to reinstate a nonliterary norm by literary means. Shakespearean romance shares the paradoxical character of the satirical, but opens up an alternative response. Instead of attempting to eliminate the violation of norms, romance confronts an underlying tragic subplot of violence and crime with a decisively theatrical solution that acknowledges the secondary character of this response. The paradigmatic romance The Tempest exposes this trait in a specific sea-change, a shift of focus toward the nonserious and nonrealistic. This sea-change culminates in a comic solution that takes place within a literary setting and remains, in a sense, ineffective, especially if one takes into account the latent threat and latent presence of the usurper's son, which most critics, like the protagonist, have persisted in overlooking.\n      </p>", "This article examines the role of graphic satire as a tool of agitation and criticism during the early 1640s, taking as its case study the treatment of the archbishop of Canterbury and his episcopal associates at the hands of engravers, etchers, and pamphlet illustrators. Previous research into the political ephemera of early modern England has been inclined to sideline its pictorial aspects in favour of predominantly textual material, employing engravings and woodcuts in a merely illustrative capacity. Similarly, studies into the contemporary relationship between art, politics, and power have marginalized certain forms of visual media, in particular the engravings and woodcuts which commonly constitute graphic satire, focusing instead on elite displays of authority and promoting the concept of a distinct dichotomy between 'high' and 'low' culture and their consumers. It is argued here that the pictorial, and in particular graphic, arts formed an integral part of a wider culture of propaganda and critique during this period, incorporating drama, satire, reportage, and verse, manipulating and appropriating ideas and imagery familiar to a diverse audience. It is further proposed that such a culture was both in its own time and at present only fully understood and appreciated when consumed and considered in these interdisciplinary terms.\n      </p>", "Brecht's early drama Trommeln in der Nacht will move from underneath the shadows of the author's later, more famous works, if it is read as a literary satire. Brecht's attacks, in Trommeln in der Nacht, except for the satire directed at the Expressionists, have largely gone unrecognized. But by approaching it from its anti-bourgeois perspective, the drama's polemic intent against the bourgeois tragedy, from Lessing's Miss Sara Sampson to Hauptmann's Rose Bernd, becomes evident. Brecht caricatures particularly the traditional prototypes of the genre: the unwed mother, the concerned and punctilious parents, etc. The Romantic aspects of B\u00fcchner's Woyzek, which Brecht also considered a bourgeois tragedy, is similarly parodied. Anti-Romanticism also impelled Brecht's lampooning of Richard Wagner, which included a caricature of the \"Ride of the Valkyries\" and some of Wagner's stylistic peculiarities. In following his satiric intent, Brecht chose pejorative tropes directed at literature and parodic names for his characters, particularly striking in the case of a minor figure, Zibeben-Manke. Trommeln in der Nacht, one of Brecht's early works, thus foreshadows the master of literary satire and hence gains a new place in Brecht's oeuvre and in German literature.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "The Satires of Juvenal's fifth book constitute an important chapter in the satiric genre's dialogue with philosophy.

Its classical legacy promised an elite status and authorial control, but its brevity and wit encouraged widespread oral, manuscript, and print circulation, and epigrammatists therefore struggled to distinguish their work from various popular forms, such as the ballad. The sub-genre of the epitaph was often used for satiric purposes, and examples prompted by the death of the epigrammatist John Owen provide a case study in the dynamics of poetic and political exchange.\n      </p>", "Karl Kraus's undaunted campaign to halt the rotary mechanism of the press determined that his own work and his self-reflection as a satirist were bound by structures of continuity and repetition and their rhetorical expression. A crisis comparable to the 'language crisis' of modernism alternates with qualitatively different repetition, the regeneration of the artist of language in literary and erotic experience. The image of a conservative anti-modernist invoking the values of 'the origin' against modernity is revised, in so far as the negations of satire exploit repetition and differentiation performatively, a practice that is compared and contrasted with deconstruction.\n      </p>", "Antonio Tabucchi, in \"L'oca al passo\" (2006), satirizes Italy's political class by arranging in non-chronological order a collection of editorials.

The non-linear ordering of the essays also prompts an interrogation of the act of reading; particularly the narrative representation of simultaneity through language, a medium that can exist only in time.

The Society's position that no scientific inquiry is valid unless it serves a utilitarian end is opposed to Sir Nicholas's conviction that the practical application to be derived from scientific experiments is irrelevant and that knowledge is an end in itself.

In recent decades, perceptions of the work in both the German- and the English-speaking world have become assimilated to conceptions of the 'postmodern', resulting in a downplaying of its sense of satirical and ethical purpose. This article reviews the significance of the satirical qualities in Musil's text, noting their affinity with the writings of Karl Kraus, and then proposes a basis for a critical assessment of the claim that \"The Man without Qualities\" is a 'postmodern' text.

It attacks the extreme position of those denouncing religious ritual and espousing the study of the classics as an alternative to prayer. The counterpoint between the liturgical framework of the poem and Jane's wandering thoughts serves as a commentary on the inefficacy of both affective devotions and classical studies as a substitute means of achieving spirituality. Skelton agrees that affective devotion inspired religious hysteria on the one hand and sacrilege on the other. The parodies of popular carols and hymns he employs in his description of Jane Scrope show that the language of fine amour should be returned to its rightful place - secular art forms. That Jane ultimately finds solace in the traditional liturgy illustrates Skelton's conservative Catholic stance.\n      </p>", "Saltykov-Shchedrin's satire may be of interest today only to the historian of social relations in Russia.

The Preface to Pym, however, provides evidence that the work was satirical in nature, a parody of the novel of adventure. Poe's quarrel with the American reading public (manifested in the \"Drake-Halleck\" review) and the pressure from his publisher to produce a long work for \"the multitude\" led him to direct his satire against the vulgarity of popular taste. In the apparently forthright Preface of \"A. G. Pym,\" Poe uses irony to reveal his contemptuous attitude toward the reading public. A comparison of the fantastic final scenes of the narrative with Pym's concern for \"veracity\" in the Preface indicates the deceptive nature of the introduction and establishes its place in the satirical strategy of the novel. The use of a persona probably reflects Poe's desire to conceal his authorship, but ironically, the first review of the novel placed the responsibility for its \"ignorance\" on Poe's shoulders, based on the evidence provided by the Preface.

Corbett's work, almost all of which might be categorized as panegyric or satire, is unashamedly controversial. Most notably, he stigmatizes Puritans as enemies of the state, and identifies himself with the interests of George Villiers, duke of Buckingham, consistently confronting the plethora of anonymous libels that attacked the notorious royal favourite. Consequently, he not only claims a status as spokesman for the crown and court, but also emerges as a figure rival poets might attack, in the process refining their own nascent poetics of opposition. The article examines poems by and about Corbett, in an effort to delineate the literary structures of cultural and political division. It also compares his work to that of his contemporaries, including Ben Jonson and Thomas Carew, and argues that it typifies fundamental contemporary shifts in approaches to the poetry of praise and blame. Indeed, it might be argued that Corbett helped to define a literature of early Stuart royalism.\n      </p>", "Although traditionally associated with the stage, the dramatic satire of Martin Marprelate is actually a unique adaptation of traditional rhetoric. The standard Elizabethan authorities on rhetoric\u2014Aristotle, Cicero, Quintilian, and Wilson\u2014all justify Marprelate's decision to answer serious religious arguments facetiously, but the complex dramatic manner in which he assumes the classical posture of the eiron and forces his opponent John Bridges into the role of the alazon reveals an original satiric genius. Consciously manipulating a variety of ironic postures, Martin extends his personae of the vociferous clown, country simpleton, and dissembling auditor into the posture of an antirhetorician. A series of imaginatively fictionalized contexts, derived in part from rhetorical techniques and designed to simulate actual confrontations, further transforms sterile polemic into an elaborate parody of serious disputation. Egregiously misusing rhetoric and flauntingly acknowledging the calculated sophistry, the satires effectively undercut the dignity of Bridges's position and dispel the seriousness of his arguments. In the process, traditional rhetoric is turned against itself as Martin Marprelate, moving beyond specific and now dated religious issues, recognizes both the strength and danger inherent in facile rhetoric.\n      </p>", "The Codex Parisinus Latinus 7558 (9th century) contains a unique piece of Christian Latin poetry of the early 5th century, presumably written in southern Gaul. The author cannot be identified with certainty, since the title in the manuscript seems to be erroneous. However, the poem which consists of some 110 hexameters, pretends to be a dialogue (a form common to monastic literature) between an older monk, Thesbon, and a younger host, Salmon, who had been living in the monastery for a while, but has returned to his hometown. In his narration he refers to the invasions of barbarians, considering them-like St. Augustine and, later on, Salvianus-as a punishment for not obeying God's commandments by not fighting against the real, inner enemy, that is to say the devil. Asked by Thesbon, Salmon delivers a traditionally styled Roman satire on men's and women's vices. Only the evening service brings the dialogue to an end. This and some other details, already set in the starting lines, evoke a peaceful bucolic scenario, which perfectly fits with the concept of monastic life as an anticipation of the peace in paradise.\n      </p>", "Drawing on material in the newly published supplementary volumes (2007) of the Nestroy edition (HKA), the article argues that scepticism towards scholarship and advances in knowledge cannot be reduced to a biographical explanation (Nestroy's education and family background), nor to the traditional opposition between 'popular' theatre and high culture: he followed with scepticism press reports of technological progress and of scholarly controversy, and his characters are aware of the limitations of knowledge, but Vincenz's scorn for study in \"Die beiden Herrn S\u00f6hne\" is an extreme case. In general his satire shows respect for learning and for culture, while testing them against ideals of truth and authenticity. Nestroys Werk weist eine Reihe von Beispielen der Skepsis gegen\u00fcber Forschung und Wissenschaft auf, die sich weder mit biographischen Faktoren wie seiner Herkunft aus dem Bildungsb\u00fcrgertum noch mit dem Gegensatz zwischen 'Volkstheater' und Hochkultur erkl\u00e4ren l\u00e4\u00dft. Wie aus den 2007 erschienenen Nachtragsb\u00e4nden zur Nestroy-HKA hervorgeht, verfolgte er Presseberichte \u00fcber technologische Fortschritte und wissenschaftliche Kontroversen mit Skepsis, und seine Figuren sind sich der Grenzen des Wissens bewu\u00dft.

Scholars have assumed he wrote it in Florence in the mid-1640's, but this article shows through documentary evidence, as well as an analysis of stylistic changes in his paintings, that Rosa composed it in the second half of 1650, after his return to Rome. This date coincides with a renewed interest in the Bamboccianti by Roman patrons and the consequent resentment by serious painters such as Rosa, who considered himself a painter-philosopher and desired acceptance by the academic establishment, whose views on painting his Satire parallels.\n      </p>", "This article identifies a major contradiction in J\u00fcrgen Habermas's theory of the emergent public sphere. In his account, Habermas gives pride of place to Swift and his fellow Tory satirists. Their assault on the Whig oligarchy, he suggests, is emblematic of public-sphere debate-even though Swift and Company are also the public sphere's fiercest critics. This contradiction is not simply Habermas's; it is the Tories' own. The defining challenge facing the Tory satirists is to conduct a critique of the public sphere-that is, a critique of critique itself-from within that sphere's institutions. We might best understand such satire, then, as a kind of publishing that is not public, a genre that circulates freely in the print marketplace while renouncing the standards of public rationality. Tory satire will bestow this project on the category of literature that emerges later in the century-the project of a public textuality that operates outside the public sphere.\n      </p>", "Parody and satire (and their relations) are redefined on the basis of previous descriptions of these genres. This revision, methodologically founded on an instrumentalist approach, argues the relevance and/or validity of two genre traits for the analysis of Mantel and Torrente's novels. Concerning parody, the requisite that source texts and norms possess an aesthetic or literary nature is refuted and replaced by a more functional, semiotic approach; this semiotic metalanguage is used to describe the diagnoses of Catholicism in the fictional worlds of the novels studied. Concerning satire, the overdetermination and possible orthodoxy of the messages of these novels are shown to be deliberately blurred by the plots imagined by the authors.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

This interest developed at a time when middle class homes, particularly in America, began receiving a host of electrical appliances. Much of this new art of technology was highly satirical, often in sympathy with the invention cartoons of the American, Rube Goldberg. In fact, some artists, particularly Duchamp, were inspired by the Goldberg cartoons. Both the Goldberg inventions and some of the fine art works produced since 1910 follow a style of satire described by Sigmund Freud. They also point out some of the basic characteristics of modern technology that most observers have failed to see. /// L'auteur remarque que l'une des seules caract\u00e9ristiques des beaux arts depuis 1910 a \u00e9t\u00e9 la reconnaissance de la technologie et des machines en tant que th\u00e8mes d'inspiration pour les peintres et les sculpteurs.

By examining these verses both in terms of their initial moment of manuscript circulation and their republication in print some fifty years later, this article explores how and why readers returned to topical satire long after its moment had passed.\n      </p>", "At Juvenal 5.141-45, Virro distributes a curious series of presents to the children of his impoverished client Trebius: a viridis thorax, nuts, and an as. Through an exploration of the connotations attached to these gifts, I argue that the scene provides a vivid mise en abyme for the rest of the poem. Just as the dinner offered to Trebius is not only meager but transforms him into a buffoon, the presents given to his children are both mean and perverse. In particular, the viridis thorax has un-Roman and effeminate connotations akin to the description of patronage as a sexual perversion in Satire 9.\n      </p>", "This article examines Sam Sly's African Journal (1843-51), a literary and satirical newspaper published by William Layton Sommons in Cape Town. It contends that the newspaper utilised satire to forge British cultural affinity in the colony, as well as to encourage and preserve the conservative social boundaries of propriety and family values espoused by white middle-class colonists. This differed from the more widely studied position of satire as a subversive challenge to the established order, with Sammons avoiding sexually explicit, scandalous humour or overt attacks on personal character. In a period of growing white consensus, the African Journal's use of satire in the 1840s formed part of the cultural politics of establishing bourgeois values through the medium of appreciation of British literature and popular culture. Satire in Sam Sly's African Journal thus functioned ideologically to extend British cultural dominance and affinities, and to preserve and instil white bourgeois moral codes. Although much satire was shorn of the racial reality of the Cape Colony, seeking to replicate an impression of metropolitan whiteness, those satires that focused on race derided the Khoikhoi and Xhosa as incapable of achieving equality with whites, drawing on growing anti-humanitarian sentiment in the Cape. The African Journal's popularity, however, diminished in the face of the anti-convict agitation of 1848-50, when colonists opposed the landing of ticket-of-leave convicts from Ireland as an impediment to the goal of representative government, through petitions and boycotting supplying to the government. Satirising these measures as a radical betrayal of British loyalty, Sommons's support dwindled owing to his criticism of popular feeling.\n      </p>", "In the 1960s, satire in American drama reached a climax. Especially experimental plays combined provocative contents with sensual form in order to achieve an elaborate potpourri of mockery. Some of the theatrical scene's most notable playwrights in that genre were Jean-Claude van Itallie, Ronald Tavel, and Arthur Kopit. They fought hard against hypocrisy and an absolute belief in progress, against a popular culture that was getting out of hand, as well as against distorting historical myths. This essay investigates the satirical elements these authors made use of, by analyzing some of their prominent dramas: van Itallie's America Hurrah (1965), Tavel's Gorilla Queen (1967), and Kopit's Indians (1968). Frequently employed satirical means are exaggeration, anachronous use of language, gesture, and music, display of theatre as a making of theatre, parodistic citation of Hollywood movie scenes, and general transparency of theatrical effects. These satirical elements, which led to a theatre of dissonance, and often to consciously bad art, were effective means of satire but were hardly suited to suggest a vision of America that went beyond the criticized American Dream.\n      </p>", "O ensaio procura observar o desencontro entre a hist\u00f3ria oficial do pa\u00eds e aquela representada em \"Triste fim de Policarpo Quaresma\", de Lima Barreto, configurando a carnavaliza\u00e7\u00e3o dos fatos e a representa\u00e7\u00e3o caricatural de suas figuras, notadamente ao que se refere \u00e0 Revolta da Armada e a Floriano Peixoto. /// The paper tries to explain the divergency between Brazilian official history and the one depicted in Lima Barreto's novel \"Triste fim de Policarpo Quaresma\".

The Memoirs establishes the courtesan Baddeley as a sentimental heroine and translates her experience of domestic violence and sexual double standards into a satire of fashionable society. Steele's narrative therefore anticipates the sentimental self-portraits of nineteenth-century women writers and looks back to an earlier tradition of the referential scandal chronicle. In addition, it reveals the impact of the commercial exchanges of the literary marketplace on female self-representations.\n      </p>", "Sermones 2.1 stages a dialectic between satire and the law through a dialogue between a satirist, Horace, and a jurist, Gaius Trebatius Testa. At stake is the relative power of the two rival discourses and what each says about contemporary politics. Caesar Augustus has recently consolidated power and put an end to civil war, changing what people could say in public. Through allusion to more and less familiar laws, Horace explores the extent to which freedom of speech still existed. Although he presents his position as impotent before the law, his friendship with Caesar trumps Trebatius' legal formalism. The power of the satirist has been reduced from wicked humor to the license to point out the restriction in his voice\u2014a critique whose gentleness masks its wit.\n      </p>", "L'analyse de la situation juridique de la satire et de la caricature en Allemagne et l'\u00e9tude de quelques d\u00e9cisions de justice permettent de mesurer \u00e0 quel point le l\u00e9gislateur \u00e9prouve des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 d\u00e9finir ces deux genres et \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une l\u00e9gislation claire.

The analysis of the legal status of satire and satirical cartoon in Germany as well as the study of some court decisions enable us to size up the legislator's difficulties in defining these two genres and in establishing a clear legislation. The number of court actions varies in time and shows an increase in recent years owing to the number of private complaints. These juridical data do not enable us, however, to apprehend the global context in which these complaints are lodged and these satirical creations produced and received. German satirists and cartoonists must take into account the tolerance threshold of German public opinion regarding graphical virulence and must willy-nilly consent to a self-censorship that is generally more severe than in France. Die Analyse der rechtlichen Lage von Satire und Karikatur in Deutschland sowie die Untersuchung einiger Gerichtsentscheidungen lassen die Schwierigkeiten des Gesetzgebers erkennen, diese beiden Genres zu definieren und eine klare Gesetzgebung zu etablieren.

A new type of mimic satire was created by Crotus Rubeanus, Ulrich von Hutten, and the other authors by distorting the language and by addressing fictional letters to Ortwin Gratius-a real-life Cologne humanist and opponent of Reuchlin. An important dimension of their satirical technique was exaggeration of salutations and the use of ridiculous names for the correspondents. Many of these names referred to the lower class of farmers, artisans, and craftsmen. In devising the characterizations of correspondents, the authors relied on assumptions of class and education that may be found in Johannes Murmellius' Didascalici libri duo and other humanist texts.

The attitudes and techniques developed by Nelson and his increasing competitors affected Berlin operetta and the lavish Broadway- type shows of the later Twenties no less than the political theater of the artistic left.
