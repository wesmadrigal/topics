{"total_words": 448, "documents": ["In this article Francis Bacon's 1953 painting \"Two Figure\" is approached through an archive consisting of popular and banal visual and written texts that are related to social/sexual practices and pleasures that in the 1950s were increasingly identified in the popular press as 'homosexual'. It is suggested that \"Two Figures\" can be viewed within a history of social and sexual encounters between men that were orchestrated by class difference and influenced by the visual and sexual economy of 1930s' German modernism. The article explores how this economy is popularized and re-presented on the pages of British and American fitness, physique, and wrestling magazines of the 1950s, and how the classified advertisements in these magazines provide a popular context for making sense of Bacon's painting. Whilst this article may go some way to explain the production of the painting, it is focused more on constructing and exploring possible understandings of the painting that may have been available to some viewers when it was first exhibited in London during 1953. The article also introduces 'cruising' as a historically contingent mode of attention that organizes an approach towards, or circulation around, \"Two Figures\".\n      </p>", "Cultivation of the bodily skills required in cavalry warfare was a prominent theme in India's pre-colonial societies. Demand for these expertises enabled fighting specialists to develop an India-wide network of patronage and employment. Wrestling and its associated exercises became the indispensable accompaniment to military preparation in the early modern period. Appreciation of the wide social diffusion of these expertises also allows for a better understanding of colonial demilitarization, the displacement of important cultures of the body, as well as the loss of mobility and honorable employment. /// La formation aux arts de la guerre mont\u00e9e fut une caract\u00e9ristique dominante important dans les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s pr\u00e9coloniales de l'Inde.

Initiators of wrestling and choice of wrestling partners were identified. All otters wrestled, some as often as 15-20 bouts/h. They wrestled significantly less often during the breeding season than in months preceding the breeding season. Females and males wrestled at similar rates, but mixed-sex wrestling bouts were initiated by females almost twice as often as by males. In same-sex bouts, dominant otters initiated wrestling nearly 5 times as often as subordinates.\n      </p>", "There are two themes for consideration in the field of wrestling: the fights themselves and the sport's wide coverage in the media. The origins of wrestling lie in the various forms of combat staged in ancient Greece and Rome, some of which now feature as Olympic sports. The problem of whether a fight is staged or \"real\" in professional wrestling is not the point: even if a corporation - and not the wrestlers - has decided who will be the winner and who the loser, the wrestlers still require exceptional athletic training to be able to wrestle without damaging either themselves or their adversary; it seems that wrestlers train more as partners than opponents. The wrestling stage is full of theatrical elements: the entrance, the speech before the combat, the costumes and masks worn, special gestures and movements made, and the nicknames of the individual wrestlers, all of which contribute to defining the athletes' characters, who in turn often reflect contemporary multi-cultural society. Wrestling bouts have the appearance of serial stories (soap operas, etc.) and the characters are divided into good and evil, but they sometimes pass from one side to the other.\n      </p>", "Sociologists have long studied how moral entrepreneurs construct claimsmaking campaigns. However, their opponents' strategies to mount counterclaimsmaking campaigns are less studied. This article examines how the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) used humor to attack its enemy, the Parents Television Council. By using narrative structures familiar to its fans, the WWF exploited characteristics of its opponent suitable for parody. It created a group of wrestlers called the Right to Censor who preached the moral values espoused by the Parents Television Council, yet were the most flagrant cheaters in the industry. This case study shows that under the right circumstances counterclaimsmaking using irony and satire can be effective.\n      </p>", "An examination of texts in Lucian, and particularly the usage of the term aithrion, leads to the conclusion that Greeks of the Roman period practiced both sand and mud wrestling in the open air. Features of the palaestra at Olympia seem to be consistent with this conclusion, and the query is posed to archaeologists as to whether other monuments support this view or not.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

A case can be made that Chapman reveals himself not only in his Stoic characters but also, and centrally, in most of his poems, plays, and translations, and that he deliberately selected subject matter which best characterized his own outlook and personal feelings. Through time, and in a considerable diversity of genres, he favors a relatively simple pattern of expression (though the manner of expression is often complicated), and when the usual pattern does not appear he gives us an obvious variation of it. The good man's confrontation with a corrupt, hostile, and often destructive world is the image of reality Chapman favors, but the necessity for consolation for numerous adversities is often a concomitant part of that experience. Many characters, fictional and historical, past and contemporary, in their coping with reality can be read as guises for Chapman's own wrestling with the world.\n      </p>", "This study in comparative midrash traces the accounts of the death of Josiah through more than a dozen texts and translations.

The study traces how performers do this physical labor and the social consequences of such work.

The adaptive significance of this widespread dimorphism has attracted much speculation, but few tests. We took advantage of huge mating aggregations of red-sided gartersnakes (Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis) in southern Manitoba to test two (non-exclusive) hypotheses about the selective forces responsible for this dimorphism. Our data support both hypotheses. First, relative tail length affects the size of the male copulatory organs (hemipenes). Males with longer tails relative to body length have longer hemipenes, presumably because of the additional space available (the hemipenes are housed inside the tail base). Second, relative tail length affects male mating success. Males with partial tail loss (due to predation or misadventure) experienced a threefold reduction in mating success. Among males with intact tails, we detected strong stabilizing selection on relative tail length in one of the two years of our study. Thus, our data support the notion that sex divergence in tail length relative to body length in snakes reflects the action of sexual selection for male mating success.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The two compositions differ, however, in style, the lines of the drawing reducing the design to bare essentials, closely resembling the pure Abbasid style of a small group of wall paintings of a destroyed hammam in Fustat, very close to those of Samarra of the 9th century. The dating of the hammam to the Fatimid period is unconfirmed, and it would, in fact, appear that both the drawing and the wall paintings belong to a period before the imported Abbasid style mixed with the local Hellenistic one.

It briefly sketches in the history of radio in South Africa and the oppressive role of apartheid ideology in its formation and development. It also provides a commentary on the role of radio drama as a producer of culture throughout the apartheid years and into the post-apartheid era. Arguing that radio drama in Zulu has become a clearly definable aural genre deeply involved in contemporary South African life and intimately connected to the needs and desires of its large audience, the paper takes the reader through the decades of the 1950s and 1960s and shows how the skills of writing, producing and acting were the terrain of a small and talented group of practitioners who bypassed the snares of the censor and attracted an eager and discerning audience among both urban and rural listeners. A number of dramas are discussed and questions raised concerning the role of language in providing a medium for `multi-accentual' engagement with a changing contemporary culture and with the past.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "In this article, the author argues that we need to conceptualize gender as a social structure, and by doing so, we can better analyze the ways in which gender is embedded in the individual, interactional, and institutional dimensions of our society. To conceptualize gender as a structure situates gender at the same level of general social significance as the economy and the polity. The author also argues that while concern with intersectionality must continue to be paramount, different structures of inequality have different constructions and perhaps different influential causal mechanisms at any given historical moment. We need to follow a both/and strategy to understand gender structure, race structure, and other structures of inequality as they currently operate while also systematically paying attention to how these axes of domination intersect. Finally, the author suggests we pay more attention to doing research and writing theory with explicit attention to how our work can indeed help transform as well as inform society.\n      </p>", "This article presents selected findings from a qualitative practitioner study into the learning experiences of 30 immigrant ESL high school students in a 3-day innovative, Freirean-styled, antidiscrimination leadership program. This case study is grounded in a social identity theoretical framework which assumes that linguistic interactions are not neutral nor is the right to be listened to universally accorded, but that these are linked to identity and structured through social power relations (including racism). In this article I first ask how students came to understand race and racism as they used the integrative antiracism analytical framework of the program to examine examples of discrimination from their personal experience. Second, I ask what implications their analysis had for their identity claims as immigrant ESL learners. The research argues for an understanding of racialized power dynamics as integral to social identity construction through English language learning, especially as they intersect with discourses of national identity and cultural citizenship in the case of immigrant ESL learners. The study suggests that integrative antiracism education can support immigrant language learners' intersectional and multilevel understandings of discrimination. These expanded understandings of discrimination can also facilitate broader possibilities for social identity claims and ethical visions of Canadianness.\n      </p>", "The concept of linguistic relativity is helpful in an inquiry into the diverse meanings of nationhood. This article traces the concept of 'zhongua minzu' (Chinese nation) through history. At face value and taken out of the international context, minzu conveys the cognitive meaning of ethnic group today, with no connotation of popular sovereignty at all. However, it is the time agency and international circumstances of its first usage that determines the real connotation of the word. It was first used by the Han Chinese elites in the 1870s. The newly loaned minzu internally denoted the Han Chinese as a minzu that aimed to topple the Manchu regime and establish a more capable self-government. Externally it denoted China as a minzu aiming at restoring its respectable position in the world if not as the central country. This double connotation has given rise in modern times to a chronic endless and hopeless debate over the definition of minzu. The linguistic fact that a word for minzu was absent until the turn of the century, and its muddling connotation since then shows that China was not and did not conceive itself as a nation until it faced the power of western nations. If one of the criteria of a nation is that it recognises its equals in the world, China did not reach the perception until the late 19th century.\n      </p>", "In seahorses, only males undergo a pregnancy. It had been tacitly and explicitly assumed that seahorses were sex role reversed (that females competed more intensely than males for access to mates), on the basis that male pregnancy so limited male reproduction as to produce a female-biased operational sex ratio (OSR). However, this supposition had never been investigated. The laboratory experiments in this paper demonstrate that, contrary to expectations, seahorses exhibit conventional sex roles: male seahorses compete more intensely than females for access to mates, on both the first and final days of courtship. Competing males are more active than competing females in those courtship and competitive behaviours common to both sexes, and only males exhibit uniquely competitive behaviours (wrestling and snapping). Males which succeeded in copulating are heavier than their rivals and copulating seahorses of both sexes generally are more active in courtship and competition than are their unsuccessful rivals. The finding that seahorses maintain conventional sex roles requires us to reconsider the impact of male pregnancy on the OSR.\n      </p>", "The postnatal development of agonistic behavior patterns in the wolf, coyote and grey fox are described, and in the red and Arctic fox which were first observed at a later age. Piloerection and back arching were present in all species, the latter behavior being especially well developed in the grey fox. The orientation of attack was almost exclusively directed at the cheek in the grey fox, but in other canids the shoulder hackle area, throat and muzzle area were also attacked; prolonged bouts of jaw-muzzle wrestling occurred in the wolf, scruff-wrestling in wolf and coyote and dog, and cheek-wrestling in the grey fox during agonistic play (play-fighting). Orientation of attack was correlated with distinctive body markings in various species. The contribution of social experience in the ontogeny of scruff-oriented attack was demonstrated in hand-raised isolated dogs and visually deprived group-raised dogs. The significance of head-turning, looking away and avoidance of eye contact in the wolf and dog is discussed. /// On a observ\u00e9 le d\u00e9veloppement post-natal d'un comportement \u00e0 tendances agressives chez le Loup, le Coyote et le Renard gris.
