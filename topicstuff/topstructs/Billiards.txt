{"total_words": 278, "documents": ["Billiards are the simplest models for understanding the statistical theory of the dynamics of a gas in a closed compartment. We analyze the dynamics of a class of billiards (the open billiard on the plane) in terms of invariant and conditionally invariant probabilities. The dynamical system has a horseshoe structure. The stable and unstable manifolds are analytically described. The natural probability \u03bc is invariant and has support in a Cantor set. This probability is the conditional limit of a conditional probability mF that has a density with respect to the Lebesgue measure. A formula relating entropy, Lyapunov exponent, and Hausdorff dimension of a natural probability \u03bc for the system is presented. The natural probability \u03bc is a Gibbs state of a potential \u03c8 (cohomologous to the potential associated to the positive Lyapunov exponent; see formula (0.1)), and we show that for a dense set of such billiards the potential \u03c8 is not lattice. As the system has a horseshoe structure, one can compute the asymptotic growth rate of n(r), the number of closed trajectories with the largest eigenvalue of the derivative smaller than r. This theorem implies good properties for the poles of the associated Zeta function and this result turns out to be very important for the understanding of scattering quantum billiards.\n      </p>", "Some questions concerning the orbits of a billiard ball in a polygon are studied. It is shown that almost all such orbits come arbitrarily close to a vertex of the polygon, implying that the entropy of the corresponding geodesic flow is zero. For polygons with rational angles, we show by using interval exchange transformations that almost all orbits are spatially dense. Two applications are given.\n      </p>", "We consider stochastic analogs of classical billiard systems. A particle moves at unit speed with constant direction in the interior of a bounded, d-dimensional region with continuously differentiable boundary. The boundary need not be connected; that is, the \"table\" may have interior \"obstacles.\" When the particle strikes the boundary, a new direction is chosen uniformly at random from the directions that point back into the interior of the region and the motion continues. Such chains are closely related to those that appear in shake-and-bake simulation algorithms. For the discrete time Markov chain that records the locations of successive hits on the boundary, we show that, uniformly in the starting point, there is exponentially fast total variation convergence to an invariant distribution. By analyzing an associated nonlinear, first-order PDE, we investigate which regions are such that this chain is reversible with respect to surface measure on the boundary. We also establish a result on uniform total variation C\u00e9saro convergence to equilibrium for the continuous time Markov process that tracks the position and direction of the particle. A key ingredient in our proof is a result on the geometry of C1 regions that can be described loosely as follows: associated with any bounded C1 region is an integer N such that it is always possible to pass a message between any two locations in the region using a relay of exactly N locations with the property that every location in the relay is directly visible from its predecessor. Moreover, the locations of the intermediaries can be chosen from a fixed, finite subset of positions on the boundary of the region. We also consider corresponding results for polygonal regions in the plane.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "As an emergent electronic material and model system for condensed-matter physics, graphene and its electrical transport properties have become a subject of intense focus. By performing low-temperature transport spectroscopy on single-layer and bilayer graphene, we observe ballistic propagation and quantum interference of multiply reflected waves of charges from normal electrodes and multiple Andreev reflections from superconducting electrodes, thereby realizing quantum billiards in which scattering only occurs at the boundaries. In contrast to the conductivity of conventional two-dimensional materials, graphene's conductivity at the Dirac point is geometry-dependent because of conduction via evanescent modes, approaching the theoretical value $4e^{2}/\\pi h$ (where e is the electron charge and h is Planck's constant) only for short and wide devices. These distinctive transport properties have important implications for understanding chaotic quantum systems and implementing nanoelectronic devices, such as ballistic transistors.\n      </p>", "A Dirac hamiltonian describing massless spin-half particles (`neutrinos') moving in the plane r = (x, y) under the action of a 4-scalar (not electric) potential V(r) is, in position representation, H = -i\u210f c\u03c3\u00b7\u2207 + V(r)\u03c3z, where \u03c3 = (\u03c3x, \u03c3y) and \u03c3z are the Pauli matrices; \u0124 acts on two-component column spinor wavefunctions \u03c8(r) = (\u03c81,\u03c82) and has eigenvalues \u210f ckn. H does not possess time-reversal symmetry (T). If V(r) describes a hard wall bounding a finite domain D (`billiards'), this is equivalent to a novel boundary condition for \u03c82/\u03c81. T-breaking is interpreted semiclassically as a difference of \u03c0 between the phases accumulated by waves travelling in opposite senses round closed geodesics in D with odd numbers of reflections. The semiclassical (large-k) asymptotics of the eigenvalue counting function (spectral staircase) N(k) are shown to have the `Weyl' leading term Ak2/4\u03c0, where A is the area of D, but zero perimeter correction. The Dirac equation is transformed to an integral equation round the boundary of D, and forms the basis of a numerical method for computing the kn. When D is the unit disc, geodesics are integrable and the eigenvalues, which satisfy Jl(kn) = Jl+1(kn), are (locally) Poisson-distributed. When D is an `Africa' shape (cubic conformal map of the unit disc), the eigenvalues are (locally) distributed according to the statistics of the gaussian unitary ensemble of random-matrix theory, as predicted on the basis of T-breaking and lack of geometric symmetry.\n      </p>", "Quantum ergodicity for classically chaotic systems has been studied extensively both theoretically and experimentally in mathematics and physics. Despite this long tradition we are able to prove a new rigorous result using only elementary calculus. In the case of the famous Bunimovich stadium shown in Figure 1, we prove that the wave functions have to spread to any neighborhood of the wings.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The c&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; are used to test the following conjectures. (a) The sequence of c&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; diverges factorially, controlled by the shortest accessible real or complex periodic geodesic. (b) If this is a 2-bounce orbit, it corresponds to the saddle of the chord length function whose contour is first crossed when climbing from the diagonal of the Mobius strip which is the space of chords of B. (c) This orbit gives an exponential contribution to the remainder when the Weyl series, truncated at its least term, is subtracted from the resolvent; the exponential switches on smoothly (according to an error function) where it is smallest, that is across the negative energy axis (Stokes line). These conjectures are motivated by recent results in asymptotics. They survive tests for the circle billiard, and for a family of curves with 2 and 3 bulges, where the dominant orbit is not always the shortest and is sometimes complex. For some systems which are not smooth billiards (e.g. a particle on a ring, or in a billiard where \u2202 B is a polygon), the Weyl series terminates and so no geodesics are accessible; for a particle on a compact surface of constant negative curvature, only the complex geodesics are accessible from the Weyl series.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The singularities may be sources or sinks of V. We study them numerically and display them graphically for two families of hamiltonians whose degeneracy structure is typical. First is a particle moving along a line segment with kinetic energy quartic in the momentum ('quartic-momentum square well'); the X are incorporated into the boundary conditions. Second is a charged particle moving in a domain D of the plane which is threaded by a magnetic flux line of strength \u03b1, with wavefunction vanishing on the boundary \u2202D ('Aharonov-Bohm billiards'); the X are \u03b1 and parameters specifying \u2202D; V is not invariant under gauge transformations of the vector potential generating the flux. For Aharonov-Bohm billiards we study how the spatial patterns of phase of wavefunctions change round circuits near degeneracies; these patterns also have singularities (wavefront dislocations) that appear and disappear by colliding with each other and with \u2202D.\n      </p>", "When playing pool or billiards, a player often has the opportunity to make a \"straight-in\" shot, that is, one in which the cue ball, the object ball, and the target (e.g., a pocket) are collinear. With the distance from the cue ball to the target assumed fixed, the relative difficulty is here explored of shots taken at varying positions of the object ball between the cue ball and target. What position of the object ball makes the shot the most difficult? This is the question addressed in the article. Proofs of the results, ranging from easy to challenging, are left as exercises and also posted on the CMJ web site.\n      </p>", "           ", "The evolution, interaction and scattering of 2N point vortices grouped into equal and opposite pairs (N-dipoles) on a rotating unit sphere are studied. A new coordinate system made up of centres of vorticity and centroids associated with each dipole is introduced. With these coordinates, the nonlinear equations for an isolated dipole diagonalize and one directly obtains the equation for geodesic motion on the sphere for the dipole centroid. When two or more dipoles interact, the equations are viewed as an interacting billiard system on the sphere--charged billiards--with long-range interactions causing the centroid trajectories to deviate from their geodesic paths. Canonical interactions are studied both with and without rotation. For two dipoles, the four basic interactions are described as exchange-scattering, non-exchange-scattering, loop-scattering (head on) and loop-scattering (chasing) interactions. For three or more dipoles, one obtains a richer variety of interactions, although the interactions identified in the two-dipole case remain fundamental.\n      </p>", "Rigid-body dynamics with unilateral contact is a good approximation for a wide range of everyday phenomena, from the operation of car brakes to walking to rock slides. It is also of vital importance for simulating robots, virtual reality, and realistic animation. However, correctly modeling rigid-body dynamics with friction is difficult due to a number of discontinuities in the behavior of rigid bodies and the discontinuities inherent in the Coulomb friction law. This is particularly crucial for handling situations with large coefficients of friction, which can result in paradoxical results known at least since Painlev\u00e9 [C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris, 121 (1895), pp. 112-115]. This single example has been a counterexample and cause of controversy ever since, and only recently have there been rigorous mathematical results that show the existence of solutions to his example. The new mathematical developments in rigid-body dynamics have come from several sources: \"sweeping processes\" and the measure differential inclusions of Moreau in the 1970s and 1980s, the variational inequality approaches of Duvaut and J.-L. Lions in the 1970s, and the use of complementarity problems to formulate frictional contact problems by L\u03bf\u0308tstedt in the early 1980s. However, it wasn't until much more recently that these tools were finally able to produce rigorous results about rigid-body dynamics with Coulomb friction and impulses.\n      </p>", "r />\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sociology.uchicago.edu/ajs/about.shtml\">Editorial Office Website</a>\n<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1290223406099/AJSrecform.pdf\">Library Recommendation Form</a>\n<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"/page/publisher/ucpress/adv.html\">Advertise in <i>AJS</i></a>\n<br />\n</p></p>\n\t\t\t", "r />\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sociology.uchicago.edu/ajs/about.shtml\">Editorial Office Website</a>\n<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"/userimages/ContentEditor/1290223406099/AJSrecform.pdf\">Library Recommendation Form</a>\n<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"/page/publisher/ucpress/adv.html\">Advertise in <i>AJS</i></a>\n<br />\n</p></p>\n\t\t\t", "", "The Hilbert modular surface $X_D $ is the moduli space of Abelian varieties A with real multiplication by a quadratic order of discriminant D &gt; 1.

The geometry of $F_D $ is related to Teichm\u00fcller theory, holomorphic motions, polygonal billiards and Latt\u00e8s rational maps.

These umbilic solitons have the property that as the space variable x tends to infinity, the solution tends to a periodic wave, and as x tends to minus infinity, it tends to a phase shifted wave of the same shape. The equations admitting solutions in this new class include the Dym equation and equations in its hierarchy. The methods used to find and analyse these solutions are those of algebraic and complex geometry. We look for classes of solutions by constructing associated finite-dimensional integrable Hamiltonian systems on Riemann surfaces. In particular, in this setting we use geodesics on n-dimensional quadrics to find the spatial, or x-flow, which, together with the commuting t-flow given by the equation itself, defines new classes of solutions. Amongst these geodesics, particularly interesting ones are the umbilic geodesics, which then generate the class of umbilic soliton solutions. This same setting also enables us to introduce another class of solutions of Dym-like equations, which are related to elliptic and umbilic billiards.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
