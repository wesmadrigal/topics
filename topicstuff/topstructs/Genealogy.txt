{"total_words": 1257, "documents": ["The basic argument of this article is that although much discussed, the distinction between category and genealogy has still not been articulated as it should be, due partly to its too close association with other agendas. The distinction is seen to relate not to different sorts of society, as is frequently assumed, but to different sorts of situation in any one society regarding the use of kin terms and kin reckoning. The argument is illustrated with reference to the work of Harold Scheffler and his debates with Louis Dumont. /// Bien que objet de nombreux d\u00e9bats, la distinction entre g\u00e9n\u00e9alogie et cat\u00e9gorie n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on satisfaisante, en partie en raison de son imbrication dans d'autres prises de position.

The essay shows how Nietzsche mocks moral psychologists by calling them genealogists, contrasts Nietzsche's work with that of genealogists, and then documents how subsequent academics, encouraged by the work of Gilles Deleuze and, in turn, Michel Foucault, created a revaluation of genealogy's meaning, thereby fetishizing their own scholarly authority.\n      </p>", "In order to clarify the relationship between morality and law, it is necessary to define both concepts precisely. Cultural realities refer to concepts which are more specifically defined if we focus towards the genealogy of those realities, that is to say, their motivation, function and aim. Should we start from legal anthropology, comparative law and history of law, law arises as a social technique which coactively imposes ways of solving conflicts, protecting fundamental values for a society's co-existence. Values subject to being protected are proposed by morality, the latter making subordination of law to morality inevitable. This explains that a great number of modern constitutions include a reference to fundamental moral values, that is to say, they have explicitly positivised moral contents. Legal reasoning, at all levels and expressions, needs to appeal to the aforementioned values. Constitutional reasoning, international law, legislative activity and judicial practice are studied to verify the latter. This subordination of law to morality sets out a serious problem: moralities are cultural realities which are only valid for a specific society. In order for law not to fall in a not very rational legal relativism, law should not be subordinated to morality, but to ethics, the latter understood as cross-cultural morality. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was a step forward in this sense.\n      </p>", "The genealogy of the Prophet Muhammad was the primary model used by medieval Muslim genealogists in defining Arab tribal structure. This article examines the credibility of both the overall genealogical template and the canonized genealogy of Muhammad's significant ancestors from Abraham. Attention is given to the derivation of tribal segment terms, especially the use of a body metaphor. It is argued that the delineation of Muhammad's genealogy represents a legitimization of his role as Prophet in early Islamic discourse on sacred history.\n      </p>", "Consider a continuous-time binary branching process conditioned to have population size n at some time t, and with a chance p for recording each extinct individual in the process. Within the family tree of this process, we consider the smallest subtree containing the genealogy of the extant individuals together with the genealogy of the recorded extinct individuals. We introduce a novel representation of such subtrees in terms of a point-process, and provide asymptotic results on the distribution of this point-process as the number of extant individuals increases. We motivate the study within the scope of a coherent analysis for an a priori model for macroevolution.\n      </p>", "This paper considers the extent to which the geneticization of 'race' and ethnicity is the prevailing outcome of genetic testing for genealogical purposes. The decoding of the human genome precipitated a change of paradigms in genetics research, from an emphasis on genetic similarity to a focus on molecular-level differences among individuals and groups. This shift from lumping to splitting spurred ongoing disagreements among scholars about the significance of 'race' and ethnicity in the genetics era. I characterize these divergent perspectives as 'pragmatism' and 'naturalism'. Drawing upon ethnographic fieldwork and interviews, I argue that neither position fully accounts for how understandings of 'race' and ethnicity are being transformed with genetic genealogy testing. While there is some acquiescence to genetic thinking about ancestry, and by implication, 'race', among African-American and black British consumers of genetic genealogy testing, test-takers also adjudicate between sources of genealogical information and from these construct meaningful biographical narratives. Consumers engage in highly situated 'objective' and 'affiliative' self-fashioning, interpreting genetic test results in the context of their 'genealogical aspirations'. I conclude that issues of site, scale, and subjectification must be attended to if scholars are to understand whether and to what extent social identities are being transformed by recent developments in genetic science.\n      </p>", "Nietzsche's book On the Genealogy of Morals is often taken to be the high point of his critical project. Many of the positive aspects of Genealogy are often ignored, however, because they are difficult to explain. This article attempts to give an interpretation of the second essay of Genealogy in terms of Nietzsche's concept of will to power. On this basis, the second essay shows itself not to be simply an account of \"bad conscience\", but rather an account of the development of morality as a whole, and one which shows the beginnings of a normative teaching. /// A obra A Genealogia da Moral \u00e9 normalmente considerada como o cume do projecto cr\u00edtico de Nietzsche.

I argue that traditional scholarly assumptions about the 'unsophisticated' nature of early modern European mentalities result in inadequate representations of accused witches and of the social contexts and processes of the trials. Genealogy, by contrast, problematizes fundamental notions such as reason, order, power and progress in ways that not only provide a different range of effective tools for the analysis of belief in witchcraft, but also underline its crucial significance for social theory. In the final section, an analysis of a typical trial is undertaken employing key genealogical insights into confession, torture, truth, governmentality, power, pleasure and pain.\n      </p>", "In this article, we have tried to incorporate acoustics, together with music, within the framework of the genealogy of science (physics). We have also stressed the insufficiently noted contribution made to physics, acoustics and musicology by the Croatian-Bohemian physicist, Vinko Dvo\u0159\u00e1k; we have tried to portray him in detail. In including acoustics in the mentioned model, we have used the philosophical and historical method of research, with special respect to modern tendencies in science, even taking them as our basis. We have pointed out the necessity to stop the general trend of neglecting acoustics, formerly a branch of physics, and, within the framework of the mentioned model, re-establishing its importance. In this way, the unique essence of science would be expressed.\n      </p>", "A remarkable numerical schema is revealed when the lifespan notices for the generations from Adam to Moses in the Masoretic version of the Pentateuch are added together--12,600 years. It is suggested that this schema has eschatological connotations that relates to the 1,260 days mentioned in Daniel and Revelation. The possibility that the lifespan notices developed from an earlier, progenitor chronology that originally tallied 12,000 years is also discussed, and the relationship between this schema, the surrounding patriarchal narratives and other Near East chronological traditions is examined in terms of the textual development of the Old Testament lifespan tradition.\n      </p>", "Traditionally population genetics and systematics have been separate fields, with distinct conceptual frameworks, tools, and statistics. Hennig drew a clear distinction between the reticulate genealogical relationships among individuals and populations on one hand, and the hierarchical phylogenetic relationships among divergent species or taxa on the other. For many plant species, such distinctions blur. The genetic structuring of plant populations is strongly affected by phylogenetic history, and the phylogenetic relationships among species are frequently confounded by gene migration between species. The identification of molecular markers that vary within species, as well as reductions in costs and time associated with DNA sequencing, have set the stage for a blending of the two fields. Haplotype variation at a non-recombining locus can be historically ordered to produce a gene genealogy. Genealogical analysis coupled with the theoretical framework of coalescence theory can be used to estimate the roles of migration, founder effects and range expansion during the formation and subsequent establishment of species. Such studies hold great promise for understanding the interplay of phylogenetic history and population level process in shaping distinct evolutionary lineages.\n      </p>", "Many species exist as metapopulations in balance between local population extinction and recolonization. The effect of these processes on average population differentiation, within-deme diversity, and specieswide diversity has been considered previously. In this paper, coalescent simulations of Slatkin's propagule-pool and migrant-pool models are used to characterize the distribution of neutral genetic diversity within demes (\u03c0S), diversity in the metapopulation a whole (\u03c0T), the ratio FST = (\u03c0T - \u03c0S)/\u03c0T, Tajima's D statistic, and several ratios of gene-tree branch lengths. Using these distributions, power to detect differences in key metapopulation parameter values is determined under contrasting sampling regimes. The results indicate that it will be difficult to use sequence data from a single locus to detect a history of extinctions and recolonizations in a metapopulation because of high genealogical variance, the loss of diversity due to reductions in effective population size, and the fact that a genealogy of lineages from different demes under Slatkin's model differs from a neutral coalescent only in its time scale. Genetic indices of gene-tree shape that capture the effects of extinction/recolonization on both external branches and the length of the genealogy as a whole will provide the best indication of metapopulation dynamics if several lineages are sampled from several different demes.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "The coalescent with recombination describes the distribution of genealogical histories and resulting patterns of genetic variation in samples of DNA sequences from natural populations. However, using the model as the basis for inference is currently severely restricted by the computational challenge of estimating the likelihood. We discuss why the coalescent with recombination is so challenging to work with and explore whether simpler models, under which inference is more tractable, may prove useful for genealogy-based inference. We introduce a simplification of the coalescent process in which coalescence between lineages with no overlapping ancestral material is banned. The resulting process has a simple Markovian structure when generating genealogies sequentially along a sequence, yet has very similar properties to the full model, both in terms of describing patterns of genetic variation and as the basis for statistical inference.\n      </p>", "Estimation of genealogical relationships from genetic data provides an approach to answering many questions of population biology. In this estimation problem, previous work has shown that bilateral relatives such as full sibs may be more likely parents than the true parent individuals. This paper investigates the source of this paradox, and the circumstances under which it may arise. Alternative approaches to inferring parentage are proposed; these involve analysis of the distributions of log-likelihood statistics and of the bivariate distribution of sib and parent log-likelihoods. A Bayesian approach may also be superposed on the likelihood analysis, enabling any prior knowledge of the population to be incorporated.\n      </p>", "A new coalescent is introduced to study the genealogy of a sample from the infinite-alleles model of population genetics. This coalescent also records the age ordering of alleles in the sample. The distribution of this process is found explicitly for the Moran model, and is shown to be robust for a wide class of reproductive schemes. Properties of the ages themselves and the relationship between ages and class sizes then follow readily.\n      </p>", "In \"The History of Sexuality\", Foucault maintains that \"Western man has become a confessing animal\" (1990, 59), thus implying that \"man\" was not always such a creature. On a related point, Wittgenstein suggests that \"man is a ceremonial animal\" (1996, 67); here the suggestion is that human beings are, by their very nature, ritualistically inclined. In this paper I examine this crucial difference in emphasis, first by reconstructing Foucault's \"genealogy\" of confession, and subsequently by exploring relevant facets of Wittgenstein's later thinking. While there are significant correlations between Foucault and Wittgenstein, an important disparity emerges in relation to the question of the \"natural.\" By critically analyzing this, I show how Wittgenstein's minimal naturalism provides an important corrective to Foucault's more extravagant claims. By implication, we see why any radical relativist, historicist, and/or constructivist position becomes untenable on Wittgensteinian grounds, even though Wittgenstein himself is often read as promoting such views.\n      </p>", "I construct a genealogy of the principle of distinction; the injunction to distinguish between combatants and civilians at all times during war. I outline the influence of a series of discourses--gender, innocence, and civilization--on these two categories. I focus on the emergence of the distinction in the seventeenth-century text \"On the Law of War and Peace\", authored by Hugo Grotius, and trace it through the twentieth-century treaties of the laws of war--the 1949 Geneva Protocols and the 1977 Protocols Additional. I draw out how the practices of and referents for our current wars partially descend from and are governed by the binary logics of Christianity, barbarism, innocence, guilt, and sex difference articulated in Grotius's text. These binaries are implicated in our contemporary distinction of \"combatant\" and \"civilian,\" troubling any facile notion of what \"humanitarian\" law is or what \"humanitarian\" law does, and posing distinct challenges to theorizations of the laws said to regulate war.\n      </p>", "Drawing on MacIntyre's encyclopaedia-genealogy-tradition typology of the humanities, the author describes Averintsev's project as bringing together the elements of encyclopaedia and tradition. The article identifies three forms of isolationism which are evident not only in 'post-atheistic' societies but more widely, and comments on Averintev's treatment of these.\n      </p>", "Speciation involves the origin of trait differences that limit or prevent gene exchange and ultimately results in daughter populations that form monophyletic or exclusive genetic groups. However, for recently diverged populations or species between which reproductive isolation is often incomplete, gene genealogies will be discordant and most regions of the genome will display nonexclusive genealogical patterns. In these situations, genome regions for which one or both species are exclusive groups may mark the footprint of recent selective sweeps. Alternatively, such regions may include or be closely linked to \"speciation genes,\" genes involved in reproductive isolation. Therefore, comparisons of gene genealogies allow inferences about the genetic architectures of both reproductive isolation and adaptation. Contrasting genealogical relationships in sexually isolated pheromone strains of the European corn borer moth (Ostrinia nubilalis) demonstrate the relevance of this approach. Genealogies for five gene regions are discordant, and only one molecular marker, the sex-linked gene Tpi, has evidence for pheromone strain exclusivity. Tpi maps to a position on the sex chromosome that is indistinguishable from a major factor (Pdd) affecting differences in postdiapause development time. The major factor (Resp) determining male behavioral response to pheromone is also sex-linked, but maps 20-30 cM away. Exclusivity at Tpi may be a consequence of these linkage relationships because evidence from phenotypic variation in natural populations implicates both Pdd and Resp as candidates for genes involved in recent sweeps and/or reproductive isolation between strains.\n      </p>", "North Greenland Polar Eskimos are the only hunter-gatherer population, to our knowledge, who can offer precise genealogical records spanning several generations. This is the first report from Eskimos on two key parameters in population genetics, namely, generation time (T) and effective population size (N\u2091). The average mother-daughter and father-son intervals were 27 and 32 years, respectively, roughly similar to the previously published generation times obtained from recent agricultural societies across the world. To gain an insight for the generation time in our distant ancestors, we calculated maternal generation time for two wild chimpanzee populations. We also provide the first comparison among three distinct approaches (genealogy, variance and life table methods) for calculating N\u2091, which resulted in slightly differing values for the Eskimos. The ratio of the effective to the census population size is estimated as 0.6-0.7 for autosomal and X-chromosomal DNA, 0.7-0.9 for mitochondrial DNA and 0.5 for Y-chromosomal DNA. A simulation of alleles along the genealogy suggested that Y-chromosomal DNA may drift a little faster than mitochondrial DNA in this population, in contrast to agricultural Icelanders. Our values will be useful not only in prehistoric population inference but also in understanding the shaping of our genome today.\n      </p>", "This article examines modernist genealogy in Alice Notley's 1992 poem The Descent of Alette. Notley's central speaker finds herself riding on a nightmarish subway ruled by a male tyrant who controls all artistic form. This article argues that the subway can be understood as an ongoing public to which poets since Pound have returned to experiment with impersonal poetic form. In Notley's poem, the subway signals vexed poetic lineage as well as the passageway to a new collective formal space. However, this article suggests, we must ask whether the poem's emphasis on private poetic speech qualifies the poem's feminist poetic imagination, or whether Notley's formal experimentation, particularly her use of citational quotation marks, leads to a workable notion of collective voice as the object of quest. Reading Alette against \u201cDoctor Williams' Heiresses,\u201d Notley's early experimental historiography, the article situates the question of private speech within the larger question of modernism's \u201cafter-affects\u201d in postwar women's poetry.\n      </p>", "New concepts have emerged in social work and in social policy over the past 10-15 years: 'you must meet the clients where they stand', 'help must be self-help' and 'poverty is spiritual rather than material'. These axioms were core principles for the welfare of the poor that philanthropic and religious societies carried out in the late nineteenth century. Their current proliferation in all types of social work and in social policy discourse demonstrates a profound transformation in the discursive structures of welfare policy -- that is, in the way social problems can be visualized and spoken about, in the way that clients can be observed and turned into objects of knowledge, and in the way that professionals can conceptualize such abstract notions as integration, citizenship, community and freedom.

Two intergenic noncoding mitochondrial loci were found to be highly informative at the within-species level. Twenty-five haplotypes were found over the whole dataset (333 base pairs, 524 individuals, and 24 populations). The native range showed striking population genetic structure stemming from low diversity within and high differentiation among populations, a pattern not observed in the introduced range of this seaweed. Contrary to classical expectations of founding effects associated with accidental introduction of exotic species, most of the introduced populations showed high genetic diversity. At the regional scale, genetic diversity and sequence divergence showed contrasting patterns in the two main areas of introduction (Europe and Australasia), suggesting different processes of introduction in the two regions. Gene genealogy analyses point to aquaculture as a major vector of introduction and spread in Europe but implicate maritime traffic in promoting recurrent migration events from the native range to Australasia. The multiplicity of processes and genetic signatures associated with the successful invasion confirms that multiple facets of global change, e.g., aquaculture practices, alteration of habitats, and increased traffic, act in synergy at the worldwide level, facilitating successful pandemic introductions.\n      </p>", "Different aleles undergoing strong symmetric balancing selection show a simple genealogical structure (allelic genealogy), similar to the gene genealogy described by the coalescense process for a sample of neutral genes randomly drawn from a panmictic population at equilibrium. The only difference between the two genealogies lies in the different time scales. An approximate scaling factor for allelic genealogy relative to that of neutral gene genealogy is ${\\sqrt{S}/(2M)}\\cdot [ln{S/(16\\tau M^2)}]^{-3/2}$ , where M = Nu and S = 2Ns (N), effective population size; u, mutation rate to selected alleles per locus per generation; s, selection coefficient). The larger the value of $\\sqrt{S}/M (\\geqq 100)$ , the larger the scaling factor. These findings, supported by simulation results, allow one to apply the theoretical results of the coalescence process directly to the allelic genealogy. Combined with the trans-species evolution of the major histocompatibility complex polymorphism for which balancing selection is believed to be responsible, allelic genealogy predicts that the number of breeding individuals in the human population could not be as small as 50-100 at any time of its evolutionary history. The analysis appears to contradict the founder principle as being important in recent mammalian evolution.\n      </p>", "The spatial distribution of genetic markers can be useful both in estimating patterns of gene flow and in reconstructing biogeographic history, particularly when gene genealogies can be estimated. Genealogies based on nonrecombining genetic units such as mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA often consist of geographically separated clades that come into contact in narrow regions. Such phylogeographic breaks are usually assumed to be the result of long-term barriers to gene flow. Here I show that deep phylogeographic breaks can form within a continuously distributed species even when there are no barriers to gene flow. The likelihood of observing phylogeographic breaks increases as the average individual dispersal distance and population size decrease. Those molecular markers that are most likely to show evidence of real geographic barriers are also most likely to show phylogeographic breaks that formed without any barrier to gene flow. These results might provide an explanation as to why some species, such as the greenish warblers (Phylloscopus trochiloides), have phylogeographic breaks in mitochondrial or chloroplast DNA that do not coincide with sudden changes in other traits.\n      </p>", "The author discusses the struggle that took place in New York City between 1968 and 1971 over whether video would be considered a tool of social change or a medium of art.

The effects of fragmentation vary across organisms, habitat types, and geographic regions. Such a contrast between a schematic concept and multifaceted empirical reality is counterproductive. I analyzed the stabilization of the schematic view of fragmentation by the early 1980s, using a genealogical narrative as a methodological approach. The main assumptions behind the schematic view were: (1) fragments are comparable to oceanic islands; (2) habitats surrounding fragments are hostile to a majority of the organisms; and (3) natural pre-fragmentation conditions were uniform. The stabilization loop of this view was supported by the reduction of empirical research to species-area curve fitting, which always produced expected results. I present a model of the dynamics of fragmentation research that shows the schematic, island-biogeographic view as an \"intellectual attractor.\" Since the 1980s, the theoretical presuppositions of the schematic view have been challenged, and empirical research has become multifaceted. Fragments of a particular habitat type are viewed as elements in a heterogeneous landscape rather than \"islands\" surrounded by a hostile \"sea.\" However, the island metaphor is still used in conservation contexts in the shape of species-area curves. It is backed by a presupposition that human-influenced environments are essentially different from so-called \"natural\" environments, but this is unfounded. My suggestion is that our perspective should be broadened still further so that habitat fragmentation is viewed as a particular form of human-induced environmental degradation; I discuss both theoretical and practical implications of this suggestion.\n      </p>", "Two kinds of characters of reduncine antelopes were analyzed cladistically: (1) quantitative osteological characters treated allometrically to remove the effects of body weight and (2) discretely coded characters. Character congruence was tested by combined cladistic analysis of all the data. We analyzed reduncine ontogeny and addressed the general question of how cladistics can be used together with ontogenetic information to study heterochrony. We tested whether characters of waterbuck evolved by paedomorphosis within the genus Kobus or whether these characters are plesiomorphic retentions. The plesiomorphic hypothesis was falsified and the paedomorphosis hypothesis was supported.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

I argue, primarily on the basis of textual evidence, that Nietzsche's procedure is neither to reliably report his own views nor to assert the reality of what might be called the theoretical terms of the account. I offer as an explanatory hypothesis that Nietzsche adopted this procedure as a response to a problem of epistemic authority that he confronted in assessing morality. I also provide some historical context for Nietzsche's method and discuss some implications of my view for the interpretation of Nietzsche's project.\n      </p>", "Nietzsche's critique of Christianity is approached by asking how far it implicitly relies upon Christian concepts and resources in implementing its criticisms. The essay first looks in detail at the parable of the madman in Gay Science, focussing in particular on its double address to theists as well as atheists; I explore its implicit invocation of Macbeth, as well as its articulation of an implicit theology of Holy Saturday, which roots the thought of God's death in Christian conceptions of the full implicationsof the Incarnation. The second half of the essay examines the Genealogy of Morality, itfocusses on Nietzsche's implicit admiration for the will to power implied in the slave revolt, his conception of himself as speaking against Christianity from a position prepared by it, and the ways in which his account of that revolt reiterates the structure of the Christian account of the Fall.\n      </p>", "This paper extends earlier work by Cox and Durrett, who studied the coalescence times for two lineages in the stepping stone model on the two-dimensional torus. We show that the genealogy of a sample of size n is given by a time change of Kingman's coalescent. With DNA sequence data in mind, we investigate mutation patterns under the infinite sites model, which assumes that each mutation occurs at a new site. Our results suggest that the spatial structure of the human population contributes to the haplotype structure and a slower than expected decay of genetic correlation with distance revealed by recent studies of the human genome.\n      </p>", "In intraspecific studies, reticulated graphs are valuable tools for visualization, within a single figure, of alternative genealogical pathways among haplotypes. As available software packages implementing the global maximum parsimony (MP) approach only give the possibility to merge resulting topologies into less-resolved consensus trees, MP has often been neglected as an alternative approach to purely algorithmic (i.e., methods defined solely on the basis of an algorithm) \"network\" construction methods. Here, we propose to search tree space using the MP criterion and present a new algorithm for uniting all equally most parsimonious trees into a single (possibly reticulated) graph. Using simulated sequence data, we compare our method with three purely algorithmic and widely used graph construction approaches (minimum-spanning network, statistical parsimony, and median-joining network). We demonstrate that the combination of MP trees into a single graph provides a good estimate of the true genealogy. Moreover, our analyses indicate that, when internal node haplotypes are not sampled, the median-joining and MP methods provide the best estimate of the true genealogy whereas the minimum-spanning algorithm shows very poor performances.\n      </p>", "We consider catalytic branching populations. They consist of a catalyst population evolving according to a critical binary branching process in continuous time with a constant branching rate and a reactant population with a branching rate proportional to the number of catalyst individuals alive. The reactant forms a process in random medium. We describe asymptotically the genealogy of catalytic branching populations coded as the induced forest of $\\mathbb{R}-trees$ using the many individualsrapid branching continuum limit. The limiting continuum genealogical forests are then studied in detail from both the quenched and annealed points of view. The result is obtained by constructing a contour process and analyzing the appropriately rescaled version and its limit. The genealogy of the limiting forest is described by a point process. We compare geometric properties and statistics of the reactant limit forest with those of the \"classical\" forest.\n      </p>", "The genealogical relationships among naturally established seedlings and flowering individuals were analyzed for a large population of the dioecious plant species Chamaelirium luteum. Genetic likelihoods based on 11 electrophoretic markers of all possible parent pairs within flowering seasons from 1974 to 1981 preceding observed establishment of seedlings from 1976 to 1982 were evaluated; and most-likely parents for 283 seedlings were thus identified, enabling a partial reconstruction of the genealogy of this population. This information, combined with the map location of each plant, was used to analyze realized gene-flow patterns. Intermate distances showed more nearby matings than would the kind of pollen dispersal profile that could be expected under random mating. Overall, seedlings tended to undergo establishment at locations between their maternal and paternal parents, indicating localized genetic adaptation along environmental gradients. Finally, a negative correlation was observed between inflorescence size (reproductive effort) and number of progeny observed (reproductive success). Techniques of genealogy reconstruction have previously been limited to human populations. As seen in the present study, such techniques also show great promise for revealing the evolutionary behavior of natural populations.\n      </p>", "The structured coalescent is a continuous-time Markov chain which describes the genealogy of a sample of homologous genes from a subdivided population. Assuming this model, some results are proved relating to the genealogy of a pair of genes and the extent of subpopulation differentiation, which are valid under certain graph-theoretic symmetry and regularity conditions on the structure of the population. We first review and extend earlier results stating conditions under which the mean time since the most recent common ancestor of a pair of genes from any single subpopulation is independent of the migration rate and equal to that of two genes from an unstructured population of the same total size. Assuming the infinite alleles model of neutral mutation with a small mutation rate, we then prove a simple relationship between the migration rate and the value of Wright's coefficient FST for a pair of neighbouring subpopulations, which does not depend on the precise structure of the population provided that this is sufficiently symmetric.\n      </p>", "Given a sample of genes taken from a large population, we consider the neutral coalescent genealogy and study the theoretical and empirical distributions of the size of the smallest clade containing a fixed gene. We show that the theoretical distribution is strongly related to a Yule distribution of parameter 2, and that the empirical count statistics are asymptotically Gaussian as the number of genes grows to infinity. Then we consider external branches of the coalescent tree, and describe their lengths. Using the infinitely many sites model of mutation, we also describe the conditional distribution of the external branch lengths, given the number of pairwise differences between a reference DNA sequence and the sequence of one closest relative in the sample.\n      </p>", "We study the genealogy of so-called immortal branching processes, i.e. branching processes where each individual upon death is replaced by at least one new individual, and conclude that their marginal distributions are compound geometric. The result also implies that the limiting distributions of properly scaled supercritical branching processes are compound geometric. We exemplify our results with an expression for the marginal distribution for a class of branching processes that have recently appeared in the theory of coalescent processes and continuous stable random trees. The limiting distribution can be expressed in terms of the Fox H-function, and in special cases by the Meijer G-function.\n      </p>", "A result proved by Saunders et al. (1984) is generalised. This generalisation, and its proof, may help to explain some curiosities noted in the original result.\n      </p>", "An island model of migration is used to study the effects of subdivision within populations and species on sample genealogies and on between-population or between-species measures of genetic variation. The model assumes that the number of demes within each population or species is large. When populations (or species), connected either by gene flow or historical association, are themselves subdivided into demes, changes in the migration rate among demes alter both the structure of genealogies and the time scale of the coalescent process. The time scale of the coalescent is related to the effective size of the population, which depends on the migration rate among demes. When the migration rate among demes within populations is low, isolation (or speciation) events seem more recent and migration rates among populations seem higher because the effective size of each population is increased. This affects the probability of reciprocal monophyly of two samples, the chance that a gene tree of a sample matches the species tree, and relative likelihoods of different types of polymorphic sites. It can also have a profound effect on the estimation of divergence times.\n      </p>", "Mycielski and Ulam have introduced three metrics on the set of all members of a species that reproduces by pairwise mating; their discussion concerns only a very orderly society in which the whole population is divided into disjoint generations, with random mating, universal monogamy and exactly two offspring of each mating. Here we discuss another metric, derived from certain probabilistic considerations, that is free of all such restrictions. It does not derive from Mendelian laws.\n      </p>", "Selection on one or more genes inevitably perturbs other genes, even when those genes have no direct effect on fitness. This article reviews the theory of such genetic hitchhiking, concentrating on effects on neutral loci. Maynard Smith and Haigh introduced the classical case where the perturbation is due to a single favourable mutation. This is contrasted with the apparently distinct effects of inherited variation in fitness due to loosely linked loci. A model of fluctuating selection is analysed which bridges these alternative treatments. When alleles sweep between extreme frequencies at a rate \u03bb, the rate of drift is increased by a factor (1 + E[1/pq]\u03bb/(2(2\u03bb + r))), where the recombination rate r is much smaller than the strength of selection. In spatially structured populations, the effects of any one substitution are weaker, and only cause a local increase in the frequency of a neutral allele. This increase depends primarily on the rate of recombination relative to selection (r/s), and more weakly, on the neighbourhood size, Nb = 4\u03c0\u03c1\u03c3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Spatial subdivision may allow local selective sweeps to occur more frequently than is indicated by the overall rate of molecular evolution. However, it seems unlikely that such sweeps can be sufficiently frequent to increase significantly the drift of neutral alleles.\n      </p>", "We introduce a statistic, the genealogical sorting index (gsi), for quantifying the degree of exclusive ancestry of labeled groups on a rooted genealogy and demonstrate its application. The statistic is simple, intuitive, and easily calculated. It has a normalized range to facilitate comparisons among different groups, trees, or studies and it provides information on individual groups rather than a composite measure for all groups. It naturally handles polytomies and accommodates measures of uncertainty in phylogenetic relationships. We use coalescent simulations to explore the behavior of the gsi across a range of divergence times, with the mean value increasing to 1, the maximum value when exclusivity within a group reached monophyly. Simulations also demonstrate that the power to reject the null hypothesis of mixed genealogical ancestry increased markedly as sample size increased, and that the gsi provides a statistically more powerful measure of divergence than $F_{ST}$ . Applications to data from published studies demonstrated that the gsi provides a useful way to detect significant exclusivity even when groups are not monophyletic. Although we describe this statistic in the context of divergence, it is more broadly applicable to quantify and assess the significance of clustering of observations in labeled groups on any tree.\n      </p>", "Nuclear DNA sequence data for diploid organisms are potentially a rich source of phylogenetic information for disentangling the evolutionary relationships of closely related organisms, but present special phylogenetic problems owing to difficulties arising from heterozygosity and recombination. We analyzed allelic relationships for two nuclear gene regions (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and elongation factor-1\u03b1), along with a mitochondrial gene region (NADH dehydrogenase subunit5), for an assemblage of closely related species of carabid beetles (Carabus subgenus Ohomopterus). We used a network approach to examine whether the nuclear gene sequences provide substantial phylogenetic information on species relationships and evolutionary history. The mitochondrial gene genealogy strongly contradicted the morphological species boundary as a result of introgression of heterospecific mitochondria. Two nuclear gene regions showed high allelic diversity within species, and this diversity was partially attributable to recombination between various alleles and high variability in the intron region. Shared nuclear alleles among species were rare and were considered to represent shared ancestral polymorphism. Despite the presence of recombination, nuclear allelic networks recovered species monophyly more often and presented genetic differentiation patterns (low to high) among species more clearly. Overall, nuclear gene networks provide clear evidence for separate biological species and information on the phylogenetic relationships among closely related carabid beetles.\n      </p>", "In the Albanian tradition, the name reflects both the genealogical lineage as well as a territorial membership. The name is transmitted from generation to generation, especially in the paternal lineage, generally in alternated manner. The Albanian nomination system appeals for three elements: the individual name, the individual name of the father, and a third name (the name of family) of territorial or genealogical reference. Albanian anthroponymy appears in the toponymie origin of names. Names of persons inform on the geographical origin of the population, its stability, or ist mobility. The name establishes the connection between the lived space of the group and other \"we,\" dispersed members of the kinship community. It comprises both a parental (genealogical) and a territorial field, and defines the inscriptions of the marriage and modes of affinity.\n      </p>", "Because Nietzsche rejects a temporally static ontology, his statements about values, customs, and beliefs typically involve a historical reconstruction of some kind. Given that his professional academic training was in philology, it is tempting to see a continuity between his early philological method and his later historiographical techniques, in particular, his genealogy. Two recent studies, by James I. Porter and Christian Benne, respectively, have argued that philology and genealogy share a consistent historiographical framework in their attempt to expose and undermine various textual traditions. I argue here that, on the contrary, there is an important shift in Nietzsche's meta-historical presuppositions between his earlier and later work. Whereas his early published philology is best characterized as a representational realism, the presentation of the genealogy should be considered representational antirealism.\n      </p>", "A new Markov chain is introduced which can be used to describe the family relationships among n individuals drawn from a particular generation of a large haploid population. The properties of this process can be studied, simultaneously for all n, by coupling techniques. Recent results in neutral mutation theory are seen as consequences of the genealogy described by the chain.\n      </p>", "The genealogy of a cluster in the multitype voter model can be defined in terms of a family of dual coalescing random walks. We represent the genealogy of a cluster as a point process in a size-time plane and show that in high dimensions the genealogy of the cluster at the origin has a weak Poisson limit. The limiting point process is the same as for the genealogy of the size-biased Galton-Watson tree. Moreover, our results show that the branching mechanism and the spatial effects of the voter model can be separated on a macroscopic scale. Our proofs are based on a probabilistic construction of the genealogy of the cluster at the origin derived from Harris' graphical representation of the voter model.\n      </p>", "It was in April 1933 that the new Nazi regime nade a strict racial definition of Germanness into state policy. In this essay I bring to life the evolution of what I call the genealogy bureaucracy, a network of party, church, synagogue, academic and government projects that aided individuals in tracing their family histories. I show how possession of knowledge about the \"racial\" origins of individuals in the society became a possible avenue to power in the Nazi system. Party, church and government policy-makers organized archives, reproduced primary sources and created extensive card files on Jews and other \"non-Aryans.\" A set of complex procedures were established in order to classify millions of German citizens by racial categories. The central surprise in the story of the genealogy bureaucracy is how contradictory policy really was on the key issue of separating race from religion. Racial identity was impossible to measure by scientific methods. And so in the end religion was brought back into the calculations of who was to be counted as which type of Jew. Themes discussed in the essay include the number and kinds of partial Jews, Protestant and forced Jewish participation in the work of genealogy, changes in the definition of who was Jewish, the complex role played by Jacob Jacobson, and the microfilming of parish registers. In the end, I conclude that the Aryan clause and the projects of the genealogy bureaucracy closed a legitimate religious loophole that had been an opportunity for previous generations of Jews to remake their identifies and fulfill their ambitious in the Christian world. /// [Abstract in Hebrew].\n      </p>", "The structural pattern inherent in the genealogy of the Old Testament is delineated (I).

I argue that as they stand, these objections are inconclusive; while they are, at least to a certain extent, effective against R\u00e9e, they fail as objections to the fundamental insights of Darwin.

The genealogical method yields insights that illuminate neglected dimensions of the chemical weapons taboo: namely, the roles that contingency, domination, and resistance have played in the operation of this norm as a symbol of \"uncivilized\" conduct in international relations.\n      </p>", "Numerous local, regional and family historians in the nineteenth and early twentieth century collected oral narrations and conducted interviews as a form to document information that otherwise might have never been preserved. Family historians, in particular, not only practiced interviewing relatives for family histories, but also encouraged the practice in how-to-do manuals among their peers. While advocating the practice, family historians also reflected about the value of \"traditionary evidence\" collected through interviews and other means. These reflections by family historians mirrored the discussions about the value of traditions and memories as historical sources among several professional historians at the time. These reflections were shaped by a modernized understanding of tradition, which combined a reverential approach to the authoritarian element of tradition with a critical approach questioning the validity of tradition. In this context, oral history was both a tool to negotiate the value of tradition and a mirror to the contemporary understanding of tradition.\n      </p>", "The received view regarding the centrality of kinship terminologies in kinship systems assumes that terminologies are genealogically constrained. This assumption ignores the generative logic of kinship terminologies, hence the need for a new paradigm. It is argued that kinship systems are based on two conceptual systems: the logic of genealogical tracing and the logic of kin-term products. Structural implications of the generative logic of terminological structures are discussed, including the logical basis for the difference between descriptive and classificatory terminologies and transformations that may be made between different kinship terminologies through simple changes in structural equations. Connection between ethnographic observations and structural properties are identified.\n      </p>", "Sexual reproduction has long been proposed as a major factor explaining the existence of species and species diversity. Yet, the importance of sex for diversification remains obscure because of a lack of critical theory, difficulties of applying universal concepts of species and speciation, and above all the scarcity of empirical tests. Here, we use genealogical theory to compare the relative tendency of strictly sexual and asexual organisms to diversify into discrete genotypic and morphological clusters. We conclude that asexuals are expected to display discrete clusters similar to those found in sexual organisms. Whether sexuals or asexuals display stronger clustering depends on a number of factors, but in at least some scenarios asexuals should display a stronger pattern. Confounding factors aside, the only explanation we identify for stronger patterns of diversification in sexuals than asexuals is if the faster rates of adaptive change conferred by sexual reproduction promote greater clustering. Quantitative comparisons of diversification in related sexual and asexual taxa are needed to resolve this issue. The answer should shed light not only on the importance of the different stages leading to diversification, but also on the adaptive consequences of sex, still largely unexplored from a macroevolutionary perspective.\n      </p>", "All reference librarians would do well to learn the basic principles of genealogical research, the fundamentals of genealogical reference interviews, the resources needed by genealogists, and where to refer genealogists for additional assistance. Librarians could solve many interlibrary loan problems concerning genealogical materials if they would develop circulating collections of local history materials, including census schedules, and if requesting libraries would request local history and genealogical materials from the library that would most logically have the materials, namely, the county or regional library serving the county being researched.\n      </p>", "In sexual species, autosomal alleles are transmitted through multigeneration organismal pedigrees via pathways of descent involving both genders. Here, models assess the sampling properties of these gender-described transmission pathways. An isolation-by-distance model of mating was used to construct a series of computer population pedigrees by systematically varying neighborhood size and the timing of isolation events in sundered populations. For each known pedigree, a matrix of true coancestry coefficients between all individuals in the final generation was calculated and compared (using cophenetic correlations) to mean pairwise times to common ancestry as estimated by sampling varying numbers of gender-defined lineage routes available to individual alleles through that pedigree. When few lineage routes were sampled, agreement between the estimated and the true pedigree was poor and showed a large variance. Agreement improved as more lineage routes were incorporated and asymptotically approached plateau levels predictably relatable to the magnitude of population structure. Results underscore a distinction between the composite genealogical information in a population pedigree and the subsets of that information registered in allelic lineage pathways.\n      </p>", "This paper discusses prehistoric forms of history. We propose that all prehistoric societies oriented their actions in the present with the past in mind. The task for archaeologists is to understand the sorts of histories at work in different periods. We propose a distinction between genealogical history, where the past is created through links to known ancestors, and mythical history, where a less well-known past is evoked. These two forms of history coexist in all societies with implications for the manner in which continuities and change are handled. We illustrate the insights that these ideas may provide through a case study from the late Bronze Age to Romano-British periods on the Ridgeway in south Oxfordshire, southern England.\n      </p>", "We analyze the genealogical structure of large Japanese firms, with particular emphasis on the relationship between parent firms and spinoff subsidiaries. The wide use of spinoffs and subsidiaries in Japan provides for flexible organizational mutations that appear to facilitate increased competitiveness and offer the opportunity to obtain benefits through a deliberate separation of core competencies. We discuss a conceptual framework for the spinoff arrangement, the results of an exploratory empirical analysis of the relationship between parent and subsidiary organizations, and implications of the use of this organizational structure. We suggest the importance of a consideration of the genealogical aspects of large Japanese firms in strategy research.\n      </p>", "This article sketches the project of a symmetrical archaeology in brief. At a point when archaeology has arguably never been more relevant, it finds itself in a climate of necessary plurality where incommensurability is routinely shrugged off as a symptom of diversity; it finds itself in a state where seemingly incompatible differences proliferate on either side of the divide between the humanities and the sciences; it finds itself perplexed by divides between ideas and things, past and present, and so on. A symmetrical archaeology holds that these divides are of our own making. Without oversimplifying the world with an impoverished vocabulary of contradictory bifurcations, a symmetrical archaeology offers a profitable suite of perspectives and practices for recognizing the impact of things and our fellow creatures, ordinarily denied a stake in modernist myths of the world.\n      </p>", "\u2022 Cenococcum geophilum is a widely distributed mycorrhizal species associated with diverse gymnosperm and angiosperm hosts. In previous studies, a significant amount of genetic and genotypic diversity has been detected in this species, despite the fact that C. geophilum is not thought to reproduce by meiotic or mitotic spores. \u2022 We conducted a phylogenetic analysis of 103 C. geophilum isolates from a California oak woodland and seven non-California isolates using a glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene. In addition, a subset of isolates was analyzed using sequences from ITS-rDNA, a Group I intron located in the 3\u2032 end of the SSU-rDNA and a portion of the mitochondrial SSU-rDNA. \u2022 Phylogenetically distinct lineages, or cryptic species, of C. geophilum were detected at the scale of a single soil sample within our field site. As much genetic diversity was found within a soil sample as was found for isolates collected across the USA. \u2022 Our results help explain the large amount of physiological, phenotypic, and genetic differences reported among isolates of C. geophilum from similar as well as diverse geographic regions. The ecological role that these sympatric cryptic species play remains to be determined.\n      </p>", "A diverse collection of isolates identified as Colletotrichum acutatum, including a range of fruitrot and foliar pathogens, was examined for mtDNA RFLPs and RFLPs and sequence variation of a 900-bp intron of the glutamine synthetase (GS) gene and a 200-bp intron of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) gene. RFLPs of mtDNA, RFLPs of the 900-bp GS intron and sequence analysis of each intron identified the same seven distinct molecular groups, or clades, within C. acutatum sensu lato. Sequence analysis produced highly concordant tree topologies with definitive phylogenetic relationships within and between the clades. The clades might represent phylogenetically distinct species within C. acutatum sensu lato. Mating tests also were conducted to assess sexual compatibility with tester isolates known to outcross to form the teleomorph Glomerella acutata. Mating compatibility was identified within one clade, C, and between two phylogenetically distinct clades, C and J4. The C clade represented isolates from a wide range of hosts and geographic origins. J4 clade contained isolates from Australia or New Zealand recovered from fruit rot and pine seedlings with terminal crook disease. That isolates in two phylogenetically distinct clades were capable of mating suggests that genetic isolation occurred before reproductive isolation. No other isolates were sexually compatible with the mating testers, which also were in groups C and J4. Certain clades identified by mtDNA and intron analysis (D1, J3 and J6) appeared to represent relatively host-limited populations. Other clades (C1, F1 and J4) contained isolates from a wide range of hosts. Isolates described as C. acutatum f. sp. pineum were clearly polyphyletic.\n      </p>", "We obtain a weak approximation for the reduced family tree in a near-critical Markov branching process when the time interval considered is long; we also extend Yaglom's theorem and the exponential law to this case.

For Soviet authorities, kinship loyalties were problematic chiefly because they hindered the emergence of class consciousness among the Turkmen. Soviet officials pursued two essentially contradictory policies in their attempt to eliminate \"tribalism\" in the Turkmen republic. First, they sought to undermine the economic basis of genealogical affiliation by dismantling the existing system of collective land tenure. Second, they devised a policy of \"tribal parity,\" which attempted to suppress kin-based conflict by guaranteeing fair and equal treatment for all genealogical groups. Instead of allowing class consciousness to supplant kinship loyalties, however, Soviet rule tended to increase the salience of distinctions based on genealogy. Because of the close linkage between genealogy and socioeconomic standing in Turkmenistan, Soviet attempts to foment class conflict inadvertently exacerbated descent group conflict.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
