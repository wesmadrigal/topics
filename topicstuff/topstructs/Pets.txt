This article considers evidence suggesting that pets influence human blood pressure. Studies on this topic extend current research testing the hypothesis that having other people around in stressful times can buffer the negative consequences of stress. The existing data suggest that people perceive pets as important, supportive parts of their lives and that the presence of a pet is associated with significant cardiovascular benefits, among both people with normal blood pressure and those with high blood pressure. Studies about pets and blood pressure have examined both naturally occurring and randomly assigned pet ownership but are limited by their focus on responses to short-term, acute stress. Future prospective studies should explore the influence of pets on people at risk for cardiovascular disease and also consider explanatory mechanisms for the pet effect.\n      </p>", "To identify animal-related factors associated with Paget's disease of bone (osteitis deformans), we conducted a case-control study in two geographical areas of Spain characterized by different socioeconomic profiles. The analysis presented here is based on 149 cases and 150 controls, frequency matched by sex, age, study area, and place of residence in youth (urban/rural). From a logistic regression analysis, we found that contact with bovine cattle [odds ratio (OR) = 2.14; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.16-3.94], consumption of meat traceable to sick livestock (OR = 2.70; 95% CI = 0.98-7.43), and frequent consumption during youth of brains (OR = 1.77; 95% CI = 1.05-2.98) and other viscera increased the risk for Paget's disease of bone. Contact with bovine cattle and consumption during youth of bovid viscera exhibited a doseresponse effect as regards length of exposure and frequency of consumption, respectively. A life-style shared with dogs showed itself to be differentially linked to the disease in one study area. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that various animal species are carriers of etiologic agents of Paget's disease of bone.\n      </p>", "Objectives: For more than three decades there has been speculation regarding a possible role of zoonotic diseases in the development of human leukemia. This study investigated the potential relationship between exposure to pets and the development of childhood leukemia. Methods: Data from 2359 cases of acute leukemia from two large case-control studies were analyzed. Cases were individually matched to population controls on telephone exchange, age, and race. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) associated with pet ownership. Results: Overall, there was no association between pet ownership (either \"any pet\", dog, or cat) and childhood acute leukemia (ORany pet:=1.01, 95% CI 0.89-1.2). Additionally, no relationship was found between exposure to an ill pet and childhood leukemia. Conclusion: The results of this analysis suggest that pet ownership (healthy or sick) is unrelated to an increased risk of childhood leukemia.\n      </p>", "This paper reports results from a 'natural experiment' taking place in China on the impact of dogs on owners' health. Previous Western research has reported modest health benefits, but results have remained controversial. In China pets were banned in urban areas until 1992. Since then dog ownership has grown quite rapidly in the major cities, especially among younger women. In these quasi-experimental conditions, we hypothesise that dog ownership will show greater health benefits than in the West. Results are given from a survey of women aged 25\u201340 in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou (N = 3031). Half the respondents owned dogs and half did not. Owners reported better health-related outcomes. They exercised more frequently, slept better, had higher self-reported fitness and health, took fewer days off sick from work and were seen less by doctors. The concluding section indicates how these results may be integrated and suggests further research on the potential economic benefits of pets.\n      </p>", "Traditionally, the cancer risks associated with radon, environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), and similar indoor residential exposures have been evaluated through either laboratory experiments in rodents or epidemiology studies in people. Laboratory studies have the advantage of being controlled experiments, but their utility as estimators of human risk is limited by the uncertainties of extrapolating from rodents to people and from high doses to those typically experienced in the home. These experiments also subject animals to noxious exposures, causing suffering that may be considered cruel. Traditional epidemiology studies evaluate human risk directly, at the exposure levels present in residences; however, these studies are limited by their potential for misclassification, biased recall, and uncontrolled confounding. The long time intervals involved between exposure and disease (often 30 years or more) make accurate recall particularly problematic. In this paper we discuss the limitations of these traditional approaches, especially as they relate to residential studies of radon and ETS. The problems associated with the maximum tolerated dose in rodent bioassays and exposure misclassification in traditional epidemiology are particularly examined. A third approach that supplements the traditional approaches and overcomes some of their limitations is suggested. This approach, dubbed pet epidemiology, estimates residential cancer risk by examining the exposure experience of pet dogs with naturally occurring cancers. The history of pet epidemiology is reviewed and its strengths and limitations are examined.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The risk of asthma associated with pets and other indoor exposures has been examined in both cross-sectional and prospective studies of younger children. However, there has been little investigation of the effect of the indoor environment on incident asthma in adolescents. Methods. Risk factors for the development of asthma were examined in a cohort of 3535 Southern California school children with no history of asthma at 1993 entry into the study, who were followed for up to 5 years. Newly diagnosed cases of asthma were identified by yearly interview report. A total of 265 children reported a new diagnosis of asthma during the follow-up period; 163 of these had reported no history of wheeze at baseline. The risk associated with indoor exposures assessed by questionnaire at entry into the study was examined using Cox proportional hazards models. Results. In children with no history of wheezing, an increased risk of developing asthma was associated with a humidifier (relative risk [RR] = 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2-2.4), any pet (RR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.0-2.5), or specifically a dog (RR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.0-2.0) in the home. An estimated 32% of new asthma cases could be attributed to pets. Conclusions. We conclude that furry pets are a common and potentially remediable risk factor for new onset asthma in adolescents. Our results suggest that a humidifier in the home may contribute to the onset of asthma in this age group.\n      </p>", "Although feral animal management is often based on the proposition that introduced species threaten ecological and conservation values, that view is not necessarily shared by all stakeholders, including those indigenous people who own and co-manage Kakadu National Park with Australia's federal government. Drawing on field-based interviews with the Jawoyn people, we found that these indigenous people categorize water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) as an important food source (tucker), view horses (Equus caballus) as bush pets, and consider pigs (Sus scrofa) a threat to their lands. As a result, Jawoyn people want more water buffalo in the park, have high tolerance of environmental damage caused by horses, and are open to the idea that pig population densities should be reduced. Jawoyn also advocate an adaptive and participatory approach to feral animal control so that the consequences of any management actions can be properly understood before irrevocable change occurs. These findings highlight one example of how indigenous people's ecological knowledge has adapted in response to changing landscapes and community aspirations. Co-anagement strategies that aim to incorporate the dynamics of indigenous people's views need to start with issues on which there is agreement between different groups and take a cautious approach to joint exploration of more contentious issues. That approach should include ongoing and on-site monitoring so that the consequences of management actions can be properly understood and comprehensively negotiated by all parties.\n      </p>", "Background: Contact with household pets has been suggested to be inversely associated with lymphoma risk. Methods: We tested the hypothesis in a case-control study of lymphoma in the Sardinia region of Italy. Cases were 326 patients, first diagnosed with lymphoma in 1999-2003. Controls were 464 population controls, frequency matched to cases by age, gender, and area of residence. In person interviews included self-reported household contact with pets and birds, type of pet(s), and age at starting contact. Results: Frequent contact with birds was inversely associated with lymphoma, and particularly B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (odds ratio [OR] = 0.6, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.4, 0.9). Contact with chickens accounted for this inverse association, which was strongest for first contact occurring at age \u22648 years (OR = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2, 1.0). No association was observed when first contact occurred at age 9 or older. Contact with any pets was inversely associated with risk of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (OR = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2, 1.0), but not other lymphoma subtypes. Conclusion: Our results support the hypothesis that earlylife exposure to pets, birds and particularly with chickens might be associated with a reduced risk of lymphoma.\n      </p>", "Free-roaming urban pets cause significant problems because they harbor zoonoses, bite human beings, cause accidents, destroy property and wildlife, and create nuisances and pollution. In the United States, about 30,000 persons each year receive post-exposure anti-rabies treatment; the national animal bite rate is estimated to be 1 per 250 persons per year. The Humane Society of the United States estimates that local governments and humane societies spend $250 million annually on impoundment and destruction of unwanted animals. Simultaneous application of several control measures could substantially reduce the number of stray and straying animals. The measures include discouraging ownership of pets, encouraging ownership of male or spayed female pets by charging owners of unspayed females for expensive breeders' licenses, encouraging the surrender of unwanted pets, and prohibiting the abandonment of pet animals. Adoption of these measures must also include mass education of the public to create an awareness of the urban hazards of roaming animals and of the responsibilities of pet ownership. Further, control measures will not be accepted unless the public is convinced that unwanted animals are captured and impounded, and unclaimed ones put to death, in an efficient and humane manner.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "The Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy (PIAMA) study is a birth cohort study that investigates the influence of allergen exposure on the development of allergy and asthma in the first several years of life. The objectives of this study were to investigate the relationship between a family history of allergy and/or asthma and exposure of newborn children to mite and pet allergen and to study the influence of different home and occupant characteristics on mite allergen exposure. Dust was sampled from the child's mattress and the parental mattress at 3 months after birth of the index child and analyzed for mite and pet allergens. Subjects were divided in groups according to history of asthma and allergy in their parents, and allergen exposure was studied in the different groups. Cat allergen exposure was significantly lower on parental mattresses in families with allergic mothers, but dog allergen exposure was not different. Mite allergen exposure was lower on parental mattresses in families with allergic mothers. Use of mite allergen-impermeable mattress covers reduced mite allergen exposure. Some other characteristics such as age of home and mattress were also found to influence mite allergen exposure. Parental mattresses in homes of allergic mothers had lower cat and mite (but not dog) allergen loadings than mattresses in homes of nonallergic parents. Paternal (as opposed to maternal) allergy seemed to have little influence.\n      </p>", "The psychological and emotional roles played by pets in the urban household are examined. Telephone interviews were conducted with 320 pet owners and 116 nonowners in Providence, Rhode Island. Respondents were obtained from a systematic random sample of the telephone directory. Sociodemographic differences exist between pet owners and those who do not have pets. Remarried people, families with children present, and families in the \"middle\" stages of the life cycle are most likely to have pets, whereas pet ownership is low among widows, empty-nesters, families with infants, and those with annual incomes of $8,000 or less. Responses to the survey indicate that pets are viewed as important family members by people who live in the city. However, the roles played by pets are related to the social structure of the household. Attachment to pets is highest among never-married, divorced, widowed and remarried people, childless couples, newlyweds, and empty-nesters. Never-married, divorced, and remarried people, and people without children present, are also most likely to anthropomorphize their pets. Pet attachment and anthropomorphism are also related to type of pet. Both dimensions of pet-human bonds are highest among people who have dogs. The findings of the survey are discussed within the framework of family development theory and changing household composition in the United States.\n      </p>", "This paper intends to track the naming criteria for dogs among the Chan\u00e9. Links between onomastics and diverse cultural contexts are thus analysed, such as the daily treatment and attitudes towards dogs, mythic symbolism, etymology, human names, names of domestic pets, and taxonomic classification. In a comparative perspective, meaningful relationships are also verified with the dynamics of ethnic relationships and mythologies of Chaco ethnic groups.\n      </p>", "Rabies was eradicated from the UK in 1922 through strict controls of dog movement and investigation of every incident of disease. Amendments were made to the UK quarantine laws and the Pet Travel Scheme (PETS) was subsequently introduced in 2000 for animals entering the UK from qualifying listed countries. European Regulation 998/2003 on the non-commercial movement of pet animals initiated the European Union Pet Movement Policy (EUPMP) in July 2004. The introduction of EUPMP harmonized the movement of pet animals within the EU (EUPMP listed ) but raised the possibility of domestic animals entering the UK from a non-EU state where rabies is endemic (EUPMP unlisted ). A quantitative risk assessment was developed to estimate the risk of rabies entering the UK from Turkey via companion animals that are incubating the disease and enter through PETS or EUPMP compared to quarantine. Specifically, the risk was assessed by estimating the annual probability of rabies entering the UK and the number of years between rabies entries for each scheme. The model identified that the probability of rabies entering the UK via the three schemes is highly dependent on compliance. If 100% compliance is assumed, PETS and EUPMP unlisted (at the current level of importation) present a lower risk than quarantine, i.e. the number of years between rabies entry is more than 170721 years for PETS and 60163 years for EUPMP unlisted compared to 41 851 years for quarantine (with 95% certainty). If less than 100% compliance is assumed, PETS and EUPMP unlisted (at the current level of importation) present a higher risk. In addition, EUPMP listed and EUPMP unlisted (at an increased level of importation) present a higher risk than quarantine or PETS at 100% compliance and at an uncertain level of compliance.\n      </p>", "Using a multi-dimensional, multi-measure approach, this study examined children's attachment to their pets and related three dimensions of such attachment\u2014behavioral, affective and cognitive\u2014to empathy and perceived competence. Child characteristics (age, sex), family characteristics (marital status, socioeconomic status, maternal employment and family size) and pet type (dog, cat) as influences on attachment to pets also were explored. Individual interviews were conducted with 120 children from kindergarten, second-and fifth-grades, and questionnaire responses were collected from one parent of each child. Pet attachment was higher for older children and those whose mothers were employed. Pet attachment related differently to empathy and perceived competence depending upon grade level.\n      </p>", "           ", "Using the concepts of \"identity\" and \"situational identity\" as developed in symbolic interactionism, this article focuses on student-perceived consequences of pets victims phenomena in the high school setting. The consequences for self-defined pets include experiencing the ridicule of one's peers, and greater pressure from teachers than normal concerning academic performance and classroom demeanour. The consequences for class victims are seen in marking and disciplining processes, in the development of a dislike for teachers, in antipathy among students, and in students' empathizing with those apparently victimized by teachers' actions. The complexities of pets victims phenomena challenge researchers and teachers alike to use diverse theoretical orientations and research techniques in order to understand teacher student interactions. /// A l'aide des concepts d'\"identit\u00e9\" et \"d'identit\u00e9 situationnelle\" d\u00e9finis dans le contexte de l'interactionnisme symbolique, cet article \u00e9tudie comment les \u00e9l\u00e8ves du secondaire per\u00e7oivent les cons\u00e9quences du ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne des chouchous et des souffre-douleur des professeurs.

Within-household transmission of Escherichia coli may promote urinary tract infection (UTI) but is poorly understood. Methods. Fecal samples from 228 individuals (152 humans [5 with acute UTI] and 76 pets) in 63 households were extensively processed for unique E. coli clones, as defined by random-amplified polymorphic DNA analysis and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Patterns of strain sharing (presence of a clone in multiple individuals) were assessed. Results. Of 335 E. coli clones, 90 (27%) were recovered from multiple hosts (up to 11 per clone). Within-household strain sharing (1) involved 68% of households, including 3 of 5 households in which a member had a UTI; (2) was more frequent than across-household strain sharing (27% vs. 0.8% of potential sharing pairs; P &lt; .001); (3) increased with household size (r\u00b2 = 0.93; P &lt; .001); and (4) varied by host-pair type (pet-pet, 58%; human-human, 31%; human-pet, 17%). Sex partners shared strains more commonly than did other adults (31% vs. 7% of pairs; P=.08) but accounted for only 12% of within-household strain sharing. Conclusions. Within-household sharing of E. coli, including in households in which a member has a UTI, is common and can involve any combination of humans and pets. Identification of the underlying mechanism(s) could lead to novel preventive measures against UTI.\n      </p>", "Hurricane Katrina was not the first disaster to expose companion animals and their guardians to significant risk, nor was it the first time organizations were involved in the recovery of animals left by people who evacuated. Yet it was during Hurricane Katrina that there was significant media exposure to the plight of pets in disasters. The purpose of this article is to (1) explore preexisting characteristics of disaster vulnerability of people who experienced pet loss, and (2) examine pet loss in association with evacuation behaviors and other traumatic experiences. The survey data are from a random sample of 1,510 Hurricane Katrina survivors conducted by the Gallup Organization in September and October 2005. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were conducted. Women, younger adults, and people who evacuated were more likely to have lost a pet during Hurricane Katrina. Additionally, people who lost pets were statistically different from their counterparts in terms of experiencing other traumatic events, including being separated from family, staying in an emergency shelter, and being hurt or injured. The results of this study support calls for greater attention to companion animals and their guardians during disasters in order to promote public health and safety.\n      </p>", "New federal legislation requiring accommodation of pets and service animals in emergency planning has garnered broad, bipartisan support.

We describe their different roles as patients and laboratory models in the emergence of two new biomedical objects that we call \"implant-pets\" and \"bone-sheep.\" For this purpose, the ways of practicing (veterinary) orthopaedic surgery and of \"materializing,\" or bringing into being, complex and heterogeneous biomedical objects are analyzed as the coevolving histories of humans and animals. Focusing on non-discursive material practices, we use the concept of \"articulation\" in order to explore the inventive and intervening character of biomedical practices that led to the existence of implant-pets and bone-sheep. Our analysis interprets the distribution of human-like and animal-like character features and values to these animals not as the result of a stable animal-human boundary, but as the effect of diverse interactions in contingent historical situations. This dynamic\u2014relational approach makes it possible to investigate the drawing of human-animal boundaries in the making and thus contributes in a new way to the study of animal-human relationships in history.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), like many other technologies, is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, this automatic identification technology would enable entirely unobstructed visibility into the supply chain and would dramatically reduce industry costs. On the other hand, RFID raises consumer privacy issues both in and outside retail surroundings. RFID not only permits extended capabilities of data collection, but also a creates new threat of tracking individuals. Inherent drawbacks in Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) developed to address these concerns make it impossible, at least at this stage of development, for the PETs to independently provide a satisfactory response to the privacy concerns. To achieve adequate privacy protection, industry behavior should not only be directed by technology, but also must be regulated by other means. This Article calls on users of RFID technology to embrace self-regulatory measures and argues that legislation or other governmental regulation may deny businesses and consumers of the benefits of technology and is therefore not yet warranted. As a self-regulatory measure, existing \"fair information practices\" (FIPs) offer a good starting point but cannot be adopted as-is for RFID technology. This Article attempts to assess what FIPs are to be adopted and how some of their existing principles should be adapted and tailored to the distinctive characteristics of RFID technology.

Most previous studies which have claimed that pets confer health benefits were cross-sectional. So they were open to the objection that owners may have been healthier in the first place, rather than becoming healthier due to owning a pet. In both countries the data show that pet owners make about 15% fewer annual doctor visits than non-owners. The relationship remains statistically significant after controlling for gender, age, marital status, income and other variables associated with health. The German data come from the German Socio-Economic Panel in which respondents have been interviewed every year since 1984 (N = 9723).

They are successful because they succeed in promoting a sense of reality in users' minds. While visual reality is a familiar element of realism, a subjective sense of reality can also prove effective. By designing interaction in a mode that takes users' psychology into account, such a sense of reality can be enhanced, especially when a user perceives an independent personality in his/her digital pet.

Previously, we purified and characterized the pets factor, demonstrating that it is a 43-kDa nuclear protein. We now describe the identification of DEK as this 43-kDa pets factor. Using a modified Southwestern screening procedure, we find that DEK can recognize the pets element. We demonstrate the ability of recombinant DEK to bind specifically to the pets site using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and DNase I footprinting. ``Supershift'' EMSA further confirms that DEK is the dominant protein binding to the pets site in T cell extracts. Our findings show that DEK is a site-specific DNA binding protein that is likely involved in transcriptional regulation and signal transduction. This has implications for multiple pathogenic processes, including hematologic malignancies, arthritis, ataxia-telangiectasia, and AIDS caused by HIV-2.\n      </p>", "In this article, we use a multimethod approach to shed light on the strategic use of presidential pets. We draw on primary source materials to demonstrate that pets are an important power center in the White House. Then we turn to presidents' strategic use of their pets in public. We present a theoretical framework and statistical evidence to explore the conditions under which presidents are most likely to trot out their four-legged friends. We show that presidents carefully gauge the best and worst times to conduct a dog and pony show. In times of war or scandal, dogs are welcome public companions, but not so in periods of economic hardship.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Proteomic analysis of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplast ribosome identified an S1-like protein, plastid-specific ribosomal protein-7 (PSRP-7), as a stoichiometric component of the 30S subunit. Here, we report that PSRP-7 is part of a polyprotein that contains PSRP-7 on its amino end and two translation elongation factor Ts (EF-Ts) domains at the carboxy end. We named this polyprotein PETs (for polyprotein of EF-Ts). Pets is a single-copy gene containing the only chloroplast PSRP-7 and EF-Ts sequences found in the C. reinhardtii genome. The pets precursor transcript undergoes alternative splicing to generate three mRNAs with open reading frames (ORFs) of 1.68, 1.8, and 3 kb. A 110-kD pro-protein is translated from the 3-kb ORF, and the majority of this protein is likely posttranslationally processed into the 65-kD protein PSRP-7 and a 55-kD EF-Ts. PETs homologs are found in Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa). The conservation of the 110-kD PETs polyprotein in the plant kingdom suggests that PSRP-7 and EF-Ts function together in some aspects of chloroplast translation and that the PETs pro-protein may have a novel function as a whole.\n      </p>", "Virtual worlds, such as the one inhabited by the players of World of Warcraft, can serve as sampling grounds for students who are video gamers.\n      </p>", "The research on organizational framing and the metaphor of institutional \"thinking\" highlight the ways that social problems organizations shape the ameliorative services they deliver. Social problems work then perpetuates representations of problems that may not match the conditions clients face. This study extends social problems literature to argue that organizations sometimes \"think\" differently about the problems they intend to solve than do persons involved with these problems in everyday life. Using ethnographic research and interviews, this article contrasts the way in which animal sheltering, as an institution, frames the problem of unwanted animals with how the public interprets that problem. Institutional \"thinking\" portrays pets as commitments for life, and shelters thus strive to offer resources that allow people to keep their animals in their homes. However, interviews reveal that most people simply want troublesome animals out of their homes. This mismatch of intentions sheds new light on the complexities of claims-making and social problems work. In particular, the \"paradox of popularization\" means that efforts to gain public support for definitions of social problems often ignore or exacerbate aspects of problems that do not fit institutional frames.\n      </p>", "Because of extensive media coverage, it is now widely believed that pets enhance their owners' health, sense of psychological well-being, and longevity. But while some researchers have reported that positive effects accrue from interacting with animals, others have found that the health and happiness of pet owners is no better, and in some cases worse, than that of non\u2014pet owners. I discuss some reasons why studies of the effects of pets on people have produced conflicting results, and I argue that the existence of a generalized \"pet effect\" on human mental and physical health is at present not a fact but an unsubstantiated hypothesis.\n      </p>", "With the rise of modern pet keeping in the eighteenth century came many published epitaphs and elegies honoring dead pets. Some of these works were simply literary games or satires; others served more serious agendas, allowing writers to speculate about the relationship between humans, God, and the natural world. Often the animal that was ostensibly the subject of an elegy or epitaph was incidental to the writer's purpose. By the end of the eighteenth century, however, such works were increasingly focused on an individual pet and a special emotional bond between human and animal. Changing attitudes toward nature, sensibility, and characteristics traditionally associated with femininity both encouraged and were encouraged by changing attitudes toward pets and pet keeping.\n      </p>", "Clostridium difficile may be an emerging community-associated pathogen but little is known about its sources of exposure. This study evaluated C. difficile contamination in households and colonization of pets. C. difficile was isolated from 44/836 (5-3%) sites in 26/84 (31%) households. Ribotype 027 was the most common (25%) environmental strain. C. difficile was isolated from 14/139 (10%) dogs. Living with an immunocompromised individual was associated with C. difficile colonization in dogs. All toxigenic strains identified in pets have been isolated from humans in Ontario. C. difficile was isolated concurrently from dogs and the environment in four households, but in all cases canine and environmental ribotypes were different. C. difficile was relatively common in households, suggesting that exposure to this pathogen may be a regular event. There was no evidence that dogs are a significant source of household C. difficile contamination.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

To model the relationships between mountain lion depredation and various human activity and habitat factors, we tested 2 predictive models. Domestic sheep depredation in counties was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) related to amount of suitable mountain lion habitat. We hypothesize that increasing domestic sheep depredation may reflect regional increases in the distribution and abundance of mountain lions. A regression model of percent pet depredation indicated a significant (P &lt; 0.05) association with average annual new house development (1979-1993). Counties with significant pet depredation are in the same regions where public safety problems have occurred and reflect a radiation of human activity into mountain lion habitat. Mountain lion depredation data may be a useful index of regional mountain lion activity. Livestock and pet depredation problems are increasing in different regions of the state for different reasons; pet depredations are increasing the most rapidly.
