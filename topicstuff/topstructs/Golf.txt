{"total_words": 822, "documents": ["A perspective of the golf swing is defined, and current knowledge of swing mechanics is reviewed. The implications of previous research are collected. A conventional arm-club simulation model is set up and used to show that an apparently important result from the literature is incorrect. The swing model is fitted, through a parametric optimization process, to data relating to expert golfers. The kinematic deficiencies of the arm-club model are pointed out and a shoulder-arm-club simulation model with shaft flexibility is developed. Parameters of the shoulder-arm-club model for best matching the expert-golfer data are found by optimization. The torques generated by the golfers are deduced. The shoulder-arm-club model is then applied for finding whether or not improvements to the observed torque histories are possible, with a positive result. A pattern for the optimal use of available driving torques is established. Scaling of the problem to help the understanding of the relationship between large and small players is studied through dimensional analysis. Several contributory conclusions are drawn.\n      </p>", "Golf courses are often considered to be chemical-intensive ecosystems with negative impacts on fauna. Here we provide evidence that golf courses can contribute to the support and conservation of wetland fauna, i.e., amphibians and macroinvertebrates. Comparisons of amphibian occurrence, diversity of macroinvetebrates, and occurrence of species of conservation concern were made between permanent freshwater ponds surveyed on golf courses around Sweden's capital city, Stockholm, and off-course ponds in natureprotected areas and residential parklands. A total of 71 macroinvertebrate species were recorded in the field study, with no significant difference between golf course ponds and offcourse ponds at the species, genus, or family levels. A within-group similarities test showed that golf course ponds have a more homogenous species composition than ponds in natureprotected areas and ponds in residential parkland. Within the macroinvertebrate group, a total of 11 species of odonates were identified, with no difference detected between the categories of ponds, nor any spatial autocorrelation. Significant differences were found between pond categories in the occurrence of five species of amphibians, although anuran occurrence did not differ between ponds. The great crested newt (Triturus cristatus) was significantly associated with golf course ponds, but the smooth newt (Triturus vulgaris) was not. We found no evidence of any correlation between pond size and occurrence of amphibians. Among the taxa of conservation concern included in the sample, all amphibians are nationally protected in Sweden, with the internationally threatened T. cristatus more frequently found in golf course ponds. Among macroinveterbrates of conservation status, the large white-faced darter dragonfly (Leucorrhinia pectoralis) was only detected in golf course ponds, and Tricholeiochitonfagesi (Trichoptera) was only found in one off-course pond. GIS results revealed that golf courses provide over a quarter of all available permanent, freshwater ponds in central greater Stockholm. We assert that golf courses have the potential to contribute to wetland fauna support, particularly in urban settings where they may significantly contribute to wetland creation. We propose a greater involvement of ecologists in the design of golf courses to further bolster this potential.\n      </p>", "We surveyed the avian communities of 87 golf courses during the 2002 breeding season to determine whether golf courses provided significant habitat for birds of conservation concern in Virginia. We defined birds of conservation concern as those with breeding priority scores \u226516 in our region, as classified by Partners in Flight (2002). The species richness and relative abundance of birds on golf courses varied widely, but in general, courses supported few birds of conservation concern. We found that a typical course had &lt;7 species of conservation concern at a relative abundance of &lt;2 birds of conservation concern per hectare. This compared unfavorably to richness and relative abundance values found at reference landscapes selected to represent the land that golf courses replaced in this region. Because some golf courses had &gt;3 times as many species of conservation concern as others, we compared the land cover on the richest and most depauperate golf courses in an attempt to explain what attracted birds of conservation concern to some courses but not others. Proportions of forested land within the golf-course boundaries and within 1.5 km of the center of the course were the best predictors of a course's conservation value. Our results suggested that 1) regional planners should not expect typical golf courses to provide more habitat for birds of conservation concern than alternative land uses, including residential or agricultural uses; and 2) designers of golf courses in this region can increase the conservation value of courses by increasing the amount of forested land on the course.\n      </p>", "Previous work on gradients of human-altered landscapes has identified golf courses as potentially valuable areas for wildlife conservation. We assessed 6 golf courses in and around Oxford, Ohio that were surrounded by varying degrees of land-use intensity and studied bird communities within these courses to identify factors that promote diverse bird assemblages. We used a Geographic Information System (GIS) and aerial photography to estimate percentages of different land-cover types surrounding each course using buffers at scales of 100-1,000 m. We also measured on-site vegetation characteristics within 50 m of the same points used for bird sampling. We used simple linear regressions between each environmental variable and bird community statistics (abundance, species richness, Shannon diversity, and evenness) to determine which variables had the most influence on bird communities. We found that landscapes surrounding golf courses were the most important determinants of bird diversity and on-site variables were relatively unimportant. Specifically, natural land-cover buffers (forests, riparian areas, and open water) promote bird diversity and residential cover reduces diversity, especially in small buffers immediately surrounding courses. Results were similar when we limited the bird data set to Neotropical migrants or to birds with declining population trends.\n      </p>", "Although golf-course construction significantly alters natural wildlife habitat, the resulting remnant, disturbed, and introduced landscape patches may provide valuable habitat for birds. Considering the current rate of new course construction, the effects of land consumption and habitat alteration on breeding bird communities in coastal South Carolina are of immediate concern. During summer 2000 and 2001, we sampled 24 golf-course landscape units (GCLU) to assess their value to the breeding bird community. We defined a GCLU as the legally owned parcel of land where a golf course was sited, including the course and all associated development (e.g., residential housing). Sample units (n=24) were selected to represent a gradient of GCLUs ranging from low to high landscape alteration and were subjectively classified a priori into 1 of 3 alteration groups (G1 [low], G2 [medium] or G3 [high]). We conducted Analysis of Variance procedures to determine whether estimations of species richness, Neotropical migrant richness, and degree of conservation concern differed across the gradient. We explored relative strengths of associations between landscape structure (landscape composition and spatial configuration) and avian community parameters at 2 spatial scales using stepwise multiple regression techniques. We used simple linear regression to assess the relationship between percent forested area of the GCLU and avian community parameters. Total number of speices and number of Neotropical migrant species, as well as degree of conservation concern of the species present, were higher in less-altered GCLUs (&lt;latex&gt;$F_{2,\\ 21}&lt;14$&lt;/latex&gt;, P&lt;0.05), and were significantly influenced by percent forested area (adj. &lt;tex-math&gt;$R^{2}=0.39-0.57$&lt;/tex-math&gt;). The majority of birds associated with less-developed landscapes were woodland and scrub-shrub breeding species, while urban-breeding species were found primarily in the more-alter landscapes (&lt;tex-math&gt;$\\chi ^{2}=440.3$&lt;/tex-math&gt;, df=6, n=4757, P&lt;0.001). The area of forest and disturbance patches, size variability in managed turfgrass patches, and measures of spatial complexity proved most useful in explaining variability of response variables due to landscape structure (adj. &lt;tex-math&gt;$R^{2}=0.57-0.90$&lt;/tex-math&gt;).\n      </p>", "The goal of our study was to determine how golf courses in the desert environment impact the indigenous bird community and, particularly, to see whether golf courses may serve as surrogate riparian habitats for southwestern birds. We compared the avian communities on 5 golf courses in the Albuquerque, New Mexico area (4 traditional and 1 \"naturalistic\") to those of 5 paired natural areas that served as reference sites. We surveyed birds using breeding-season point counts over 2 years and measured several habitat characteristics of each site. In agreement with most other studies of urbanization effects, we found that bird abundance was greater on 4 out of 5 golf courses. In contrast to many studies of urban birds, we found that both total species richness and species diversity was higher on the golf courses in 3 out of 5 cases, and indigenous species richness was higher on all 5 of the golf courses. Of the bird species unique to the golf-course communities, 74% were riparian associates. Although they had high numbers of indigenous species, most of the individuals on golf courses were relatively common generalist species. The naturalistic golf course that was dominated by native vegetation had greater indigenous bird species richness, diversity, and abundance when compared to its reference site and all of the other courses. We conclude that golf courses do have the potential to support riparian bird communities but that their conservation potential can be enhanced through the addition of habitat complexity and structure.\n      </p>", "Various summary statistics collected by the Professional Golf Association European tour for 1998-2001 are investigated, in particular to see how well these predict golfing success. The paper tries to avoid predicting something by itself, as previous papers have in effect done, concentrating on key parts of the game only. We conclude that the game of golf is too complex to characterize by the relatively small set of variables that are currently used, and we suggest further quantities which, if measured, would allow a more informative analysis.\n      </p>", "Analysis of reproductive parameters of birds breeding on golf courses can provide valuable insight into the biological effects of the golf-course environment on wildlife. For 6 seasons (1999-2004) we monitored initiation of breeding, inter-nest intervals, clutch size, brood size, and chick condition of eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) in North Carolina with \u223c150 nestboxes in available nongolf habitat (hayfields, old fields, pastures) and up to 250 on golf courses. Bluebirds nesting on golf courses initiated their first nests an average of 1 day later and laid slightly smaller clutches (4.4 vs. 4.5) than pairs nesting in nongolf habitat. The mean time interval between spring and summer nests was 3.5 days longer for bluebirds on golf courses. Brood size did not differ significantly between golf and nongolf habitat. Nestlings (the shortest-winged chick in each brood) on golf courses were in slightly but significantly poorer condition than those in nongolf habitat. Using 2 independent measures of condition-quality (residuals from a linear regression of mass on &lt;tex-math&gt;$\\text{wing}^{3}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;, tail symmetry), we found that adults of both sexes breeding on golf courses were similar to those nesting in nongolf habitat. While these adult data do not rule out the possibility that the poorer performance of bluebirds on golf courses was due to settlement of golf courses by inferior birds, they do suggest that a more direct effect is at least as plausible. Similarly, although we cannot rule out direct effects of chemical contamination or human disturbance, the lower abundance of arthropods on golf courses provides a likely mechanism for the slightly poorer performance of bluebirds breeding there.\n      </p>", "As human pressures continue to alter and degrade natural wetlands, alternative habitats such as created wetlands may become increasingly important to wetland-dependent species. Golf-course ponds and impoundments in Florida often are used both to store water for irrigation and to prevent extensive flooding during the rainy season. These semipermanent water bodies also may provide habitat for waterbirds. To determine the habitat value of constructed golf-course ponds to waterbirds, we quantified the abundance and diversity of waterbirds using 183 ponds on 12 courses in southwest Florida from January through April 2001 and 2002. We also quantified vegetation and hydrological features of ponds to determine their correlation with waterbird site selection. We recorded 10,474 birds representing 42 species during the 2-year period. We categorized species into 6 foraging guilds, which we used for analyses and management recommendations. In general, results from this study indicate that golf-course ponds are capable of attracting many species of waterbirds. However, analysis of site preference resulted in a wide range of pond features selected by each foraging guild. This finding coupled with low densities of birds (&lt;2 birds/ha for most species) suggested that the value of golf-course ponds may be enhanced through vegetation and hydrological modifications designed to appeal to specific guilds.\n      </p>", "We assessed adult reproductive and nesting success, and developmental instability, survival, and condition of nestling eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) breeding in nestboxes on and off golf courses. With this information we tested hypotheses predicting that nestboxes on golf-course habitat provided poor nesting and chick-rearing environments due to pesticide pollution or other factors. Contrary to our prediction, nestboxes on golf courses received 28% more bluebird eggs and produced 17% more fledglings than nestboxes on nongolf sites. Individual nests on golf courses appeared to have slightly reduced probabilities of survival during laying and incubation, but we found no depression in the overall Mayfield survival probabilities. Surprisingly, nestling bluebirds raised in golf-course boxes exhibited 39% less fluctuating asymmetry of their tarsus bones, possibly an indicator that nestlings that survived to fledge had been under less stress during development. This may have resulted from stronger selection against asymmetrical nestlings on golf courses, or it may indicate that golf-course nestboxes provide higher-quality habitat for bluebirds. Our results suggest that for this bird species, nestboxes on the golf-course habitat we studied can provide high-quality rearing environments and may serve as population sources. This may not apply to other species, including most birds of conservation concern, which do not nest in protected artificial cavities or forage directly on turfgrass habitat.\n      </p>", "Burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia) populations are declining in many portions of their range, and lack of suitable nesting burrows is thought to be one reason for observed declines. Burrowing owls are attracted to golf courses because the birds generally nest and forage in short-grass, open areas, yet golf courses seldom have suitable nesting burrows. We examined the efficacy of installing artificial nesting burrows on golf courses as a way to help restore local burrowing owl populations. From 2001-2004 we monitored over 175 natural burrows off golf courses, 14 natural burrows on golf courses, 86 artificial burrows off golf courses, and 130 artificial burrows on golf courses. Owls located and used 8 of the 130 artificial burrows installed on golf courses (4 were used as nests). Owls selected burrows that were closer to existing natural burrows, farther from maintained areas (areas receiving turf maintenance by golf course staff), and farther from sprinkler heads. All 4 of the artificial burrows used as nests successfully fledged young, and annual site fidelity for owls nesting on golf courses was higher than for owls nesting off golf courses. However, annual fecundity of owls nesting on golf courses was lower than that of owls nesting off golf courses. If golf courses have sufficiently large nonmaintained areas and there are nesting owls nearby, course managers potentially can help in restoring local burrowing owl populations by installing artificial nesting burrows on the periphery of the course. However, the low fecundity on golf courses reported here should be more thoroughly examined before artificial burrows are used to attract owls to golf courses.\n      </p>", "Golf is said to be among the most rapidly increasing forms of land use, yet little is known of the effects of golf courses and golf playing on wildlife. A Norwegian population of the endangered ortolan bunting (Emberiza hortulana) occurs on a forest burn that has an area allocated to golf. Some forest-burn habitat (heather [Calluna vulgaris] heath with scattered, small Scots pines [Pinus sylvestris]) remains between fairways and on the periphery of the golf course. I compared pairing success, residence times, and emigration rates of male ortolan buntings in the interior and periphery of the golf course and in a neighboring part of undisturbed forest burn (control area). Males in the interior of the golf course (n = 4) never attracted females and less than half (43%, n = 7) in the golf periphery did so, whereas most males in the control area attracted females (77%, n = 13; all males on golf course vs. control: P = 0.038). Males in the golf interior had shorter residence times than males on the golf periphery, and both were present for a shorter time than males in the control area (golf vs. control: P = 0.030). All males that had territories in the golf interior emigrated to other areas (median = 13.3 km away). The emigration rate was lower for males on the golf periphery (43%) and even lower in the control area (15%; golf vs. control: P = 0.033). Males emigrating from the golf course attracted females at the same rate as control males in their new areas of residence. Compared to males in the rest of the forest burn (n = 76), males on the golf course had shorter residence times (P = 0.049) and higher emigration rate (P = 0.009), but pairing success was not different (P = 0.196). Overall, the golf course did not seem to be attractive to ortolan buntings, although the lack of other populations on golf courses precludes replicate studies. Whether the apparent avoidance was due to fragmentation of breeding habitat on the golf course, human disturbance, or some other reason remains to be tested. In the case of the ortolan bunting, the negative effects of the golf course probably would have been reduced if remaining natural habitat had been concentrated to the periphery of the golf course and adjacent to other bunting habitat.\n      </p>", "The placement of various tee boxes on golf courses subsidizes the first shot of each hole for certain players. McCormick and Tollison find that this subsidy is statistically larger (other factors equal) in the southern US states and that it has been decreasing over time. These findings illustrate more general issues of chivalry, gender, age, and opportunity costs. The economics profession will undoubtedly continue to use sports data to better understand the behavior and interactions of people and firms in the economy.\n      </p>", "Understanding the role of green space in urban\u2013suburban landscapes is becoming critical for bird conservation because of rampant habitat loss and conversion. Although not natural habitat, golf courses could play a role in bird conservation if they support breeding populations of some native species, yet scientists remain skeptical. In 2003\u20132009, we measured reproduction of Eastern Bluebirds (Siala sialis) in Virginia on golf courses and surrounding reference habitats, of the type that would have been present had golf courses not been developed on these sites (e.g., recreational parks, cemeteries, agriculture land, and college campus). We monitored &gt;650 nest boxes and 2,255 nest attempts (n = 1,363 golf course, n = 892 reference site). We used an information-theoretic modeling approach to evaluate whether conditions on golf courses affected timing of breeding, investment, or nest productivity compared with nearby reference sites. We found that Eastern Bluebirds breeding on golf courses reproduced as well as those breeding in other disturbed habitats. Habitat type had no effect on initial reproductive investment, including date of clutch initiation or clutch size ( = 4 eggs). During incubation and hatching, eggs in nests on golf courses had higher hatching rates (80%) and brood sizes ( = 4.0 nestlings brood\u20131) than nests on reference sites (75% hatching rate; = 3.8 nestlings brood\u20131). Mortality of older nestlings was also lower on golf courses and, on average, golf course nests produced 0.3 more fledglings than nests on reference sites. Thus, within a matrix of human-dominated habitats, golf courses may support productive populations of some avian species that can tolerate moderate levels of disturbance, like Eastern Bluebirds.\n         \u2014Comprender el papel del espacio verde en paisajes urbanos\u2013suburbanos se est\u00e1 haciendo cr\u00edtico para la conservaci\u00f3n de las aves debido a la marcada p\u00e9rdida y conversi\u00f3n de h\u00e1bitats.

Monitoreamos m\u00e1s de 650 cajas de anidaci\u00f3n y 2255 intentos de anidaci\u00f3n (n = 1363 en campos de golf, n = 892 en sitios de referencia). Empleamos un enfoque de modelamiento basado en teor\u00eda de la informaci\u00f3n para evaluar si las condiciones de los campos de golf afectaban el momento en que ten\u00eda lugar la reproducci\u00f3n, la inversi\u00f3n reproductiva o la productividad de los nidos en comparaci\u00f3n con sitios de referencia cercanos. Encontramos que los individuos que se reproducen en los campos de golf lo hacen tan bien como los que cr\u00edan en otros ambientes perturbados. El tipo de h\u00e1bitat no tuvo efecto sobre la inversi\u00f3n reproductiva inicial, incluyendo la fecha de iniciaci\u00f3n de nidadas y el tama\u00f1o de la puesta ( = 4 huevos). Durante la incubaci\u00f3n y la eclosi\u00f3n, los huevos de los campos de golf presentaron mayores tasas de eclosi\u00f3n (80%) y las parvadas fueron de mayor tama\u00f1o ( = 4.0 pichones por parvada) en comparaci\u00f3n con los nidos de sitios de referencia (\u00e9xito de eclosi\u00f3n 75%; = 3.8 pichones por parvada). La mortalidad de los pichones m\u00e1s viejos tambi\u00e9n fue menor en los campos de golf y, en promedio, los nidos de campos de golf produjeron 0.3 m\u00e1s volantones que los nidos de los sitios de referencia. Por lo tanto, en una matriz de ambientes dominados por humanos, los campos de golf pueden sostener poblaciones productivas de algunas especies de aves que pueden tolerar niveles moderados de disturbio, como S. sialis.\n      </p>", "The red headed woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) once was a common species in much of the Midwest and eastern North America in oak (Quercus sp.) savanna, farmlands, and other open habitats with trees. This species has experienced a range-wide population decline over the last century that likely is associated with changes in land management within agro-ecosystems and loss of oak savanna. Due to structural similarities with natural habitats used by the species, we expected that golf courses could provide suitable breeding habitat for red-headed woodpeckers. From mid-May to early August 2002 and 2003, we censused red-headed woodpeckers on 100 randomly selected golf courses in northern and central Ohio, measured habitat characteristics at each course and surrounding each active woodpecker nest, and monitored nesting success of breeding pairs. We recorded 158 adult red-headed woodpeckers on 26 of the 100 censused courses. Golf courses used by red-headed woodpeckers contained trees that were 12% larger in diameter and had approximately twice as many hard-mast trees (e.g., oaks, hickories [Carya sp.], American beech [Fagus grandifolia]), standing dead trees (snags), and dead limbs as courses without woodpeckers. Habitat measurements at 49 active nests indicated that nest patches contained roughly twice as many hard-mast trees, snags, and dead limbs as non-nest habitat plots over the entire course. Most nests (67%) were located in dead limbs of live trees, rather than in snags. Of 16 nests monitored on courses, 75% successfully fledged \u22651 young, and this was comparable to 10 nests monitored off courses, for which 80% successfully fledged \u22651 young. Our findings illustrate that highly modified habitats, such as golf courses, could play a valuable role in the conservation of wildlife associated with open, disturbance-maintained wood-lands, including the declining red-headed woodpecker.\n      </p>", "The primary purpose of this paper is to provide an objective method for ranking the 18 holes of a golf course in order of difficulty.

Surveillance efforts in 2001-2002 documented the widespread occurrence of several types of potentially or measurably toxic harmful algal blooms (HABs) in these ponds. These man-made retention ponds were constructed in order to serve as a buffer between developed areas and open estuaries or for aesthetic reasons.

These discoveries introduce the need to consider mitigation measures to existing ponds and HAB preventive strategies for future pond construction.\n      </p>", "We compared the density and species richness of birds with the wildlife habitats found on four golf courses in the lower Fraser Valley region of British Columbia. From November 1990 to July 1991, 82 species of birds were observed during 120 bird counts. Twenty-nine species were considered to belong to the community of birds likely to be found on golf courses. Five species: the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), northwestern crow (Corvus caurinus), black-capped chickadee (Parus atricapillus), American robin (Turdus migratorius) and European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) were considered common. Bird density was greatest on ponds and waterways. Species richness was highest in hedgerows and wooded areas where foliage and vegetation at ground level had not been removed. Turf surfaces had the lowest density of birds and were the lowest in species richness.\n      </p>", "Managing areas designed for human recreation so that they are compatible with natural amphibian populations can reduce the negative impacts of habitat destruction. We examined the potential for amphibians to complete larval development in golf course ponds in the presence or absence of overwintered bullfrog tadpoles (Rana catesbeiana), which are frequently found in permanent, human-made ponds. We reared larval American toads (Bufo americanus), southern leopard frogs (R. sphenocephala), and spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) with 0 or 5 overwintered bullfrog tadpoles in field enclosures located in ponds on golf courses or in experimental wetlands at a reference site. Survival to metamorphosis of American toads, southern leopard frogs, and spotted salamanders was greater in ponds on golf courses than at reference sites. We attributed this increased survival to low abundance of insect predators in golf course ponds. The presence of overwintered bullfrogs, however, reduced the survival of American toads, southern leopard frogs, and spotted salamanders reared in golf course ponds, indicating that the suitability of the aquatic habitats for these species partly depended on the biotic community present. Our results suggest that ponds in human recreational areas should be managed by maintaining intermediate hydroperiods, which will reduce the presence of bullfrog tadpoles and predators, such as fish, and which may allow native amphibian assemblages to flourish. /// El manejo de \u00e1reas dise\u00f1adas para la recreaci\u00f3n humana de manera que sean compatibles con las poblaciones naturales de anfibios puede reducir los impactos negativos de la destrucci\u00f3n del h\u00e1bitat.

La supervivencia hasta la metamorfosis de B. americanus, R. sphenocephala y A. maculatum fue mayor en los campos de golf que en los sitios de referencia.

Data on collegiate football scores have instructive distributions that indicate more about the strengths of the teams playing than their absolute values would suggest. A robust analysis of professional football scores led to widespread publicity with the help of professional newswriters. Professional golf players on the regular tour are so close in skill that a few rounds do little to distinguish their abilities. A simple model for golf scoring is \"base +X\" where the base is a small score for a round rarely achieved, such as 64, and X is a Poisson distribution with mean about 8. In basketball, football, and hockey the leader at the beginning of the final period wins about 80% of the time, and in baseball the leader at the end of seven full innings wins 95% of the time.

This pattern was consistent also for comparisons based on measures of species richness, as well as for comparisons of overall measures of birds and insects\u2014the fauna groups most widely examined in the studies. Many golf courses also contribute to the preservation of fauna of conservation concern. More broadly, we found that the ecological value of golf courses significantly decreases with land types having low levels of anthropogenic impact, like natural and nature-protected areas. Conversely, the value of golf courses significantly increases with land that has high levels of anthropogenic impact, like agricultural and urban lands. From an ecosystem management perspective, golf courses represent a promising measure for restoring and enhancing biodiversity in ecologically simplified landscapes. Furthermore, the review suggests that golf courses hold a real potential to be designed and managed to promote critical ecosystem services, like pollination and natural pest control, providing an opportunity for joint collaboration among conservation, restoration and recreational interests.\n      </p>", "Two field experiments were conducted to evaluate the reduction of torpedograss canopy by multiple split applications of quinclorac applied postemergence (POST) to bermudagrass golf course roughs in Florida.

Quinclorac sprayed at 1.68 kg/ha/yr visually reduced torpedograss canopy to a varying extent, depending on the number of split applications. The most effective treatment, 0.42 kg/ha quinclorac applied four times each year for 2 yr, reduced torpedograss canopy to 10% compared with 86% torpedograss canopy in the untreated plots, and reduced torpedograss dry weight to 1,570 kg/ha compared with 8,010 kg/ha in the untreated plots. After reapplication for 2 yr with the commercially labeled treatment, quinclorac at 0.84 kg/ha applied twice per year, torpedograss canopy was reduced to 45% and dry weight to 4,640 kg/ha. Visual evaluation of canopy was too optimistic in representing the herbicidal control of torpedograss by quinclorac because torpedograss regrew from rhizomes, and canopy was a relatively small part of the plant. In plots not chemically treated, pachymorph rhizomes were 63%, leptomorph rhizomes were 24%, and leaves were only 13% of the total dry weight of torpedograss.\n      </p>", "Polaze\u0107i od spoznaje da je golf danas jedan od najpopularnijih i najrazvijenijih sportova u svijetu, posebno u emitivnim turisti\u010dkim zemljama, proizlaze potrebe za izgradnjom golf centara u Hrvatskoj. Analiza tr\u017ei\u0161ta golfa pokazuje da je golf danas kao sport postao nezaobilazan i nu\u017ean dio turisti\u010dke ponude, ne samo u europskim zemljama, nego diljem svijeta. Turisti\u010dka putovanja motivirana igranjem golfa do\u017eivljavaju veliku ekspanziju na vode\u0107im emitivnim turisti\u010dkim tr\u017ei\u0161tima svijeta. Danas oko 150 milijuna ljudi putuje u one destinacije koje raspola\u017eu kvalitetnim golf terenima, \u0161to predstavlja oko \u00bc ukupnih inozemnih turisti\u010dkih putovanja u svijetu. Polaze\u0107i od ekonomskih kriterija golfa koje smo istra\u017eenih i prezentiranih u ovom radu, smatramo da treba izvr\u0161iti revalorizaciju postoje\u0107ih planova. Izgradnji golf objekata sa prate\u0107om infrastrukturom treba prethoditi precizna i argumentirana studija razvoja sa tr\u017ei\u0161nim, ekonomskim, ekolo\u0161kim i svim drugim parametrima, koja \u0107e utvrditi ekonomsku efikasnost te dru\u0161tvenu rentabilnost svakog projekta posebno. U radu se do\u0161lo do zaklju\u010dka da je izgradnja golf terena potreba razvoja kvalitetnog turizma u Hrvatskoj, pa bi ga zbog toga trebali podr\u017eati svi relevantni \u010dimbenici, od vlade do turisti\u010dkih poduze\u0107a. Me\u0111utim, profitabilnost golfa mogu\u0107e je posti\u0107i samo u najrazvijenijim turisti\u010dkim destinacijama, a tih u Hrvatskoj ima svega nekoliko. The fact that golf today is one of the most popular and most developed sports in the world, especially in the tourism generating countries, is a prime mover which motivates the building of golf centres in Croatia. The market analysis shows that golf today is an inevitable and a necessary part of tourist offer, not only in European countries, but all over the world. Tourist travel which is motivated by the possibility of playing golf in a particular tourism destination are increasing in all leading tourism generating markets. About 150 million people in the whole world travel today to those destinations in which quality golf courses may be found. This number represents about one fourth of all foreign tourist travels. Starting from the economic criteria analysed and presented in this paper, we are of the opinion that a reevaluation of the existing plans should be made. The building of golf facilities with the accompanying infrastructure should be preceded by an accurate and substantiated development study which would take into account all the market, economic, ecological and other parameters. This study would determine the economic efficiency and the social profitability of each project. Therefore, it may be concluded that the building of golf facilities in Croatia is necessary in order to develop high quality tourism. All relevant factors should be taken into account. However, the profitability of golf may be achieved only in the most developed tourism destinations, and there are only several such destinations in Croatia.\n      </p>", "We assessed dispersal behavior of 78 radiotagged adult spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) at a 36-hole golf course in southeastern Connecticut, USA. Lake of Isles Golf Course is atypical of most golf courses in North America because it is much larger (461 ha) than average 18-hole golf courses (54 ha) and deciduous forests accounted for 70% landscape composition on the course. We tracked individuals an average of 164 days as they emigrated from 3 seasonal pools surrounded by golf course fairways and one pool located in contiguous forest (control pool) from March through December 2004. Males and females dispersed similar distances at the control pool, averaging 71 \u00b1 10 m. However, females migrating across the golf course dispersed twice as far (214 \u00b125 m) as males on the golf course (102 \u00b1 15 m) and both genders at the control pool. Over 40% the salamanders at the golf course crossed fairways; thus, fairways were not a dispersal barrier to adult spotted salamanders. Previous researchers have suggested establishing a 164-m life zone around breeding ponds to protect pond-breeding amphibian populations. Our results suggest that strategies that protect core upland habitat within 164 m of wetland boundaries would include 82% of adult males and only 50% of adult females. Empirical estimates based on our telemetry study suggest that core terrestrial habitat would have to extend 370 m to protect 95% of adult females, which is much farther than previous estimates.\n      </p>", "What has been lacking is a rationale for professional trainers to employ African American cultural ideas to the training field. This article examines the root causes of the slow rate of change in the way professional trainers in traditionally White mainstream athletics have approached the pedagogical aspect of their work. Because many African Americans and Latinos are now entering fields that were once the preserve of the White male and female, it is important that we explore the nature of this particular asymmetrical relationship.\n      </p>", "The insect parasitic nematode, Steinernema scapterisci Nguyen and Smart, is a non-chemical alternative to pest mole cricket control in the southern United States. These ambush nematodes can become established after one application and spread into untreated areas through host movement in the soil. However, the nematode's persistence from previous inoculative applications in 1988 and 1989 and the effectiveness of subsequent augmentative applications on intensively managed golf courses were unknown. In 2001, two linear pitfall traps were placed in the roughs of 10 holes on each of two golf courses (20 traps per course) near areas of adult mole cricket activity, and half of the plots with traps were treated with S. scapterisci. Ten to 15% of mole crickets trapped before the augmentative nematode applications were infected by S. scapterisci. After this application, the percentage of infected mole crickets was higher than the baseline for 8 mo at one golf course and 17 mo at the other. The percentage of mole crickets infected on treated plots equaled or exceeded pretreatment levels about 4-8 wk post-application. The percentage of infected mole crickets in untreated areas at both sites equaled the percent infection in treated areas after about 5 mo. Mole cricket trap catches and percent of infection declined in the second year, but continued to fluctuate with mole cricket popula- tion density, age, and environmental conditions. Augmentative applications of S. scapterisci for pest mole cricket control can enhance mole cricket mortality on golf courses. /// El nematodo entomoparasitico, Steinernema scapterisci Nguyen and Smart, es una de las alternativas no qu\u00edmicas para el control de grillo topos en el sur de los Estados Unidos. Estos nematodos cazadores pueden establecerse despu\u00e9s de una aplicaci\u00f3n y moverse a \u00e1reas sin tratamiento con ayuda del hu\u00e9sped en el suelo. Sin embargo, la persistencia del nematodo debido a aplicaciones inoculativas entre 1988 y 1989, y la afectividad de aplicaciones aumentativas en campos de golf que han sido intensamente manejados, es desconocida. En 2001, dos trampas de ca\u00edda se colocaron en las \u00e1reas perif\u00e9ricas de 10 hoyos en cada uno de dos campos de golf (20 trampas en cada campo) cerca de los focos de grillo topos, la mitad de los lotes con trampas fueron tratados con S. scapterisci. Despues de las aplicaciones, el porcentaje de grillo topos infectados por el nematodo fue mayor que la linea base despues de 8 meses en un campo y 17 meses en el otro. El porcentaje de grillo topos infectados igualaron o sobrepasaron los niveles del pretratamiento entre 4 y 8 semanas despu\u00e9s de la aplicaci\u00f3n. El porcentaje de grillo topos infectados en \u00e1reas sin tratamiento igualaron el porcentaje de infecci\u00f3n de los lugares con tratamiento 5 meses despu\u00e9s del inicio del experimento. El n\u00famero de grillos capturados y el porcentaje de infecci\u00f3n se redujeron en el segundo a\u00f1o, pero continuaron fluctuando con la poblaci\u00f3n, edad y condiciones ambientales en las que se encontraban los grillo topos. Aplicaciones aumentativas de S. scapterisci para el control de grillo topos pueden incrementar los niveles de mortalidad en campos de golf.\n      </p>", "Field studies were conducted to evaluate foramsulfuron for postemergence control of goosegrass in bermudagrass turf as a possible replacement for MSMA. In field trials on a golf course and sports fields planted to bermudagrass, mature goosegrass was controlled effectively (&gt;85% goosegrass dead on the basis of canopy area) with two applications of foramsulfuron plus metribuzin. The herbicide rates that were effective varied among studies, e.g., foramsulfuron at 0.029 or 0.044 kg ai/ha mixed with metribuzin at 0.105 to 0.210 kg ai/ha. Goosegrass was often controlled with MSMA at 2.24 kg ai/ha plus metribuzin at 0.105 to 0.210 kg/ha, but foramsulfuron was always as effective, or more effective, than MSMA, in controlling mature goosegrass, at the same rate of metribuzin. Bermudagrass phytotoxicity of foramsulfuron plus metribuzin was temporary and not different from MSMA plus metribuzin. In one location there was noticeable phytotoxicity 4 wk after initial treatment.\n      </p>", "Previous studies on handicapping have suggested that in matches between two golfers, the better golfer has an advantage. This article considers medal play between two golfers when they are both playing well. The study uses the new slope system for handicapping. In this context we argue that it is actually the weaker golfer who has an advantage. The conclusions are based on both the analysis of actual golf scores and the analysis of theoretical models. We suggest an alternative scoring formula which leads to \"fairer\" competitions.\n      </p>", "Eight new palaeonemertean species, belonging to the families Tubulanidae, Carinomidae, Cephalothricidae and Hubrechtidae, from the Gulf of Arabia are described and illustrated: Carininajohnstoni sp.n., Carinesta dellechiajei sp. n., Callinera quatrefagesi sp.n., Callinera blanchardi sp.n., Carinoma renieri sp.n., Cephalotrichella gaimardi sp.n., Cephalothrix kefersteini sp.n. and Hubrechtella ehrenbergi sp.n.

Eastern Mud Turtles (Kinosternon subrubrum), which rely heavily on both aquatic and terrestrial habitats, may face challenges on golf courses, which typically have significantly modified and fragmented landscapes. We conducted a radio-telemetric study of 11 mud turtles inhabiting a golf course pond in the western Piedmont of North Carolina to investigate their terrestrial activity and habitat selection in a fragmented landscape. Most turtles moved to terrestrial habitats in late summer and emigrated a mean distance (\u00b1 SE) of 187.2 \u00b1 67.4 m and moved a mean straight line distance (\u00b1 SE) of 119.3 \u00b1 47.4 m from the pond. We determined habitat selection using logistic regression to compare turtle locations with random locations and found that mud turtles selected forested habitats with moderate canopy cover and no grass. Mud turtles also selected habitat containing herbaceous vegetation and woody debris as overwintering locations. Mud turtles did not select heavily disturbed habitats with limited canopy cover and pavement or cut grass associated with fairways, roughs, and residential lawns. Overall, our study suggests that maintaining relatively undisturbed forested habitat within fragmented urban landscapes, such as those found on golf courses, may allow for the persistence of these semi-aquatic turtles. Information from this study can be used to better understand critical upland habitat requirements of other semi-aquatic species inhabiting fragmented landscapes and aid in the implementation of habitat management plans.\n      </p>", "Golf underwent rapid growth in northeastern United States between 1888 and 1900 and then dispersed throughout the country by 1920. Regional variation in access to courses is still a function of income, population density, settlement patterns, ethnic and racial patterns, land costs, and availability of water. Changes in the economics of course development have led to modifications of design and new relationships between the game and real-estate ventures. Continued attraction of new players may be dependent on alternative forms for courses and equipment.\n      </p>", "Path rush can become problematic on golf course fairways, especially on roughs where continuous golf cart or maintenance equipment traffic occurs. Research trials conducted in 2003 and 2004 compared the efficacy of 2,4-D and mixtures containing 2,4-D in single or sequential applications to herbicides without 2,4-D for path rush control in bermudagrass roughs. Sequential applications of 1.1 kg ae/ha 2,4-D or 0.8 + 0.2 + 0.1 kg ae/ha 2,4-D + MCPP + dicamba provided 95% path rush control with no injury to bermudagrass, 15 wk after initial treatment (WAIT). Single applications of 1.1 + 0.3 + 0.1 kg/ha 2,4-D + MCPP + dicamba or 1.1 kg/ha 2,4-D provided at least 81% path rush control, 15 WAIT. Treatments without 2,4-D did not provide acceptable levels of control (34% or less, 15 WAIT). 2,4-D applied alone or in preformulated mixtures provided excellent path rush control compared to treatments without 2,4-D. Sequential applications of these treatments provided greater path rush control than single applications. However, only the sequential application of 0.8 + 0.2 + 0.1 kg/ha 2,4-D + MCPP + dicamba provided greater path rush control than the single application. Results from these studies suggest that 2,4-D is a key herbicide for path rush control.\n      </p>", "The coastal plain of the southeastern United States has experienced rapid and intense urbanization that has substantially changed the area's landscape. Much of this landscape change has been associated with the development of golf courses and associated communities, and cumulatively, these landscape units occupy thousands of hectares in the region. The opportunity for these golf courses to support native wildlife requires examination as these habitats are becoming more common and often represent some of the largest tracts of remaining open space within an area. Although declining throughout the southeastern US, Sciurus niger (Fox Squirrel) populations are still found on golf courses in this region. We investigated the relationship between Fox Squirrel presence and landscape characteristics on 98 golf courses in coastal South Carolina. Visual and telephone surveys indicated Fox Squirrels were present on 68 of the courses surveyed. The best predictor of Fox Squirrel presence on a course was the presence of a Fox Squirrel population on the nearest neighboring course. The probability of Fox Squirrels being present on a course if they were also present on the nearest neighboring course was 87.3%. Course age was the best predictor of Fox Squirrel presence on golf courses without a Fox Squirrel population on their nearest neighboring course. Our results suggest that regional Fox Squirrel populations may be stabilized by multi-patch population dynamics.\n      </p>", "Studies were conducted to determine the effectiveness of 11 multiple treatment combinations of bensulide in controlling a perennial and an annual subspecies of annual bluegrass. Bensulide controlled 97% of the annual subspecies with annual applications of 11 kg ai ha-1 (Jan.) + 6 kg ha-1 (Feb.) + 6 kg ha-1 (Mar.) totaling 92 kg ha-1 in 4 yr. The annual subspecies appeared to have a germination period from mid November to early January. None of the bensulide treatments controlled the perennial subspecies acceptably. The common occurrence of these two subspecies in mixed stands may account for the erratic weed control reported by many researchers. Bentgrass showed good tolerance to bensulide totals over 4 yr of 160 kg ha-1 applied in a U.S. Golf Association rootzone green.\n      </p>", "Few studies have investigated the emigration behavior of adult ambystomatid salamanders in fragmented landscapes. We assessed the emigration behavior of 30 Spotted Salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) by implanting transmitters in 2003. Study sites, all in southern Rhode Island, included an active golf course, a golf course under construction, and a closed-canopy forest that served as a control site. Maximum dispersal distances from breeding ponds ranged from 44-467 m (mean = 145, SE = 20 m), with the maximum distance twice as far as prior studies on this species. Spotted Salamanders exhibited distinct preferences for terrestrial habitats by avoiding fairways and selecting forested uplands and forested wetlands. The use of forested wetlands was unusual because most past research has suggested avoidance of this habitat by Spotted Salamanders. We documented adult Spotted Salamanders crossing fairways to adjacent forest patches; thus, fairways were not a dispersal barrier. Compared to random points, adult Spotted Salamanders selected cool microhabitats with greater leaf litter depth, more coarse woody debris, more canopy cover, less herbaceous cover, and high densities of vertical and horizontal small mammal burrows. These results suggest that maintaining extensive upland and wetland forested habitats near breeding ponds, with significant amounts of deep leaf litter, coarse woody debris, and high small mammal densities will help sustain Spotted Salamanders.\n      </p>", "This paper examines the structure of the three professional golf tours and the factors that are most important in determining the earnings of professional golfers. The results show that the greater level of competition on the men's tour, relative to the senior and women's tours indicate that a solid well-rounded game is necessary for success on the men's tour. In addition, the weaker level of competition on the women's and senior's tours, coupled with the shorter, less demanding golf courses played on these tours indicates that the seniors and the women can succeed by attaining sound iron games and becoming good putters.\n      </p>", "This paper develops an analytical (nonsimulation) model of the game of golf in order to investigate the 'fairness' of the present handicapping scheme, as well as to compare the results of medal play with those of match play.

We used MARK to calculate daily survival rates of Least Bell's Vireo nests and applied an information-theoretic approach to evaluate support for logistic regression models of the effect of habitat variables on predation risk. Analysis of data for 195 nests collected during 1999 and 2000 at the San Luis Rey River and Pilgrim Creek in southern California revealed no effect of fine-scale factors, including nest height, supporting plant species, and three measures of nest concealment, on the likelihood of predation. At the intermediate scale, distances to the riparian-habitat edge and to internal gaps in the canopy were unrelated to nest survival. Surrounding land-use type was a poor predictor of predation risk, with the exception of proximity to golf course\u2013park habitat and wetland. Nests within 400 m of golf course\u2013park were only 20% as likely to avoid predation as nests &gt;400 m from this habitat, and nests near wetland were more than twice as likely to survive as nests distant from wetland. Spatially, predation appeared to be random throughout the site, with localized clustering evident in the vicinity of golf course\u2013park and wetland. Our results suggest that the landscape may be the most appropriate scale at which to manage nest predation in this system.\n         Examinamos las variables que influencian la depredaci\u00f3n de nidos del tax\u00f3n en peligro de extinci\u00f3n Vireo bellii pusillus a tres escalas espaciales diferentes. Determinamos las caracter\u00edsticas del sitio de anidaci\u00f3n, del h\u00e1bitat o del paisaje que afectan la probabilidad de depredaci\u00f3n de los nidos, la distribuci\u00f3n espacial del riesgo de depredaci\u00f3n y las variables que lo influencian.

Los an\u00e1lisis de datos correspondientes a 195 nidos recolectados entre 1999 y 2000 en las inmediaciones del r\u00edo San Luis Rey y Pilgrim Creek, sur de California, no revelaron un efecto sobre la probabilidad de depredaci\u00f3n de los factores a la escala m\u00e1s fina, incluyendo la altura del nido, la especie de la planta que soporta al nido y tres mediciones del escondimiento de nido. A la escala intermedia, las distancias hacia el borde con las \u00e1reas ribere\u00f1as y hacia claros internos en el dosel no se relacionaron con la supervivencia de los nidos. El tipo de uso de suelo en el paisaje circundante no predijo el riesgo de depredaci\u00f3n con excepci\u00f3n de la proximidad a parques, campos de golf y humedales. Los nidos que se encontraban a una distancia menor de 400 m de parques o campos de golf, tuvieron una probabilidad de evitar la depredaci\u00f3n un 20% menor que la de los nidos que se encontraban a m\u00e1s de 400 m de este h\u00e1bitat.

To answer this question, I devised a four transect plan in which four weather stations measured temperature and dew point at three levels (0.70 m, 1.25 m and 2.5 m), along with wind speed at two levels (1.25 m and 2.5 m), as well as wind direction at 2.5 m. I positioned two stations above the golf course, considered natural stations, and two stations below the golf course, considered to be anthropogenically influenced stations. I then collected data over a six-night period starting at 1700 MST on January 3 and ending at 0945 MST on January 9. A golf course community appears to significantly modify katabatic flow. Using Analysis of Variance, coupled with Tukey's comparison test, at the 95 percentile confidence interval, the mean temperature and dew point at 0.70 m, 1.25 m and 2.5 m were significantly different from the top of the course when compared to the bottom. Wind speeds at 1.25 m and 2.5 m were appreciably dissimilar. Locations below the golf course had considerably lower temperatures and higher dew points, with relation to proximity to the course. The most notable finding was directly down slope of the course where katabatic flow was found to be near non-existent, even when a strong katabatic flow event occurred just upslope of the golf course. This near elimination of katabatic flow is likely to be the result of cool/moist and, subsequently, dense air residing over the golf course due to the grass surface. As the katabatic flow moving off the nearby Superstition Mountains reached this cooler and more moist/dense air, it slowed as the density differences between the two air masses were lowered.\n      </p>", "Seed germinability at high temperature (25 \u26acc) was found to differ among golf course populations of Poa annua L. located along a gradient of different intensities of turf irrigation and mowing practices. A seed germination index was calculated to express the effect of temperature on seed germination. The seed germination indices of the less managed populations from the golf roughs were uniformly low and less than 30%, with a mean index of 5%. Conversely, the germination indices of the golf green populations were high. Most seed families of the golf green populations had a germination index higher than 60%. A wide range of seed germination indices was found in seed families of the fairway populations, ranging from 10 to 90% with a mean index of 49%, and with a bimodal distribution. The results of this study indicate that rapid genetic differentiation in temperature-enforced seed dormancy among populations of Poa annua had taken place at the micro-ecological level.\n      </p>", "The influence of several covariates on golf course choice behavior are investigated using a discrete-time hazard model. This model is able to predict whether an individual will play a new golf course (probability) and, if so, when in terms of weeks after the course opens for play (timing).

Dallisgrass control declined with herbicide rates; therefore, only the highest rates (foramsulfuron, 0.15 kg ai/ha; MSMA, 2.5 kg ai/ha) are discussed. Foramsulfuron followed by (fb) foramsulfuron 1 wk after initial treatment (WAIT) provided 60% control of dallisgrass 1 mo after initial treatment (MAIT), but control declined to 40% 3 MAIT. MSMA (2.5 kg ai/ha) applied three times provided 89% dallisgrass control 1 MAIT, but control declined to 71% 3 MAIT. Among 22 MSMA and foramsulfuron sequential application programs, MSMA fb foramsulfuron 2 WAIT fb MSMA 3 WAIT provided the highest control (94%) of dallisgrass 1 MAIT, and control levels remained high (93%) 3 MAIT. This herbicide program provided 85% control 1 yr after initial treatment (YAIT), whereas no other treatment provided greater than 37% control 1 YAIT. Timing of foramsulfuron application following the initial MSMA application affected the control of dallisgrass. Waiting 2 WAIT, rather than 1 WAIT, before applying foramsulfuron increased control of dallisgrass by 20% 1 MAIT and 19% 3 MAIT. However, the increase in control 1 YAIT was only 5% regardless of herbicide rate. The addition of a second application of MSMA following the application of foramsulfuron 2 WAIT of MSMA further increased control by 10% 1 MAIT, 37% 3 MAIT, and 48% 1 YAIT. Results from this study suggest dallisgrass may be controlled with applications of MSMA fb foramsulfuron 2 WAIT fb MSMA 3 WAIT applied during early to midsummer. The use of MSMA was required to achieve dallisgrass control, however, the relatively high level of control achieved 1 YAIT with a program including sequential applications of MSMA and foramsulfuron may help reduce the total amount of arsenical herbicides used to control dallisgrass infestations over time.\n      </p>", "Postemergence grass weed control in turf-type bermudagrass is currently available only with repeated applications of organic arsenicals and/or with combinations of metribuzin which decrease turf quality.

Bermudagrass cultivars tolerated diclofop well. When injury was evident, a rate response was noted, with higher rates (3.4 and 4.5 kg ha-1) resulting in increased phytotoxicity. However, this level of phytotoxicity was acceptable and the turf soon recovered (3 to 14 d). The addition of crop oil concentrate (1.25% v/v) did not affect turf quality. Addition of MSMA resulted in slightly lower turf quality than diclofop alone. However, these responses were acceptable and usually the turf recovered by 14 d after treatment. Metribuzin applied alone or in combination with diclofop damaged turf to unacceptable levels and up to 21 d were required for turf recovery.\n      </p>", "           ", "1. Poa annua (annual meadow-grass or annual bluegrass) is the most problematic weed of temperate zone golf putting greens. In the UK there are no chemicals approved for its control, although several herbicides and plant growth regulators are available in the USA. Reducing P. annua levels in fine turf would greatly reduce the heavy reliance on pesticides and water that currently exists. 2. This paper reports on an observational and a manipulative study in golf putting greens, aimed at determining whether arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi have any potential for the reduction of this weed in fine turf. 3. All 18 greens on three golf courses were sampled, and in two courses a negative relation between AM fungi and P. annua abundance was found, upholding previous results. In greens where AM fungi were relatively common (as measured by root colonization), P. annua was rare, and vice versa. Furthermore, when the fungi were common, abundance of the desirable turfgrass Agrostis stolonifera was greater. 4. Two explanations are suggested for these relations, a competitive one, in which AM fungi alter the balance of competition between the two grasses, and an antagonistic one, in which the fungi may directly reduce the growth of P. annua. 5. In a manipulative experiment, where mycorrhizal inoculum was added to a golf green, the colonization level of A. stolonifera roots was enhanced, as was the abundance of this grass. Furthermore, there was a suggestion that adding inoculum could decrease the abundance of P. annua. 6. AM fungi have the potential to be a much more environmentally sound method of P. annua control in sports turf than the currently used chemicals.\n      </p>", "El recent atac de l'aviaci\u00f3 de guerra de l'Iraq contra la fragata \u00abStark\u00bb nordamericana, en aigu\u00ebs internacionals del Golf P\u00e8rsic, amb un balan\u00e7 de 37 mariners de l'US Navy morts, ha situat el conflicte entre l'Iran i l'Iraq a les portes de la seva internacionalitzaci\u00f3.
