{"total_words": 1246, "documents": ["The shopping trip to the grocery store is one of the most basic elements of consumer behavior. The authors seek to provide an understanding of the factors that account for variations in shopping behavior across households. They present a model of shopping behavior that assumes that households seek to minimize the travel cost associated with shopping and the cost of holding goods in inventory. As in the classic EOQ model, observed shopping behavior reflects the manner in which households balance these coats while meeting their consumption needs. A number of propositions derived from the model are tested using data on shopping trips made by households over a one-year period. The results support the model and indicate that the relationship between household characteristics and shopping behavior can be fairly complex: for some households shopping may have a recreational aspect while for others it may compete directly with wage-earning activity.\n      </p>", "From publicly available data, we identified two national culture dimensions, individualism-collectivism and uncertainty avoidance, and their interaction that influences Internet shopping rates across a wide spectrum of countries. Together, these factors accounted for 14% of the explained variance (on top of the combined variance of 63% explained by national income level, educational level, economic growth rate, unemployment rate, and crime rate) in predicting Internet shopping rates. For countries lower in uncertainty avoidance, individualist cultures show higher Internet shopping rates than do collectivist cultures. Implications for national- and Internet firm-level web design strategies are discussed.\n      </p>", "Electronic commerce is a worldwide phenomenon. Many Internet users browse the Web for information on products and services, but very few actually make purchases on-line. Until now, research on the factors that promote on-line shopping behavior has treated them independently and at the national level. The present study, in contrast, uses cross-country data from 26 nations and analyzes constructs with a structural equation model (SEM). The study finds that the factors of trust and economic conditions, but not educational level and technological savvy, make a significant positive contribution to on-line shopping behavior. In fact they explain more than 80 percent of the variability in on-line shopping behavior. Empirical guidelines are provided to help managers select one or more macro-level predictors to explain on-line shopping behavior. Future research opportunities are delineated.\n      </p>", "E-commerce success, especially in the business-to-consumer area, is determined in part by whether consumers trust sellers and products they cannot see or touch, and electronic systems with which they have no previous experience. This paper describes a theoretical model for investigating the four main antecedent influences on consumer trust in Internet shopping, a major form of business-to-consumer e-commerce: trustworthiness of the Internet merchant, trustworthiness of the Internet as a shopping medium, infrastructural (contextual) factors (e.g., security, third-party certification), and other factors (e.g., company size, demographic variables). The antecedent variables are moderated by the individual consumer's degree of trust propensity, which reflects personality traits, culture, and experience. Based on the research model, a comprehensive set of hypotheses is formulated and a methodology for testing them is outlined. Some of the hypotheses are tested empirically to demonstrate the applicability of the theoretical model. The findings indicate that merchant integrity is a major positive determinant of consumer trust in Internet shopping, and that its effect is moderated by the individual consumer's trust propensity.\n      </p>", "This research examines whether (1) consumers' shopping orientations are significantly related to their preference for shopping online, (2) consumers' demographic characteristics are significantly related to preference for shopping online, (3) relationships of shopping orientation and demographic variables with purchase preferences on the Internet will vary by the type of products (i.e., search, experience, or credence). Deriving from the product classification theory, products are classified into four categories: search products, two types of experience products, and credence products. Data were collected through self-administered surveys from adult population in two metropolitan areas in the Southern United States. The findings significantly support the study's hypotheses that shopping orientations such as convenience and recreational shopper and demographic variables such as gender, education, and household income were significantly related to consumer's online purchase preference. The researchers' findings also confirm that the relationships of shopping orientation and demographic variables with purchase preference for shopping online significantly differ by product category. More specifically, convenience and recreational orientations were positively related to preference for shopping online for experience-1, experience-2, and credence product types, though the directional relationship between recreational shopper orientation and preference for shopping on the Internet was positive rather than negative as hypothesized. The results and discussion section also includes implications drawn from the findings.\n      </p>", "The World Wide Web has rapidly become an alternative means to reach customers and has attracted the attention of many businesses. Unfortunately, however, despite its growth, there is little knowledge of which consumers would be willing to switch to the new format and to what extent. Our paper is aimed at providing some insights into these questions. Specifically, we propose a model to identify segments that differ in their shopping style, i.e., in their preference for which format, or bundle of formats, they like to shop in. Our research question, and model, is similar in spirit to prior research in marketing on how consumers choose assortments. Despite this similarity, our research makes some substantive and methodological contributions to the literature. Substantively, we examine the issue of the choice of channel assortments by consumers across a variety of product categories. We believe this is an important question and one that has not been examined earlier. From a methodological point of view, our model adds to earlier work by specifying the utility of an assortment as a sum of the deterministic and stochastic components of the utilities of its members. This contrasts with previous research where only the deterministic components of the utilities of the component brands of an assortment are added and the relationships between their random components are not accounted for. We calibrate the model on data regarding the format choices of households. In order to control for potentially similar format preferences across purchases of different categories we specify the model to allow for correlation between format preferences over the choice history of each household. Our results suggest that there are four segments of consumers that differ in their preference for different types of formats.\n      </p>", "We examine three sets of established behavioral hypotheses about consumers\u2019 in\u2010store behavior using field data on grocery store shopping paths and purchases. Our results provide field evidence for the following empirical regularities. First, as consumers spend more time in the store, they become more purposeful\u2014they are less likely to spend time on exploration and more likely to shop/buy. Second, consistent with \u201clicensing\u201d behavior, after purchasing virtue categories, consumers are more likely to shop at locations that carry vice categories. Third, the presence of other shoppers attracts consumers toward a store zone but reduces consumers\u2019 tendency to shop there.\n      </p>", "When a product's price fluctuates at a store, how should rational, cost-minimizing shoppers shop for it? Specifically, how frequently should they visit the store, and how much of the product should they buy when they get there? Would this rational shopping behavior differ across Every Day Low Price (EDLP) and Promotional Pricing (HILO) stores? If shoppers are rational, which retail price format is more profitable, EDLP or HILO? To answer these questions, we develop a normative model that shows how rational customers should shop when the price of the product is random. We derive a closed-form expression for the optimal purchasing policy and show that the optimal quantity to purchase under a given price scenario is linearly decreasing in the difference between the price under that scenario and the average price. This purchase flexibility due to price variability has a direct impact on shopping frequency. Indeed, the benefit of this purchase flexibility can be captured via an \"option value\" that implicitly reduces the fixed cost associated with each shopping trip. Consequently, rational shoppers should shop more often and buy fewer units per trip when they face higher price variability. Our results suggest that if two stores charge the same average price for a product, rational shoppers incur a lower level of expenditure at the store with a higher price variability. Since stores with different price variabilities coexist in practice, we expect stores with higher price variability to charge a higher average price. Thus, given two stores, a higher relative mean price for a given item should be indicative of higher price variability, and vice versa. These model implications are tested using multicategory scanner panel data from 513 households and pricing data for three stores (two EDLP stores and one HILO store) and 33 product categories over a two-year period. We find strong empirical support for the model implications.\n      </p>", "The Project is a long term conceptual art project that documents and categorizes stray shopping carts based on the situations in which they are found. The overarching goal was to look at the ways in which language and scientific systems of classification shape our perception of things. Thousands of stray carts have been catalogued and categorized into thirty-three types. The two man types are Class A: False Carts and Class B: True Carts. Photographs from the project are included in the article.\n      </p>", "Electronic shopping systems offer new horizons in vendor marketing, customer convenience, and overall market efficiencies. Information networks can gather thousands of vendors and millions of customers into an information-rich marketplace that serves both their perspectives. Unfortunately, existing electronic shopping systems provide a vendor/customer dialectic that offers low product differentiation and comparability. This limits market efficiency and results in negative experiences for both vendors and customers. We propose a functional architecture for a new generation of electronic shopping infrastructures to dramatically improve vendor representation and customer navigation. This design reshapes the vendor/customer dialectic by providing higher levels of both product differentiation and comparability. A prototype implementation of the architecture is described.\n      </p>", "This paper examines the routine convenience shopping behaviour of two groups of disadvantaged consumers: households containing unemployed adults and households containing retired adults. Some hypotheses relating their behaviour to stereotypes of 'subsistence consumers' are tested against findings from the Cardiff Consumer Panel survey of 1982. It is shown that the 'unemployed' and 'retired' groups did not generally possess attitudes to shopping consistent with this stereotype, and that the food and grocery shopping expenditure and store choice patterns of the 'unemployed' were in general similar to those of the control group, except that superstores were used less and distances travelled to major grocery shopping opportunities were shorter. The retired also travelled shorter distances, and were more likely to use independent or affiliated stores than were the other groups. The implications of these findings for further geographic research and retail planning are discussed briefly.\n      </p>", "Price-comparison engines allow customers to compare product offerings of online sellers and reveal almost complete information on the alternatives, and hence create erosion in store loyalty. Consequently, the competitive dynamics of online sales are affected in markets where price-comparison shopping is diffusing rapidly. We develop a dynamic competitive pricing model that deals with an asymmetric duopolistic market where the segment sizes are determined through a diffusion process. Our diffusion-of-innovations approach allows us to dynamically capture the proportion of informed and uninformed customers in a homogenous goods market. We use this model to analyze how strategic profit-maximization behavior evolves over time. This analysis shows that the increasing numbers of price-comparison shoppers pull prices down, and the rate at which prices decrease is shaped by the diffusion curve and brand preference. Our analysis shows that stores with loyal customers, or with a preference for their brands, can attain higher profits further into the diffusion process. The direct implication is that firms should use their information technology, operations, and marketing capabilities to create, enhance, and cultivate stronger preferences for, and loyalty to, their brand names to survive the inevitable informationrich markets of tomorrow.\n      </p>", "Cet article s'efforce de reconstruire l'histoire du chariot de supermarch\u00e9 et, \u00e0 travers elle, de comprendre comment dynamique des innovations et consommation de masse se soutiennent mutuellement.

The history of the shopping cart contains three identifiable periods. The first corresponds to the original cart (1936)- a \"basket carrier\" derived from folding chair, designed by the grocer Sylvan N. Goldman. The second period is that of the \"telescoping carts\" - a cart with a hinge and a swinging gate, as developed by the engineer Orla E. Watson in order to allow the lateral interlocking ofcarts when not in use (1946). The third period is that of today's cart, as it emerged from the paternity suit that opposed Goldman to Watson around the patent of telescoping shopping carts (1947-1949). The article shows that just like the object they deal with, these three periods are interlocked, and that this interlocked structure has contributed to stabilizing the shape of the device, finally turning it into the most robust, permanent and emblematic tool of mass consumption.\n      </p>", "Internet Shopping Agents (ISAs) allow consumers to constlessly search many online retailers and buy as the lowest price. One would expect these ISAs to subject sellers to intense price competition that results in uniform low prices. Yet, Internet retailers have joined these ISAs. Furthermore, the prices charged by inside retailers can vary substantially. We examine the impact of ISAs on market competition. An ISA due to mass of consumers that they can potentially win, while others stay our and extract surplus from their loyal consumers. The equilibrium inside pricing is such that the average price charnged can increase or decrease when more retailers join, depending on whether or not the reach of the ISA is independent of the number of joining retailers. When the reach is endogenous, there exists a unique number of inside retailers.\n      </p>", "This paper examines the relationships that exist between consumer shopping behavior and the population sizes of central places. The discussion begins by establishing the production characteristics for bundles in a Christaller-type system. Then a multipurpose shopping model of the neoclassical variety is developed. This allows specification of trips generated and quantities demanded at any location in the system. Consumer demand for bundles is next aggregated according to the system's geometry, and population size is identified by setting supply (production) equal to aggregate demand for each bundle. Two results are numerically indicated. First, multipurpose shopping behavior creates intralevel variability in central place sizes. Second, a shift from single-purpose behavior to multipurpose behavior generates population declines in small places and population increases in large places.\n      </p>", "This paper sets up a simple model in which two countries, differing in geographical extent, engage in commodity tax competition originating in opportunities for cross-border shopping. The non-cooperative tax equilibrium and various coordination initiatives are examined in the benchmark model and in two model extensions incorporating (i) costs of transportation for goods and (ii) border inspection. Among the more surprising results are the following: with (i), pure profits accrue to sellers near the border, but subjecting them to tax may lower the country's total tax revenue; with (ii), the volume of cross-border shopping may well increase.\n      </p>", "Objective. Nonattendance is a major health services research and management issue that has received little attention or systematic study in Asia. We examined the independent associations between waiting time, doctor shopping, and nonattendance in specialist outpatient clinics of 4 large public hospitals in Hong Kong. Research Design.

These effects were robust after multivariate adjustment and testing for effect modification. They also appeared to persist uniformly across hospitals and specialties. There was no demonstrable relationship between waiting time and doctor shopping. Conclusions. This is the largest study of nonattendance at outpatient clinics and the first such study carried out in Asia. Targeted strategies should be implemented and evaluated using these results to reduce waiting time, doctor shopping, and ultimately nonattendance.\n      </p>", "In recent years, the supermarket industry has become increasingly competitive. One outcome has been the proliferation of a variety of pricing formats, and considerable debate among academics and practitioners about how these formats affect consumers' store choice behavior. This paper advances the idea that consumer shopping behavior (as defined by average size of the shopping basket and the frequency of store visits) is an important determinant of the store choice decision when stores offer different price formats. A recent Wall Street Journal article that summarized the result of Bruno's management switching the chain from EDLP to HILO illustrates the important of this issue: \"The company's price-conscious customers, used to shopping for a fixed basket of goods, stayed away in droves.\" Thus, the audience for this paper includes practitioners and academics who wish to understand store choices or predict how a change in price format might affect store profitability and the mix of clientele that shop there. This paper attempts to understand the relationship between grocery shopping behavior, retail price format, and store choice by posing and answering the following questions. First, after controlling for other factors (e.g., distance to the store, prior experience in the store, advertised specials), do consumer expectations about prices for a basket of grocery products (\"expected basket attractiveness\") influence the store choice decision? This is a fairly straightforward test of the effect of price expectations on store choice. Second, are different pricing formats (EDLP or HILO) more or less attractive to different types of shoppers? To adequately answer the second question, we must link consumers' category purchase decisions, which collectively define the market basket, and the store choice decision. We study the research questions using two complementary approaches. First, we develop a stylized theory of consumer shopping behavior under price uncertainty. The principal features and results from the stylized model can be summarized as follows. Shoppers are defined (in a relative sense) as either large or small basket shoppers. Thus, we abstract from the vicissitudes of individual shopping trips and focus on meaningful differences across shoppers in terms of the expected basket size per trip. The shoppers make category purchase incidence decisions and can choose to shop in either an EDLP or a HILO store. Large basket shoppers are shoppers who have a relatively high probability of purchase for any given category, and as such they are more captive to prices across many different categories. The first two propositions summarize the price responsiveness of shoppers. In particular, the large basket shoppers are less responsive to price in their individual category purchase incidence decisions; this makes them more responsive to the expected basket price in their store choice decisions. This key structural implication of the model highlights an asymmetry between response at the category level and response at the store level. The result is quite intuitive; a (large basket) shopper with less ability to respond to prices in individual product categories will be more sensitive to the expected cost of the overall portfolio (the market basket) when choosing a store. The final proposition derives the price at which a given shopper will be indifferent between an EDLP and a HILO store. The key insight is that as a shopper increases his or her tendency to become a large basket shopper, the EDLP store can increase its (constant) price closer and closer to the average price in the HILO store. Conversely, as the shopper becomes more of small basket shopper, the EDLP store must lower its price closer to the deal price in the HILO store. Thus, we have the interesting result that small basket shoppers prefer HILO stores, even at higher average prices. The empirical testing mirrors the development of the consumer theory. We test the implications of the propositions using a market basket scanner panel database. The database includes two years of shopping data for 1,042 households in two separate market areas. We first use household-level grocery expenditures to model the probability that a household is a large or small basket shopper. Subsequently, we estimate purchase incidence and store choice models. We find that after controlling for important factors such as household distance to the store, previous experience in the store, and advertised specials, price expectations for the basket influence store choice. Furthermore, EDLP stores get a greater than expected share of business from large basket shoppers; HILO stores get a greater than expected share from small basket shoppers. Consistent with the implications of the propositions, large basket shoppers are relatively price inelastic in their category purchase incidence decisions and price elastic in their store choice decisions.\n      </p>", "We propose a two\u2010stage model to describe the increasing concreteness of consumers\u2019 goals during the shopping process, testing the model with a series of field experiments at a convenience store. Using a number of different process measures (experiment 1), we first established that consumers are less certain of their shopping goals and construe products in less concrete terms when they are in the first (vs. second) stage of the shopping process. The results of experiments 2 and 3 next demonstrate that goal\u2010evoking marketing promotions (e.g., conditional coupons) are more effective in influencing consumers\u2019 spending when consumers\u2019 goals are less concrete.\n      </p>", "A feature central to the success of e-commerce Web sites is the design of an effective interface to present product information. However, the suitability of the prevalent information formats in supporting various online shopping tasks is not known. Using the cognitive fit theory as the theoretical framework, we developed a research model to investigate the fit between information format and shopping task, and examine its influence on consumers' online shopping performance and perceptions of shopping experience. The competition for attention theory from the marketing literature and the scanpath theory from vision research were employed to support the analyses. An experiment was conducted to examine the effects of two types of information formats (list versus matrix) in the context of two types of shopping tasks (searching versus browsing). The results show that when there is a match between the information format and the shopping task, consumers can search the information space more efficiently and have better recall of product information. Specifically, the list format better supports browsing tasks, and the matrix format facilitates searching tasks. However, a match between the information format and the shopping task has no effect on cognitive effort or attitude toward using the Web site. Overall, this research supports the application of the cognitive fit theory to the study of Web interface design. It also demonstrates the value in integrating findings from cognitive science and vision research to understand the processes involved. As the information format has been shown to affect consumers' online shopping behavior, even when the information content is held constant, the practical implications for Web site designers include providing both types of information format on their Web sites and matching the appropriate information format to the individual consumer's task.\n      </p>", "Before purchasing, consumers may examine one brand or a number and shop one store or several. Their behavior can be described in a \"shopping matrix.\" Investigation of such patterns revealed differences, not only between consumers and product classes, but also between brands, within the same product class, suggesting the potential value of such analysis in formulating marketing strategy.\n      </p>", "Mean food spending by food stamp households peaks sharply in the first three days after benefits are received. For those who conduct major grocery shopping trips only once per month (42% of all food stamp households), mean food energy intake drops significantly by the fourth week of the month.

These patterns motivate an empirical model that simultaneously accounts for the shopping frequency and food intake decisions over time.

They comprise loose groupings of superstores and retail warehouses at highly accessible suburban and out-of-town locations. The relaxation of planning controls on retailing in a number of Enterprise Zones has encouraged such developments. The individual stores may function as largely separate entities or together as integrated shopping centres. However, considering the existing scale of such developments and the substantial commercial pressures for further schemes, evidence on this issue is lacking. The article outlines the general functional characteristics of retail parks before focussing on the shopping linkages between stores in the Swansea Enterprise Zone retail park. All the stores predominantly serve car-owning households drawn from a wide trade area. The retail park functions as a loosely structured collection of stores rather than as a strongly integrated shopping centre. The shopping linkages between stores demonstrate a low level of interrelationships and a functional dichotomy between the superstores and retail warehouses. Nevertheless, a number of significant functional linkages are identified reflecting comparison shopping, the spatial contiguity of some stores and 'spin-off' trips generated by a small number of key retail units. The commercial disadvantages of a peripheral site and the traffic congestion resulting from vehicular circulation within the retail park are apparent. The commercial and environmental advantages of an integrated spatial structure for future retail parks are stressed.\n      </p>", "Increasingly, retailers are combining Internet and store based operations to become \"multi-channel\" as they attempt to attract and retain customers. This study investigates how the type and level of perceived product risk (specifically economic and psychosocial risk) influence patronage preference for shopping from three types of e-tailers. The e-tailer formats studied are: pure play e-tailers (e.g., Overstock.com), value-oriented store based e-tailers (e.g., Wal-Mart.com), and prestigious store based e-tailers (e.g., Bloomingdales.com). The hypotheses, based upon prior research in the area of perceived product risk, show that type and level of risk do matter. Further, e-tailers linked with prestigious stores have an advantage over both other e-tailer types. Results also show an interaction between perceived product risk and the e-tail format. Based on samples from the Northeast and Southeast USA, the results are found to be similar in these diverse regions, improving the generalizability of the findings.\n      </p>", "Perhaps the most surprising thing about our knowledge of planned shopping centers is the gap of quantitative information available on the subject.

The online purchase data come from a large traditional grocery retailer that also operates an online store for its products. The offline data corresponds to the exact same brands and categories bought in traditional stores by a panel of homes operated by ACNielsen for purchases made in the same city and over the same time period. We compare the observed loyalty with a baseline model, a new segmented Dirichlet model, which has latent classes for brand choice and provides a very accurate model for purchase behavior. The results show that observed brand loyalty for high market share brands bought online is significantly greater than expected, with the reverse result for small share brands. In contrast, in the traditional shopping environment, the difference between observed and predicted brand loyalty is not related to brand share.\n      </p>", "This paper explores search behavior of online shoppers. Information economics literature suggests that search cost in electronic markets has essentially been reduced to zero as consumers are able to use powerful search tools, free of charge, to easily find and compare product and shopping information on the Internet. In the present research, however, we present a research model proposing that users need to spend time and effort when completing search tasks, resulting in significant search cost and a trade-off between search cost and search performance. Preliminary findings from an Internet experiment indicate that search task complexity, search engine capability, search strategy, and user experience are important factors determining search cost and performance.\n      </p>", "This study examines the importance of determinance value of attributes regarding shopping mode choice. It looks at shopping mode choice within the theoretical framework of Sheth's patronage predisposition theory. Four segments, defined on the basis of outshopping and in-home shopping behavior, were identified. Then discriminant analysis was used to identify shopping motives that differentiated among the groups. The results indicate shopping enjoyment/entertainment, price, convenience, and quality and selection of services are influential in shopping mode decisions.\n      </p>", "Consumers shop online for both goal-oriented and experiential reasons. However, goal-oriented motives are more common among online shoppers than are experiential motives. This article identifies and discusses attributes that facilitate goal-oriented online shopping, including accessibility/convenience, selection, information availability, and lack of unwanted sociality from retail sales help or shopping partners such as spouses. Importantly, consumers report that shopping online results in a substantially increased sense of freedom and control as compared to offline shopping. While consumers are more likely to describe offline rather than online shopping in experiential terms, evidence of experiential motivations for online shopping is emerging. Also, while closing transactions at web sites is one important e-commerce goal, companies should not lose site of the continuing importance and power of their web site as an information and communications vehicle.\n      </p>", "Consumers make multicategory decisions in a variety of contexts such as choice of multiple categories during a shopping trip or mail-order purchasing. The choice of one category may affect the selection of another category due to the complementary nature (e.g., cake mix and cake frosting) of the two categories. Alternatively, two categories may co-occur in a shopping basket not because they are complementary but because of similar purchase cycles (e.g., beer and diapers) or because of a host of other unobserved factors. While complementarity gives managers some control over consumers' buying behavior (e.g., a change in the price of cake mix could change the purchase probability of cake frosting), co-occurrence or co-incidence is less controllable. Other factors that may affect multi-category choice may be (unobserved) household preferences or (observed) household demographics. We also argue that not accounting for these three factors simultaneously could lead to erroneous inferences. We then develop a conceptual framework that incorporates complementarity, co-incidence and heterogeneity (both observed and unobserved) as the factors that could lead to multicategory choice. We then translate this framework into a model of multicategory choice. Our model is based on random utility theory and allows for simultaneous, interdependent choice of many items. This model, the multivariate probit model, is implemented in a Hierarchical Bayes framework. The hierarchy consists of three levels. The first level captures the choice of items for the shopping basket during a shopping trip. The second level captures differences across households and the third level specifies the priors for the unknown parameters. We generalize some recent advances in Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in order to estimate the model. Specifically, we use a substitution sampler which incorporates techniques such as the Metropolis Hit-and-Run algorithm and the Gibbs Sampler. The model is estimated on four categories (cake mix, cake frosting, fabric detergent and fabric softener) using multicategory panel data. The results disentangle the complementarity and co-incidence effects. The complementarity results show that pricing and promotional changes in one category affect purchase incidence in related product categories. In general, the cross-price and cross-promotion effects are smaller than the own-price and own-promotions effects. The cross-effects are also asymmetric across pairs of categories, i.e., related category pairs may be characterized as having a \"primary\" and a \"secondary\" category. Thus these results provide a more complete description of the effects of promotional changes by examining them both within and across categories. The co-incidence results show the extent of the relationship between categories that arises from uncontrollable and unobserved factors. These results are useful since they provide insights into a general structure of dependence relationships across categories. The heterogeneity results show that observed demographic factors such as family size influence the intrinsic category preference of households. Larger family sizes also tend to make households more price sensitive for both the primary and secondary categories. We find that price sensitivities across categories are not highly correlated at the household level. We also find some evidence that intrinsic preferences for cake mix and cake frosting are more closely related than preferences for fabric detergent and fabric softener. We compare our model with a series of null models using both estimation and holdout samples. We show that both complementarity and co-incidence play a significant role in predicting multicategory choice. We also show how many single-category models used in conjunction may not be good predictors of joint choice. Our results are likely to be of interest to retailers and manufacturers trying to optimize pricing and promotion strategies across many categories as well as in designing micromarketing strategies. We illustrate some of these benefits by carrying out an analysis which shows that the \"true\" impact of complementarity and co-incidence on profitability is significant in a retail setting. Our model can also be applied to other domains. The combination of item interdependence and individual household level estimates may be of particular interest to database marketers in building customized \"cross-selling\" strategies in the direct mail and financial service industries.\n      </p>", "Consumers purchasing products over the Internet generally have incomplete information about the retailer's credibility. This makes the retailer's brand very important for those who care about the noncontractible aspects of after-orders. Three choice strategies are possible at on-line shopping comparison sites, and logit models are used to capture their characteristics. The first strategy, expected value, chooses the retailer with the lowest expected cost (or highest utility) in terms of price, brand, and expected credibility. The second, brand seeking, chooses the best-known retailer. The third, price aversion, chooses the lowest-price retailer to minimize immediate costs. These three strategies, and the effect on them of four attributes (price, objective product information, perception of retailer credibility, correlation between brand and credibility) were tested in simulated shopping experiments played over nine periods for 241 graduate students. A set of two items was chosen: digital cameras and books. The experiment yielded 2,169 retailer choices for each item and 10,845 observations. It found (1) that price, objective product information, and perceptions of retailer credibility are the three important attributes when consumers select retailers on the search-result pages of an on-line shopping comparison site; (2) that consumers consider objective product information and perceptions of retailer credibility regardless of their brand-seeking or price-aversion strategy; and (3) that an increase in objective product information leads to a dramatic increase in expected-value choices and a corresponding decrease in brand-seeking and price-aversion choices.

The introduction to this paper deals with the general situation of shopping centre research in Germany as well as with some studies on urban centres in the Ruhr which did not include shopping centres as special elements of the central place system. Within chapter 3 the shopping centres are classified according to construction periods, their architectural concepts, size classes, and types of location (see fig. 2 and table 1). Chapter 4 deals with the functional equipment of retail and service establishments and their development; the shopping centres in the Ruhr have been grouped into six so-called types of equipment (see fig. 3). Within chapter 5 the results of comparing empirical research of the two most important centers are explained: the Ruhrpark Shopping Centre in Bochum (see fig. 4) and the Rhine Ruhr Centre in M\u00fclheim near the border of Essen (see fig. 5). With regard to their age and their architectural concept, both belong to different generations of shopping centres but they are very similar according to their location between two large cities, to their sizes and their regional spheres of influence. On the basis of land use mapping, consumer enquiries and traffic analysis, the structure of retailing and services as well as their use by consumers are compared in detail. Within the hierarchy of central places these two largest shopping centres in the Ruhr are only centres of medium rank which are characterized by deficiencies especially in services and partly in retailing. This paper represents the first results of a larger retail project on shopping centres and hypermarkets in the Ruhr.\n      </p>", "This article presents a perceived shopping utility framework for analyzing the impact of retail price format on store choice. This, in turn, determines three key performance metrics: number of shoppers; number of trips; and average spending per trip. When choosing a store, consumers evaluate both the fixed and variable utilities of shopping. The fixed utility does not vary from trip to trip whereas the variable utility depends on the size and composition of the shopping list. This article summarizes prior findings on store choice, analyzes how retailers can improve their performance, and interprets the practices of leading retailers. It presents a framework that can accommodate situations where retailers face multiple segments of buyers who have different sensitivities to fixed and variable utilities.\n      </p>", "Software agents, semi-intelligent autonomous tools, will play an increasing role in electronic commerce applications.

This research aims at exploring the effects of the crisis on consumer shopping behavior and on related retailers' strategies. A qualitative study has been conducted (interviews with consumers and retailers), which emphasizes a wise shopping behavior, coupled with mixed feelings towards promotional actions and retailers. The latter are perceived as bringing over temptations for consumers. To overpass the generated consumers' mistrust, retailers combine traditional defensive strategies (i.e promotional tactics) and more offensive ones, based on store assortment building and atmosphere management.\n      </p>", "Despite the explosive growth of electronic commerce and the rapidly increasing number of consumers who use interactive media (such as the World Wide Web) for prepurchase information search and online shopping, very little is known about how consumers make purchase decisions in such settings. A unique characteristic of online shopping environments is that they allow vendors to create retail interfaces with highly interactive features. One desirable form of interactivity from a consumer perspective is the implementation of sophisticated tools to assist shoppers in their purchase decisions by customizing the electronic shopping environment to their individual preferences. The availability of such tools, which we refer to as interactive decision aids for consumers, may lead to a transformation of the way in which shoppers search for product information and make purchase decisions. The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the nature of the effects that interactive decision aids may have on consumer decision making in online shopping environments. While making purchase decisions, consumers are often unable to evaluate all available alternatives in great depth and, thus, tend to use two-stage processes to reach their decisions. At the first stage, consumers typically screen a large set of available products and identify a subset of the most promising alternatives. Subsequently, they evaluate the latter in more depth, perform relative comparisons across products on important attributes, and make a purchase decision. Given the different tasks to be performed in such a two-stage process, interactive tools that provide support to consumers in the following respects are particularly valuable: (1) the initial screening of available products to determine which ones are worth considering further, and (2) the in-depth comparison of selected products before making the actual purchase decision. This paper examines the effects of two decision aids, each designed to assist consumers in performing one of the above tasks, on purchase decision making in an online store. The first interactive tool, a recommendation agent (RA), allows consumers to more efficiently screen the (potentially very large) set of alternatives available in an online shopping environment. Based on self-explicated information about a consumer's own utility function (attribute importance weights and minimum acceptable attribute levels), the RA generates a personalized list of recommended alternatives. The second decision aid, a comparison matrix (CM), is designed to help consumers make in-depth comparisons among selected alternatives. The CM allows consumers to organize attribute information about multiple products in an alternatives \u00d7 attributes matrix and to have alternatives sorted by any attribute. Based on theoretical and empirical work in marketing, judgment and decision making, psychology, and decision support systems, we develop a set of hypotheses pertaining to the effects of these two decision aids on various aspects of consumer decision making. In particular, we focus on how use of the RA and CM affects consumers' search for product information, the size and quality of their consideration sets, and the quality of their purchase decisions in an online shopping environment. A controlled experiment using a simulated online store was conducted to test the hypotheses. The results indicate that both interactive decision aids have a substantial impact on consumer decision making. As predicted, use of the RA reduces consumers' search effort for product information, decreases the size but increases the quality of their consideration sets, and improves the quality of their purchase decisions. Use of the CM also leads to a decrease in the size but an increase in the quality of consumers' consideration sets, and has a favorable effect on some indicators of decision quality. In sum, our findings suggest that interactive tools designed to assist consumers in the initial screening of available alternatives and to facilitate in-depth comparisons among selected alternatives in an online shopping environment may have strong favorable effects on both the quality and the efficiency of purchase decisions-shoppers can make much better decisions while expending substantially less effort. This suggests that interactive decision aids have the potential to drastically transform the way in which consumers search for product information and make purchase decisions.\n      </p>", "The authors explore the drivers of multichannel shopping and the impact of multichannel shopping on customer profitability. Through a longitudinal analysis, the authors provide evidence that multichannel shopping is associated with higher customer profitability. Using the social exchange theory, they develop hypotheses regarding the impact of several customer-firm interaction characteristics on customer channel adoption duration. They propose a shared-frailty hazard model for testing the proposed hypotheses. They use the customer database of an apparel manufacturer that sells through three distinct channels for the empirical analysis and find that frequency-related interaction characteristics have the greatest influence on second-channel adoption duration. In contrast, proportion of returns, a purchase-related interaction characteristic, has the greatest influence on third-channel adoption duration. Variation across customers in purchase-related attributes has a greater impact on the duration to adopt the second channel than the duration to adopt the third channel. In contrast, variation across customers in the channel-related attributes has a greater impact on the third-channel adoption duration than on the second-channel adoption duration. The customer-firm interaction characteristics identified in this study and the proposed model framework allow for forward-looking allocation of multichannel marketing resources.\n      </p>", "Many consumers are sceptical or suspicious about the functional mechanisms of electronic commerce, its intransparent processes and effects, and the quality of many products that are offered online. This paper analyses the role of consumer trust as a foundation for the diffusion and acceptance of electronic commerce. Starting from a functional perspective trust is seen as distinct but potentially coexisting mechanism for reducing the uncertainty and complexity of transactions and relationships in electronic markets. The analysis focuses on conditions of e-commerce transactions that are relevant for the formation of trust problems. Drawing on the theory of information two types of uncertainty are described: system-dependent and transaction-specific uncertainty. Finally different activities and instruments are described and categorized that Internet firms can use to establish and maintain trust.\n      </p>", "This paper reviews the recent trends in the geography of retailing, in particular the large-scale redevelopment of shopping facilities over huge tracts of our city centres by property companies and local authorities, often in association. The building of these new shopping centres has involved innovation in architectural design and urban planning, property development, shop leasing and urban management techniques. These innovations are adequately discussed in the literature of their respective disciplines, but as yet the geographical literature has largely failed to recognise that the traditional pattern of shopping provision is giving way to a newer, more \"planned\" format \u2014 with markedly different economic and spatial characteristics. This paper attempts to draw together some of the discussion relating to enclosed shopping developments that exist in other related disciplines, and to place that within a geographical framework. Firstly, the evolution of the \"enclosed shopping centre\" concept is outlined. Next, the paper looks at some of the aims and objectives of enclosed shopping centres. Finally, an assessment is made of the extent to which these have been achieved and there is some analysis of the geographical implications of these developments.\n      </p>", "Course shopping, a widely practiced postsecondary enrollment behavior, has rarely been studied.

It attempts to explain why there has been so little RSC development in Britain, compared with the situation in north America, or with expectations in the late 1980s. After a summary of the north American background, the progress in RSC construction in Britain during the 1970s and 1980s is reviewed. The high level of local opposition to RSC development, and the changing views of government departments during this period, are summarised. The planning and development history, and subsequent impact, of f our large RSCs built during the late 1980s are explained. Finally, the prospects for development of more RSCs in the 1990s are discussed. It is concluded that strengthening opposition from planning and institutional interests will severely restrict further growth in the number of RSCs in Britain.\n      </p>", "Economic theory suggests that price competition is in part driven by actively searching buyers.

New facilities ranging from superstores through retail warehouses and retail parks to regional shopping centres have been added to the retail scene. Inevitably, these have had negative impacts on some of the traditional shopping centres at all hierarchical levels. This article examines the plight of the less-advantageously located district shopping centres by focusing on a particular case study in South Wales. The circumstances associated with the development of a 'spiral of retail decline' in such centres are examined, and the potential for commercial revitalisation is evaluated. Public intervention appears essential to initiate a process of regeneration. Without such action, the future of many small shopping centres is likely to be weak and bleak, and the local shopping opportunities available to the less mobile elements of the community will continue to decline.\n      </p>", "The purposes of the study are (1) to compare the shopping orientations among Chinese, Filipino and Japanese shoppers; and (2) their willingness to purchase a specific product classification (either hand tools or kitchen utensils) from nine different purchasing sources. Data (N=684) were collected via a questionnaire from a convenience sample of 1,000 respondents. The results of the study indicate that Asian shoppers do not differ much in terms of their shopping orientations except for a few situations. Asian shoppers were also found not to differ much in their willingness to purchase from different purchasing sources. Implications for marketing and practice are discussed.\n      </p>", "Shopping engines of different designs were researched in respect to convenience as a mode of access to goods and services offered on the Web. Some shopping engines function autonomously in one stage, quickly maximizing decision accuracy as a function of several parameters. Others strongly involve the user, searching in multiple stages to satisfy decision accuracy requirements. Single-stage and multiple-stage shopping engines designed with two approaches, QuickSearch and AdaptiveSearch, were tested on 205 users trying to attain maximal accuracy with minimal effort. The best-performing shopping engine used two stages, QuickSearch first, then AdaptiveSearch. The results imply that QuickSearch and AdaptiveSearch, although logically equivalent, have different impacts on shopping for differentiated, multi-attribute goods and services. This suggests that shopping engines should be designed to first save the shopper effort and then provide attribute-focused support for examining the resulting set of items.\n      </p>", "Much fascination and speculation surrounds the impact of the World Wide Web on consumer shopping behavior. At the same time, there is little empirical evidence underlying all this speculation. This article provides one such data set. It reports on factors that consumers found salient as they browsed through selected electronic malls on the World Wide Web. We gathered consumers' reactions via an open-ended survey using a sample of 220 shoppers. We related the reactions to the factors of product perceptions, shopping experience, customer service, and perceived consumer risk, which we had identified from the existing literature on retail patronage behavior. This study translated these factors to the World Wide Web context and explored their relative salience. With respect to product perceptions, consumers were impressed by the breadth of stores on the World Wide Web but disappointed with the depth of a merchant's offerings. The shopping experience was reported to be generally enjoyable, but at the same time frustrating. Consumers also reported that they could perceive the potential for time savings and reduced effort compared with traditional forms of shopping, but that, at present, goal-directed shopping was difficult. Nearly everyone in the sample had something negative to say about customer service on the World Wide Web, judging that the sites were not designed to be responsive to their needs and that the presentation of goods and services seemed intangible. Risk was cited as a barrier to shopping on the World Wide Web, but was not as salient to our sample as product perceptions, shopping experience, and customer service. Overall, the results suggest that World Wide Web merchants need to think more about how they perform on the factors known to affect consumer behavior; namely, product perceptions, shopping experience, and customer service. We offer advice for enhancing the design of World Wide Web retail sites.\n      </p>", "The authors develop and test a new model of store choice behavior whose basic premise is that each shopper is more likely to visit the store with the lowest total shopping cost. The total shopping cost is composed of fixed and variable costs. The fixed cost is independent of, whereas the variable cost depends on, the shopping list (i.e., the products and their respective quantities to be purchased). Besides travel distance, the fixed cost includes a shopper's inherent preference for the store and historic store loyalty. The variable cost is a weighted sum of the quantities of items on the shopping list multiplied by their expected prices at the store. The article has three objectives: (1) to model and estimate the relative importance of fixed and variable shopping costs, (2) to investigate customer segmentation in response to shopping costs, and (3) to introduce a new measure (the basket size threshold) that defines competition between stores from a shopping cost perspective. The model controls for two important phenomena: Consumer shopping lists might differ from the collection of goods ultimately bought, and shoppers might develop category-specific store loyalty.\n      </p>", "One of the most dramatic events in the post-World War II period, of profound urban as well as architectural significance, was the rise of the big regional shopping center. The regional, differing from prewar community shopping centers in both size and function, was a hotly debated topic among architects and city planners in the late 1940s. Several of these new, experimental, gargantuan centers, 50 to 150 acres in size with stores and services numbering 100 or more, were in the planning stage across the country at the time. The urban-dimensioned problems that architects and planners faced, however, were formidable. Few were professionally equipped to handle them. The postwar period was marked by a boom in the retail industry: population was increasing, private incomes were rising, and the demand for consumer goods, long capped by the Depression and then by the war, soared. Meanwhile, as use of the private car became commonplace and high-speed freeway systems expanded, vast numbers of people moved to the suburbs. The situation was ripe for the emergence of the large-scale suburban retail center. These highly competitive, multimillion-dollar projects were, however, wholly financed by private investment, and the financial risks were enormous. It was a highly experimental period, with architects and developers following each other closely. The Northgate Shopping Center, located just outside Seattle and finished in 1950, was the first of the regional type to open. Designed by architect John Graham, its progress was monitored carefully by other shopping center planners and developers across the country, in particular, by William Wurster, Welton Becket, and Victor Gruen. Architecturally undistinguished, hence slighted by the architectural community, Northgate was financially highly successful. Graham's concept of a narrow pedestrian mall lined with a dense array of stores and services surrounded by easily accessible parking, attesting his thorough understanding of merchandising as well as architectural and planning problems, proved, in the last analysis, paradigmatic.\n      </p>", "During the 1930s the neighborhood shopping center emerged as an important phenomenon in the development of retail facilities in the United States. Prior to that decade, the type was limited to a modest number of examples built as components of planned residential subdivisions for the well-to-do. By the eve of World War II, the neighborhood shopping center was seen as an advantageous means of meeting the routine needs of people in outlying urban areas generally. During the 1930s, the neighborhood center also became one of the first common building forms to experience a basic reconfiguration to accommodate patterns of widespread automobile usage. Washington, D. C., was the initial and by far the most intensive proving ground for this work at its formative stage. The results were influential nationwide in the shopping center's transformation from a novelty to a ubiquitous feature of the American landscape.\n      </p>", "An empirical regularity in the price-promotion behavior of retailers of homogenous goods is explained theoretically. Based on this, a model is proposed for price competition in a market for a homogenous good with many asymmetrically positioned retailers. Asymmetry in this context refers to firms having potentially dissimilar loyal and switcher customer numbers that shape their pricing behavior in on-line markets. Incomplete information on the size of these segments results in distinguishable clusters of indistinguishable firms. To analyze these markets, a static game of price competition is developed and solved in an asymmetric oligopoly with numerous clusters of firms. The firms with the smallest ratio of switcher segment size to loyal segment size engage in fierce price competition, whereas the members of all other groups price their goods at reservation price points with no price promotions. This observation is a unique contribution and challenges the perception that all firms in markets for homogenous goods adopt mixed pricing strategies.\n      </p>", "Because of the increasing time pressure they face, many consumers are becoming more concerned about the efficiency of their shopping patterns. Retailers have recognized this trend and have improved shopping convenience by offering greater variety in product categories and making it easier for consumers to combine visits to multiple stores. However, little is known about how consumers improve the efficiency of their shopping trips or how changes in retail supply affect the way in which consumers combine multiple purposes and destinations. Building on previous work in consumer shopping trip modeling and conjoint design theory, the authors introduce a choice-based conjoint approach to studying and modeling this phenomenon. The authors illustrate the approach in a case study that investigates the tendency of Dutch shoppers to combine grocery, drugstore, and clothing purchases across multiple shopping destinations. The authors observe that the tendency of consumers to combine purchases differs from category to category and depends on category availability. In general, consumers combine considerably fewer purchases than could be expected if their shopping trip planning was based purely on travel cost minimization.\n      </p>", "This study examines the predictive association between ten demographic and sociographic variables and thirty-four shopping behaviour variables in Georgetown, Guyana. Using cross-tabulation analysis, a joint frequency of cases according to two or more variables was performed on the data and the resulting joint frequency distributions were first analyzed by chi-square significance tests and those joint distributions found to be associated were then further examined for strength of predictive association by Guttman's Lambda and the Uncertainty Coefficient. The study, which allows for cross-national comparisons with similar studies in more developed countries, found that organizing expenditure for shopping in Guyana was affected particularly by family income level, number of children, family life cycle, and religion.\n      </p>", "This study attempts to gain much needed information on the food shopping behaviour of the Trinidadian consumer. Primary data for the study were collected through the use of a questionnaire. The questionnaire was mailed to respondents randomly selected from three geographical areas in Trinidad, each thought to be representative of a distinct income group. The findings from the study seem to indicate that regardless of income status, the Trinidadian consumer is a very careful shopper. It was found that most shoppers made a list prior to going to the grocery, and tend to buy most of the items on the list. There is little impulse buying but a high degree of coupon redemption. Much emphasis was also placed by shoppers on the information on labels as being an important criterion when deciding which brand(s) to purchase. Shoppers display limited brand loyalty, are highly price conscious and consider experiential sources of information as the most important in deciding on their purchases.

However, no methodology is available to assess empirically how the demand for multipurpose shopping depends on retail agglomeration or, in general, the characteristics of retail supply, such as the numbers and types of stores in a shopping center or the number of categories in a supermarket. The authors propose a nested-logit model that captures retail agglomeration effects on consumer choice of shopping trip purpose (what to buy) and destination (where to buy). The authors estimate parameters representing trip purpose-adjustment and between-store attraction effects on shopping trip data collected from a sample of 1704 households in The Netherlands. Both effects are significant for each of the three categories for which the model is estimated. This is consistent with the idea of agglomeration effects. The findings suggest that agglomeration helps attract not only multipurpose but also single-purpose trips. A comparison of multi- and single-purpose trip model predictions shows that single-purpose models underpredict the number of trips to larger shopping centers.\n      </p>", "Traditionally it has been held that consumer buying behavior can be classified by social class and stage in the family life cycle. Recently it has been suggested that these distinctions have been obscured by the leveling effects of social and economic changes. From data of an extensive empirical study of women's shopping behavior, the authors suggest that in many instances the earlier market segmentation concept may be outmoded.\n      </p>", "This paper reviews current methods used in classifying retail outlets and areas devoted to retailing, in the geographical and town planning literature. For retail outlets, classifications based upon types of goods sold, and types of shopping trip, are discussed. This is followed by an analysis of modern large store development which reflects property developers' and retailers' concerns. Areas devoted to retail uses are subdivided into unplanned 'retail areas' and planned 'shopping centres'. Traditional classifications based upon central place theory are reviewed for both of these types, and found wanting in the light of recent changes in retail development practice and consumer behaviour. Classifications based upon physical development characteristics and type of shopping trip are recommended. Finally, classifications of urban retail location are examined.\n      </p>", "Although the challenges facing rural retailers have been attributed to competition and decreasing population, this paper defines the problem from rural consumers' perspective. It argues that consumers select shopping location on its shopping value, determined by its attractiveness and accessibility. The results indicate that locations closest to the consumer's residence offer the highest shopping value for groceries and other low-order goods. They also show that increasing gasoline prices favor local retailers. Rural retailers may use these results to implement differentiating strategies that increase their attractiveness, accessibility, and consequently their competitiveness.\n      </p>", "Background: Prescription drug abuse is a major health concern nationwide, with West Virginia having one of the highest prescription drug death rates in the United States. Studies are lacking that compare living subjects with persons who died from drug overdose for evidence of doctor and pharmacy shopping for controlled substances. The study objectives were to compare deceased and living subjects in West Virginia for evidence of prior doctor and pharmacy shopping for controlled substances and to identify factors associated with drug-related death. Methods: A secondary data study was conducted using controlled substance, Schedule II\u2014IV, prescription data from the West Virginia Controlled Substance Monitoring Program and drug-related death data compiled by the Forensic Drug Database between July 2005 and December 2007. A case-control design compared deceased subjects 18 years and older whose death was drug related with living subjects for prior doctor and pharmacy shopping. Logistic regression identified factors related to the odds of drug-related death. Results: A significantly greater proportion of deceased subjects were doctor shoppers (25.21% vs. 3.58%) and pharmacy shoppers (17.48% vs. 1.30%) than living subjects. Approximately 20.23% of doctor shoppers were also pharmacy shoppers, and 55.60% of pharmacy shoppers were doctor shoppers. Younger age, greater number of prescriptions dispensed, exposure to opioids and benzodiazepines, and doctor and pharmacy shopping were factors with greater odds of drug-related death. Conclusions: Doctor and pharmacy shopping involving controlled substances were identified, and shopping behavior was associated with drug-related death. Prescription monitoring programs may be useful in identifying potential shoppers at the point of care.\n      </p>", "The potential competitive importance of retail parks highlights the need for information on their functional characteristics. Evidence from two contrasting retail parks in Swansea is used to assess the effects of variations in size, functional mix and spatial structure on inter-store shopping likages and the efficiency of the shopping area. The influence of comparison shopping, functional complementarity, spin-off trips and market segmentation are demonstrated, while spatial proximity and peripherality are also important in determining shopping linkages. The need to combine appropriate functional, spatial and transportational influences are considered necessary to maximise the competitive and environmental advantages of retail parks.\n      </p>", "Background: Fruit and vegetables are protective of a number of chronic diseases; however, their intakes have been shown to vary by socioeconomic position (SEP). Household and food shopping environmental factors are thought to contribute to these differences. To determine whether household and food shopping environmental factors are associated with fruit and vegetable (FV) intakes, and contribute to socioeconomic inequalities in FV consumption. Methods: Cross-sectional data were obtained by a postal questionnaire among 4333 adults (23-85 years) living in 168 neighbourhoods in the south-eastern Netherlands. Participants agreed/disagreed with a number of statements about the characteristics of their household and food shopping environments, including access, prices and quality. Education was used to characterise socioeconomic position (SEP). Main outcome measures were whether or not participants consumed fruit or vegetables on a daily basis. Multilevel logistic regression models examined between-area variance in FV consumption and associations between characteristics of the household and food shopping environments and FV consumption. Results: Only a few household and food shopping environmental factors were significantly associated with fruit and vegetable consumption, and their prevalence was low. Participants who perceived FV to be expensive were more likely to consume them. There were significant socioeconomic inequalities in fruit and vegetable consumption (ORs of not consuming fruit and vegetables were 4.26 and 5.47 among the lowest-educated groups for fruit and vegetables, respectively); however, these were not explained by any household or food shopping environmental factors. Conclusions: Improving access to FV in the household and food shopping environments will only make a small contribution to improving population consumption levels, and may only have a limited effect in reducing socioeconomic inequalities in their consumption.\n      </p>", "In July 2000 the 15.5 km long fixed link across the \u00d8resund was opened, connecting the Danish capital Copenhagen and the Swedish city of Malmo. With the decrease of the barrier an enlarged flow of shoppers was expected with Swedish customers availing themselves of the range of opportunities in the Copenhagen area and Danish customers making use of the much longer shop opening hours in Sweden. However, experience from other European border areas shows that customers tend to do their ordinary shopping in their home countries and that there must be significant differences in prices or ranges of goods to overcome the barrier of the border. Does the typical situation result from the rural nature of many border areas, and will matters be quite different in a metropolitan area? The purpose of the present paper is to describe the level and character of cross-border shopping by the residents of the \u00d8resund region before and after the opening of the fixed link. Responses from about 4,000 people form the basis of the conclusion that a little less than a year after the opening of the fixed link the number of shopping trips across the \u00d8resund had increased, but there was still no heavy flow of customers doing ordinary shopping in the neighbouring countries. In order to assess the level of cross-border shopping across the \u00d8resund the findings are compared to those from surveys across the Danish-German land border.\n      </p>", "The preceding article defines convenience, shopping, and specialty goods in light of Festinger's theory of cognitive dissonance. In contrast, this article reports shopping behavior research which puts the classification of consumer goods in yet another perspective. The authors specifically question whether customers want to search in several stores before making buying decisions for certain types of merchandise. The answer to this question may hold important implications for future trends in channel policies, store locations, and retailing techniques.\n      </p>", "Governments have recently become concerned about cross border shopping and smuggling because it can decrease tax revenue. The tobacco industry predicted that, with the removal of border controls in the European Union, price differences between neighbouring countries would lead to a diversion of tobacco trade, legally and illegally, to countries with cheaper cigarettes. According to them this diversion would be through increased cross border shopping for personal consumption or through increased smuggling of cheap cigarettes from countries with low tax to countries with high tax, where cigarettes are more expensive. These arguments have been used to urge governments not to increase tax on tobacco products. The evidence suggests, however, that cross border shopping is not yet a problem in Europe and that smuggling is not of cheap cigarettes to expensive countries. Instead, more expensive \"international\" brands are smuggled into northern Europe and sold illegally on the streets of the cheaper countries of southern Europe.\n      </p>", "Shopping momentum occurs when an initial purchase provides a psychological impulse that enhances the purchase of a second, unrelated product. The authors propose that the most promising theoretical mechanism for shopping momentum comes from Gollwitzer's (1990) theory of implementation and deliberation mind-sets. Under this theory, shopping momentum occurs because the initial purchase moves the consumer from a deliberative to an implemental mind-set, thus driving subsequent purchases. After demonstrating the main shopping momentum effect, the authors support the mind-set theory by (1) demonstrating how an initial purchase induces implemental orientation and (2) by illustrating that an implementation mind-set leads to greater purchase. The authors then explore the boundaries of this effect by demonstrating how shopping momentum can be interrupted. Finally, they discuss alternative theoretical accounts for the results and explore consequences for marketing managers.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Using a mail-out survey this study tests several hypotheses that differences exist between this family type and two parent families on grocery shopping attitudes and behaviors. Single mothers and married mothers hold similar attitudes toward grocery shopping. It is the behavior of the children and the interaction of the parent with the children that represents the major source of difference between the two family types. Family shopping is three times as common for single parent families, and children of single parents shop alone for the family at three times the rate of children raised in dual parent households.

It argues that impulse-buying tendencies, trait competitiveness, and hedonic need fulfillment are antecedents of strategic exit, and that hedonic need fulfillment moderates the effect of impulse-buying tendencies on strategic exit. Buyers who exit an auction early by using the BIN feature end up paying a higher than average price. Theoretical and practical implications for the design of electronic auctions and the process of selling goods are offered.\n      </p>", "The relation between audit opinions and auditor switching has received considerable attention in recent years. Chow and Rice (1982) report a positive association between a firm's propensity to switch auditors and the receipt of a qualified opinion in the year prior to the switch. 1 However, firms that switch auditors do not seem to receive \"improved\" opinions in the year following the switch (Chow and Rice 1982; Smith 1986). Despite this evidence, the Securities and Exchange Commission (e.g., Release No. 33-6594 [1985] and Financial Reporting Release No. 34 [1989]) and the popular financial press (e.g., Power 1984) continue to express concerns about opinion shopping. This study focuses on the auditor's opinion formulation process for switching and non-switching clients in the year prior to the switch. In particular, it examines the possibility that auditor switches are triggered not by the receipt of qualified opinions, but by auditors' use of conservative judgments for some clients. While conservatism refers to a number of accounting and auditing issues, the overall conservatism of the auditor is assumed to be reflected in a tendency to issue qualified opinions. An ordered probit model of the qualification decision is estimated with different threshold values for prospective switchers and non-switchers measuring different judgments applied to the two groups of clients. The results support the hypothesis that threshold values for switchers are significantly lower (more conservative) than those for non-switchers. Further analysis of switching patterns suggests that when qualified opinions are based on conservative standards, the switching rate is higher than when average standards are applied. The observed conservatism could be the auditor's reaction to negative private information gathered during the audit that makes continued association with the client uneconomical or undesirable. However, the evidence indicating that opinions do not improve after switches suggests that opinion shopping is generally futile. This condition may exist because private information is obtained during the audit process, and a client usually will not be able to shop for a less conservative auditor with a prior commitment of a favorable treatment. Recent concerns about opinion shopping and its effect on auditor independence may therefore not be justified.\n      </p>", "The findings of this research indicate that attitude toward recycling has a significant effect on waste recycling and recycling shopping behaviors. In addition, affect, past behavior, and subjective norm explain significant incremental variance in the two types of recycling behaviors. Moderator analyses show that for waste recycling behavior, affect plays a lesser role when the strength of attitude toward recycling is strong, and vice-versa. Finally, the authors find a significant correlation between waste recycling behavior and recycling shopping behavior. The authors discuss managerial and public policy issues based on these findings.\n      </p>", "Shopping is the most important contemporary social activity, and, for the most part, takes place in the shopping center. Developers and designers of the retail built environment exploit the power of place and an intuitive understanding of the structuration of space to facilitate consumption and thus the realization of retail profits. They strive to present an alternative rationale for the shopping center's existence, manipulate shoppers' behavior through the configuration of space, and consciously design a symbolic landscape that provokes associative moods and dispositions in the shopper. These strategies are examined to obtain an understanding of how the retail built environment works, and how we might work against it.\n      </p>", "The 1920s and 1930s were crucial decades in laying the groundwork for the shopping center as a major force in retail development during the second half of the twentieth century. The concept of the shopping center as a fully integrated business enterprise became significantly more sophisticated and ambitious. Sizable complexes were initiated that included at least several dozen businesses purveying not only routine goods and services, but a variety of more specialized ones as well. Thus cast, the shopping center became more than a place of convenience; it formed a destination-a focus of activity and a physical landmark in the fast-growing suburban landscape. Despite their pivotal role, these large community shopping centers remained few in number during the initial decades of their development. The projects that were undertaken were experimental, and hence tentative in nature. They were also highly individualistic in appearance and other physical characteristics, reflecting the vision and the taste of the developers who created them. Many were integral parts of comprehensively planned residential communities and were conceived as much to control and contain commerce as to foster it. In such ways, this first generation of large shopping centers offer conspicuous contrast with their post-World War II offspring. Their influence on later work was nonetheless crucial, for they demonstrated the advantages of meticulous planning and management in the fiercely competitive area.\n      </p>", "Consumer responses to stockouts, both in terms of consumer satisfaction with the decision process and in terms of subsequent store choice behavior, are explored. Four laboratory experiments involving stockouts in a consumer choice context are run. The results suggest that consumer response to stockouts is driven in large part by two factors: the effect of a stockout on the difficulty of making a choice from the set and the degree of personal commitment to the out\u2010of\u2010stock alternative. The results show that personal commitment to an out\u2010of\u2010stock choice option is a function of preference for the option, whether the option is included in the consumer\u2019s consideration set, and the degree to which the stockout announcement is personally directed. As personal commitment to the out\u2010of\u2010stock option increases, consumers react substantially and negatively to the stockout\u2014they report lower satisfaction with the decision process and show a higher likelihood of switching stores on subsequent shopping trips. However, under conditions in which personal commitment to the out\u2010of\u2010stock option is low and the stockout leads to a decrease in the difficulty of making a product selection, consumer response to the stockout can actually be positive.\n      </p>", "Investigations concerning the influence of non-integrated shopping-centers on urban traffic often yield results that are unique for each urban area, so that they should not be generalized. Planning procedures that in many cases lead to the installation of new shopping centers are often orientated only to the specific location and rarely consider broader implications. On the other hand, scientists who utilize spatial analyses are frequently critical of such procedures when they lead to the proposed development of peripheral malls. This investigation proves that only the combination of locational and spatial analyses provide reliable information for addressing the impact of shopping center development on traffic flow. We demonstrate that the induction of traffic to the Innsbruck shopping centers is significally less than it was previously assumed. In addition the diversion of consumers from the sensitive traffic areas of the downtown core is considerable. Two scenarios were calculated in order to compare the results with a hypothetical situation that assumes Innsbruck's two peripheral malls do not exist. The results of the two scenarios illustrate impressively that without the peripheral malls, traffic would overwhelm the capacity of the inner-urban traffic system. /// Untersuchungen zur Verkehrsbeeinflussung durch Einkaufszentren kommen meist zu diametral entgegengesetzten Ergebnissen.

Recently, studies have begun to show that aesthetic qualities such as color, graphics, and the layout of a Web site can play an important role in improving consumer shopping experiences. By integrating theories and research findings from diverse fields, we investigate the impacts of two dimensions of aesthetics, namely, classical aesthetics and expressive aesthetics, on online consumers' shopping value. More important, we propose that the effect of these two dimensions of aesthetics on consumer shopping value is contingent on the hedonic and utilitarian nature of products that consumers purchase online. A laboratory experiment was conducted to test the research model, and the results generally support our hypotheses. From a theoretical perspective, our findings not only establish consumer shopping value as a key business value of Web site aesthetics but also enrich the current knowledge on the contingent effect of Web site aesthetics for utilitarian and hedonic products. From a practical perspective, the findings provide guidance for online vendors to provide their customers with better service in the form of properly designed aesthetic Web sites.\n      </p>", "In contrast to a currently held assumption, cross-shopping is shown to produce incremental business for a retail firm.

It offers customers a shopping experience distinct from physical place-based retailing. However, little is known about the characteristics and payoffs from digital retailing or the degree to which it may substitute for physical stores and malls. This article investigates the characteristics of three commonly implemented digital retailing approaches\u2013catalog search, bundling, and virtual reality storefront\u2013and the suitability of each approach for electronic commerce. Publishers and vendors have claimed that the rich medium of virtual reality will lead to greater sales and profits in retailing, a view refuted by our research. Although qualitatively different from other approaches, virtual reality is not clearly superior in generating profits and sales revenues. The research finds no statistically significant difference in the money spent or the number of items purchased among the three approaches. The only significant difference is the time spent shopping, which tends to be longer for virtual reality storefronts. Virtual reality retailing requires a 50 percent increase in search time over a catalog search, and a 212 percent increase over time spent when retailers bundle products on screen. In contrast to claims of many software vendors and marketing consultants who have touted virtual reality storefronts and virtual reality technologies as vehicles for increasing sale revenues, the research finds that customers are not likely to spend more on merchandise just because it is presented via a virtual reality storefront interface.\n      </p>", "The kinds of shopping behavior exhibited by automobile purchasers have implications for both advertising and selling strategy.

The model incorporates two ways of shopping in a category. Shoppers who have planned their purchasing (made a decision before entering the store) do not process in-store information and show no response to point-of-purchase promotions. Consumers who have not planned their purchasing in a category (deciding at the point of purchase) may process in-store information and may be strongly influenced by promotions. The two modes of information processing are called decision states and are labelled planned and opportunistic, respectively. The two-state model is calibrated on IRI scanner purchase records for saltine crackers. The model yields a significantly better fit than a one-state nested logit model and provides new insights into the relationship between shopping behavior and consumer purchase response.\n      </p>", "Fabrizio Nevola considers the form, function, and significance of shops and the other commercial spaces contained in the ground floors of the Renaissance palaces of Siena, Florence, and Rome.

Contrary to much that has been written about the palaces of the fifteenth century, their designers did not abandon botteghe (shops), nor more broadly construed commercial functions. The resulting buildings are hybrid structures in which the proud individual fa\u00e7ades of private patrons' palaces were configured to serve the needs of trade.

I use a new scanner dataset to compare the behavior of households shopping online and in-store at the same chain, for identical items and prices. I find that brand exploration is more prevalent in-store. My model quantifies the role of features of e-commerce, like the existence of \"favorites lists\" and the difficulty in verifying item quality. Limited exploration online implies higher barriers to entry on the Internet channel. Counterfactual exercises suggest that online advertising could make the Internet channel more competitive.\n      </p>", "The concept of an electronic marketplace is introduced whereby consumers may browse through a structured database giving product offerings and local supply outlets. We consider the nature of software to facilitate the shopping process developing a concept of similarity between generic products using a semantic net structure. The search is guided by specified user preferences.

Based on a longitudinal study of a festival shopping mall, we provide an emergent theory of how the utopian marketplace is experienced, a theory that hinges around three interlinked conceptual categories: sensing displace, creating playspace, and performing artscape, which are subverted by the center management\u2019s maladroit refreshment of the retail offer. The relevance of this theorization for place\u2010based scholarship, together with its implications for researchers of consumer/marketer relations, is also discussed.\n      </p>"], "words":
