{"total_words": 593, "documents": ["Telemetry data obtained from grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) were used to evaluate resource selection within the Jewel Basin Hiking Area (JBHA) of western Montana. Logistic regression models were constructed using Geographic Information System maps of elevation zones, dominant cover types, and distance to hiking trails and lakes. Fourteen radiocollared grizzly bears used the JBHA between 1987-1994 primarily during summer. Using univariate statistics, we determined that grizzly bears were significantly farther than expected from trails and from lakes with campsites during spring, summer, and autumn. In multivariate models however, distance to trails and lakes were significant variables only during summer and autumn. During these 2 seasons the relative probability of grizzly bear use increased as distances to trails and lakes with campsites increased. For each season, grizzly bears selected relatively open habitats compared to the predominant forest habitat type in which most of the trail system occurred. We found no historical records of conflicts between grizzly bears and recreationists in the JBHA; bears did not appear to be conditioned to or habituated to food. No radiocollared bears lived solely within the JBHA; each individual's home range included multiple-use lands with roads and where many human activities occurred. We concluded that several factors together precluded human-bear conflicts in the JBHA. These included low visitor-use levels, trail placement, an educated public, and the bears' negative conditioning towards a host of human activities occurring within and outside the area. Therefore, while in the JBHA, grizzly bears minimized their interaction with recreationists by avoiding high-use areas.\n      </p>", "Mountain landscapes show rapid evolution, especially at high altitudes, in response to current climate changes. In addition, the greater number of routes and trails made available and the increase in tourism have caused some impacts on mountain areas. Gradual soil erosion has been observed along some hiking trails, with the latter tending to deepen, and with stronger erosion where the trail cuts the slope. Where trails cross forested areas, trees can suffer root damage from foot trampling as roots become exposed. A dendrogeomorphological study was conducted on trees along two hiking trails in upper Valtellina (Italian Alps). On the first trail, in Valle dei Forni, European larches and stone pines, mostly with exposed roots, were sampled. A mean erosion rate of 2.7 mm/a, related to deepening of the footpath, was obtained, and various degrees of root growth disturbance along the trail were observed. In particular, the growth of many sampled roots shows an increase in ring width corresponding with the moment when root exposure occurred, followed, after 3-5 years, by rapid growth suppression. The exposure of many roots has taken place since the 1980s. No significant variations in stem growth were observed, even when there were exposed and damaged roots. Along the second trail, in Valle Alpisella, exposed roots of mountain pines were analysed. A mean erosion rate of 3.2-3.7 mm/a, related to the escarpments bordering the footpath, was obtained, while no significant changes were detected in root growth.\n      </p>", "Off-road recreation on public lands in North America has increased dramatically in recent years. Wild ungulates are sensitive to human activities, but the effect of off-road recreation, both motorized and nonmotorized, is poorly understood. We measured responses of elk (Cervus elaphus) to recreational disturbance in northeast Oregon, USA, from April to October, 2003 and 2004. We subjected elk to 4 types of recreational disturbance: all-terrain vehicle (ATV) riding, mountain biking, hiking, and horseback riding. Motion sensors inside radiocollars worn by 13 female elk recorded resting, feeding, and travel activities at 5-minute intervals throughout disturbance and control periods. Elk fed and rested during control periods, with little time spent traveling. Travel time increased in response to all 4 disturbances and was highest in mornings. Elk travel time was highest during ATV exposure, followed by exposure to mountain biking, hiking, and horseback riding. Feeding time decreased during ATV exposure and resting decreased when we subjected elk to mountain biking and hiking disturbance in 2003. Our results demonstrated that activities of elk can be substantially affected by off-road recreation. Mitigating these effects may be appropriate where elk are a management priority. Balancing management of species like elk with off-road recreation will become increasingly important as off-road recreational uses continue to increase on public lands in North America.\n      </p>", "Surveys of visitors to National Forests in Colorado were conducted to determine whether different fire ages and presence of crown fires have different effects on hiking and mountain biking recreation visits and benefits. Actual and intended behavior data were combined using a count-data travel cost model. The intended behavior trip questions asked about changes in number of trips due to the presence of a highintensity crown fire, prescribed fire, and a 20-year-old high-intensity fire at the area respondents were visiting. Using the estimated recreation demand function, years since a non-crown fire had a statistically significant positive effect on the trip demand of hikers. In contrast, presence of crown fires had no statistically significant effect on the quantity of hiker trips, but had a significant and negative effect on mountain biking trips. Crown fires also had a large effect on the value per trip, with crown fires increasing the value per hiking trip but lowering the value per mountain biking trip.\n      </p>", "Over the past five or six decades, contamination and pollution of the world's enclosed seas, coastal waters and the wider open oceans by plastics and other synthetic, non-biodegradable materials (generally known as 'marine debris') has been an ever-increasing phenomenon. The sources of these polluting materials are both land-and marine-based, their origins may be local or distant, and the environmental consequences are many and varied. The more widely recognized problems are typically associated with entanglement, ingestion, suffocation and general debilitation, and are often related to stranding events and public perception. Among the less frequently recognized and recorded problems are global hazards to shipping, fisheries and other maritime activities. Today, there are rapidly developing research interests in the biota attracted to freely floating (i.e. pelagic) marine debris, commonly known as 'hangers-on and hitch-hikers' as well as material sinking to the sea floor despite being buoyant. Dispersal of aggressive alien and invasive species by these mechanisms leads one to reflect on the possibilities that ensuing invasions could endanger sensitive, or at-risk coastal environments (both marine and terrestrial) far from their native habitats.\n      </p>", "Outdoor recreation has the potential to disturb wildlife, resulting in energetic costs, impacts to animals' behavior and fitness, and avoidance of otherwise suitable habitat. Mountain biking is emerging as a popular form of outdoor recreation, yet virtually nothing is known about whether wildlife responds differently to mountain biking vs. more traditional forms of recreation, such as hiking. In addition, there is a lack of information on the \"area of influence\" (within which wildlife may be displaced from otherwise suitable habitat due to human activities) of different forms of recreation. We examined the responses of bison (Bison bison), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana) to hikers and mountain bikers at Antelope Island State Park, Utah, by comparing alert distance, flight distance, and distance moved. Within a species, wildlife did not respond differently to mountain biking vs. hiking, but there was a negative relationship between wildlife body size and response. We determined the area of influence along trails and off-trail transects by examining each species' probability of flushing as perpendicular distance away from a trail increased. All three species exhibited a 70% probability of flushing from on-trail recreationists within 100 m from trails. Mule deer showed a 96% probability of flushing within 100 m of recreationists located off trails; their probability of flushing did not drop to 70% until perpendicular distance reached 390 m. We calculated the area around existing trails on Antelope Island that may be impacted by recreationists on those trails. Based on a 200-m \"area of influence,\" 8.0 km (7%) of the island was potentially unsuitable for wildlife due to disturbance from recreation. Few studies have examined how recreationists perceive their effects on wildlife, although this has implications for their behavior on public lands. We surveyed 640 backcountry trail users on Antelope Island to investigate their perceptions of the effects of recreation on wildlife. Approximately 50% of recreationists felt that recreation was not having a negative effect on wildlife. In general, survey respondents perceived that it was acceptable to approach wildlife more closely than our empirical data indicated wildlife would allow. Recreationists also tended to blame other user groups for stress to wildlife rather than holding themselves responsible. The results of both the biological and human-dimensions aspects of our research have implications for the management of public lands where the continued coexistence of wildlife and recreation is a primary goal. Understanding wildlife responses to recreation and the \"area of influence\" of human activities may help managers judge whether wildlife populations are experiencing stress due to interactions with humans, and may aid in tailoring recreation plans to minimize long-term effects to wildlife from disturbance. Knowledge of recreationists' perceptions and beliefs regarding their effects on wildlife may also assist public lands managers in encouraging positive visitor behaviors around wildlife.\n      </p>", "On the Colorado Plateau, some environments occupied by Mexican Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis lucida) receive a great deal of recreational use. To assess the effects of hikers on breeding owls, we quantified changes in the activity budgets of owls at nests in response to a controlled amount of hiking in canyons of southern Utah in 1997 and 1998. We examined differences in the duration and frequency of eight behaviors as well as in the type and frequency of owl vocalizations between hiking and control treatments. In general, activity budgets of owls did not change markedly when hikers were near nests, although during hiking treatments, females decreased the amount of time they handled prey by 57% and decreased the amount of time they performed daytime maintenance behaviors by 30%. Further, hikers caused both females and males to increase the frequency of contact vocalizations by 58% and 534%, respectively. The order in which we applied treatments at nests (control-hiking or hiking-control) also influenced owl responses to hiking treatments, suggesting that observers near nests may have affected owl behavior. We concluded that the cumulative effects of high levels of short-duration recreational hiking near nests may be detrimental to Mexican Spotted Owls. Given current levels of visitation rates to most remote canyons occupied by owls, however, owl populations on the Colorado Plateau are not likely threatened by hiking. Notable exceptions are those canyons that receive use by \u226550 hikers per day. We recommend monitoring of owl occupancy, nest success, and hiking intensity in these high-use canyons.\n      </p>", "Many insects possess a sexual communication system that is vulnerable to chemical espionage by parasitic wasps. We recently discovered that a hitch-hiking (H) egg parasitoid exploits the antiaphrodisiac pheromone benzyl cyanide (BC) of the Large Cabbage White butterfly Pieris brassicae. This pheromone is passed from male butterflies to females during mating to render them less attractive to conspecific males. When the tiny parasitic wasp Trichogramma brassicae detects the antiaphrodisiac, it rides on a mated female butterfly to a host plant and then parasitizes her freshly laid eggs. The present study demonstrates that a closely related generalist wasp, Trichogramma evanescens. exploits BC in a similar way, but only after learning. Interestingly, the wasp learns to associate an H response to the odors of a mated female P. brassicae butterfly with reinforcement by parasitizing freshly laid butterfly eggs. Behavioral assays, before which we specifically inhibited long-term memory (LTM) formation with a translation inhibitor, reveal that the wasp has formed protein synthesisdependent LTM at 24 h after learning. To our knowledge, the combination of associatively learning to exploit the sexual communication system of a host and the formation of protein synthesis-dependent LTM after a single learning event has not been documented before. We expect it to be widespread in nature, because it is highly adaptive in many species of egg parasitoids. Our finding of the exploitation of an antiaphrodisiac by multiple species of parasitic wasps suggests its use by Pieris butterflies to be under strong selective pressure.\n      </p>", "Aim The biogeographical patterns and drivers of diversity on oceanic islands in the tropical South Pacific (TSP) are synthesized. We use published studies to determine present patterns of diversity on TSP islands, the likely sources of the biota on these islands and how the islands were colonized. We also investigate the effect of extinctions. Location We focus on oceanic islands in the TSP. Methods We review available literature and published molecular studies. Results Examples of typical island features (e.g. gigantism, flightlessness, gender dimorphism) are common, as are adaptive radiations. Diversity decreases with increasing isolation from mainland sources and with decreasing size and age of archipelagos, corresponding well with island biogeographical expectations. Molecular studies support New Guinea/Malesia, New Caledonia and Australia as major source areas for the Pacific biota. Numerous studies support dispersalbased scenarios, either over several 100 km (long-distance dispersal) or over shorter distances by island-hopping (stepping stones) and transport by human means (hitch-hiking). Only one vicariance explanation, the eastward drift of continental fragments (shuttles) that may have contributed biota to Fiji from New Caledonia, is supported by some geological evidence, although there is no evidence for the transport of taxa on shuttle fragments. Another vicariance explanation, the existence of a major continental landmass in the Pacific within the last 100 Myr (Atlantis theory), receives little support and appears unlikely. Extinction of lineages in source areas and persistence in the TSP has probably occurred many times and has resulted in misinterpretation of biogeographical data. Main conclusions Malesia has long been considered the major source region for the biota of oceanic islands in the TSP because of shared taxa and high species diversity. However, recent molecular studies have produced compelling support for New Caledonia and Australia as alternative important source areas. They also show dispersal events, and not vicariance, to have been the major contributors to the current biota of the TSP. Past extinction events can obscure interpretations of diversity patterns.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Recreational pressure on land above the treeline in the Swedish mountains has increased rapidly in recent years. Increased popularity of hiking in particular has in some areas resulted in trail erosion and landscape degradation. A study of recreational impact on hiking trails near Gr\u00f6velsj\u00f6n has shown that where use intensity is uniform incidence of damage depends largely on soil properties and profile characteristics. Properties of particular significance are: abundance of rocks, homogeneity of texture, iron-pan morphology, aggregate stability and organic content. Organic soils are shown to be highly vulnerable to damage, especially during the peak tourist season when moisture contents are high. Severity of trail damage is discussed in relation to land-use planning objectives and recommendations are made for abandonment of the policy of trailmarking on lands above the treeline.\n      </p>", "In fire-prone ecosystems, many plants possess traits that enhance their relative flammability and ecologists have suggested increased flammability could result from natural selection. To date, theoretical models addressing the evolution of flammable characteristics assume that flammable plants realize some direct fitness advantage. In this paper, we explore the idea that enhanced flammability can increase in frequency in a population without any direct fitness benefit to the flammable type. In our model, flammability evolves due to an association between an allele that promotes flammability and alleles at unlinked loci that give high fitness. In analogy to genetic hitchhiking, in which a deleterious allele can invade due to a genetic linkage, we call this process \"genetic niche-hiking,\" because the association results from localized niche construction. Specifically, flammable plants sacrifice themselves and their neighbors to produce local fire-cleared gaps (the constructed niche) in which their offspring are able to continually track an ever-changing environment. Niche-hiking requires that mating, dispersal and niche construction all occur locally (i.e. the population is spatially structured), such that offspring are likely to experience the niches their parents construct. Using a spatially-explicit lattice-based simulation, we find that increased flammability can evolve despite the \"self-killing\" cost of such a trait. Genetic niche-hiking may also be applicable to the evolution of other traits in spatially structured ecological systems such as plant disease susceptibility and forest tree characteristics that influence gap production.\n      </p>", "Unintended effects of recreational activities in protected areas are of growing concern. We used an adaptive-management framework to develop guidelines for optimally managing hiking activities to maintain desired levels of territory occupancy and reproductive success of Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) in Denali National Park (Alaska, U.S.A.). The management decision was to restrict human access (hikers) to particular nesting territories to reduce disturbance. The management objective was to minimize restrictions on hikers while maintaining reproductive performance of eagles above some specified level. We based our decision analysis on predictive models of site occupancy of eagles developed using a combination of expert opinion and data collected from 93 eagle territories over 20 years. The best predictive model showed that restricting human access to eagle territories had little effect on occupancy dynamics. However, when considering important sources of uncertainty in the models, including environmental stochasticity, imperfect detection of hares on which eagles prey, and model uncertainty, restricting access of territories to hikers improved eagle reproduction substantially. An adaptive management framework such as ours may help reduce uncertainty of the effects of hiking activities on Golden Eagles.

In many cases such spots are composed of extremely large melanophore cells, the so-called macromelanophores. Macromelanophore pattern polymorphism is known in 10 out of 22 Xiphophorus species. In at least 8 species alleles of the macromelanophore determining locus Mdl are intimately linked to a dominant oncogene, ONC-Xmrk, which can give rise to malignant skin tumors (melanoma). We present, for the first time, evidence that macromelanophore pattern polymorphisms may be maintained by selection in a seasonally variable environment. In school-choice experiments single Xiphophorus helleri females spent more time with groups of spotted females than with non-spotted females under turbid, but not under clear water conditions. Similarly, receptive females preferred spotted males in turbid, but not in clear water. Thus, in nature, when the water becomes turbid after heavy rainfalls, school mates and reproductive partners can evidently find each other more easily with the help of macromelanophore spotting patterns. Intrasexual selection seems to be irrelevant because spotted and non-spotted males were equally successful in competition experiments. A genetic hitchhiking scenario is discussed which could explain the fact that the potentially injurious tumor gene ONC-Xmrk has been maintained in the genus Xiphophorus over a period of millions of years by its close linkage to positively selected macromelanophore alleles.\n      </p>", "The contingent valuation approach was applied to the problem of estimating the recreation benefits from alleviating congestion at Indian Peaks wilderness area, Colorado. A random sample of 126 individuals were interviewed while hiking and backpacking at the study site in 1979. The results provide an empirical test and confirmation of the Cesario and Freeman proposals that under conditions of excess recreational demand for existing sites, enhanced opportunities to substitute newly designated sites by reducing congestion results in external benefits to the remaining peak day users who do not substitute, and should be added to the recreational use benefits of new sites.\n      </p>", "Subjects were presented with a series of pictures, some of which were general (girl walking down the path) and others specific (girl hiking down the path).

It was found that labelling the picture with a sentence containing a specific verb substantially increased the likelihood that the specific picture corresponding to that verb would subsequently be falsely recognized.

To test the hypothesis that risk of predation plays a key role in the development of sexual segregation (habitat segregation) in this species, compositions and locations of groups of ibex were recorded from February 2003 to October 2004. Individual fixes of marked adult males and females in the Gran Paradiso National Park in Italy were collected monthly over a 4-year period (January 2000-December 2003). Distances were measured between each location and the nearest refuge area (rocky slopes), and between each location and the nearest source of disturbance (roads and hiking trails). Group size was not related to distances from refuge areas or from sources of disturbance, but sex, age, and weaning played a key role in spatial segregation. During the period of rut, females kept nearer to rocky slopes and further from hiking trails than males. The presence of young also influenced the spatial behavior of females: mothers made use of refuge areas more frequently and of areas near hiking trails less frequently than other females. In contrast, no difference between the spatial behaviors of pregnant and non-pregnant females was recorded in spring. Age played an important role in space use by males, but not by females. Young males (2-5 years) stayed closer to rocks than did middle-aged males (6-11 years), and both stayed closer to rocks than did adult males (&amp;gt;11 years). Adult males stayed closer to hiking trails than middle-aged males; likewise, the latter stayed closer to hiking trails than young males. Males stayed near areas with human presence, likely because of good foraging opportunities. Although our findings do not exclude other explanations, they support the reproductive strategy-predation risk hypothesis. Moreover, predation risk was shown as an important factor leading to both sexual and age segregation in males.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "General assessments of ecotourism and community-led development offer conflicting views of these strategies' potential. Appraisals of successful projects add to the available knowledge that policy makers can use to improve decision-making. The Mapu Lahual Network of Indigenous Parks (RML), an ecotourism development and conservation project in the 10th Region of southern Chile, covers 45,000 ha within the territories of eight indigenous communities, in a part of southern Chile that national and international conservation organizations consider a high priority for ecological conservation. Elected leaders of the indigenous communities established the RML in 2000 with technical assistance from public agencies and financial assistance from national and environmental organizations. The RML's primary purpose is to increase and diversify per-capita incomes in a way that preserves the area's environment and culture by establishing tourism based on a system of parks, trails, campgrounds, and local services. This paper appraises the RML with respect to the common interest of the relevant local, national, and international communities. The policy sciences provide a contextual basis for practical recommendations that will help participants build on the project's strengths and correct its weaknesses.

These activities represent a potential threat to owls, yet due to the confines of canyon walls, spatial restrictions on recreational activities would likely eliminate all activity within these canyons. We assessed factors that influenced flush responses (flush or no flush), flush distances, distances of avoidance flights, and behavioral changes of owls in response to a single hiker that approached roosting owls. Increased perch height decreased the likelihood that adults (odds ratio = 0.09) and juveniles (odds ratio = 0.17) would flush in response to the presence of a hiker; having flushed previously the same day increased the likelihood of adults flushing on subsequent approaches (odds ratio = 6.83). Juveniles and adults were unlikely to flush at distances \u226512 m and \u226524 m from hikers, respectively, and neither age class was likely to alter its behavior in response to the presence of a hiker at distances \u226555 m. Based on these response thresholds, placing a 55-m buffer zone around roosting sites would eliminate virtually all behavioral responses of owls to hikers, but would restrict hiker access to 80% of canyons occupied by owls. A less conservative 12-m buffer zone would eliminate 95% of juvenile and 80% of adult flush responses, and restrict hiker access to 25% of canyons occupied by owls.\n      </p>", "Failure to detect noxious weeds with current survey methods prevents their control and has contributed to their ability to establish and spread in remote range and forest sites. Techniques used in remote sensing can classify plant occurrence on maps, offering a method for surveying invasive species in remote locations and across extensive areas. An imaging hyperspectral spectrometer recorded images on July 19, 1998 in Farragut State Park near Bayview, ID, in the reflected solar region of the electromagnetic spectrum ranging from 440 to 2,543 nm to detect spotted knapweed. The sensor records 128 spectral bands in 12- to 16-nm intervals at a spatial resolution of 5 m. A spectral angle mapper (SAM) algorithm was used to classify the data. Infestations in Idaho with 70 to 100% spotted knapweed cover that were 0.1 ha were detected regardless of the classification angle. However, narrow angles (2 to 8\u00b0) did not completely define the extent of the infestation, and the widest angle tested (20\u00b0) falsely classified some areas as infested. The overall image error for all classes was lowest (3%) when SAM angles ranged from 10 to 11\u00b0. Specific errors for the spotted knapweed class for the 10 to 11\u00b0 angles showed that omissional and commissional errors were less than 3%. Areas with as little as 1 to 40% spotted knapweed cover were detected with an omissional error of 1% and a commissional error of 6%. Further verification sites were established on August 11, 1998 near Bozeman, MT, using the algorithms developed for Idaho. The omissional error for the Montana sites was 0%, and the commissional error was 10%.

The alert, flight initiation and escape distances were 1.6, 2.5 and 2.3 times longer, respectively, when Svalbard reindeer were encountered by a person disguised as a polar bear compared to a person in dark hiking gear. Population increase of polar bears on Svalbard and decrease in sea-ice cover in the Arctic region during summer probably results in more frequent interactions with reindeer on the archipelago. Similar reindeer response behavior from encounters with a polar bear and persons disguised as polar bears indicate a predator-prey relationship between the two species on Edge\u00f8ya.\n      </p>", "           ", "1. Plant pathogens can have major impacts on diverse taxa and ecological systems world-wide, and some of the most conspicuous of these are invasive non-native species. Although many factors are known to influence the distribution and abundance of plant pathogens, the extent to which humans play a role is less well-known but still critical for understanding the dynamics of invasive pathogens in natural systems. 2. One invasive pathogen of great concern world-wide is Phytophthora ramorum, which causes Sudden Oak Death, an emerging forest disease. Here, we examined the influence of humans and a range of environmental factors on the distribution of P. ramorum at three distinct spatial scales in northern and central California. 3. At the local scale, P. ramorum more commonly occurred in soil on hiking trails used heavily by humans than in soil from adjacent areas off trails. These results support the hypothesis that humans dispersed the pathogen within already infected areas and into areas lacking local sources of inoculum. 4. At the landscape scale, using a network of 202 randomly located plots across a 275 km\u00b2 area, we found that forests on public land open to recreation exhibited higher prevalence of disease in a critical infectious host tree (bay laurel, Umbellularia californica), than forests on private lands. Infection levels were also higher in plots surrounded by large amounts of forest with warm climatic conditions and greater potential soil moisture. Although prevalence of diseased canker hosts (Quercus agrifolia, Q. kelloggii and Lithocarpus densiflora) was positively associated with dominance of bay laurel and rainy season temperatures, it was not significantly related to public access, and we hypothesize that this occurred because our study area was in the early stages of infection. 5. At the regional scale, the probability of disease occurrence at 165 sites distributed across the geographic range of P. ramorum in California increased significantly as human population density increased in the surrounding area. Chances of infection also increased significantly with precipitation and presence of bay laurel. 6. Synthesis. Our results suggest that human activity -- along with temperature, moisture and host composition -- is associated with increased prevalence of an influential exotic forest pathogen. These results indicate that there may be conflicts between humans and disease, and that efforts to address this issue may require aggressive management of human activity.\n      </p>", "The lawyers' agitation in Tamil Nadu against the ordinance hiking court fees and the state government's eventual climbdown suspending it raises several issues on the citizens' right to access the justice system.\n      </p>", "The area surrounding the Great Lakes is a haven for temperate terrestrial orchids.

We evaluated the use by birds of 2 abandoned railroad rights-of-way in southeast Nebraska, one a partially converted 42-km urban-rural corridor and the other a converted urban recreational trail. We surveyed birds from 1992 to 1994 in 22 400-m transects (14 rural, 8 urban) that had either continuous woody vegetation (woody) or a more open mixture of grasses and forbs with scattered trees or shrubs (mixed). Of the 112 bird species (99 rural, 77 urban) observed, 47% were neotropical migrants, 38% short-distance migrants, and 15% permanent residents. Overall abundance was generally greater in rural woody and urban mixed transects, but there was no clear urban versus rural difference. Overall mean species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity index were generally greater in urban transects during autumn and winter but shifted to greater in rural woody transects during spring and rural during summer. Abundance, richness, and diversity for permanent residents were generally greater in urban transects than in rural through all seasons, but for neotropical migrants they were greater in rural woody (spring) or rural (summer). Richness and diversity of short-distance migrants were generally greater in rural transects during spring and summer, but abundance did not differ. For some species, abundance in urban versus rural transects changed seasonally and such patterns in mourning dove (Zenaida macroura) numbers support the concept that doves may behave as migrants in rural segments but as permanent residents in urban. Within the rural right-of-way, woody transects, compared to mixed, had greater total mean bird abundance during spring, summer, and winter and greater species richness and diversity during all seasons. However, these differences did not hold in urban transects, probably because of influences from surrounding suburban landscaping. We found 5 species to be more abundant overall in woody transects and one in mixed during one or more seasons, and within rural transects an additional 7 species more abundant in woody and 2 in mixed. Management along such rights-of-way should consider potential differences among migratory guilds and species in their response to right-of-way vegetation and urban versus rural surrounding land use.\n      </p>", "Raccoon (Procyon lotor) rabies was extremely close to the Ontario-New York state international boundary during 1994.

With the current decline of the extractive industries in this rural area, tourism is taking on new significance for many communities. This article gives an overview of tourism in the extensive Swedish mountain region, with a focus on types of recreational activities and their regionality. The data presented are based on a national sample of participation in mountain tourism. Findings show that 43% of the Swedish adult population (2.66 million individuals) visited the mountains at least once during a 5-year period (1995-1999). Winter activities-skiing and snowmobiling-were the dominant forms of mountain recreation. Tourism activity patterns differ distinctively across the 4 mountain counties: whereas winter tourism dominates in the southern parts of the region, the north receives visitors mostly in the summer. Only 5% of visitors to the Swedish mountains are from outside Scandinavia. In a single year, 9 times as many people visited the Swedish mountains as live there, but despite these numbers the population in the region is continually decreasing.\n      </p>", "           ", "To clarify aspects of the association between physical activity and breast cancer, such as activity intensity required, and possible effect modification by factors such as menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) use. We prospectively examined physical activity in relation to breast cancer risk among 45,631 women participating in the U.S. Radiologic Technologists cohort. Participants provided information at baseline regarding hours spent per week engaging in strenuous activity, walking/hiking for exercise, and walking at home or work. We estimated multivariable relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of breast cancer using Cox regression. We identified 864 incident-invasive breast cancers. Greatest risk reduction was observed among women who reported walking/hiking for exercise 10 or more hours per week (RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.34\u20130.95) compared with those reporting no walking/hiking. The association between walking/ hiking for exercise and breast cancer was modified by MHT use (p for interaction = 0.039). Postmenopausal women who never used MHT had reduced risks of breast cancer associated with physical activity whereas no relation was observed among ever users of MHT.

Soil compaction and bulk density increased significantly with increasing gross traffic weight, visit frequency, and soil moisture when examined these three factors independently. In both dry and moist soils, 10 passes in the human hiking trail was equivalent to a single pass in the vehicle trail; 100 passes in the hiking trail was equivalent to 10 passes in the vehicle trail. Significant interactions were found between disturbance type and visit frequency (number of passes), as well as number of passes and moisture level for soil compaction and bulk density.

Evidence is given for limited glaciation and/or periglacial conditions, with or without permafrost. An investigation of the distribution, morphometric attributes and surface weathering characteristics of relict openwork block accumulations in the area around Thabana-Ntlenyana, the highest summit in the range, supports the contention for a relatively arid periglacial environment during the Last Glacial period. A phase of enhanced block production is evident from the concentration of blocks in the upper layer of colluvium. Slope mobility on south-facing slopes is shown in the blockfield fabrics and the increase in downslope relative age of block surfaces. Block production and slope creep are attributed to depressed temperature conditions and seasonal freeze. Colluvium, within which blocks have been incorporated and superimposed, indicates that slope mantles predate the onset of the colder period and evidence militates against either deep snow cover or localised glaciation of south-facing slopes.\n      </p>", "This paper develops a negative binomial model of recreation demand that corrects for both truncation and endogenous stratification.

After 1980, the majority of injuries occurred in the backcountry. Backcountry injuries tended to be more severe and were more often caused by grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) than those that occurred along roadsides. Of the 34 injuries that occurred in the backcountry from 1970 through 1994, 13 (38%) were considered severe and 3 (9%) resulted in human fatalities.
