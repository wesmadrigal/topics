{"total_words": 961, "documents": ["This article reports the exploratory results of a computer-based behavioral simulation that examines the role of social utility in fashion behavior. Social utility is defined as those benefits of a product or service that satisfy interpersonal needs (e.g., conformity, individuality relative to others). These exploratory results suggest that social utility is a prime determinate of fashion behavior, and that selected personality traits moderate behavioral responses to social influence in the fashion domain.\n      </p>", "The article confronts two issues, first the question of women and consumption and second the fashion industry as a feminized sector. In the first instance the argument is that recent scholarship on consumption has been weakened by an inattention to questions of exclusion from consumption and the production of consumption. Income differentials as well as questions of poverty have dropped off the agenda in this debate. Attention instead has been paid to the meaning systems which come into play around items of consumption. This has led to a sense of political complacency as though consumption is not a problem. For the many thousands of women bringing up children at or below the poverty line it clearly is. The second part of the article takes the fashion industry as an example of a field where perspectives on both production and consumption are rarely brought together. This produces a sense of political hopelessness in relation to improving its employment practices, especially for very low paid women workers. The argument here is that greater integration and debate across the production and consumption divide could conceivably result in policies which would make this sector whose employees on a global basis are predominantly female, a better place of work.\n      </p>", "This paper examines the relevance of fashion photography as a source for the study of women's modernity in Germany between the wars as it focuses on the work of a fascinating and prolific professional photographer of the late 1920s and early 1930s-Else Neul\u00e4nder Simon-known by her artistic name Yva. Yva discovered her own unique visual language somewhere between the commercial clich\u00e9s and the modernist idioms of her time. As a successful professional photographer, she continuously searched for an image of the woman in fashion and advertisement photography that was not reductive and degrading. In an era when images of the woman as a sexual symbol were dominating mass media and were proven to attract customers, Yva positioned her photographed female model in a way that did not diminish her to a mere eye-catcher for the male spectator.\n      </p>", "Clothing has political significance because it affects the relationship among citizens. Clothing is not simply a private or personal matter; it implies the existence of an intersubjective social world in which one presents oneself and is seen by others. In examining the implications of fashion for political relationships, I will concede that fashion aggravates antagonistic relationship among citizens when it is used to flaunt one's status and wealth, but I will also argue clothes can also be used to exhibit respect toward others and allegiance to a group. Clothes, therefore, sometimes facilitate the democratic ideal of widely distributed power. Fashion can provoke dialogue about social and political matters, and that dialogue is democratic. When fashion manifests creativity, respect, allegiance, or membership, the relationships that it fosters are potentially democratic.\n      </p>", "This paper is concerned with the different forms of pleasure and identification activated in the consumption of dominant and subcultural print media. It centres on an analysis of the lesbian visual pleasures generated through the reading of fashion editorial in the new lesbian and gay lifestyle magazines. This consideration of the lesbian gaze is contrasted to the lesbian visual pleasures obtained from an against the grain reading of mainstream women's fashion magazines. The development of the lesbian and gay lifestyle magazines, in the context of the pink pound, produces a situation in which an eroticized lesbian visual pleasure is the overt remit of the magazine, rather than a clandestine pleasure obtained through a transgressive reading of dominant cultural imagery. In contrast to the polysemic free-play of fashion fantasy by which readers produce lesbian pleasure in the consumption of mainstream magazines, responses to the fashion content in the lesbian magazine Diva suggest that in a subcultural context readers deploy a realist mode of reading that demands a monosemic positive images iconography. The article uses the concept of subcultural competency to consider the different ways lesbians read mainstream and subcultural print media and suggests that the conflict over Diva's fashion spreads may be linked to changing patterns of identification and the use of dress for recognizability.\n      </p>", "Facing growing globalization of the marketplace, a number of Australian fashion designers in the 1970s and 1980s abandoned a long-standing reliance on Europe for inspiration to examine their domestic and indigenous 'grassroots'. They believed that by using indigenous sources, they could find an alternative to current Western concepts of fashionable style. This paper is an attempt to rethink assumptions that these fashions were inspirationally self-contained and their sources uni-directional. It uses the notion of cross-cultural 'threading' as a way of thinking about the spread of design ideas and engagements that took place across both European and indigenous cultures, and especially between orthodox fashion and indigenous art and design.\n      </p>", "This paper examines the influence of fashion on wealth accumulation in an economy with two groups of agents. Fashion is modelled as an externality generated by a particular dependence of individual agents' time preference on the two groups' per-capita consumption habits. It is shown that fashion causes excessive wealth fluctuations in the sense that stronger and more persistent fashion is more likely to generate limit cycles in wealth. Opposite to intuitive arguments, however, the externality in fashion does not necessarily generate instability in wealth. In a special case, equilibrium consumption and wealth are stable but the optimal ones that internalize the externality are locally unstable. Whether equilibrium consumption is excessive relative to optimal consumption depends on the distribution as well as the aggregate level of wealth.\n      </p>", "One of the greatest problems facing luxury goods firms in a globalizing market is that of counterfeiting. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the different types of counterfeiting that take place in the fashion industry and the ethical issues raised. We argue that the problem partly lies in the industry itself. Copying of designs is endemic and condoned, which raises several ethical dilemmas in passing judgment on the practice of counterfeiting. We analyze the ethical issues in a number of different types of counterfeiting encountered in the fashion industry. We conclude with some observations on the general implications for ethics in intellectual property rights.\n      </p>", "Fashion apparel is a highly competitive business where product life is short and differentiation advantages are built on brand image and product styling that can be quickly imitated. Over the past two decades, competition on price and quality has intensified as low cost global manufacturing became available to even small competitors. Recently, competition has shifted to the arena of timing and know-how where vertically integrated firms gained the lead in implementing a set of process innovations known as `quick response,' designed to shorten the production cycle. Less integrated firms have begun to erode that advantage, but the integrated firms that have linked quick response into retailing continue to have superior capabilities. These firms demonstrate the elements of organization needed to link flexible and fast cycle manufacturing with rapid learning about demand and customer satisfaction.\n      </p>", "Management fashion setters disseminate management fashions, transitory collective beliefs that certain management techniques are at the forefront of management progress. These fashion setters-consulting firms, management gurus, business mass-media publications, and business schools-do not simply force fashions onto gullible managers. To sustain their images as fashion setters, they must lead in a race (a) to sense the emergent collective preferences of managers for new management techniques, (b) to develop rhetorics that describe these techniques as the forefront of management progress, and (c) to disseminate these rhetorics back to managers and organizational stakeholders before other fashion setters. Fashion setters who fall behind in this race (e.g., business schools or certain scholarly professional societies) are condemned to be perceived as lagging rather than leading management progress, as peripheral to the business community, and as undeserving of societal support. This article is not a plea for business school scholars to become slaves to management fashion. Rather, it urges these scholars not only to study the management-fashion-setting process and to explain when and how it fails to serve shareholders, employees, managers, students, and other stakeholders, but also to intervene in this process in order to render it a more technically useful, collective learning process for these stakeholders.\n      </p>", "This paper uses the New Zealand designer fashion industry as an analytical lens through which to examine the co-constitution of political projects in what we label 'after-neoliberalism'. The paper begins by tracing the making of New Zealand designer fashion as an industry, and relates this process to four political projects in which designer fashion is understood to have different possibilities - globalisation, the knowledge economy, creative cities and social development. We examine two key sites of the constitution of the industry - the scoping reports that created it, and New Zealand Fashion Week, when designer fashion can be seen to mobilise the different political projects and to be harnessed to them. We show how 'the designer fashion industry' is expected to articulate diverse state aspirations. Our emphasis on the co-constitution of political projects highlights a new style of post-structural political economic analysis, as does our concern with industry as a space in which political projects become mobilised.\n      </p>", "We focus on backup agreements between a catalog company and manufacturers-a scheme to provide upstream sourcing flexibility for fashion merchandise. A backup agreement states that if the catalog company commits to a number of units for the season, the manufacturer holds back a constant fraction of the commitment and delivers the remaining units before the start of the fashion season. After observing early demand, the catalog company can order up to this backup quantity for the original purchase cost and receive quick delivery but will pay a penalty cost for any of the backup units it does not buy. In representative contracts with five companies, the fraction held as backup varies from 20% to 33% and the penalty ranges from 0 to 20% of cost. We model this inventory problem and derive the optimal solution. We provide results from a retrospective parallel test of the model against buyer decisions in 1993 based on a data set from the women's fashion department at a catalog company (Catco). The results indicate that backup arrangements can have a substantial impact on expected profits and may result in an increase in the committed quantity. Also, these arrangements may maintain the manufacturer's expected profit for a wide range of parameters.\n      </p>", "This article explores some of the key dynamics of the UK fashion sector as an example of a post-industrial, urban based, cultural economy comprising of a largely youthful female workforce. It argues that the small scale, independent activities which formed the backbone of the success of British fashion design as an internationally recognized phenomenon from the mid 1980s to the mid 1990s, represented a form of female self-generated work giving rise to collaborative possibilities and co-operation. However without an effective lobby or association (despite the expansion of the fashion media) and under conditions of rapid individualization and in an increasingly harsh climate of neo-liberalization, this creative economy has been overtaken and virtually demolished by the joint forces of a re-vitalized high street fashion culture and the aggressive presence of corporate fashion ('Prada-ization'). While the UK government celebrates the growth of the cultural economy, it also overlooks the processes making the livelihoods of its predominantly female workforce either untenable or else requiring de-specialization and 'multi-tasking'.\n      </p>", "In the field of the historical study of fashion and dress the use of oral history as a research methodology to date is limited. The purpose of this essay is to reflect why this might be, situating such lack in relation to both oral and fashion historical studies' own battles with academic prejudice and, further, to disciplinary disjunctures within the field of fashion and dress itself. More controversially, it will suggest that the resulting historiographical lacuna is one equally inflected with prejudices from within both fields towards each other. At the same time however, it also hopes to demonstrate the ways in which dress-based oral history testimonies might contribute to a progressive and mutually informative dialogue between clothing and oral historians and their research.\n      </p>", "This essay demonstrates how the stylistic use of colour in fashion newsreels of the 1910s and 1920s was derived and modified from earlier attractions-based film practices with regard to narrative integration and spectacle, and also related to conventions associated with the later narrative cinema. It places the use of colour in fashion newsreels within a broader visual and commercial context by exploring how contemporary cultural connotations associated with colour in relation to the terms 'primitive' and 'feminine' were both adopted and problematized in a film genre specifically addressing female spectators.\n      </p>", "The authors develop a theoretical framework of the fashion process and a mathematical model of that framework. Basic constructs related to an individual's motivations for adopting fashions are extracted from the fashion literature and related to the individual's fashion decision process. The individual-level model is then integrated into a societal-level framework that can be represented as a system of difference equations. The parameters of the system represent static interpersonal influence networks. The general solution for the system of difference equations is presented and the dynamic implications of several interpersonal influence patterns assumed in previous research are derived mathematically.\n      </p>", "The cutting operation in the high fashion clothing industry essentially involves putting several layers of cloth on a long cutting table and fixing templates of the parts of several articles on top of the stack before the actual cutting can be initiated. This is a very time-consuming task giving raise to high setup costs in addition to waste production resulting from the cutting process. Total production costs can then be optimized by minimizing the number of these setups while at the same time producing little or no waste. In this paper a mixed integer programming model is proposed that searches for an optimal set of cutting patterns, each giving a combination of articles to be cut in one operation, and corresponding stack heights.\n      </p>", "Fashion is a form of imitation and so of social equalization, but, paradoxically, in changing incessantly, it differentiates one time from another and one social stratum from another. It unites those of a social class and segregates them from others. The eliete initiates fashion and, when the mass imitates it in an effort to obliterate the external distinctions of class, abandons it for a newer mode-a process that quickens with the increase of wealth. Fashion does not exist in tribal and classless societies. It concerns externals and superficialities where irrationality does no harm. It signalizes the lack of personal freedom; hence it characterizes the female and the middle class, whose increased social freedom is matched by intense individual subjugation. Some forms are intrinsically more suited to the modifications of fashion than others: the internal unity of the forms called \"classic\" makes them immune to change.\n      </p>", "In many industries, the contemporary context of acute environmental dislocation shows the limits of traditional organizational recipes. In direct response to environmental challenges, companies are experimenting with new organizational solutions. While flexibility, or the capacity to redefine organizational form to follow changing purposes, is undeniably a common trend, these experiments otherwise differ greatly. Diversity is such, in fact, that it is difficult to clearly identify and define a unique organizational paradigm for the future. To explore the connection between environmental dislocation and organizational transformations, we adopt a historical and comparative perspective. Our empirical base of evidence is the luxury fashion industry in three countries. France, Italy, and the United States. For many years, this industry was defined by stable environmental conditions, and a craft model of organization remained dominant. We show that, over a more recent period, increasing environmental turbulence has brought about a redefinition of the rules of the game. A common response has been for organizations to move towards greater flexibility or modularity and to experiment with network forms. However, we also show that the paths or trajectories leading to organizational flexibility have varied significantly across countries, reflecting historical legacies and institutional constraints. We identify in fact three different network forms in that industry, which represent national ideal types-the \"umbrella holding\" company in France, the \"flexible embedded network\" in Italy, and the \"virtual organization\" in the United States. We argue that the process of change in the luxury fashion industry has been one of coevolution, where environmental transformation and organizational change have fed upon each other through time. Pioneer firms in the luxury fashion industry originally devised organizational solutions within the bounds set by nationally defined constraints and opportunities. Becoming institutionalized, these early solutions in turn shaped the environment for individual organizations and organizational populations, creating new sets of opportunities and constraints. In a path-dependent manner, different models of organization and national competitiveness thus emerged. In conclusion, we are brought to question the likelihood of full and stable convergence towards a unique organizational form or paradigm. There appears to be, in each national context, a process of construction of new organizational solutions that starts from local foundations. Embedded as they are in powerful historical and institutional legacies, organizational differences are there to stay, we believe, beyond the period of transition and acute environmental dislocation.\n      </p>", "This article analyses the characteristics of women's clothing fashion opinion leaders.

The first perspective assumes that the consumer has free reign in the play of signs (i.e., the consumer is constituting). The second assumes that the consumer is imprisoned by the signs and codes of the historical moment (i.e., the consumer is constituted). The dialectical and discursive tension between these two perspectives is used as an orienting framework in the hermeneutic analyses of 14 phenomenological interviews. Thompson and Haytko\u2019s (1997) findings/claims remain pertinent in a professional, middle\u2010class context. In addition, this research contributes to their lived hegemony premise by emphasizing the dominating tendencies of marketing systems.\n      </p>", "The rise of the transnational veiling-fashion industry in Turkey has taken place within the context of neoliberal economic restructuring, the subjection of the veil to new regulations, and the resurgence of Islamic identities worldwide. Even after almost two decades since its first catwalk appearance, the idea of 'veiling-fashion' continues to be controversial, drawing criticism from secular and devout Muslim segments of society alike. Analysing veiling-fashion as it plays out across economic, political and cultural fields is to enter into a new understanding of the role of Islam in the global arena today Veiling-fashion crystallises a series of issues about Islamic identity, the transnational linkages of both producers and consumers, and the shifting boundaries between Islamic ethics and the imperatives of neoliberal capitalism. In this paper, our overarching argument is that controversies and practices surrounding veiling-fashion show how Islamic actors are adapting and transforming neoliberal capitalism at the same time as they navigate a complex geopolitical terrain in which Islam - and the iconic Muslim, headscarf-wearing woman - has been cast as a threatening 'Other'. Thus the rise of veiling-fashion as a transnational phenomenon positions women and women's bodies at the centre of political debates and struggles surrounding what it means to be 'modern' and Muslim today. Based on interviews with producers, consumers and salesclerks, and our analysis of newspaper articles, catalogues and web sites, this article traces out how the transnational production, sale and consumption of veiling-fashion works to order spaces of geopolitics, geo-economics and subject formation.\n      </p>", "This article uses a case study approach, informed by oral testimony, to explore the relationship between fashion, gay masculinity and shopping, through the experiences of three men during the 1950s to the early 1970s. Focusing on clothing bought by the interviewees from the newly established boutiques aimed at both straight and gay male consumers, such as Vince Man's Shop, John Stephens' 'His Clothes' and John Michael, this research highlights the fact that dress and clothing is part of a series of gay sensibilities that cannot be isolated from their wider cultural, historical and social context.\n      </p>", "Cinema presented the most spectacular site for the display of Weimar fashions. Fashion\u2014both as part of the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne and the narrative in popular films\u2014shaped distinct cinematic conventions so that a sub-genre emerged: Konfektionskom\u00f6die or \"fashion farce.\" This sub-genre's rise coincided with the flourishing of Berlin's garment industry, Konfektion, in the 1910s and 1920s. Fashion and film, in tandem, guided the audience from the screen to see and experience modern life. At the same, the visual style of this genre was often influenced by other popular forms of live entertainment in Weimar Germany such as the fashion show (Modenschau).\n      </p>", "This article seeks to analyze the role of intermediary groups, specifically professional groups and consultants, in the development of management fashion. Consideration of that role highlights the need to develop the institutional perspective on fashion to encompass not only diffusion, but also episodes of theorization and institutionalization. Based on available evidence on the importance of intermediary groups in these episodes, a number of propositions are advanced as to their roles and activities, and the implications that these have for the development of fashion. These propositions are illustrated and explored by drawing on experience with the knowledge management (KM) fashion. Here, evidence on the activities of professionals and consultants highlights the interplay between the colonizing efforts of professionals and the commodifying activities of consultants. Both constituencies are seen as benefiting from the ambiguity of KM, in that it allows particular groups to pursue competitive differentiation through the development of their own interpretations. The analysis of KM's development suggests that the factors that promote the diffusion of a new fashion may in turn limit its translation into practice. The role of intermediary groups is important here. The collusive interaction between and among consultants and professional groups to promote their own versions of KM may have accelerated its diffusion, but it also had the effect of reducing the legitimacy of KM-inspired changes to a narrowly technological domain \u2014 thereby rendering them ineffective, on the one hand, but intensifying the fashion cycle, on the other.\n      </p>", "The Italian fashion industry rose to a position of international prominence in the second half of the twentieth century. An important factor in the sector's global success was the opening up of the international, particularly the American, markets. The changes that occurred within the fashion industry after World War II, most critically the end of the Parisian monopoly, offered opportunities that were exploited differently by the various competitors. While cities like London and New York managed to promote themselves as alternatives to Paris, Italy was initially unable to create a single fashion capital. Florence, Rome, and Milan felt themselves equally entitled to become the staging ground for Italian fashion production, but Milan, benefiting from certain features of its productive structure, eventually emerged as the winner. The city's success was based on a long, steady accumulation of resources and the ability to harness its creative and managerial capabilities. The result was Milan's emergence as a fashion \"superstar\" in the 1970s.\n      </p>", "The distinction between art photography and fashion photography was long regarded as significant and necessary to protect 'serious' photography from fashion's odium. Like authors writing for Hollywood, 'serious' photographers risked their respectability if they worked for one of the major fashion journals and thus carefully avoided being labeled 'fashion photographers.' Yet early on, major American photographers\u2014Edward Steichen, Man Ray, Clifford Coffin, Irving Penn, Richard Avedon, and William Klein among them\u2014spent years abroad working for international fashion journals, producing images that emphasized the fashionable and transitory quality of dress and glamour while creating photographs of timeless beauty and aesthetic value. This paper will adopt a phenomenological, descriptive approach in order to focus on the visual inventiveness of American photographers in transforming European fashion into images of perfection while at the same time transgressing accepted generic boundaries.\n      </p>", "This article examines the complex relationships between changing forms of commodity production and consumption and changing styles of religiosity in Zabid, the Republic of Yemen. I examine a couple of prominent logics of veiling in Fin-de-Si\u00e8cle Yemen: Some reformist women add \"Islamic socks\" and gloves to their already fully modest garb, while other women don chadors that decorate these garments with embroidery, making them into items of fashionable consumption and adornment. Other commodities, like a Chador Barbie that I found in Yemen's suq, are used to think through changing practices of consumption, adornment, and women's sociability in Zabid.\n      </p>", "Through close study of Sherman Alexie's short story collection, \"The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven\" (1993), this essay aims to explore the dialectics of Native American narrative now. First, the blockage or thwarting of narrative in Alexie is identified and interpreted as a crisis for Native American representation. However, a second section suggests that Alexie queries the centrality accorded narrative within his tradition. Yet the final section finds that the non-narrative or anti-narrative strategies thereby explored are also, in their turn, questioned by Alexie; in postmodern fashion, his work considers the possibilities for Native Americans of 'little narratives'.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

We propose a single-period inventory modelling framework with two ordering opportunities. The second order reflects updated demand information and potentially capitalizes on supply chain flexibility. We consider two complementary forms of flexibility: quantity flexibility in production and timing flexibility in scheduling. In this framework, we analyze the total inventory cost of a firm for alternate demand types. We model functional products through the standard assumption of independent demand over the period, fashion-driven innovative products through a Bayesian model, and innovative products with evolving demand through a Martingale process. The three demand processes exhibit very different behavior with respect to the value of the alternate forms of flexibility. We observe that quantity flexibility is of moderate value for functional goods and of high value for fashion-driven products for all lead times. Quantity flexibility is of low value for goods with evolving demand with long lead times but of high value for short lead times. Alternately, we observe timing flexibility is of highest value for functional goods, especially for cases of high holding cost, and is of lesser value for fashion-driven goods. It is of least value for goods with evolving demand. Both quantity and timing flexibility capabilities are required to significantly reduce the relevant supply chain costs for evolving-demand innovative goods when the lead times are long.\n      </p>", "I.

Although design historians have long acknowledged the influence of organic matter on the streamlined style, cultural historians have just begun to explore the interplay between technology and the presentation and perception of the human body. Exploring the ways in which experts attempted to conceal both mechanical and bodily function through streamlining illuminates the cultural values this style represented. While the machine served as the ideal for bodily function, popular culture applied the philosophy behind the design mode of streamlining to breasts. Prescriptive literature presented lactating breasts as technology that could be manipulated into better performance or replaced by perfectible mass-manufactured products. By the 1920s, medicine, new technology and fashion encouraged a singular ideal of youthful, or neutered, femininity.

In the early thirties she was Man Ray's muse, student, and lover in Paris, where she also worked as both photographer and model for Paris Vogue, as well as for numerous courtiers, including Patou and Scheperelli. The mid-thirties found her with her own successful photographic studio back in Manhattan. In WWII she served as British Vogue's official war correspondent and was one of the first photographers to enter liberated Dachau and Buchenwald. In 1957 Miller passed the Cordon Bleu course at their Paris school.

The home she shared with her husband, Roland Penrose, in the English countryside was frequently filled with weekend guests drawn from the international modern art world.

Fashion innovativeness and fashion opinion leadership were studied in relation to selected social, psychological, and economic variables. Since the test of collective selection occurs in the local social system it would seem appropriate that theories regarding the operation of the fashion process account more fully for the rate and degree of acceptance and rejection of innovations in the local social system, and for the functions of local participants in the process.

A person blindly following the whims of fashion was without style, whereas a man of style -- or a gentleman -- used his own power of judgement. Immanuel Kant shared this conception with many of his contemporaries. It is well known that Georg Simmel's idea of a formal sociology was influenced by his reading of Kant's aesthetic writings. Even Simmel's famous essay on fashion can best be understood as a somewhat ironic commentary on Kant's idea of a sensus communis: the community of fashion is the real community of universal taste. To Simmel, fashion is a societal formation always combining two opposite forces. It is a socially acceptable and safe way to distinguish oneself from others and, at the same time, it satisfies the individual's need for social adaptation and imitation. Furthermore, the charm of novelty offered by fashion is a purely aesthetic pleasure. Fashion helps to solve -- at least provisionally -- the central problem of the philosophy of life, also expressed in the antinomy of taste as formulated by Kant. It teaches the modern man how a person can be a homogeneous part of a social mass without losing his individuality, or how he can both stick to his own private taste and expect others -- who recognizably also have a taste of their own -- to share it. Simmel's suggestion of the 'stylized life-style' further develops the same idea. In modern society, both style and fashion are functional equivalents to 'good taste'.\n      </p>", "A model of fashion cycles is developed in which designs are used as a signaling device in a \"dating game.\" A monopolist periodically creates a new design. Over time the price of the design falls as it spreads across the population. Once sufficiently many consumers own the design it is profitable to create a new design and thereby render the old design obsolete. The paper gives conditions under which all consumers would be better off by banning the use of fashion. Competition among designers may lead to less frequent changes in fashion and to higher prices than monopoly.

This article explains that fashion trends can be detected fairly easily if the marketer is aware of certain factors which help to determine whether a particular innovation will go on to become an accepted fashion.

This article assesses the relevance of top-down as compared to bottom-up models of diffusion for fashion. Changes in the relationships between fashion organizations and their publics have affected what is diffused, how it is diffused, and to whom. Originally, fashion design was centered in Paris; designers created clothes for local clients, but styles were diffused to many other countries. This highly centralized system has been replaced by a system in which fashion designers in several countries create designs for small publics in global markets, but their organizations make their profits from luxury products other than clothing. Trends are set by fashion forecasters, fashion editors, and department store buyers. Industrial manufacturers are consumer driven, and market trends originate in many types of social groups, including adolescent urban subcultures. Consequently, fashion emanates from many sources and diffuses in various ways to different publics.\n      </p>", "World-renowned fashion designer Dai Fujiwara sought out Fields medalist Bill Thurston to see if great minds really do think alike.\n      </p>", "This article considers the move in mathematics education, away from abstract calculations and toward 'mathematics in context', particularly in relation to female underachievement in the mathematics classroom. It is suggested that 'unreal' contexts, which require students to view school mathematics as useful only in the make-believe world created in the classroom, are particularly damaging for girls. A small-scale piece of research is reviewed which suggests that girls are more likely than boys to underachieve in contexts which present real world variables but do not allow the variables to be taken into account. The implications of this situation in relation to girls' reported underachievement and disinterest in school mathematics are discussed.\n      </p>", "Women's responses in the context of focus groups to fashion photographs and clothing advertisements in Vogue magazine and to a brief questionnaire eliciting their attitudes toward clothing and fashion are used to examine the nature and extent of hegemonic influences in fashion. Participants' sources of information about fashion suggest that the authority of the fashion press is limited. The magazine's conceptions of women's roles as expressed in its fashion photography fit a model of \"conflicted\" hegemony characteristic of American media and popular culture in general. Empowered by the cultural context of conflicted hegemony, women were generally critical of fashion photographs. Their responses to photographs were influenced by their acceptance of traditional norms of feminine demeanor but varied by age and race. They rejected the magazine's orientation toward the use of fashionable clothing for postmodernist role-playing in favor of a modernist outlook.\n      </p>", "Consider a category of product variants distinguished by some attribute such as color or flavor.

We show that the optimal assortment has a simple structure and provide insights on how various factors affect the optimal level of assortment variety.

Unlike advertising, consumers perceive these sources as neutral and more credible because they usually presume that editorial content and product coverage in newspapers and magazines are independent and free from advertisers' influence. In this article, the authors show how advertising activities of firms may influence media coverage to the firms' advantage. They analyze a recent (2002-2003) large data set comprising 291 fashion companies based in Italy and their advertising and product coverage data published in newspapers and magazines of 123 publishers from Italy, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Controlling for firm heterogeneity, endogeneity, and the simultaneity of advertising and coverage, the authors find that, overall, (1) there is evidence of a strong positive influence of advertising on coverage, (2) publishers that depend more on a specific industry for their advertising revenues are prone to a higher degree of influence from their corporate advertisers than others, (3) peer pressures from competing publishers affect coverage decisions, (4) larger and more innovative companies are at an advantage for obtaining coverage for their products, and (5) the effects of corporate advertising influence exist in both Europe and the United States. These findings raise concerns about the independence of editorial content and coverage of magazines.\n      </p>", "r />\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(128, 0, 0);\">EDITORS</span></p>\nMary Frances Luce \n<br />\nAnn L.

In the current social environment, the interest in modesty is more than a shift in trends. The ascendance and assertion of religious views on the body can lead fashion, as demonstrated in the increasing interest in more modest fashion and movement against immodesty. Membership in evangelical and fundamental religions, which is currently increasing in numbers, is influencing non-religious consumer culture by pressuring designers, producers and retailers of fashion.\n      </p>", "Fashions are self-fulfilling prophecies, and arise through a process of agreement among fashion-makers responding to common situational cues. Consumer behavior is only one of these cues. This view of the fashion process is illustrated by the wide C-post, which has become a dominant fashion in automobile styling during the past ten years.\n      </p>", "Although scientists generally consider fashion, which they define as the selection of problems on the basis of non-scientific criteria, as a form of deviance, it is not necessary to postulate deviant motives on the part of the scientist in order to interpret the phenomenon of fashion in science. The phenomenon of rapid acceptance of scientific information can be explained more satisfactorily as a process of exceptionally rapid growth in a scientific field. The conditions which produce an exceptional rate of growth are described. The theoretical development of the field and the relative number of scientists attracted to it determines whether a field exhibiting this type of growth will be labeled \"fashionable.\" Whether this label is deserved also depends on the theoretical development of the field.\n      </p>", "Narrative transportation\u2014to be carried away by a story\u2014has been proposed as a distinct route to persuasion. But as originally conceived, narrative transportation is unlikely to occur in response to advertisements, where persuasive intent is obvious and consumer resistance is expected. We analyze fashion ads to show how narrative transportation can nonetheless be a possible response to ads, if specific aesthetic properties are present, most notably when grotesque imagery is used. We then situate narrative transportation as one of five modes of engaging fashion advertising, each of which serves as a distinct route to persuasion. Interviews showed that consumers variously engage ads to act, identify, feel, transport, or immerse. We explain how aesthetic properties of ads call forth different modes of engagement and explore how grotesque imagery can lead to either narrative transportation or immersion. As routes to persuasion, transportation and immersion work by intensifying brand experience rather than boosting brand evaluation.\n      </p>", "We focus on the problem of buying fashion goods for the \"big book\" of a catalogue merchandiser. This company also owns outlet stores and thus has the opportunity, as the season evolves, to divert inventory originally purchased for the big book to the outlet store. The obvious questions are: (1) how much to order originally, and (2) how much to divert to the outlet store as actual demand is observed. We develop a model of demand for an individual item. The model is motivated by data from the women's designer fashion department and uses both historical data and buyer judgement. We build a stochastic dynamic programming (DP) model of the fashion buying problem that incorporates the model of demand. The DP model is used to derive the structure of the optimal inventory control policy. We then develop an updated Newsboy heuristic that is intuitively appealing and easily implemented. When this heuristic is compared to the optimal solution for a wide variety of scenarios, we observe that it performs very well. Similar numerical experiments show that the current company practice does not yield consistently good results when compared to the optimal solution.\n      </p>", "The present study analyses Finnish higher education steering system, management by results, from the perspective of higher education institutions. We ask what happens inside a higher education institution, called here the \"Campus University\", during the actual negotiations related to the national steering system. We analyse not only the management by results as a steering system but pay close attention to the social space created by this managerial fad. The social space of the negotiations is constructed by different kinds of unofficial elements of social interaction; the physical space, the expected behaviour of the negotiators, the seating arrangements, the coffee servings, and the \"small talk\". These elements of interaction are part of the polity of the negotiations and they are controlled by the chairperson of the negotiations. They form the modes of the social space of these negotiations. Therefore, the social space of the negotiations not only supports the hierarchical character of the ritual, but also makes it natural for the Rector to use power to allocate resources because s/he represents the institution. The analysis is based on qualitative and ethnographic methods of research.\n      </p>", "This paper elucidates two positions (the positivist and the critical) that inform the creative design of technological fashion. On the one side is the instrumentalist trend toward the minimized or disappearing interface. On the other, some theorists and artists suggest that increased invisibility presents social and ethical concerns (such as invasiveness and control) when networking and communication devices are involved. The positivist side has roots in modernist design. Positivist designers create responsive and controllable fabrics using shape-changing polymers, e-textiles, and nano-scale electronics to resolve clumsy and prohibitive problems of hardware vs. body. The critical side draws upon archetypal ideas about technology and the body that are familiar from literature and science fiction, and includes writers and media artists who emphasize the intractable or mechanic nature of technological clothing to enhance, rather than erase, the body. The paper concludes that both positions must be considered as the field of technological fashion moves forward.\n      </p>", "This article examines the ways in which the eighteenth-century French fashion press creatively repackaged Rousseau's ideas about femininity for the benefit of the fashion industry. The fashion editors took the existing discourse on fashion, which since the seventeenth century had associated clothing consumption with aristocracy, luxury, and women's theatricality, and transformed it so that the consumption of fashions could be rendered compatible with domesticity. The editors did so by suggesting that fashion was fundamentally a product of taste rather than wealth and luxury. Broadly, the article suggests that by looking closely at the ways in which gender identities were shaped and negotiated within the realm of commerce, historians may be able to move beyond rigid understandings of the ways in which notions of public and private marked women's place within eighteenth-century French culture.\n      </p>", "Between December 1917 and May 1918, one of the leading acts on the Keith vaudeville circuit was \"Fleurette's Dream at Peronne\", a fashion show featuring a dozen mannequins and a million dollars in clothing. Staged by British couturier Lucile (Lady Duff Gordon), the self-proclaimed inventor of the modern fashion show, the twenty-eight minute \"playlet\" was a celebration of fashion's excesses and a clever promotional vehicle for the designer's gowns. But as Lucile repeatedly emphasized in her stage appearances and newspaper interviews, Fleurette's Dream was not a fashion show: it was a war drama created for the express purpose of raising money to rebuild French homes destroyed in the war. In framing the act in this way, Lucile aligned theatrical spectatorship and fashion consumption with the ideals of philanthropy, humanitarianism, and patriotism. Read against the US government's wartime call for campaign and thrift, \"Fleurette's Dream at Peronne\" becomes much more than a lavish spectacle wrapped up in a convenient war disguise. Through the medium of the vaudeville fashion show, Lucile advanced a pro-consumption message that actively refuted attempts to shame women for purchasing dresses, jewels, and other display commodities. \"Fleurette's Dream at Peronne\" thus offers fascinating insight into the production of female citizenship during World War I and the evolving relationship between consumption and patriotism.\n      </p>", "<a href=\"/doi/story/10.2307/ANN.2011.01.13.14408\">Katarzyna Marciniak&#39;s Signs essay &quot;Pedagogy of Anxiety&quot; has won the 2010 Florence Howe Award.</a> \n<br />\n<br />\n <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://press.uchicago.edu/pressReleases/2012/July/Signs_1207_Stimpson2013.html\">Anna H&#225;jkov&#225; wins the Signs 2013 Catharine Stimpson Prize.</a> \n<br />\n<br />\n <!-- end SECOND SECTION --> <!-- start THIRD SECTION --> \n<div style=\"color: rgb(133, 51, 51); font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold;\">IMPORTANT LINKS", "<a href=\"/doi/story/10.2307/ANN.2011.01.13.14408\">Katarzyna Marciniak&#39;s Signs essay &quot;Pedagogy of Anxiety&quot; has won the 2010 Florence Howe Award.</a> \n<br />\n<br />\n <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://press.uchicago.edu/pressReleases/2012/July/Signs_1207_Stimpson2013.html\">Anna H&#225;jkov&#225; wins the Signs 2013 Catharine Stimpson Prize.</a> \n<br />\n<br />\n <!-- end SECOND SECTION --> <!-- start THIRD SECTION --> \n<div style=\"color: rgb(133, 51, 51); font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold;\">IMPORTANT LINKS", "", "<a href=\"/doi/story/10.2307/ANN.2011.01.13.14408\">Katarzyna Marciniak&#39;s Signs essay &quot;Pedagogy of Anxiety&quot; has won the 2010 Florence Howe Award.</a> \n<br />\n<br />\n <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://press.uchicago.edu/pressReleases/2012/July/Signs_1207_Stimpson2013.html\">Anna H&#225;jkov&#225; wins the Signs 2013 Catharine Stimpson Prize.</a> \n<br />\n<br />\n <!-- end SECOND SECTION --> <!-- start THIRD SECTION --> \n<div style=\"color: rgb(133, 51, 51); font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold;\">IMPORTANT LINKS", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "What makes a commodity 'Islamic'? By focusing on the question of 'Islamic-ness' as it traverses both material and symbolic production, this paper aims to contribute to recent research in geography on the lives of commodities. Our study demonstrates the instability of Islamic-ness in the veiling-fashion industry in Turkey and draws out the implications of this finding for our understanding of the socio-spatial work of the commodity. The veiling-fashion (or tesett\u00fcr) sector has become a conspicuous part of the Turkish apparel industry in the past 30 years. Firms producing veiling-fashion engage in the design, production, marketing and sale of distinctive commodities stylised to signify Islamic-ness. We begin by situating veiling-fashion within the broader contours of the Turkish apparel industry, economic restructuring and the rise of an Islamic habitus in Turkey. Based on our 2008 survey of 174 veiling-fashion firms in Turkey and our case studies of three such firms, we seek to understand how and to what extent the commodity is inscribed as an Islamic commodity in the course of its life, from financing to marketing. We use survey data to explore the role of Islamic banking practices, Islamic trading practices and Islamic workplace ethics in the itinerary of veiling-fashion. Drawing on our case studies of three veiling-fashion firms (Tekbir, Boutique Dayi and Armine), we show how these companies represent their ambivalent relationships to Islamic-ness, both as a set of values and as a particular milieu in Turkey. Through this analysis, we find that the Islamic-ness of the commodity cannot in fact be located or fixed; it is instead best understood as a mode of insertion into socio-spatial networks. Veiling-fashion as a commodity thus enters into and becomes constitutive of the wider material and symbolic networks that enact Islamic-ness in Turkey today.\n      </p>", "A former Chairman of the New York Couture Group and now a Director of Affiliated Dress Manufacturers Inc., Mr. Klein demonstrates the modern businessman's awareness of the role of fashion in the history of business.\n      </p>", "In commenting on two articles on fashion which appeared in the July issue of the JOURNAL OF MARKETING, the author identifies some generally neglected early writings on fashion and considers the serious problems arising out of the lack of availability of early contributions to marketing literature.

It is, therefore, important that today's scholars capitalize on our rich heritage of marketing literature.\n      </p>", "Are fads and fashions proof of a capricious consumer? Are they evidences that sellers can and do manipulate the market? According to this article, the cyclical nature of fashion rests on a firm foundation of individual and social psychology.

The dramatic increase in fashion titles published during the last decade has coincided with the increase in academic interest in fashion, as compared to vocational or technical study. This article reviews recent literature, addresses changes in publishing and collecting fashion resources, recommends major resources suitable for research libraries, and profiles use by varying constituencies, examining how a fashion collection fits into an academic art library.\n      </p>", "Can we speak of Islamic fashion or is this a contradiction in terms? This article deals with a setting that is generally seen as traditionalist, that is San'a, the capital of the Yemen Arab Republic. If there seems to be little space for the development of fashionable women's dress, both for the women concerned and for others taking an interest in women's dress, such as conservative religious authorities, fashion is an issue. This article sets out with a brief analysis of how conservative Islamists have discussed fashion in the colorful booklets they distribute in San'a. This then is followed by a description of debates that have taken place in San'a about women's dress, starting in the 1960s, and trends in women's everyday sartorial practices from the 1960s till 2000. The question whether Islam and fashion can go together turns out to be a question about Islam, agency, and modernity. Those who assume that Islam and fashion do not go together, be it Western scholars or the conservative authors of the booklets, assume a link between wearing Islamic dress and tradition, albeit in a different way. The everyday sartorial practices of San'ani women obviously contradict such a point of view.\n      </p>", "This theory-development case study of the quality circle management fashion focuses on three features of management-knowledge entrepreneurs' discourse promoting or discrediting such fashions: its lifecycle, forces triggering stages in its lifecycle, and the type of collective learning it fostered. Results suggest, first, that variability in when different types of knowledge entrepreneurs begin, continue, and stop promoting fashions explains variability in their lifecycles; second, that historically unique conjunctions of forces, endogenous and exogenous to the management-fashion market, trigger and shape management fashions; and third, that emotionally charged, enthusiastic, and unreasoned discourse characterizes the upswings of management fashion waves, whereas more reasoned, unemotional, and qualified discourse characterizes their downswings, evidencing a pattern of superstitious collective learning.\n      </p>", "This article asks you to think geographically about fashion.

Why do we buy and wear the clothes we do and how often do we think about where the value lies in a garment? Why do the phrases 'Made in Italy' and 'Made in China' have such different connotations? How can a child in Cambodia working in a denim factory have any geographical connection to a Prada store on Bond Street? The following article argues for a relational approach to the study of fashion, one that brings these complex connections between production, branding, retailing and wearing into simultaneous and mutually constitutive view. The article shows how the global maps of clothing supply and retailing expose our complicity as consumers in the production of deeply unequal geographies of fashion.\n      </p>", "Elisabetta Caminer Turra (1751-96) was one of Italy's first female journalists. Her periodical, the Giornale enciclopedico (later Nuovo giornale enciclopedico, and Nuovo giornale enciclopedico d'Italia), offered reviews, extracts, and announcements of the latest literary, scientific, philosophical, and historical works published across Europe. Under Caminer's direction, the periodical became the most progressive Enlightenment influence in the Veneto region of Italy. While not opposed to the fashion industry-which she viewed as useful to commerce-Caminer became an adamant critic of the new fashion periodicals for women. In a series of reviews published between 1777 and 1786, she critiqued her compatriots' willingness to ape French fashions, inveighed against the claims of fashion periodicals to provide an education for women, and warned her female readers that choosing the toilette over the writing table allowed men to retain their superior position in the gender hierarchy and made women complicit in their own subjugation.\n      </p>"], "words": {"essay": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "limited": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "writings": {"number": 1, "prob":
