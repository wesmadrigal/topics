{"total_words": 171, "documents": ["We tested some resin-based composites used in dentistry for their estrogenic activity. A sealant based on bisphenol-A diglycidylether methacrylate (bis-GMA) increased cell yields, progesterone receptor expression, and pS2 secretion in human estrogen-target, serum-sensitive MCF7 breast cancer cells. Estrogenicity was due to bisphenol-A and bisphenol-A dimethacrylate, monomers found in the base paste of the dental sealant and identified by mass spectrometry. Samples of saliva from 18 subjects treated with 50 mg of a bis-GMA-based sealant applied on their molars were collected 1 hr before and after treatment. Bisphenol-A (range 90-931 \u03bcg) was identified only in saliva collected during a 1-hr period after treatment. The use of bis-GMA-based resins in dentistry, and particularly the use of sealants in children, appears to contribute to human exposure to xenoestrogens.\n      </p>", "It is now almost 30 years since the General Medical Council first made recommendations on the undergraduate teaching of statistics and biometry in the UK. The subsequent progress of medical statistics teaching is traced. The similar but later development of the teaching of biometry to dental students is also outlined. The teaching of the principles of biometry and medical statistics course to first-year medical students at the United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St Thomas's (a London medical school) is then described in detail. The teaching of statistical ideas to dental students and in the context of dental public health is also discussed. The effect of some current developments in medical education, including special study modules, evidence-based medicine and computer-assisted learning, is then reviewed. The paper concludes with some personal reflections.\n      </p>", "The importance of five aspects of dentistry in motivating choice of career is assayed with data from 3,578 entering dental students. The relative attractions in dentistry, as compared with other professions, of prestige, money, service, autonomy, and the opportunity to use manual skills are considered. Interviews with a third of the polled group support the conclusions that a patterned balance of these motives, and probably of others not studied, is needed to produce optimum interest in dentistry as a career and that the need for autonomy is central.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Self-recruitment to dentistry provides an excellent case of the purposive or negotiated nature of occupational choice, especially of the skilled and professional occupations. Choices were made as compromises between reward preferences and expectancies of access to specific occupations; both of these career perspectives were developed with reference to familial occupational history, especially the occupational status of the father. Evidence is presented which indicates that dentistry was chosen because it combined high rewards with a reasonable degree of access; i.e., a minimax strategy was employed. Medicine, although possessing greater rewards, was rejected because of difficult access; while law, university teaching and accountancy, etc., were rejected because of perceived lower rewards.\n      </p>", "Intermittent methohexitone for conservative dentistry has been shown to cause clinically undetectable respiratory obstruction, depression of the laryngeal reflex, and arterial hypoxaemia. Because of the pronounced decrease in total peripheral resistance, the blood pressure was maintained only by large increases in cardiac output. Furthermore, the output of the heart could not increase when challenged by hypoxia.\n      </p>", "Objectives\u2014Dental instruments such as the right angle or straight handpiece, air turbine, and ultrasonic scaler have the ability to produce dental aerosols containing water, saliva, microorganisms, blood, tooth particles, lubricating oil, and restorative materials. The purpose of this study was to find out whether personal protective equipment (mask, glasses) was used by dental personnel, and to investigate possible work related disease in the dental profession. Methods\u2014Cross sectional data were collected with a self administered questionnaire sent to 69 randomly chosen general dental practices in the West Midlands Region. All members of the dental team completed questionnaires (dentists (n = 122); nurses (n = 115); hygienists (n = 86); and receptionists (n = 74)) and answered questions on use of personal protective equipment and the prevalence of upper and lower respiratory tract, eye, and skin symptoms (reported and work related). Reception staff were included as a low exposure, control group. Also, a longitudinal study of dental hygienists was carried out on 31 people who had taken part in a similar study five years earlier. Results\u2014Use of a face mask and glasses differed between clinical groups with hygienists and nurses being the most and least prevalent users respectively. Although several reported symptoms were significantly more prevalent among clinical staff, only one work related symptom (skin rashes or itchy or dry skin) was reported by the clinical staff more than by the non-clinical receptionists. Among female clinical staff, age &lt; 35 years and atopy were the factors that predisposed to work related symptoms. Also, reported symptoms were related to duration of use of instruments that generated aerosols. Conclusions\u2014This study shows a low level of work related symptoms in dentistry, but highlights a group vulnerable to prolonged exposures to dental aerosols. It also supports the need for enforcement of the use of personal protective equipment among dental nurses.\n      </p>", "This review summarizes data from self-reported and observational studies describing the nature, frequency, and circumstances of occupational blood exposures among US dental workers between 1986 and 1995. These studies suggest that, among US dentists, percutaneous injuries have declined steadily over the 10-year period. Data also suggest that, in 1995, most dental workers (dentists, hygienists, assistants, and oral surgeons) experienced approximately three injuries per year. Work practices (eg, using an instrument instead of fingers to retract tissue), safer instrumentation or design (eg, self-sheathing needles, changes in dental-unit design), and continued worker education may reduce occupational blood exposures in dentistry further.\n      </p>", "The potential impact of feminization upon professions is examined through a case study of the Ontario dental profession. Women are entering dentistry in larger numbers, and if women practice differently than men, then their increased participation may alter the nature of dental practice. Using data from a survey of dentists in Ontario conducted in 2002 (N=484), this study finds that there are very few differences between male and female dentists in terms of practice characteristics and attitudes towards practise. Although men and women tend to differ in their practice type and average income, they, on average, resemble one another in terms of working hours, practice location and professional attitudes. Nevertheless, age emerged as an important mediating factor and some gender differences do exist amongst the younger cohorts of dentists. The implications of these findings for dentistry, and the feminization of professions more generally, are discussed. /// Cet article examine l'impact potentiel de la f\u00e9minisation sur les professions au moyen d'une \u00e9tude de cas dans les professions dentaires en Ontario. Les femmes embrassent la m\u00e9decine dentaire en grand nombre et si elles pratiquent cet art diff\u00e9remment des hommes, alors leur plus grande participation \u00e0 la profession peut modifier la nature m\u00eame de la pratique dentaire. \u00c0 partir de donn\u00e9es provenant d'un sondage fait en 2002 (N=484) aupr\u00e8s de dentistes en Ontario, l'\u00e9tude a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu'il y avait tr\u00e8s peu de diff\u00e9rences entre les dentistes hommes et femmes en ce qui a trait aux caract\u00e9ristiques de la pratique et leur attitude \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de celle-ci. Bien que les hommes et les femmes diff\u00e8rent dans leur genre de pratique et revenu moyen, ils se ressemblent en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, en ce qui concerne leurs heures de travail, l'emplacement de leur pratique et leurs attitudes professionnelles. Pourtant, l'\u00e2ge est apparu comme \u00e9tant un facteur m\u00e9diateur et il existe certes des diff\u00e9rences de genre chez les cohortes plus jeunes de dentistes. Les implications de ces conclusions pour l'art dentaire et la f\u00e9minisation des professions en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral y sont trait\u00e9es.\n      </p>", "Patients unable to submit themselves to routine dental treatment under local anaesthesia were studied during treatment under diazepam sedation accompanied by local anaesthesia, and compared with a matched control group for psychiatric assessment. Physiological responses, operating conditions, amnesia, pain threshold, and recovery were all assessed by various tests. Some of the patients had an anxiety neurosis, and several had been referred because of previous failure to complete dental treatment. Satisfactory conditions were obtained in all but two instances, and no adverse physiological responses occurred with diazepam in an intravenous dose of 0.2mg./kg. Patients were clinically safe to leave accompanied by a responsible adult within one hour of administration of the drug. Some patients showed an improvement in attitude towards dentistry following treatment.\n      </p>", "The physiological responses to intravenous diazepam and oral local analgesia for conservative dentistry have been assessed in 16 patients. Apart from a transient tachycardia during actual administration of the drug, no clinically significant changes occurred in the haemodynamic, respiratory, or metabolic status of the patients. In some patients there was a period of incompetence of the laryngeal closure reflex.\n      </p>", "Patient outcomes form one part of the classic triad used to define quality of care: structure, process, and outcome. Outcomes research in dentistry should focus on global questions such as: What difference does dental care make to a patient? Do patients derive perceptible benefits from their dental care? What dental treatments work the best? Like programs or other courses of action, treatment outcomes are considered on three levels: the policy level, which asks, \"Are we doing the right things for our target population, given our resources?\" program evaluation, in which specific program objectives are set in terms of achievement or maintenance of certain rates and measures; and the individual patient level, in which specific physiologic, psychological, and sociological measures are used to determine individual treatment outcomes. Each level of evaluation can use treatment outcomes or oral health status measures as evaluation criteria. Clinicians routinely face the challenge of providing \"appropriate\" care to older veterans-a concept that considers the accuracy of risk assessment and diagnosis as well as treatment outcomes (such as the relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of alternative treatment strategies, together with the short- and longer-term physiologic and psychological results). Outcomes research is even more challenging when considering its application in older populations whose physical, social, and psychological health are increasingly interrelated and variable with age. Thus, outcomes research, and particularly research on the appropriateness of care, must consider the values and preferences (utility) of those outcomes for older veterans and their families. Optimal oral health outcomes can be achieved through invigorated oral health services research to better understand patients' preferences related to dental treatment decisions, to define oral health outcomes incorporating these preferences, and to assess the effectiveness of the current dental delivery system and its various components, including the appropriate mix of dental providers and allied health personnel, emerging technologies, and innovative prevention and health promotion strategies. An administrative structure and incentives should be established to support dental health services and outcomes research withint the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). A dental service network with an oversight board could be established to evaluate issues related to treatment outcomes. Alternatively, a Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center devoted to the improvement of the quality of VA dental care and the oral health care delivery system could be established.\n      </p>", "The adequacy of serum bactericidal activity after oral amoxycillin given as prophylaxis against infective endocarditis was studied using a double blind randomised protocol in healthy volunteers having dentistry. One hour before their procedure 38 patients received 3 g amoxycillin syrup and 12 received matching placebo. Venous blood samples were drawn before and one and nine hours after dosing and serum amoxycillin concentrations determined using a standard bioassay. Samples containing amoxycillin had inhibitory titres measured against two reference isolates of viridans streptococci known to have caused infective endocarditis. The susceptibility to amoxycillin of one strain was high and the other low, respective minimal bactericidal and inhibitory concentrations being 0.08 and 0.04 \u03bcmol/l (0.03 and 0.015 \u03bcg/ml) and 2.74 and 1.37 \u03bcmol/l (1 and 0.5 \u03bcg/ml). Amoxycillin was detected in only post-treatment sample of patients given the active drug. There were no significant correlations between one or nine hour drug concentrations and age or physical characteristics, nor was there any relation to preceding food consumption. Correlations between drug concentrations at one and nine hours were weak (r=0.34; p&lt;0.05), but between corresponding drug concentrations and serum inhibitory titres there were consistent correlations (r=0.46-0.48; p&lt;0.005). Against the low susceptibility reference isolate bactericidal amoxycillin concentrations were encountered in only 20 of the 38 nine hour samples (95% confidence limits 34% and 66%). When repeat doses of amoxycillin are indicated after dentistry they should be given about four hours later, not eight hours later as commonly practised.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
