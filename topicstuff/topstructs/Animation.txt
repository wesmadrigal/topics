{"total_words": 905, "documents": ["This paper describes an interactive 3D animation approach that may help with the investigation, understanding and interpretation of results for a Visual Interactive Simulation (VIS) project. The method uses a graphics algorithm to draw on a computer screen `3D contour maps' which show the response of a simulation model to changes in its input parameters. A previous paper showed that it is possible for a neural network to learn the response of a simulation. This paper shows that the speed of response of a neural network can be exploited so that 3D animation sequences of the simulation's results can be produced. It is possible to rotate the `3D contour map', zoom, pan, or generally view the projection from different perspectives. Two example problems are described. The paper suggests that this approach can further improve the quality of VIS by being able to give comprehensive graphic 3D sensitivity analyses to the original problem under investigation.\n      </p>", "Reading cartoons and associated exhibition practices in the silent and early sound eras, this essay examines the expression of the black/white racial binary in American animation of the 1920s and 1930s. It treats cartoons as a case study in the visual representation of the intersection of spatial practice, aesthetics, and labor/management relations in the reorganization of the American film industry during the transition to sound film.\n      </p>", "This article describes the characteristics and values of hypermedia for learning chemistry. It reports how a hypermedia environment was used to explore a group of 11th grade chemistry students' conceptions of table salt dissolving in water. It then presents how the hypermedia was used by students to negotiate meaning for two conceptualizations about the process of dissolving table salt in water: (a) the transformation of solid to liquid, and (b) the chemical combination of solute and solvent. This article traces the nature of students' conceptions for the solution process of table salt. The findings of this study indicate that a hypermedia environment can be used to explore, negotiate, and assess students' conceptions of the submicroscopic aspects of solution chemistry. Further, this article discusses the successes and difficulties pertaining to the learning of solution chemistry in a hypermedia environment, and presents an account of an improved version for future study.\n      </p>", "The use of a Visual Interactive Simulation (VIS) model for experimental analysis, where the user initiates runs and gathers information as desired without necessarily any respect for formal analysis, is encouraged by some proponents of VIS and VIS software packages. Proponents of formal output analysis view this approach as dangerous and irresponsible. We designed and executed a laboratory experiment in which 51 subjects solved a case study based around the allocation of trucks in a mining operation in order to investigate the efficacy of VIS to model experimentation. Subjects were provided with a VIS, developed by the authors, which contained a terminating simulation of the system and two different displays: an animation and a dynamically changing histogram. The user could halt execution of the model and change the truck allocation at any time. We found that subjects performed badly relative to a known solution obtained through detailed formal experimentation but performed well compared to solutions they provided prior to use of the model. Use of the animated display was not associated with correct solutions but was associated with more efficient use of the VIS. Subjects who obtained a correct solution investigated fewer alternatives and used fewer interactions than those obtaining incorrect solutions. Finally, we found a significant difference in the process used between subjects providing correct and incorrect solutions.\n      </p>", "This paper examines aspects of industrial change in the post-fordist era. It begins with the observation that two trends are implicit in much of the reorganization being experienced: first toward product customization, and second toward new forms of artisanal labour processes. The exact nature of the outcomes of transformation processes is considered to be locally contingent, sectorally specific, and culturally inflected. As a case study, the computer animation industry in Toronto is used to illustrate how new forms of production have emerged in that place and sector. The results of in-depth interviews with a number of actors in this sector support the theoretical claims about customization and the labour process, and indeed appear to be linked to specific cultural and locational factors at the regional and micro levels. Der Beitrag untersucht Aspekte des post-fordistischen industriellen Wandels. Am Anfang steht die Beobachtung, da\u00df zwei Trends in vielen Bereichen der Reorganisation erkennbar sind, die wir zur Zeit erleben: zum einen der Trend zu einer Produktion, die f\u00fcr ganz unterschiedliche Kunden ma\u00dfgeschneidert ist, und zum anderen der Trend zu neuen Formen von handwerklich gepr\u00e4gten Arbeitsprozessen. Das Ergebnis dieser Transformationsprozesse wird als ortsabh\u00e4ngig, sektorspezifisch sowie kulturell beeinflu\u00dft beurteilt. Die Fallstudie der Computer-Animations-Branche in Toronto soll aufzeigen, wie genau an diesem Ort und in diesem Sektor die genannten neuen Produktionsformen entstanden sind. Die mit einer Reihe von Akteuren aus der Branche gef\u00fchrten vertiefenden Interviews st\u00fctzen die theoretischen \u00dcberlegungen zur kundenspezifischen Produktion und den neuen Arbeitsproze\u00df; die Resultate scheinen in der Tat an spezifische kulturelle und lokale Faktoren im regionalen und im Mikro-Ma\u00dfstab gekn\u00fcpft zu sein.\n      </p>", "While Winsor McCay was the pioneer of American animation, it was J. R. Bray who was the first to establish a true animated cartoon studio. His development of the process of cel animation created a rigid division of labor among animation workers, and served as a model for most other studios. While economically successful, this approach soon led the animated film to a marginal and highly conventionalized position within the motion picture industry.\n      </p>", "'Animation Rurale' or 'Animation au D\u00e9veloppement' has worked since 1963 within the framework of the 'Commissariat G\u00e9n\u00e9ral an D\u00e9veloppement' which was linked to the President of the Republic. The role of Animation has been to stimulate the participation of the rural communities in development activities as set out by the National Plan. In conformity with this role it should a) help the communities to organize themselves , contributing towards the set-up of effective structures in the rural world b) favour the dialogue between the population and the different Technical Services c) cooperate with all Services interfering in the rural world. The introduction of the development cooperatives and the principle of the integrated action should forward to highest efficiency and actually organize the cooperation and coordination between Services, especially Animation, UNCC, Agriculture. Yet, Animation has taken place in a peripheric formation which had besides others as essential characteristics: constitution of a local bourgeoisie following suit dominant foreign capital; tendency toward a bureaucratic development; specific characteristic of the phenomena of 'prol\u00e9tarisation'. Within these structures, the participation of the rural population has been catalysed by an authoritarian, ineffective, parasitic organization of power whose agents attached to privileges tried to hammer into people's head a mystic of progress and counted only on sacrifices by the administered subjects. The administrators, officials, politicians have become a political-administrative class, materially privileged, more or less cut off from the rural realities and with the principal worry to conserve their power and therefore to limit any conscientization of the rural population. The people who were asked to participate could not become the beneficiaries of the process. The structural and institutional impediments prevented the participation of the people in development, robbed them of their due and transferred the benefits to those who did not work for it in introducing thereby some type of a 'mechanical participation'. /// L'Animation Rurale ou l'Animation an D\u00e9veloppement a travaill\u00e9 depuis 1963 dans le cadre du Commissariat G\u00e9n\u00e9ral au D\u00e9veloppement, lui-m\u00eame rattach\u00e9 au Pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique. Le r\u00f4le de l'Animation \u00e9tait de susciter la participation des collectivit\u00e9s villageoises aux actions de d\u00e9veloppement retenues par la planification nationale. C'est pourquoi elle devrait a) aider les collectivit\u00e9s \u00e0 s'organiser, contribuant \u00e0 une v\u00e9ritable structuration du monde rural, b) favoriser le dialogue des populations avec les diff\u00e9rents Services Techniques, c) collaborer avec tous les Services intervenant dans le monde rural. L'introduction des coop\u00e9ratives de d\u00e9veloppement et du principe de l'action int\u00e9gr\u00e9e devrait pousser au maximum et organiser concr\u00e8tement la collaboration et la coordination entre services, notamment lAnimation, l'UNCC, l'Agriculture. Or, l'Animation s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e dans une formation p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique ayant entre autres comme caract\u00e8res essentiels: la constitution d'une bourgeoisie locale dans le sillage du capital \u00e9tranger dominant; la tendance \u00e0 un d\u00e9veloppement bureaucratique; le caract\u00e8re sp\u00e9cifique des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes de prol\u00e9tarisation. Dans ces structures, la participation des populations rurales \u00e9tait catalys\u00e9e par une organisation du pouvoir autoritaire, inefficace, parasitaire dont les agents attach\u00e9s \u00e0 des privil\u00e8ges essayaient d'inculquer une mystique du progr\u00e8s et n'escomptaient de sacrifices que de la part des administr\u00e9s. Les administrateurs, fonctionnaires, politiciens sont devenus une classe politico-administrative, mat\u00e9riellement privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e, plus ou moins coup\u00e9 des r\u00e9alit\u00e9s rurales et dont le souci principal \u00e9tait de conserver leur pouvoir et par l\u00e0 de limiter toute prise de conscience de la part de la population rurale. Ainsi la classe politico-administrative catalysait par l'organisation impos\u00e9e la participation des populations selon ses int\u00e9r\u00eats de classe. Les paysans invit\u00e9s \u00e0 la participation n'\u00e9taient pas les usufruitiers du proc\u00e8s de d\u00e9veloppement mais uniquement ses instruments.

With New Media techniques we are taking a big step forward in methods of presentation. Multimedia adds extra features like sound, animation, interactivity, and so on and enriches the teaching of natural sciences. Multimedia offers a means of freeing cartography from having to visualize topics in a strictly static way. It is now possible to show dynamic subjects in a dynamic (animated) manner not only on maps but also on globes. Presenting dynamic subjects in animated form gives the user more insight and a faster understanding of complex processes. By generating a digital model of the globe we can preserve the advantages and widely eliminate the disadvantages of traditional globes.

Current trends in computer animation have made successful and effective teamwork a necessity. To address these issues, the authors have developed an interdisciplinary computer animation course for artists and scientists, in which student teams produce a professional animation that extends the capabilities of a commercial animation package. A key component of this course is the use of collaborative teams that provide practical experience and cross-mixing of student expertise. Another key component is group-based education: the students learn from each other, as well as from the instructors.\n      </p>", "We develop uses for two recently proposed types of dynamic displays-rotation and animation-in regression diagnostics. Some of the general issues that we address by using these displays include checking for interactions and normality, assessing the need to transform the data, and adding predictors to a model. Animation is used in probability plotting and as an aid to understanding the effects of adding variables to a model. Rotation is used for threedimensional added-variable and residual plots, each of which may be effective for diagnosing the presence of an interaction.\n      </p>", "We present an active way to use a computer animation in secondary molecular genetics class. For this purpose we developed an activity booklet that helps students to work interactively with a computer animation which deals with abstract concepts and processes in molecular biology. The achievements of the experimental group were compared with those of a control group by means of a written questionnaire, which the students received right after the molecular genetics instruction. Analysis of the post-test showed that the mean score of the experimental group was significantly higher than the mean score of the control group. This positive trend was also reflected in personal interviews.\n      </p>", "Different visualization techniques have been used for teaching chemistry concepts. Previous studies have shown that when molecular animations and video demonstrations are used, students seem to better correlate all three levels of representation: macroscopic, submicroscopic, and symbolic. This thinking process allows the students to improve their conceptual understanding and ability to create dynamic mental models. In this study, general chemistry students viewed three experiments involving dynamic fluid equilibrium in a graphic design, a video demonstration, and a molecular animation. The study investigated whether video demonstrations or particulate animations helped the students' conceptual understanding, and if the order of visualizations (video or animation first) produced any differences. Students showed improvement after each visualization. Surprisingly, there was significant improvement in responses between the first and second visualization. This work shows the importance of combining both types of visualizations, but it does not indicate a preference toward a specific order.\n      </p>", "The study of multiple female mating preferences and multiple male signals requires correct and precise measurement of preferences. A review is given of existing preference test paradigms. Non-interactive preference tests using computer animations perfectly fulfil the demands for the study of multiple preferences for visual traits: exclusion of confounding variables, exclusion of variation within and between male pairs, great potential of experimental manipulation of single and combinations of visual traits including behaviour. We give a detailed description for the production of computer animation movies based on commercial software. Finally, we show how computer animations can be properly applied to the testing of mating preferences. In sticklebacks, female mating preferences that were tested in this way agreed with preferences that were measured with other test paradigms.\n      </p>", "The worlds of animation and anatomy have a long-standing connection based on both direct and indirect collaboration.

Across two experiments, video and animation groups reported more favorable attitudes towards learning and were better able to apply the learned principles than the control group. Text and control groups did not differ in their learning or attitudes towards learning, suggesting that format is an important factor in determining the effectiveness of classroom exemplars as pedagogical tools for teacher education.

In this review, we examine the role of animation in multimedia learning (including multimedia instructional messages and microworld games), present a cognitive theory of multimedia learning, and summarize our program of research, which has yielded seven principles for the use of animation in multimedia instruction. These include the multimedia principle (present animation and narration rather than narration alone), spatial contiguity principle (present on-screen text near rather than far from corresponding animation), temporal contiguity principle (present corresponding animation and narration simultaneously rather than successively), coherence principle (exclude extraneous words, sounds, and video), modality principle (present animation and narration rather than animation and on-screen text), redundancy principle (present animation and narration rather than animation, narration, and on-screen text), and personalization principle (present words in conversational rather than formal style). Animation can promote learner understanding when used in ways that are consistent with the cognitive theory of multimedia learning.\n      </p>", "Walt Disney's \"DUMBO\" (RKO, 1941) is shown to contain two disparate animation traditions operating simultaneously within the Disney studio. Sequences alternate between those presented in Disney's West Coast style, an expression of the classic Hollywood tradition, and an imported East Coast style, which emphasized artifice, nonlinear narrative, and \"rubbery\" graphics. Associated with such New York studios as Fleischer and Van Beuren, the East Coast Style in \"DUMBO\" is traced to the contributions of specific New York-trained animators, who were able to operate relatively freely due to Disney's own lack of involvement. The \"Pink Elephants\" sequence is analyzed as a major example of the East Coast influence in the film.\n      </p>", "Although the use of animated visuals is both common and popular among CBI designers, the theoretical and empirical foundations for their use have not been firmly established. Animated visuals represent a subset of instructional visuals; for this reason, general conclusions from research on static visuals are thought to extend to animated visuals. The extent to which animated visual research represents elaborations or departures from static visual research is questioned, however The purpose of this paper is to review current empirical evidence of the effectiveness of animated visuals in instruction. Tentative design recommendations resulting from this review are presented. Current applications of computer animations in instruction are discussed and a brief summary of static visuals research is also presented.\n      </p>", "The authors have turned the Zoetrope, initially an optical toy from the pre-cinema era, into a threedimensional (3D) animation display. \"Crystal Zoetrope\" is a new visual medium involving a glass disc with numerous engraved objects that displays a sophisticated 3D animation.

Both forms of instruction provided animated experiments and required students to predict outcomes, observe results, and explain their ideas. In addition, the reflective instruction diagnosed specific inconsistencies in student reasoning and encouraged students to reflect on these dilemmas as well as to construct general principles. We distinguished the impact of instruction on students who believed scientific phenomena are governed by principles (cohesive beliefs) versus students who believed that science is a collection of unrelated \"facts\" (dissociated beliefs). Students typically held multiple models of displacement, using different explanations depending on the form of assessment. For example, we found that 17% of these middle school students made accurate predictions about displacement experiments prior to instruction and 25% could construct an accurate general principle. However, only 12% consistently used the same explanation across assessments. After instruction, students were more accurate and more consistent: over 50% accurately predicted experimental outcomes, 79% gave an accurate general principle, and about 40% gave consistent responses. We found no advantages for enhanced animations over straightforward animated experiments. The reflective integration instruction led to more substantial long-term changes in student understanding than did spontaneous integration instruction. Furthermore, on a delayed posttest we found that students with cohesive beliefs not only sustained their understanding of displaced volume, but, when exposed to reflective integration instruction, actually continued to construct more predictive views following instruction. In contrast, students with dissociated beliefs made no long-term progress independent of the form of instruction.\n      </p>", "The Animation Tutor\u2122 is a curriculum project that uses software to supplement instruction in courses such as intermediate algebra. Its purpose is to ground mathematical reasoning in concrete experiences through the use of interactive animation and the virtual manipulation of objects. This article summarizes how the project has progressed from research to practice and back. The first section shows how research helped implement six instructional objectives: emphasize interactivity with reflection, integrate multiple representations, reduce cognitive load, facilitate transfer, replace ineffective static images with animated images, and provide domain-specific knowledge. The last section illustrates the reciprocal nature of research and practice by describing how formative evaluations of the Animation Tutor\u2122 program led to laboratory studies aimed at improving instructional materials and student strategies.\n      </p>", "Oxygen deprivation is a major cause of cellular damage and death. Here we demonstrate that Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, which can survive both in anoxia (&lt;0.001 kPa O2) by entering into suspended animation and in mild hypoxia (0.25-1 kPa O2) through a hypoxia-inducible factor 1-mediated response, cannot survive in intermediate concentrations of oxygen, between 0.01 and 0.1 kPa O2. Moreover, we show that carbon monoxide can protect C. elegans embryos against hypoxic damage in this sensitive range. Carbon monoxide can also rescue the hypoxia-sensitive mutant hif-1(ia04) from lethality in hypoxia. This work defines the oxygen tensions over which hypoxic damage occurs in C. elegans embryos and demonstrates that carbon monoxide can prevent this damage by inducing suspended animation.\n      </p>", "High-performance interaction with scatterplot matrices is a powerful approach to exploratory multivariate data analysis. For a small number of data points, real-time interaction is possible and overplotting is usually not a major problem. When the number of plotted points is large, however, display techniques that deal with overplotting and slow production are important. This article addresses these two problems. Topics include density representation by gray scale or by symbol area, alternatives to brushing, and animation sequences. We also discuss techniques that are generally applicable, including interactive graphical subset selection from any plot in a collection of scatterplots and comparison of scatterplot matrices.\n      </p>", "Although animated maps are widely promoted as ideal vehicles for learning and scientific discovery, there has been little empirical work that demonstrates their relative effectiveness in relation to static small-multiple alternatives. In this article, we attempt to clarify the issues related to the potential of animation from an explicitly geographic perspective, but one that is also grounded in broader cognitive science and human-computer interaction considerations. We compared the effectiveness of animated with static small-multiple maps, specifically in relation to map readers' ability to identify clusters that move over space and through time. In this study, we focused on several factors that might impact (or help explain) map readers' ability to correctly identify clusters. These factors included animation pace, cluster coherence, and gender. We found that map readers answer more quickly and identify more patterns correctly when using animated maps than when using static small-multiple maps. We also found that pace and cluster coherence interact so that different paces are more effective for identifying certain types of clusters (none vs. subtle vs. strong), and that there are some gender differences in the animated condition. This study is one of a small number of controlled experiments directed to the relative advantages of animated and static small-multiple maps. It provides the basis for further research that is needed to better understand the cognitive load involved in reading animated maps, to better describe and understand gender differences, and to investigate the efficacy of animated maps for other types of map reading tasks.\n      </p>", "Avec les rapides avanc\u00e9es technologiques de la derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cennie, les nouvelles formes de visualisation avanc\u00e9e, comme la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle ou l'animation, ont prolif\u00e9r\u00e9.

Deux types de recherches sont rapport\u00e9es: 12 recherches exp\u00e9rimentales, comparant une interface statique et une interface anim\u00e9e dans des conditions contr\u00f4l\u00e9es, et 5 recherches de terrain, en milieu scolaire, comparant l'utilisation d'une interface anim\u00e9e \u00e0 un cours traditionnel (en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pour la phase d'exercices). En termes de performance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, parmi les 12 recherches qui comparent interface statique et interface anim\u00e9e, sept \u00e9tudes rapportent un effet positif de l'animation sur les performances (en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, temps et exactitude dans des t\u00e2ches qui suivent l'observation du dispositif). Les cinq \u00e9tudes restantes ne trouvent aucune diff\u00e9rence entre les deux types de dispositifs.

Pour conclure, cette synth\u00e8se souligne le manque de recherches de fond sur l'animation qui ne seraient pas dirig\u00e9es par l'intuition mais par une r\u00e9flexion sur les processus cognitif s que l'animation est suppos\u00e9e am\u00e9liorer. N\u00e9anmoins, deux principes de conception se d\u00e9gagent de ces recherches: 1/ le principe de concision, selon lequel l'information doit \u00eatre transmise de la fa\u00e7on la plus claire et simple possible; 2/ le principe de correspondance conceptuelle, selon lequel l'animation doit \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e uniquement lorsque le contenu \u00e0 transmettre implique un changement dans le temps. Advanced graphical visualizations, such as virtual reality and animation are at the forefront of technological development. Despite claims that much can be gained from interacting with animation, researchers did not consistently demonstrate cognitive benefits. In this paper, we review research on effects in computer animation in several domains, including education, human-computer interaction and psychology. No clear cut evidence emerges either to support or to invalidate the utility of animation at the work place. Instead, animation seems to be effective when a) dynamic information is to be conveyed and b) the animation conveys that information clearly and simply.\n      </p>", "Early film animation by Blackton, Cohl, McCay, and others, was a labor-intensive process which required that each individual frame always be drawn in full. John Randolph Bray and Earl Hurd developed methods of separating those elements which required animation effects from other portions of the image which could remain static. Using these patented processes, animation studios could now mass produce films which previously had required inefficient amounts of time and labor. From 1914, the bulk of America's animation industry operated under licenses issued by the Bray-Hurd Process Company.

Applications include the recording of choreographic works, an aid for teachers of classical ballet, and a source for the study of human movement.\n      </p>", "The effects of media and data properties on different methods of cartographic animation are unclear. This is due partially to the focus of previous research as well as the general lack of a conceptual framework for animation. Many researchers have discussed methods of visualizing 3-D and 4-D spatial data through cartographic animations but have not sufficiently identified the effects that visualization methods and data properties exert on the resulting products. Some results support the use of animations; others are inconclusive or unsupportive. Modality effects do not necessarily function as the primary mediator. As a result, media comparisons alone are not fully informative as so many other factors affect spatial data visualization \"effectiveness.\" The research presented here is not just media comparison research, although two types of media are included: animation and static representations. This research is grounded in the developing conceptual framework of animation, which includes typologies of animation based on construction and delivery and on data properties (location, time, and attribute). The investigation focused on identifying the potential impact of data properties on subject responses and learning from different visualization methods. The results partially support the conceptual congruence hypothesis that dynamic data are more effectively displayed through dynamic media. However, the results also indicate that the data properties exert their own influence and that influence may be mediated, but not dependent, on the visualization method. Moreover, results support the developing conceptual framework and typology of animation that includes categorization of animation based on data properties or dimensions (location, time, attribute) and their dynamic or static nature. /// \u5a92\u4f53\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5236\u56fe\u52a8\u753b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e. \u90e8\u5206\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814 \u7a76\u6ca1\u6709\u5c06\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u70b9. \u52a8\u753b\u7814\u7a76\u666e\u904d\u4e0a\u4e5f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6. \u8bb8\u591a\u5b66\u8005\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5236\u56fe\u52a8\u753b\u5c06\u4e09\u7ef4\u548c\u56db\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e \u53ef\u89c6\u5316, \u7136\u800c\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u5145\u5206\u6307\u51fa\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6027\u8d28\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u7531\u6b64\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1. \u4e00\u4e9b\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u652f \u6301\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u753b; \u5176\u4f59\u7684\u672a\u8fbe\u5230\u7ed3\u8bba\u6216\u8868\u793a\u53cd\u5bf9. \u6a21\u5f0f\u6548\u679c\u5e76 \u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u8c03\u505c\u8005. \u5355\u662f\u6bd4\u8f83\u5a92\u4f53\u5e76\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f, \u56e0\u4e3a\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u5176\u4ed6\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7684 \"\u6709\u6548\u6027.\" \u867d\u7136\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u5305 \u62ec\u4e24\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5a92\u4f53\u7684\u7814\u7a76 (\u52a8\u753b\u548c\u9759\u6001\u7684\u7533\u8ff0), \u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u5448\u73b0\u7684\u5e76\u4e0d\u53ea\u662f\u5a92\u4f53\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83. \u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u662f\u5960\u57fa \u4e8e\u8fd8\u5728\u53d1\u5c55\u5f53\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8 \u753b\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6, \u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u62ec\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u8bbe, \u5448\u73b0\u65b9\u5f0f\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5c5e\u6027 (\u5730\u70b9, \u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5c5e\u6027) \u7684\u52a8\u753b\u7c7b\u578b. \u8c03\u67e5\u91cd\u70b9\u662f\u67e5\u660e\u6570\u636e\u5c5e\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u6b63\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u53cd\u5e94, \u4ee5\u53ca\u4ece\u5404\u79cd\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u6548. \u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u90e8\u5206\u652f\u6301\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u5047\u8bbe, \u5373\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5a92\u4f53\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u6765. \u4e0d\u8fc7, \u7ed3\u679c\u8fd8\u8868 \u660e, \u6570\u636e\u6027\u8d28\u80fd\u591f\u53d1\u6325\u81ea\u5df2\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u529b, \u800c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u4ecb\u5bfc (\u4f46\u4e0d\u51b3\u5b9a) \u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u529b. \u6b64\u5916, \u7814\u7a76\u7ed3 \u679c\u652f\u6301\u6b63\u5728\u53d1\u5c55\u5f53\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u753b\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6, \u5305\u62ec\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u5c5e\u6027\u6216\u7ef4\u6570 (\u5730\u70b9, \u65f6\u95f4, \u5c5e\u6027) \u548c\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6216 \u9759\u6001\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u4f5c\u5206\u7c7b. /// Los efectos de las propiedades de los medios y los datos en los diferentes m\u00e9todos de animaci\u00f3n cartogr\u00e1fica son poco claros.

Shiryaev's films, amateur productions created with consumer-grade 17.5 and 35 mm equipment, were unknown to history until their chance rediscovery many years after his death.

During anoxia-induced suspended animation, embryos lacking functional SAN-1 or a second spindle checkpoint component, MDF-2, failed to arrest the cell cycle, exhibited chromosome missegregation, and showed reduced viability.

In polyphony, different voices jointly construct a melody (story or solution) enabling other voices to adopt differential positions and to identify dissonances (unsound, rickety stories or solutions). The proposed theory starts from ideas of Mikhail Bakhtin, and identifies in chats several classes of patterns of inter-animation along longitudinal and transversal dimensions, similarly to musical polyphonic contrapunctus. The article also describes implemented software tools, which facilitate the visualization of the threads in a chat and the influence that an utterance has on the subsequent ones. Such tools help both teachers and learners to evaluate and enhance the learning process.

By setting the formal vocabulary of 'abstract' painting into cinematic motion, the form finds itself in a functional dilemma. On the one hand, the spatial ambiguities offered by 'abstract' images go far in compensating for painting's lack of movement, and thus there is no need to add the kinetics of cinema. On the other hand, cinema technically allows images to move, and so the compensation offered by 'abstraction' becomes inoperable. However, the fact remains that certain 'abstract' animations offer a unique expression through which the viewer can visually experience a non-measurable, non-causal and non-sequential sense of time duration. In the article this quality is termed 'temporal ambiguity'. How this expression occurs in animations such as Harry Smith's 'Early Abstraction No. 3', Werner Graeffs 'Film Partitur (Composition I/22)' and Jules Engel's 'Train Landscape' is described. Animations by Oskar Fischinger, Douglass Crockwell and Dwinelle Grant are also discussed.\n      </p>", "This study investigated the effect of jigsaw cooperative learning and animation versus traditional teaching methods on students' understanding of electrochemistry in a first-year general chemistry course.

Students participating in the jigsaw group were divided into five \"home groups\" since the topic electrochemistry is divided into five subtopics. Each of these home groups contained four students. The groups were as follows: (1) Home Group A (HGA), representing the fundamental concepts of electrochemistry, (2) Home Group B (HGB), representing the electrochemical cell and energy source, (3) Home Group C (HGC), representing electrolysis, (4) Home Group D (HGD), representing Faraday's laws, and (5) Home Group E (HGE), representing corrosion. The home groups broke apart, like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, and the students moved into jigsaw groups consisting of members from the other home groups, who were each assigned a subtopic. For students in the animation group, their lesson focused on explaining the step-by-step process of electrochemistry through a computer-animated presentation.

While it is true that the shape-shifting powers of the oni made it possible for them to take on human form, their gruesome appearance would reflect their evil dispositions. The oni were often depicted with one or more horns atop their heads, wearing only a loincloth of tiger skin, and a toothy grimace that stretched from ear to ear. The oni were also feared because of their penchant for human flesh. Popular modern day literary treatments of the oni reveal several new renderings of this demon. Today's oni are much more eclectic in appearance and demeanor than their ancestral cousins. Some modern renderings even depict the oni as benign and, at times, benevolent beings. Although they are still shape shifters, today's oni sometimes assume the form of an alluring human female, exuding sexuality, sensuality, and a child-like naughtiness that is altogether absent in older mytho-historical and literary treatments. There is no doubt this change in the oni has been at least partially brought on by commercial interests imposed on writers and artists in the modern age. Moreover, the oni's transformation is reflective of Japan's own socio-economic transmutation into one of the major industrialized nations of the world. This article delineates the oni's transformation.\n      </p>", "Composing with timbres involves an approach that is very different from the usual way of conceiving traditional Western music. In fact, it is problematic to attempt to organize timbres according to traditional principles. The author believes that if it is possible to establish links between audio and video events, then it is both possible to use the visual language to organize a music composition and possible to create abstract visual objects that correspond to synthetic sounds, consequently having a biunivocal link between audio and video events. The relationships between abstract animation and synthetic sounds are investigated in light of the correspondences between sound timbres and visual shapes, between perceived audio and video spatial locations and between perceived audio and video intensities.

An experiment was designed to address this issue by focusing specifically on the physiological and psychological effects of animation speeds in Web ads. Hypotheses derived from motion effects, excitation transfer, limited capacity, and vividness effects theories were tested via a mixed-design experiment wherein participants (N = 47) were exposed to both slow-paced and fast-paced animated ads in one of two sequences (fast then slow, or slow then fast).

A schematic view shows animating agents proposing an educative process to the animated receptive group. According to some authors, animating is a particular form of education directly related to the setting up of new structures in rural development, in which are involved various components, either social, directing, or rural. Rural animation tends towards responsibility being decentralized at village or group level, which are given the necessary means to express their own requirements and outline a preliminary professional organization. Owing to resistance to change generally observed in rural communities, animation has known but limited results. It has also been shown that inserting a small animating group in the village community may take many years, even if there is general agreement of the group itself. The study of rural animation experienced in various African countries \u2014 such as Mali, Tanzania, Benin \u2014 tends to formulate as follows the successive steps to be taken : define permanent points of concern ; seek means to reach proposed goals, without judicial statement and with as little exterior aid as possible ; preliminary educative formation to be given to all individuals concerned ; general information for the whole rural community, so that the small animating group is not rejected ; action surveyed during a sufficient period ; new points of concern to be introduced when the former have been stabilized ; after several years of the action engaged, formulation of a legal statute on general matters. Such a proposition can only be of experimental character, as no definite achievement has yet been observed in rural animation.\n      </p>", "Disney did not have a monopoly on using animated folklore films for marketing purposes. During the heyday of Soviet animation in the 1970s and 1980s, cartoons that seemed to follow folktales were altered slightly to convey messages in keeping with Soviet ideology. They not only criticized capitalism, but also depicted women as sexless and selfsacrificing, and urged cooperation, neighborliness, and non violence. National minorities within the Soviet Union were portrayed as backward and in need of the guidance of Russia, the leading Soviet republic. Ukrainians, for example, were shown as cute and quaint, living in a bucolic land. Colorful clothing and tasty foods were attributed to them, as well as the ability to sing and dance. However, they were also seen as a people who believed in spirits and did not un derstand modern life. The fall of the Soviet Union and Ukrainian independence have not changed the situation, at least when it comes to animation produced in Russia. Folklore films still show Ukrainians as bucolic and musical. Women still sacrifice for the sake of others.

He also explains how the images were born and shaped by the process of form building in his animation process.\n      </p>", "The proliferation of information on the Internet poses a significant challenge on humans' limited attentional resources. To attract online users' attention, various kinds of animation are widely used on websites. Despite the ubiquitous use of animation, there is an inadequate understanding of its effect on attention. Focusing on flash animation, this study examines its effects on online users' performance and perceptions in both taskrelevant and task-irrelevant information search contexts by drawing on the visual search literature and two theories from cognitive psychology. In the task-relevant context, flash is applied on the search target; while in the task-irrelevant context, flash is applied on a nontarget item. The results of this study confirm that flash does attract users' attention and facilitates quicker location of the flashed target item in tightly packed screen displays. However, there is no evidence that attracting attention increases recall of the flashed item, as is generally presumed in practice, and may even decrease the overall recall. One explanation is that when users have to use their limited attentional resources on suppressing the distraction of flash, they will have less mental resources to process information. Moreover, the results suggest that processing information about an item depends not only on the attention it attracts per se, but also on the attention that other items on the same screen attract. While flashing an item may not increase the recall of that item, it can reduce the recall of other items (especially the nontarget items) on the screen. Finally, flash has negative effects on users' focused attention and attitude towards using the website. These results have implications for website interface design, online product promotion, online advertising, and multimedia training systems, among others.\n      </p>", "The effects of two computer-based instructional strategies--visual display and feedback type-were investigated in the acquisition of electronic troubleshooting skills. Animation was used to simulate the functional behaviors of electronic circuits and to demonstrate the troubleshooting procedures. The first hypothesis tested was that animated visual displays would be more effective than static visual displays if animation was selectively used to support the specific learning requirements of a given task. Results supported this hypothesis by showing that college students in the animated visual display condition needed significantly fewer trials than those in the static visual display condition. The second hypothesis was that the effectiveness of intentionally mediated feedback (knowledge of results or explanatory information) would be minimal if natural feedback-the system's automatic functional reaction to external inputs-was available and the subject had the basic knowledge needed to understand the system functions. The results supported this hypothesis. Overall, this study implies that instructional strategies, including visual displays and feedback, should be applied selectively based on the specific learning requirements of a given task.\n      </p>", "The author proposes a synthesis of theories of perception, image analysis and computer graphics as a foundation for the further development of realistic computer animation based on the point of view of the observer of the simulated world rather than on analysis of the physics of the simulation. Various aspects of perspective are explored, and the author shows how projection on a flat plane can fail to account for our intuitive expectation of how appearances change with distance. He also derives a way of describing truly moving pictures, i.e. those that are not created through a sequence of still frames.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "In this paper we propose a study of co-verbal gesture expressivity during a conversational interaction.

We found that embryos of the zebrafish Danio rerio can survive for 24 h in the absence of oxygen (anoxia, 0% O2). In anoxia, zebrafish entered a state of suspended animation where all microscopically observable movement ceased, including cell division, developmental progression, and motility. Animals that had developed a heartbeat before anoxic exposure showed no evidence of a heartbeat until return to terrestrial atmosphere (normoxia, 20.8% O2). In analyzing cell-cycle changes of rapidly dividing blastomeres exposed to anoxia, we found that no cells arrested in mitosis. This is in sharp contrast to similarly staged normoxic embryos that consistently contain more than 15% of cells in mitosis. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that blastomeres arrested during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. This work indicates that survival of oxygen deprivation in vertebrates involves the reduction of diverse processes, such as cardiac function and cell-cycle progression, thus allowing energy supply to be matched by energy demands.\n      </p>", "The animated interludes in the film \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" demonstrate director and animator Terry Gilliam's interest in and use of images in the margins of Gothic manuscripts.\n      </p>", "Ernst Mayr used the geography of closely related species in various stages of increasing divergence to \"animate\" the process of geographic, or allopatric, speciation. This approach was applied to a wide set of taxa, and a seminal paper by Mayr used it to explore speciation patterns in tropical sea urchins. Since then, taxonomic information in several of these genera has been augmented by detailed molecular phylogenies. We compare Mayr's animation with the phylogenies of eight sea urchin genera placed by Mayr into four speciation groups. True to Mayr's predictions, early-stage genera have on average lower species divergence and more polytypic species than genera in later stages. For six of these genera, we also have information about the evolution of the gamete recognition protein bindin, which is critical to reproductive isolation. These comparisons show that later-stage genera with many sympatric species tend to be those with rapid bindin evolution. By contrast, early-stage genera with few sympatric species are not necessarily earlier in the divergence process; they happen to be those with slow rates of bindin evolution. These results show that the rate of speciation in sea urchins does not only depend on the steady accumulation of genome divergence over time, but also on the rate of evolution of gamete recognition proteins. The animation method used by Mayr is generally supported by molecular phylogenies. However, the existence of multiple rates in the acquisition of reproductive isolation complicates placement of different genera in an evolutionary series.\n      </p>", "For over forty years, Henry Jamison Handy (1886\u20131983) operated one of the leading industrial film studios in the United States, the Jam Handy Organization. Based in Detroit, Handy's studio was conveniently located in America's industrial heartland, and produced hundreds of advertising, training, and informational films for National Cash Register, General Motors, RCA, and other growing industries looking to take advantage of business opportunities afforded by the new media.

The method works by selecting a few similar motions from a database and then averaging them. An appropriate parameterization is developed for representing the motions composed of the trajectories of the endpoints such as the hands and stretch pivot coordinates to represent the interior joints such as the shoulders or knees. Within this representation, local averaging may sensibly occur while preserving specified constraints like the length of the body segments and final location of the endpoints. A nearest neighbor regression like method is developed and a cross-validation procedure implemented for selecting the best number of neighbors and appropriate notions of similarity in the motions selected for averaging. The methodology is illustrated with the development of a prediction model for two-handed standing lifts with applications to ergonomics.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Mathematical homotopies, metamorphosis and computer animation provide excellent avenues for the creation of innovative, phantasmagoric art forms.
