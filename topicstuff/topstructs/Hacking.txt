{"total_words": 389, "documents": ["This paper examines the benefits and obstacles to young people's open-ended and unrestricted access to technological environments. While children and youth are frequently seen as threatened or threatening in this realm, their playful engagements suggest that they are self-possessed social actors, able to negotiate most of its challenges effectively. Whether it is proprietary software, the business practices of some technology providers, or the separation of play, work, and learning in most classrooms, the spatial-temporality of young people's access to and use of technology is often configured to restrict their freedom of choice and behavior. We focus on these issues through the lens of technological interactions known as \u201chacking,\u201d wherein people playfully engage computer technologies for the intrinsic pleasure of seeing what they can do. We argue for an approach to technology that welcomes rather than constrains young people's explorations, suggesting that it will not only help them to better understand and manage their technological environments, but also foster their critical capacities and creativity.\n      </p>", "As part of a program to recover the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) in the southeastern United States, we assessed procedural and demographic influences on hacking success by evaluating inherent variation and incorporating controlled manipulation in hacking protocol. We examined release age and date, release cohort size and sex ratio, postfledging area occupancy, and feeding regimen. Fourteen peregrines dispersed successfully, 9 dispersed prematurely, and 5 died before dispersal. Generally, these variables were poor predictors of success with release age (t = -1.29, P = 0.25) and feeding regimen ( $\\chi ^{2}=1.32$ , P = 0.25) showing only weak associations with success. Sex interacted predictably with release age and postfledging area occupancy to influence success; males were more successful when released younger (\u00b1 SD days = 45.4 \u00b1 2.8 [successful]) and 47.1 \u00b1 5.0 [unsuccessful]) onto a postfledging area occupied by few conspecifics (\u00b1 SD number of peregrines = 0.3 \u00b1 0.4 [successful] and 1.3 \u00b1 1.3 [unsuccessful]), whereas females were more successful when released older (47.0 \u00b1 1.8 [successful] and 44.5 \u00b1 0.7 [unsuccessful]) and were unaffected by postfledging area occupancy (0.9 \u00b1 0.8 [successful] and 1.0 \u00b1 1.4 [unsuccessful]). These results added substantiation to the perception of hacking as a procedurally sound tool in the release of captive-reared peregrines and highlighted some alternate considerations on feeding regimen and release-cohort sex ratio in raptor hacking.\n      </p>", "'Human kind' is a term introduced by Ian Hacking to refer to the kinds of people-child abusers, pregnant teenagers, the unemployed-studied by the human sciences. Hacking argues that classifying and describing human kinds results in feedback, which alters the very kinds under study. This feedback results in human kinds having histories totally unlike those of natural kinds (such as gold, electrons and tigers), leading Hacking to conclude that human kinds are radically unlike natural kinds. Here I argue that Hacking's argument fails and that he has not demonstrated that human kinds cannot be natural kinds.\n      </p>", "Fisher's theory of fiducial inference is known to lead to mathematical inconsistencies. Hacking (1965) puts forward a new basis for fiducial inference. In this paper we have presented Hacking's theory retaining his original terminology but replacing his notation by more usual mathematical notation. His condition of irrelevance is derived in an explicit mathematical form, making it more comprehensible to statisticians. Further an example is constructed to show that Hacking's theory also leads to mathematical inconsistencies. /// Il est bien connu que de la th\u00e9orie de Fisher sur l'inf\u00e9rence fiduciaire r\u00e9sultent des incoh\u00e9rences math\u00e9matiques.

The thesis of the \"theory ladenness\" of observation leads to an antinomy. In order to solve this antinomy a technical operationalism is sketched, according to which theories should in principle not contain anything that cannot be reduced to technical procedures. This implies the rejection of Quine's underdeterminacy thesis and of many views about the theoretical-observational distinction, e.g. neopositivistic views, van Fraassen's view, Sneed-Stegm\u00fcller's view. Then I argue for the following theses: 1. All scientific concepts are theory laden in the sense that they allow us to anticipate possible experiences, but they have to be in principle fully observable, i.e. integrally convertible into operational-technical applications. 2. The observation/theory distinction can be maintained as a historical one: what is observable depends on the instruments that are available at any stage of the development of science. 3. In principle theoretical entities are empirically real in Hacking's sense. However, some aspects of Hacking's realism are to be criticized. Theoretical entities are to be resolved into the totality of the interrelated properties accessible to us by means of theoretical points of view embodied in scientific instruments.\n      </p>", "As Laudan and Fine show, and Boyd concedes, the attempt to infer the truth of scientific realism from the fact that it putatively provides the best explanation of the instrumental success of science is circular, since what is to be shown is precisely the legitimacy of such abductive inferences. Hacking's \"experimental argument for scientific realism about entities\" is one of the few arguments for scientific realism that purports to avoid this circularity. We argue that Hacking's argument is as dependent on inference to the best explanation (IBE), and therefore as weak, as the other realist arguments.\n      </p>", "For Hacking, the word \"real\", like the sexist expression \"wear the trousers\", takes its meaning from its negative uses. In this essay, I criticize Hacking's reasons for believing that the objects of study of the social sciences are not real. First I argue that the realism issue in the social sciences concerns not unobservable entities but systems of social classification. I then argue that Hacking's social science nominalism derives from his considering social groups in isolation from the entire social system. I conclude that the objects of study of the social sciences do not relegate them to an inferior status.\n      </p>", "Hacking argues against van Fraassen's constructive empiricism by appeal to features of microscopic imaging. Hacking relies on both our practices involving imaging instruments and the structure of the images produced by these micropractices. Van Fraassen's reply is formally correct yet fundamentally unsatisfying. I aim to strengthen van Fraassen's reply, but must then extend constructive empiricism, specifically the central notion of \"theoretical immersion.\" I argue that immersion is more analogous to entering a virtual reality than to learning a language. This metaphor assimilates instrument-based practice as well as theoretical debate and explanation, and can provide an anti-realist view of our micro-practices consonant with constructive empiricism.\n      </p>", "This paper discusses an argument for scientific realism put forward by Anthony Quinton in The Nature of Things. The argument - here called the controlled continuity argument - seems to have received no attention in the literature, apparently because it may easily be mistaken for a better-known argument, Grover Maxwell's \"argument from the continuum\". It is argued here that, in point of fact, the two are quite distinct and that Quinton's argument has several advantages over Maxwell's. The controlled continuity argument is also compared to Ian Hacking's \"argument from coincidence\". It is pointed out that both arguments are to a large extent independent from considerations about high-level scientific theories, and that both are abductive arguments at the core. But these similarities do not dilute an important difference related to the fact that Quinton's argument cleverly seeks to anchor belief in unobservable entities in realism about ordinary objects, which is a position shared by most contemporary scientific anti-realists.\n      </p>", "Representing and Reconstructing: A Hermeneutical Reply to Ian Hacking. Hacking published in 1983 Representing and Intervening, which has provoked, particularly in the US, the so called realism/anti-realism debate which is still alive today. He lays claim to anti-realism for theory and to realism for the experiment. Following him, only that which can be used for manipulating something (e.g., the path of an electon) is realistic. H. Putnam is a severe critic of this dualism. In my paper I am going to take the Hacking-Putnam controversy as a starting-point for the problem about the determination of the relation between theory and experiment in the natural sciences. I shall then follow M. Schlick's discussion of this problem and the current solution to the problem as offered by H. Pietschmann. The differing interpretation of Kant according to the three perspectives shall be the guideline for the argumentation. The goal of my argumentation is that theory and experiment do not live their own lives, that in experimenting one always continues traditional chains of action, and that natural science cannot be regarded independently of the life world it takes place in. This insight into the representing and reconstructing overturns in natural science, due to the necessity of human decisions, opens up their hermeneutical dimension.\n      </p>", "This paper examines Ian Hacking's arguments in favor of entity realism. It shows that his examples from science do not support his realism. Furthermore, his proposed criterion of experimental use is neither sufficient nor necessary for conferring a privileged status on his preferred unobservables. Nonetheless his insight is genuine; it may be most profitably seen as part of a more general effort to create a space for a new form of scientific and philosophical certainty, one that does not require foundations.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Ian Hacking interprets the creation of new phenomena in science very differently, arguing that it can seen as an argument for scientific realism.

Thus, we compared dispersal time and age, habitat use, site tenacity, sightings, and returns for captive- (n = 12) and wild-reared (n = 10) bald eagles after release and fledging from a hacking tower in northeastern Alabama. Captive- (92.2%) and wild-reared (92.5%) bald eagles were radio-located (n = 549) in predominately forest/wetland edges. Eagles moved 0.8-1.3 km away from the release tower during the first week. Captive-reared bald eagles returned closer (P &lt; 0.01) to the tower during the second and third weeks after release than wild-reared birds. By the fifth week after release, both groups moved away from the tower. Weekly dispersal rates were similar between groups except during the second week after release when 5 of 10 wild-reared eagles left the area (&gt;25 km). A higher rate of return (P &lt; 0.05) to the tower, a longer time (P &lt; 0.05) in the hacking tower after release and before fledging, and a larger number of locations on or near the tower (61.6% vs. 31.9%, P &lt; 0.01) after release for captive-reared eagles suggests they had stronger site tenacity (imprinting) to the hacking tower. Captive-reared eagles also dispersed at the same age as eagles raised at wild nests. Our data suggest that release of captive-reared eagles raised without adult eagles is appropriate when translocation of young birds is not feasible or biologically sound.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Ce clivage au sein du discours philosophique s'est grandement estomp\u00e9 de nos jours. D'une part, Kuhn a d\u00e9fendu la pertinence philosophique de l'histoire des sciences. D'autre part, Vuillemin et Gilles-Gaston Granger ont promu l'\u00e9tude de la philosophie analytique et l'emploi de ses techniques logiques.

For over half a century the continental tradition favored a historical method in philosophy of science, while the Anglo-American tradition promoted a logical method. In recent years this contrast has tended to lessen. On the one hand, there has been a growing interest since the 1970s in France for the analytic tradition, due to the pioneering studies of Vuillemin and Gilles-Gaston Granger. On the other hand, Kuhn has brought out the philosophical relevance of history of science. This tendency takes a new turn in Feyerabend's final texts as well as in the works of Ian Hacking. The latter deliberately combines the historical instruments of the French school with the logical techniques of the North-American school. How to understand this evolution ? What directions of research does it open up ? I address these questions by way of a comparative study of some recent developments in philosophy of science both in France and North America.\n      </p>", "Macrofaunal communities of beaches in eastern Australia were investigated for relationships of species number, abundance, and biomass with the physical characteristics of the beach environment (expressed numerically as the dimensionless fall velocity and beach state index [BSI]). A range of physical beach states across three biogeographical regions was sampled for macrofauna at low tide during summer months, and the data were regressed and compared. Results showed that species number, abundance, and biomass increased from reflective to ultradissipative shore conditions (abundance and biomass increasing logarithmically). Species number showed the same numerical relationship with BSI for each of the regions studied, the common regression equation showing that nearly 90% of variation in macrofaunal species number between beaches can be explained by this compound index of physical parameters. Abundance and biomass showed similarities in response to BSI, although at different orders of magnitude by region. The results of a multiple regression including latitude suggest that, although species richness is almost directly related to physical beach processes, abundance and biomass are determined more by a combination of surf zone processes and climatic factors specific to each biogeographic region.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

It was federally listed as endangered in 1986. The Peregrine Fund established a captive breeding program based on 25 nestlings obtained from eastern Mexico during 1977-1988. Following a pilot release project in 1985-1989, a full-scale release effort in the southern Texas plain began in 1993 employing techniques similar to those we developed for the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus). We produced 923 fledgling aplomado falcons, of which 812 were released in Texas on both federal wildlife refuges and private property. We observed released falcons breeding in the wild for the first time in 1995, and by 2002, 37 pairs were known and at least 87 wild young had fledged over an 8-year period. Predation by raccoons (Procyon lotor) was a frequent cause of nest failure, and the great horned owl (Bubo virginianus) was the principal source of death in fledglings at hack sites, a factor that may limit aplomado falcon recovery in some areas of its former range.

I highlight how developers concurrently tinker with technology and the law using similar skills, which transform and consolidate ethical precepts among developers. I contrast this legal pedagogy with more extraordinary legal battles over intellectual property, speech, and software. I concentrate on the arrests of two programmers, Jon Johansen and Dmitry Sklyarov, and on the protests they provoked, which unfolded between 1999 and 2003.

They publicized the challenge that F/OSS represents to the dominant regime of intellectual property (and clarified the democratic stakes involved) and also stabilized a rival liberal legal regime intimately connecting source code to speech.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

They are creating the language in which to describe the experience of autism, and hence helping to forge the concepts in which to think autism. This paper focuses on a series of autobiographies that began with Grandin's Emergence. These are often said to show us autism from the 'inside'. The paper proposes that instead they are developing ways to describe experience for which there is little preexisting language. Wittgenstein has many well-known aphorisms about how we understand other people directly, without inference. They condense what he had found in Wolfgang K\u00f6hler's Gestalt Psychology. These phenomena of direct understanding what other people are doing are, K\u00f6hler wrote, 'the common property and practice of mankind'. They are not the common property and practice of people with autism. Ordinary language is rich in age-old ways to describe what others are thinking, feeling and so forth. K\u00f6hler's phenomena are the bedrock on which such language rests. There is no such discourse for autism, because K\u00f6hler's phenomena are absent. But a new discourse is being made up right now, i. e. ways of talking for which the autobiographies serve as working prototypes.\n      </p>", "Animal liberationists have increased our moral concern for animals, to the extent that many now think that animals have rights. I am very cautious about the arguments of these philosophers, although I agree with many of their precepts. In this respect, I am aligned with the powerful essays of Cora Diamond. I argue that something like what Hume calls sympathy is essential for expanding circles of moral concern, and develop some Humeian ideas. Sympathy with, and not simply sympathy for. Suffering is too narrow a range of concern. It is not as if the pain and pleasure of the utilitarians were the only ways in which we could be concerned with others. As Hume argued, animals share most human emotions, and it is through sympathy with the entire range that our worlds join. It is increasingly difficult for most of us to realize this, because human relationships with animals have changed since Hume's day. The multi-species barnyard has all but disappeared. We now live in a world of televised wilderness. To exaggerate, our species lives alone for the first time. Animal liberationists have the effect of enlarging our moral world, but should do so not just by attending to suffering or to rights of an animal, but to the whole creature, a being with which we can resonate.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

On the other hand is the idea of domain-specific cognitive abilities urged in contemporary developmental psychology. Each family of ideas can be used to understand the other. Neither the metaphysical nor the psychological approach is intrinsically more fundamental; they complement each other. The paper incidentally clarifies distinct uses of the word \"category\" in different disciplines, and also attempts to make explicit several notions of \"domain\". It also examines Aristotle's most exotic and least discussed categories, being-in-a-position (e.g., sitting) and having-(on) (e.g., armour).

Brown's insight, Nersessian's mental modelling, and Gooding's embodiment, arise, in each case, from a major all-purpose philosophical theory. None reaches down to the specific level of thought experiments, which are small, rare, and precious. I urge attention to Wittgenstein's remark that \"the experimental character disappears when one looks at the process as a memorable picture.\" Thought experiments are not experiments. They are static. They become fixed, more like jokes or optical illusions. Unlike real experiments, they have no life of their own.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
