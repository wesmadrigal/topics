{"total_words": 76, "documents": ["In this paper we describe the objectives of teaching medical ethics to undergraduates and the teaching methods used. We describe a workshop used in the University of Liverpool Department of Psychiatry, designed to enhance ethical sensitivity in psychiatry. The workshop reviews significant historical and current errors in the ethical practice of psychiatry and doctors' defence mechanisms against accepting responsibility for deficiencies in ethical practice. The workshop explores the student doctors' own group ethos in response to ethical dilemmas, and demonstrates how the individual contributes to and is responsible for the group ethos through participation and also through non-participation. The student feedback about the workshop is reviewed. The Toronto Ethical Sensitivity Instrument was used to assess whether or not the workshop altered sensitivity. Compared to a control group the attenders' sensitivity was significantly increased (on Student's t-test p equals or is less than 0.002).\n      </p>", "\"Mental illness\" is a myth, used by society to conceal conflict as illness and to justify coercion as treatment. And involuntary hospitalization for this \"illness\" is a grave attack on the rights of those condemned to confinement. In a truly free society, involuntary psychiatry has no place.\n      </p>", "This paper concerns the special ethical problems in child and adolescent psychiatry which relate to the child as a developing being. Two themes are discussed \u2013 the sense of responsibility in the child, and the therapist's responsibility towards the child. As a background to understanding the former, ideas on moral and cognitive development are reviewed. The therapist's responsibility is discussed in relation to different styles of therapy and the ethical issues they raise. The article concludes with a number of suggested ethical principles.\n      </p>", "When an applicant for legal aid informs the legal aid office that her problem is that her mother-in-law is a witch from South Carolina, what does the office do? Today it may have access to psychiatric consultation, in which case it will refer the client for a psychiatric evaluation before proceeding with her case. Only recently have the services of forensic psychiatry been made available to legal aid offices, and this expansion is only one instance of the growing role of psychiatry in the civil law process.\n      </p>", "Evidence of evil spirits is voluminous and comes from many cultures, both ancient and modern. Cases from China, India, and the United States are examined and evaluated. The actual experience of spirit victims, the universality of spirit oppression, the superhuman phenomena associated with \"possession,\" and the comparative success of deliverance and exorcism vs. psychiatry are considered. Potential arguments against the spirit hypothesis center on the antecedent improbability of spirits, multiple personality disorder, and the effectiveness of medication; but these can be countered. Psychiatrists should question their materialist assumption that mental illness is strictly a matter of an aberrant brain, carefully examine the literature of possession, experiment to determine why exorcists and deliverance ministers often succeed where psychiatry fails, and develop a more complete inventory of techniques for healing the complete person.\n      </p>", "Objectives: Celebrity followers of the Church of Scientology have recently used their public forum to attack the modern practice of mental health. The practice of Scientology is rooted in the religious writings of its founder, L. Ron Hubbard. This paper will review the religious writings of L Ron Hubbard to understand Scientology's position on mental health. Method: This paper reviews four of the major religious books written by L Ron Hubbard, in addition to a comprehensive overview of Scientology compiled by Scientology staff. Results: Hubbard's theory of mind borrowed heavily from the earlier writings of Freud, until Hubbard's psychological theory extended to include a spiritual existence that goes beyond the material world. The goal of Hubbard's psychology and religion were to optimize the freedom of the individual, and he viewed psychiatry and psychology as inherently anti-spiritual and opposed to personal freedom and self-realization. Ultimately Hubbard presents a world view of potential nuclear world cataclysm, fueled by the geopolitical climate and mental health theories that dominated the mid 20th century. Conclusions: Hubbard's writings mirrored the times in which he lived. His views that mental health practices are inherently anti-religious, freedom-inhibiting, and brain damaging do not reflect the modern-day practices of mental health.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>"], "words": {"and": {"number": 4, "prob": 3.312505952159133e-05}, "ethical": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "illness": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "methods": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "office": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "being": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "relate": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "is": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "describe": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "undergraduates": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "an": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "as": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "paper": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "in": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "special": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "mental": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "ancient": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "from": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "spirits": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "adolescent": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "objectives": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "when": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "legal": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "to": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "concerns": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "which": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "teaching": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "we": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "used": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "that": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "ith": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "of": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "problems": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "evil": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "child": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "ethics": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "evidence": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "problem": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "a": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "both": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "for": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "developing": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "this": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "many": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "medical": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "modern": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "voluminous": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "her": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "cultures,": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "mother": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "psychiatry": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}, "aid": {"number": 2, "prob": 1.6562529760795664e-05}, "the": {"number": 5, "prob": 4.140632440198916e-05}, "comes": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06}}}
