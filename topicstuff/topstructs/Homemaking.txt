We found that both homemakers and career-oriented women existed in a North American sample of Mennonites. Homemakers, who were more religious, less educated and less individualistic, were significantly more pro-life, as expected. The career-oriented were more educated and more individualistic, and they were also significantly more pro-choice. Individualism was the most significant predictor of pro-choice attitudes on all six dependent variables. However, ideology in the form of the Anabaptist religious beliefs found in this sample of Mennonites, was the most consistent and most significant predictor of pro-life attitudes. Anabaptist beliefs, cradled in a home-making context, correlated highly with pro-life attitudes on abortion, and correlated negatively with individualism, career-making, education, and socio-economic status. As Tribe's findings suggested, religion can be a strong counterforce to Luker's emphasis on status, which also correlates strongly with pro-life attitudes on abortion.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "The evolutionary nature of the family field suggests that family life education should be evolving and changing. As new concepts emerge, do family life teachers consider them as important to teach as traditional concepts? Do they consider themselves as qualified to teach the emerging concepts as they do the traditional concepts? This study attempted to answer these questions. Respondents included 436 randomly selected Home Economics Family Life teachers who responded to a mailed questionnaire. Overall, traditional concepts were reported to be significantly more important to teach than were emerging concepts.

Situated within the context of the liberalizing reforms initiated by Nikita Khrushchev in the political and economic realms, it focuses on one key policy program of the era-ending the Soviet housing crisis and providing each family its own apartment. Based on the premise that this objective was part of a broader return to the task of building Communism, this exposition argues that the domestic realm was ideologically charged and metaphoric for the moral order of society. Therefore, much more was at stake in homemaking than simply creating a cozy living space, and household objects became saturated with meaning: simple, modern lines in decorative wares-as for housing design in general-signified a productive society, fundamentally opposed to individualism and materialism. An overview of how Soviet design experts presented the domestic interior as an integral part of the general housing construction campaign provides the backdrop. The article then proceeds to analyze the ideal \"socialist\" interior, as well as its antithesis, and consider the values with which each was associated. Before concluding, consideration is afforded to how ordinary individuals might actually have decorated their homes. Finally, the article disentangles various contradictions in Soviet housing policy, design prescriptions and fictional depictions that complicate the \"total\" vision for homemaking detailed in the introduction.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "           ", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Evidence for a number of middle-class homes is used to explore the variations. The symbolic value of individual objects and their role within the material culture of the home is examined-in particular, the use of textiles to articulate the practical and symbolic functions of living rooms.

First she questions the way Professor Schultz seems to assume a rigid barrier between love and work, suggesting instead that legal feminists need not choose between work for love and work for wages as the cornerstone of feminist legal reform. Second she challenges Schultz's suggestion that proposals to remunerate homemaking labor are backward thinking. Since wage labor is not the only route to citizenship, Professor Ertman contends, proposals to remunerate homemaking labor can buttress many women's citizenship claims.

Private agencies have had long years of experience in homemaking services and retain the leading position in operating the largest number of programs. As public welfare has moved toward a service program, impressive progress has been made by the public agencies in developing the service. The homemaker program was developed originally to meet a crisis in the home. Particularly was this true when the mother was ill or absent from the home, and an effort was made through homemaking services to keep the children at home. In county public welfare departments and especially in rural areas, homemakers are assuming more of a teaching role and reaching more people through a group approach. The importance of a homemaker program being operated in a social agency is that it can provide the joint services of the homemaker and the professional caseworker.

In this study, I examine the rate of married women's labor force reentry in Japan and Taiwan, using event history data constructed from the 1995 Social Stratification and Social Mobility (SSM) Survey for the former and the 1996 Social Change (SC) Survey for the latter. The analysis reveals that Japanese women's timing of reentry reflects changes in their family roles, independent of the duration of work interruption. By contrast, the processes of Taiwanese women's employment return are less closely tied to family stages, but show patterns of duration dependence. These findings indicate that national contexts impact the dynamics of women's labor force reentry after marriage because of their differences in work-family conflict and the time sensitivity of the cost of nonemployment. These contextual differences also influence the effects of other determinants of women's rate of return, including education, husband's income potential, work commitment, and previous job experiences.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Using the Dunn (1960) Marriage Role Expectation inventory, the Marriage Role Expectations of 110 female university students enrolled in an introductory Marriage and Family course in the Fall of 1978 were compared with the marriage role expectations of 72 female university students enrolled in the same course in the Spring of 1961.

Research on voluntary associations shows that these also are segregated by sex. However, little is known about the connections between these institutions. In this research, we explore the effects of occupational sex composition on the sex composition of respondents' voluntary memberships.

In the equations representing social causation, full-time employment predicts slower declines in perceived health and in physical functioning for both men and women. Full-time employment has the same effect for both sexes. Among women, it also has the same effect for White and non-White, and for married and nonmarried. In the equations representing social selection, physical functioning increases the odds of getting or keeping a full-time job for both sexes. Perceived health increases the odds for women but not for men. In regard to homemaking among women, homemaking predicts significantly greater declines in health, but health has no effect on the odds of becoming or staying a homemaker.\n      </p>", "In a simulation game designed for families to plan adolescents' career goals, 183 families were studied for evidence that traditional sex-role attitudes were reflected in family decisions regarding the career goals of teenagers. Special attention was focused upon 96 of these families, each having both a male and female adolescent. Results indicated that family decisions favored the career goals of adolescent males over adolescent females by a 4 to 1 ratio. That is, the differential preference given to adolescents' goals seemed to be determined by the adolescents' gender. Furthermore, this variable retained its explanatory efficacy despite analyses for the effects of such alternative variables as the ordinal position of the adolescent, religious preference of parents, religiosity of parents, education of fathers, fathers' income, employment status of mothers, and whether the daughters desired an occupational or homemaking career as a primary life goal. Another important finding was that daughters were divided about equally in their choices of an occupational versus homemaking career. Generational differences were also prevalent, because fathers clearly preferred domestic goals for their daughters more than adolescent females chose these goals for themselves.\n      </p>", "A merged sample of eight of the General Social Surveys provided the data for analyzing stability and change in childhood homes since the beginning of the century. Cohort membership and two measures of social disadvantage were used as explanatory variables in analysis of the risk of growing up in a broken home and of the living arrangements of children with broken homes. The risk of a broken home by age 16 proved to be stable across cohorts and greater for those from disadvantaged homes. Stability of the risk arose from the balance between homes broken by parental death and homes broken by divorce or separation. Across cohorts mothers were the chief homemaking parents in broken homes and, except among nonwhites, this proportion increased. Fathers were remarried more often than mothers, although mothers in more advantaged homes were increasingly more likely to be remarried. Stepfathers came to outnumber stepmothers in later cohorts.\n      </p>", "The purpose of this research is to demonstrate that one overriding factor, the maximization of role profit, is associated with selecting both the fulltime homemaking role and dual roles when educated married women are free to choose. The research also explores whether profit is maximized differentially from one role to another through values associated with these roles. \"Profit\" is subjectively evaluated in terms of the two comparison levels of exchange theory: (1) CLalt (comparison level of alternative choices), and (2) CL (comparison level of fulfilled expectation). The hypothesis is advanced, and accepted, that when role choice is voluntary, married women choose roles which maximize their profit; differential values are found to be associated with these different roles. Data were derived from 178 faculty wives who returned mailed questionnaires, and from personal interviews with 36 women in four \"ideal type\" roles.\n      </p>", "There is growing pressure on men to increase their participation in home life. As more and more women, particularly the mothers of young children, enter the labor force, there appears to be greater need for men to contribute to housework and childcare. This paper draws on intensive interview material with 25 Boston-area families to describe and explain the ambivalence of male response to this pressure. Because of men's different social support networks, they can obtain little moral support and logistical help in performing tasks around the house. Because men perceive paid employment as their primary contribution to the family, they are reluctant to acknowledge either that they need help in performing this function or have a responsibility to participate in the homemaking function.\n      </p>", "Time-sampled observations were made of the free-play fantasy behavior of groups of 3-5-year-old children in a preschool setting. Boys displayed more, and more active, fantasy play than girls; older children engaged in more make-believe than younger ones. Increases in fantasy play over the year depended on age, sex, and the nature of the activity. Boys and older children performed more make-believe play outdoors than girls and younger children. Whereas interactive fantasy play was shown more often by boys and older children, cooperative role taking was more common among girls. The greater role-taking fantasy play of girls as compared with boys was not simply a function of the girls' greater use of a \"homemaking\" play area. The opportunity for outdoor play may be related to the greater overall fantasy play of boys.\n      </p>", "In this paper we examine theoretical arguments about cultural reproduction and resistance in the context of the welfare state. We argue that the welfare state reproduces gender stratification structurally by replicating a gendered division of labor and culturally by inculcating an ideological framework that sustains that division of labor. We illustrate our arguments through an historical study of the War on Poverty, a key period in the history of the welfare state. The Job Corps, a core anti-poverty program, trained young men and women in basic skills and prepared them for jobs in the skilled trades. While job training for young, African-American women emphasized middle-class, homemaking skills, young men received training in the skilled trades.

As for recruitment, female candidates benefited from the area's favorable political climate and effective women's organizations. A surprising finding, in light of previous research, was that district elections were indispensable to women's electoral successes. And as for attitudes, while there were few policy differences between female and male officials, women had distinctive conceptions of power and politics. Given their numerical majorities on two local governing boards, they were free from the restraints experienced by \"token women\" (Kanter) and spoke candidly about their differences from male officials. An important new finding was the extent to which they spontaneously linked such differences to women's homemaking and childrearing experiences. The primary study material consists of intensive interviews with many of these officials in 1982.\n      </p>", "The orientations of female college students toward education, family, and work were assessed in 1969 and 1973. Questionnaires revealed that in both years, the women were more strongly committed to the principles of sexual equality than they were to incorporating these principles into their own lives. Furthermore, although the women sampled in 1973 were markedly more feminist than those of 1969 in their general attitudes toward sexual equality, they were only slightly more feminist in their own personal plans and expectations. Commitment to marriage and motherhood was strong in both samples, but among those intending to combine marriage, motherhood, and a career, there was, in 1973, an increase in the percentage planning a \"double-track\" career-homemaking pattern and a reduction in the percentage planning to interrupt their careers for childrearing. The data suggest that these changes occurred both among women just entering college and among those who were on campus during this four year period.\n      </p>", "The increasing trend of single parenthood in Hong Kong is not parallel with increased understanding of its specific family processes and dynamics. Instead, most of the understanding is based on western experiences through their literatures and researches. This study was an attempt to understand the child care pattern of single parent families in Hong Kong through a citywise survey based on a representative sample. Findings in the study confirmed the hypotheses that single parents in Hong Kong had less time in engaging various child care and homemaking activities and perceived child care as more difficult in comparing to two-parent families. The findings were highly consistent with many other findings as based on North American samples. Cultural differences were explored as well as the implications for work policy and day care policy.\n      </p>", "Men and women are increasingly likely to pursue careers in elite professions, but gendered expectations about homemaking and breadwinning continue to shape opportunities for professional advancement and individual decisions to marry, have children, regulate employment hours, or use \"family-friendly\" programs. This article describes how the Victorian ideology of separate spheres and other gendered beliefs and practices have spawned a modern-day \"career advancement double standard\" in which professional women who marry or have children are considered less serious about their careers, whereas professional men who marry or become fathers are considered more likely candidates for promotion. Trends in the general population toward more gender equality in labor force attachment and family labor sharing are compared to slower changes among elite professionals such as doctors, lawyers, and bankers.\n      </p>", "Enabling the making of home is central to the practices of housing, but constructing home is more than building adequate shelter. It is about establishing, nurturing and managing social relationships and bringing together spaces, objects and elements to represent and celebrate desired relationships, events and memories. Drawing on empirical data from Sri Lanka and Colombia, this paper examines in detail the practices of homemaking in low-income settlements. By focussing on people's conceptions of home and by identifying key social and societal practices, the paper offers insights into the processes of home-making among ordinary dwellers in developing countries and calls for culturally sensitive and holistic housing interventions which support and complement these processes.\n      </p>", "Many years after the Velvet Revolution, feminism remains close to a dirty word in the Czech Republic, even among women who share the views of \"Western feminists.\" Surprisingly, this may in part hark back to the negative views of \"bourgeois feminism\" propounded by the Communists. Equally surprising is the very high proportion of women who are employed, almost all of them full-time, although they continue to do the lion's share of homemaking. This strategy enables Czech women to have a high sense of personal efficacy and independence. This paper emphasizes the historical roots of women's position in Czech society, and the importance of the cultural and social context for the emergence of what we term \"Feminism, Czech Style.\"\n      </p>", "This study examines whether long work hours exacerbate gender inequality. As working long hours becomes increasingly common, a normative conception of gender that prioritizes men's careers over women's careers in dual-earner households may pressure women to quit their jobs. I apply multilevel models to longitudinal data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation to show that having a husband who works long hours significantly increases a woman's likelihood of quitting, whereas having a wife who works long hours does not appear to increase a man's likelihood of quitting. This gendered pattern is more prominent among workers in professional and managerial occupations, where the norm of overwork and the culture of intensive parenting are strong. Furthermore, the effect is stronger among workers who have children. Findings suggest that overwork can reintroduce the separate spheres arrangement, consisting of breadwinning men and homemaking women, to many formerly dual-earner households.\n      </p>", "In the late 1960s and early 1970s the gender divide in American higher education narrowed rapidly as women shifted their aims from homemaking to careers. The dynamicsocial-norms hypothesis explains why we observe unexpected and rapid rather than gradual change in women's education and employment. The explanation draws on a theory of social change developed by Timur Kuran that predicts revolutionary rather than incremental shifts in social norms. Critical to the argument is the claim that in some settings the choices of individuals depend in part on the choices of others. In the presence of inter dependencies, the potential exists for unexpected and rapid transformations, such as that occurring in higher education between 1965 and 1975.\n      </p>", "We examine the argument that predominantly female occupations attract women because they are relatively easy to combine with family responsibilities. Some traditionally female occupations offer relatively low penalties for labor force withdrawal, but other \"female\" occupations reduce the costs of employment to mothers by facilitating the combination of worker and mother roles. We test the hypothesis that a woman's response to the characteristics of her occupation and to other factors depends on her preference for employment vs. homemaking over the long run. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, the analysis focuses on the period from the year prior to the first birth through the two years following the birth as the time of maximum conflict between employment and child rearing. We find no effect of occupational sex composition on the likelihood that prospective or recent mothers are employed. Occupational characteristics that raise the cost of labor force withdrawal (high education, wages, and job-specific training) tend to decrease the probability of women's withdrawal from work, as do nonmonetary occupational characteristics. All women respond to the cost of labor force withdrawal, but women with low work commitment also respond to financial pressures and convenience of the work setting.\n      </p>", "Using survey data collected in 1988 from a random sample of 12,463 participants (6,593 of which were females), this study tested whether or not being employed, being married, enjoying good physical health, and having children under five years old at home are likely to predict life satisfaction of women in nine Western European countries. Being healthy was positively related to life satisfaction of females in all nine countries (as did being married, except in France). Having children under five years old at home was negatively related to life satisfaction of women in Britain, Germany, and Ireland but was unrelated in the other countries. Employment was related to life satisfaction in Denmark only. In Denmark, homemakers had higher life satisfaction than did employed women. Furthermore, any effects employment might have exercised on life satisfaction were the same whether or not women were married, experienced good physical health, or had children under five years old at home. Of the employed women, those in countries with a small percentage of employed women were more satisfied with their lives than those in countries where female employment was more common. Key terms: Female employment, life satisfaction, health, marital status, children, homemaking.\n      </p>", "The different conditions for a successful career of professional women &amp; men were investigated on the basis of a mail questionnaire sent to 581 persons with academic degrees in agricultural sciences, architecture, engineering, law, medicine, &amp; forestry. The sample was stratified according to sex &amp; field of study. The response rate was 80%; 223 women &amp; 230 men returned the questionnaire. Career success was measured by income &amp; own evaluation of the appropriateness of professional placement. The following variables were correlated with the career success of both sexes: broad scope of professional activity, academic degree beyond the lowest one, contact with male co-workers outside working hours, &amp; freedom from homemaking obligations. Among women also good performance in secondary school, faithful service to the same employer, urban location, &amp; progressive attitude toward woman's role in working life were correlated significantly with success. Among men only good academic performance, high prestige of father's profession, job changes, working overtime, keeping up with professional literature, &amp; a non-employed wife were characteristic of those successful in their careers. The results were discussed in terms of sex role differentiation. In addition to household obligations, segregation of the sexes in the working life is also one of the many structural barriers against the equality of the sexes.\n      </p>", "Common Western stereotypes about men and women and their relationships to labor and production often influence how we view these matters even in non-modern contexts, such as rabbinic Judaism in late antiquity. In fact, notwithstanding modern and ancient conventions assigning women to homemaking and men to earning the family livelihood, rabbinic texts depict women in a variety of wage-earning tasks and consider women's labor and production, domestic and otherwise, an essential element of the family economy. On the other hand, labor is not automatically valorized for men but rather stands in tension with the ideal of full devotion to Torah study. This article explores these elements of rabbinic culture, individually and in terms of their interaction: the conflict for rabbinic men between the desire to devote themselves exclusively to Torah study and the need to support themselves and ensure that essential societal tasks get done; the participation of women (wives, and also slaves) in the rabbinically imagined family economy; and the exemption/exclusion of women (and slaves) from various forms of religious practice and learning.\n      </p>", "           ", "Given the increasing female labour force participation rates in recent decades, the question arises as to whether the daughters of working mothers show different job patterns than the daughters of homemakers. Using data from a sample of 3,169 adult women in the 2002-2004 wave of the Netherlands Kinship Panel Study, we find that women who were raised by a working mother work about two more hours per week than those raised by a homemaking mother. The likelihood that women are currently in the labour market is not affected by their mother's past labour force participation. Women's own educational achievement and the presence of children younger than 12 are the strongest determinants of their participation and work hours. Our findings add to the growing evidence that parental behaviours during childhood have long-reaching consequences for children's behaviours, also in the realm of paid work. This provides a useful explanation for the persisting gender gap in work hours across Europe, in addition to the conventional explanations of education, occupational history and family formation.\n      </p>", "Feminist research on community care and 'informal carers' identified this as a women's issue but failed to address the interests and experiences of older and disabled women - those who received 'care'. One consequence is that such feminist research has implicitly, and sometimes explicitly, undermined disabled women's rights to a home, children and personal relationships. Using qualitative research, the article highlights the actual experience of women whose physical impairment means that they need help with daily living activities, looking at the different circumstances in which such help is received. The disability movement's concept of 'independent living' raises particular issues for disabled women. 'Independent living' is about having choice and control over the assistance needed, rather than necessarily doing everything for yourself. However, gender inequalities may also inhibit the choice and control that women have in their lives. Assistance can be given within a personal relationship as an expression of love, but disabled women may also experience abusive, restrictive or exploitative relationships. Public services do not generally provide assistance in a way which enables a woman to have choice and control in her life, or even to carry out child-caring or homemaking tasks. The research on the various ways of receiving personal assistance found that those women who were able to purchase their own help were most likely to be living independently, in the sense of exerting choice and control in their lives. Feminist research can help to create a space for disabled women's absent voices, and add to the pressure for change in the way that personal assistance needs are met. This is a human and civil rights issue which has a key impact on the control that disabled women have over their lives.\n      </p>", "Goethe's Werther may be read as an allegory for the artwork as it confronts its own irreconcilable demands for autonomy and recognition. This article seeks the bases for such a reading in Werther's letter of 21 June, in his tenuous attempts to place himself within the epic world of a Homeric text, and in his ambivalent idealization of the imagery of imprisonment. Critical consideration is given to Luk\u00e1c's idea of second nature and to Adorno's critique of the Enlightenment. Comparisons are made with the tropes of homecoming, homemaking, and confinement as they appear in the works of Rousseau, Schiller, and Thoreau.\n      </p>", "We examine the gender division of labor among married Spaniards (Family and the Use of Time Survey, 1993), testing hypotheses about secular, rational efficiency effects of employment, education, and political attitudes conflicting with wives' and husbands' gender traditional reactions to parenthood and Catholicism. The dependent variables include a summed inventory of six routine household maintenance tasks, daily hours spent in employment, housework, child care, and leisure, and three measures of timing, pacing, and multitasking pressures. Wives perform the vast majority of routine daily household maintenance chores and spend longer days in combined paid employment, housework, and child care than do husbands. Wives also experience greater pacing, timing, and multi-tasking pressures than do husbands. We find support for our argument that Spaniards combine both traditional and equalitarian orientations in their daily routines. Wives especially seem to balance a rationally efficient orientation to their market capital and time availability demands, but still retain a very traditional homemaking role based on affiliation with Catholic principles.

At one level, it may have been artistic self-expression; at another level a product of a commitment to household duty or financial necessity, or on a third level it may have been for entertainment or pastime. These motivations seem to reflect the more recently labelled DIY home improvements. The fact that particular crafts were associated with women was based partly on the determinist philosophies of the eighteenth century. These were predicated on distinctions that supposed that each gender had inherently different faculties. In the fields of art and crafts, this led to the distinction between amateur women and professional men, and more especially, the equating of specific crafts with women's work and homemaking. This gendering, which was preached both in school and in print, meant that by the mid-eighteenth century, any visual sensibility women had developed was particularly directed towards their homes. The broad aims of this paper are therefore to investigate the nature of the work undertaken, the role it played in certain women's lives, how it reflected social attitudes of the period, and its relationship with the home during the period 1750-1900. Finally, the article will reflect on how and in what different ways women's domestic arts and crafts could be considered as precursors to the DIY of today.\n      </p>", "Background: Healthcare systems are investing in end-of-life homecare to reduce acute care use. However, little evidence exists on the timing and amount of homecare services necessary to reduce acute care utilization. Objectives: To investigate whether admission time to homecare hand the amount of services, as measured by average nursing and personal support and homemaking (PSH) hours/week (h/wk), are associated with using acute care services at end-of-life. Research Design: Retrospective observational cohort study. Subjects: Decedents admitted to end-of-life homecare in Ontario, Canada. Measures: The odds ratios (OR) of having a hospitalization or emergency room visit in the 2 weeks before death and dying in a hospital. Results: The cohort (n = 9018) used an average of 3.11 (SD = 4.87) nursing h/wk, 3.18 (SD = 6.89) PSH h/wk, and 18% were admitted to homecare for &lt;1 month. As admission time to death and homecare services increased, the adjusted OR of an outcome decreased in a dose reponse manner. Patients admitted earlier than 6 months before death had a 35% (95% CI: 25%\u201344%) lower OR of hospitalization than those admitted 3 to 4 weeks before death; patients using more than 7 nursing h/wk and more than 7 PSH h/wk had a 50% (95% CI: 37%\u201360%) and 35% (95% CI: 21%\u201347%) lower OR of a hospitalization, respectively, than patients using 1 h/wk, controlling for other covariates. Other outcomes had similar results. Conclusion: These results suggest that early homecare admission and increased homecare services will help alleviate the demand for hospital resources at end-of-life.\n      </p>", "Viviana Zelizer's recent book, The Purchase of Intimacy (2005), presents an innovative theory of how social and lega actors negotiate nghts and obligations when money changes hands in intimate relationships\u2014a perspective that could change how we understand many things, from valuations of homemaking labor to the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund. This essay describes Zelizer's critique of the reductionist \"Hostile Worlds\" and \"Nothing But\" approaches to economic exchange in intimate relationships and then explains her more three-dimensional approach, \"Connected Lives.\" While Zelizer focuses on family law, the essay goes beyond that context, extending Zelizer's approach to transfers of genetic material and concluding
