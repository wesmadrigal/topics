Competing hypotheses about trends are described, using notions of role-specialization, spouse support, and uncertainty. The study is based on an investigation of the life histories of 2,795 men in the Netherlands who were born between the 1930s and the 1960s, and confirms earlier findings by showing that employment fosters marriage while marriage protects men from becoming unemployed. There is also a relationship between employment and cohabitation but it is weaker in both directions. However, the relationship between marriage or cohabitation and occupational mobility is less clear, suggesting that the economic benefits of marriage cannot be generalized to the occupational domain. Although it is commonly believed that the link for men between career and marriage has weakened over time, our comparison of birth cohorts shows that in fact this is not the case.\n      </p>", "Since the implementation of the new General Assistance Act (1996) in The Netherlands, single parents on welfare have become obliged to seek work as soon as their youngest child has become 5 years old.

The Netherlands is known for its low rates of unwanted pregnancy, safe and accessible abortion services, low perinatal and maternal mortality and well-developed programmes for adolescent sexual health, but recent studies show a rising incidence of abortions and STDs, particularly among young people and immigrants. This article describes reproductive health services in the Netherlands, their historical roots and current constellation, including services for family planning, abortion, STDs, infertility, information, education and counselling on sexuality, and antenatal and delivery care, in the context of cost containment and other recent reforms. It shows that although these core components are well covered and the system of reimbursement for costs has greatly helped to increase accessibility, they are not all well integrated into the primary health care system. In some cases, they are well covered by other providers, such as midwives. Prevention and management of STDs and infertility, however, are particularly split between different providers and in some cases the extent and quality of service provision is lacking. What emerges is a still fragmented landscape - with many successes but also some significant shortcomings. /// Depuis la Conf\u00e9rence internationale sur la population et le d\u00e9veloppement en 1994, les obstacles \u00e0 l'am\u00e9lioration des programmes de sant\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9sique dans les pays industrialis\u00e9s ont re\u00e7u peu d'attention.

Shared-frailty Cox proportional hazard analyses of longitudinal data from historical population registers show that siblings exerted an additive impact on women's migration, independently of temporal and household characteristics. Just how siblings influenced women's migration depended on regional modes of production and on employment opportunities. In the Zeeland region, sisters channelled each other into service positions. In the Pays de Herve, where men and women found industrial work in the Walloon cities, women were as much influenced by their brothers' activities. Evidence is found for two mechanisms explaining the effects of siblings: microeconomic notions of joint-household decision-making and social capital theory.\n      </p>", "Nineteen ninety-six saw the publication of a major Dutch survey into euthanasia in the Netherlands.

Using data from eight pooled surveys in the Netherlands, an extended Blau-Duncan status attainment model is formulated and analysed. The corresponding CMLR model is formulated incorporating general and specific inheritance effects. The final CMLR model gives a relatively parsimonious description of Dutch mobility patterns, similar to the extended Blau-Duncan model, at the same time offering the possibility of including specific effects where necessary.

An exploratory study on the unmet needs, attitudes, and beliefs of migrant Ghanaian women with infertility problems living in the Netherlands, and the kinds of treatment they sought was undertaken in 1999. Qualitative data were collected from 12 women with primary or secondary infertility through narratives and 20 key informant interviews. The women described seeking treatment for infertility in Ghana, the Netherlands and other European countries, included use of infertility drugs, surgery, donor insemination and in vitro fertilisation. Illegal migrant women are not entitled to treatment paid by the national health system, and being of low income they cannot afford to pay directly for this or to obtain private health insurance. Herbalists and spiritual healers in both Amsterdam and Ghana were regularly consulted, especially for their willingness to address the social and spiritual aspects of infertility. To produce a pregnancy where male infertility was suspected, transfer of sexual rights to another man in the husband/partner's family, or a healer or priest, was a practical remedy that kept male infertility hidden. This study revealed difficulties experienced in clinical settings due to language barriers and cultural differences. Ghanaian women living in the Netherlands need much more information on the causes of infertility and their options. /// Les \u00e9tudes sur la st\u00e9rilit\u00e9 aux Pays-Bas n'informent gu\u00e8re sur les Ghan\u00e9ennes; pourtant, les Ghan\u00e9ens repr\u00e9sentent le troisi\u00e8me groupe de migrants \u00e0 Amsterdam.

The results show that in the Netherlands, as opposed to the USA, a vast majority of the wives are still completely or strongly dependent on their husband's income. Yet, also Dutch wives' economic dependency is decreasing at a significant rate. Despite clear life course differences that yet seem to persist, we observe declining levels of dependency within each age group. This declining trend seems to reflect mostly changes in married women's employment status over time. An implication of the reported trend, however, is that it becomes increasingly important to study the influence of the social position of both partners.\n      </p>", "Creativity is central in stimulating economic growth in cities, regions and advanced capitalist economies in general. There is, of course, no one-to-one relation of the number of firms in creative industries to economic growth. Innovation is a key mechanism explaining the relationship of creative industries with economic performance. Based on an empirical study in the Netherlands we explore the effect of creative industries on innovation, and ultimately on employment growth in cities. In the Netherlands the three specific domains of creative industries-arts, media and publishing, and creative business services-make up 9 per cent of the business population. Drawing on survey data we find that firms in creative industries are indeed relatively innovative. Yet substantial differences are found across the three domains: firms in the arts domain are clearly less innovative, most likely due to a different (less market-oriented) dominant ideology. In addition, firms in creative industries located in urban areas are more innovative than their rural counterparts. We go on to analyse how the concentration of creative industries across cities is connected with employment growth. With the exception of the metropolitan city of Amsterdam, we find no measurable spill-over effect from creative industries. The presence of the creative class (in all kinds of industries other than creative ones) appears to be a much stronger driver of employment growth than creative industries.\n      </p>", "Children with cerebral palsy (CP) and their families often make strong demands on diagnostic, therapeutic, technical and social facilities. Prevalence estimates are needed to improve treatment and services. As recent Dutch data are not available, the present study aimed to assess the population prevalence of CP in the Netherlands. A representative Dutch area with 1.2 million inhabitants of which 172,000 were born between 1977 and 1988 was studied. To ascertain the children with CP from these birth years, medical practices (such as rehabilitation centres, paediatric and child neurological departments) were consecutively asked to contact their (supposed) CP cases. Next, a parents' organisation and finally regional news media assisted in the ascertainment. In total, 170 'supposed' CP cases underwent an expert examination. Of these 170, 127 children proved to be definite CP-cases, yielding a 'crude' average prevalence of 0.74 per 1000 inhabitants (95% CI: 0.61-0.87). Under-ascertainment was recognised and quantified. Accordingly, the population prevalence of CP over the birth year period 1977-1988 was calculated as 1.51 per 1000 inhabitants (average over the 12 birth years). The calculated CP prevalence rose significantly over time: from 0.77 (1977-1979) to 2.44 (1986-1988).

We used data of approximately 3,000,000 sick fund insured persons of the Health Insurance Company Agis in The Netherlands from 1999 to 2003. We calculated annual numbers and corresponding 95% confidence intervals for different age, gender and ethnicity categories. The mean age of the population was 38\u00b122 years and 46% were male. Chest radiographs were ordered in 130 per 1000 persons per year and abdominal ultrasound examinations in 39 per 1000 persons per year; these frequencies did not change noticeable over the five-year period. Chest radiography was performed more often in males (156 vs. 109 per 1,000 persons/year in females; p &lt; 0.05) and abdominal ultrasound more often in females (43 vs. 34 per 1000 persons/year in males; p &lt; 0.05). Frequencies were highest in persons aged 70-79 years. Compared to medical specialists, general practitioners more frequently referred younger patients and females, especially for abdominal ultrasound.

We analyzed incidence rates for (potential) primary malignant central nervous system (CNS) tumors in an area (southeastern Netherlands) and during a period (1980-94) in which access to healthcare was good and computerized tomography (CT) was available. Methods: Data were obtained from the Eindhoven and Maastricht cancer registries, representing a population of 936,000 and 847,000 inhabitants, respectively. Cases were identified of primary CNS tumors (ICD-0 codes 191, 192, excluding lymphomas) and brain metastases from an unknown primary site (code 199) and data on mortality according to gender and region were provided by Statistics Netherlands. Results: Incidence rates in three-year periods of primary CNS cancer remained stable, also for patients aged 60 years and older. Mortality/incidence ratios ranged from 0.6 to 0.9. Although more CNS cancers were histologically verified in recent years, especially in the Eindhoven region, changes in diagnosis probably did not influence the overall trend of primary CNS cancer. Conclusions: Major changes in the incidence of the most common types of primary CNS cancers (i.e., high-grade astrocytomas) were unlikely in southeastern Netherlands.\n      </p>", "Recent research suggests a significant connection between declining voter turnout among younger Canadian cohorts and diminished levels of political knowledge. This article seeks to develop these findings further by drawing contrasts with a country (the Netherlands) that has not witnessed a significant turnout decline among the young to see whether political knowledge levels have likewise remained stable. The results partly confound expectations: as in Canada, a growing knowledge gap between young and old is evident in the Netherlands. Voting among young Dutch cohorts has not been markedly affected, however, because knowledge has less impact on electoral participation than in Canada.

It is widely documented in the US, but not in Europe. This paper focuses on a comparative analysis of redlining practices in the two largest cities of the Netherlands: Amsterdam and Rotterdam. It shows that redlining was common practice in Rotterdam in 1999. In 2001, no signs of redlining were found in Rotterdam. However, 'yellowlining' (lower loan-to-value ratios) was still common in some parts of Rotterdam. In Amsterdam, no neighbourhoods were faced with redlining in either 1999 or 2001. However, in 1999 some neighbourhoods were yellowlined. This paper aims to get a better understanding of the nature and the institutional context of redlining in the Netherlands by explaining how the differences in redlining practices between Amsterdam and Rotterdam, and between 1999 and 2001, can be explained. The National Mortgage Guarantee as well as socio-historical, and housing and mortgage market differences and changes, are instrumental in explaining these differences in redlining practices.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Objective To investigate the association between nonoccupational physical activity and the risk of ovarian cancer among post-menopausal women.

The reconstruction is based on two approaches: a forward projection 1941-1945, starting from registration data supplemented by information on Holocaust losses; and a backward projection 1966-1945, starting from an enumeration of Halachic Jews carried out in 1966.

Methods: The Netherlands Cohort Study on diet and cancer was initiated in 1986. A self-administered questionnaire on dietary habits and other risk factors for cancer was completed by 62,573 postmenopausal women. Follow-up for cancer was established by annual record linkages with the Netherlands Cancer Registry. After 9.3 years of follow-up, 214 incident invasive epithelial ovarian cancer cases and 2211 subcohort members with complete data on alcohol intake were available for analysis. All incidence rate ratios (RRs) were corrected for age, use of oral contraceptives, parity, height, body mass index, energy intake and current cigarette smoking. Results: The RRs of ovarian cancer for women who consumed up to 5, 15 and &gt;15 g of alcohol per day were 1.13 (95% confidence interval, 95% CI = 0.79-1.63), 0.85 (95% CI = 0.53-1.37) and 0.92 (95% CI = 0.55-1.54), respectively, compared to non-drinkers.

Methods In 1986, the Netherlands Cohort Study was initiated. A self-administered questionnaire on dietary habits and other cancer risk factors was completed by 62,573 women. Follow-up for cancer was established by record linkage to the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Results After 11.3-years of follow-up, 280 incident endometrial cancer cases were available for analyses. In multivariate analysis, the rate ratio (RR) for alcohol users versus non-users was 1.06 (95% Confidence Interval (95% CI) = 0.78-1.43). There were neither dose-dependent trends nor associations with different types of beverages. The RR for former and current smokers versus never-smokers was 0.83 (95% CI = 0.58-1.20) and 0.59 (95% CI = 0.40-0.88), respectively. These estimates did not change significantly when body mass index (BMI) and age at menopause were added to the models. Conclusions There is no association between alcohol consumption and endometrial cancer. Current smoking is associated with a reduced risk of endometrial cancer. This association is neither mediated by BMI nor by age at menopause.\n      </p>", "This study examines the relationship between gendered family roles and divorce in The Netherlands. Cultural and economic aspects of this relationship are distinguished. Economic hypotheses argue that the likelihood of divorce is increased if women work for pay and have attractive labor market resources. Cultural hypotheses argue that divorce chances are increased if women adhere to emancipatory norms, independent of their labor market positions. An event-history analysis of a life-history survey among 1,289 Dutch women reveals evidence for both hypotheses. Interaction effects are found as well: The protective effect of a traditional division of paid labor is only present among couples in which wives have traditional gender attitudes. Hence, the validity of economic explanations of divorce is conditional on cultural values.\n      </p>", "The number of never-married and divorced persons living in one-person households will continue to increase strongly.

Factors influencing second trimester abortion in the Netherlands may be different from those that play a role in first trimester abortions. This is important for professionals in counselling and education. In this paper national registration data are used to complement data from a small, qualitative, exploratory file study conducted in three clinics, on the factors associated with second trimester abortions. In 2006, 6.6% of all abortions registered in the National Abortion Registry took place after 12 weeks of gestation. In the qualitative data, relationship problems with the partner were mentioned more frequently as the main reason for second trimester abortions than for first trimester abortions. Factors associated with delay in obtaining an abortion were young age, inability to recognise pregnancy, ambivalence towards the pregnancy, having to travel to the Netherlands for abortion and to a lesser extent being an immigrant from specific countries. Information should be provided for young women and women from specific immigrant groups on early awareness of pregnancy, contraception and reduction of fear about seeking abortion and sexuality education should be provided. /// Aux Pays-Bas, l'avortement du deuxi\u00e8me trimestre est l\u00e9gal depuis 1984.

In this paper, it is argued that in a staunchly abolitionist country such as The Netherlands, the existence and perseverance of such support can be better understood and explained by conceiving of capital punishment support in attitudinal terms as part of a law and order syndrome. Death penalty attitudes are analyzed by means of hierarchic logistic regression analysis. It is shown that support can be modeled quite well, partly in terms of general attitudes to criminal justice, partly in terms of political and sociodemographic parameters. Within the criminal justice attitudes complex, more support is found among those endorsing harsh treatment of offenders, those willing to grant far-reaching powers to justice authorities, those believing that the government is not delivering on the topic of crime fighting, and those who are concerned about the level of crime. Within the political context, more support is enlisted among people who abstain from voting and those who vote at either extreme of the political spectrum as opposed to central parties' supporters. In sociodemographic segments it is the younger and poorly educated who are the strongest supporters of capital punishment. It is suggested that endorsing capital punishment can be better understood as an expressive act, displaying dissatisfaction with judicial and political elites in the country.\n      </p>", "The association between several anthropometric indices and breast cancer risk was evaluated within the Netherlands Cohort Study on diet and cancer, which began in 1986 and is conducted among 62,573 women aged 55 to 69 years at baseline. After 4.3 years of follow-up, data on 626 women with incident breast cancer were available with complete information on height and weight at baseline. In multivariate case-cohort analyses, a significantly positive association between adult height and breast cancer was found (P trend &lt; 0.001). Compared with women with height \u2264 155 cm, the rate ratios of breast cancer for women with heights up to 160, 165, 170, 175, and \u2265 175 cm were 1.22, 1.19, 1.44, 1.77, and 2.06, respectively. For weight at baseline, the significant positive association with breast cancer observed in age-adjusted analysis disappeared in multivariate analysis with adjustment for height and other confounders. For body mass index (BMI) (wt[kg]/ht[m]2) at baseline, no association was observed with breast cancer in multivariate analysis; compared with women with a BMI less than 23, the RR for women with a BMI of 30 or more was 0.98 with P trend = 0.46. Weight and BMI at age 20 showed weak inverse associations with breast cancer risk. For gain in weight or BMI between age 20 and cohort baseline age, inconsistent increases in risk were found, with no significant trends. These data support a positive association between height and breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women. Further study is needed to evaluate the role of early diet and breast cancer in this population, and its relationship to height.\n      </p>", "This paper describes a new method to derive nitrogen critical loads for vegetation, and its application to The Netherlands. An 'inverted' form of the soil chemical model SMART2 was used to estimate atmospheric nitrogen deposition at the critical conditions for 139 terrestrial vegetation types (associations) occurring in northwestern Europe, using an iterative search procedure. The critical conditions are the lower end of the pH range, and the upper end of the nitrogen availability range for each vegetation type. The critical load is assumed to be the nitrogen deposition that results in the critical conditions. The critical load values were subjected to a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. Sensitivity analysis showed that the estimated critical N load mainly depends on the vegetation type and to a lesser extent on the soil type and the critical N availability. Of these variables N availability, which was estimated from Ellenberg's indicator scale, contributes most to the uncertainty. The critical load averaged over all vegetation types and soil types is estimated to be 23 \u00b1 7 kg N ha\u207b\u00b9y\u207b\u00b9. This is a rather reliable value because its uncertainty is small and it is in agreement with empirical estimates of critical loads. Critical loads per vegetation type are less reliable because they are not correlated to empirical values, although the ranges of simulated and empirical values usually overlap. At the site level, uncertainty becomes very large and it is not possible to determine critical loads with any practical significance. The uncertainties can only be reduced if more data become available on the abiotic response per species under field conditions, at least to nitrogen availability and soil pH.\n      </p>", "This cost-of-illness analysis based on information from 1549 patients in The Netherlands is part of a Europe-wide study on the costs of multiple sclerosis (MS). The objective was to analyze the costs and quality of life (QoL) related to the level of disease severity and progression. Patients from three specialized MS centres participated in the survey by answering a mail questionnaire (response rate, 52%). In addition to details on the disease (type of disease, relapses, level of functional disability), the questionnaire asked for information on all resource consumption, medical, non-medical, work absence, early retirement and informal care as well as QoL (expressed as utility). The mean age of the cohort was 47 years, and 7.6% of patients were 65 years of age or more. Forty-eight percent of patients had mild disease [Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 0-3], 40% moderate disease (EDSS score of 4-6.5) and 11% severe disease (EDSS score of 7 and above). The mean EDSS score in the sample was 3.9 (median 4.0), with a utility of 0.61. Costs and utility are highly correlated with disease severity. Workforce participation decreases from around 75 to 80% in early disease to less than 5% in the very late stages. Hospitalization is very infrequent in early disease, representing less than \u20ac 500 per year for patients at EDSS scores below 6, but increases steeply for patients at an EDSS score of 7 and above. Ambulatory care increases fivefold between early and late disease, while services rise from basically no cost to almost \u20ac 8000 per year at an EDSS score of 7 and \u20ac 19000 per year at EDSS scores of 8-9. Productivity losses are multiplied by 10 in late disease, while informal care increases from \u20ac 300 per year at EDSS scores of 0-1 to nearly \u20ac 15000 per year at EDSS scores of 8-9. Hence, total mean costs per patient are driven essentially by the distribution of the severity levels in the sample, increasing from \u20ac 9300 per year at EDSS scores of 0-1 to \u20ac 50000 per year at an EDSS score of 7 and \u20ac 78000 per year at EDSS scores of 8-9. The same is true for utility, which decreases from 0.85 to 0.05 as the disease becomes severe. However, the utility loss compared to the age- and gendermatched general population is high at all levels of the disease (0.25 at an EDSS score of 2 to 0.4 at EDSS scores of 5-6), leading to an estimated annual loss of 0.24 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per patient. Relapses for patients with an EDSS score below 5 are associated with a cost of around \u20ac 2800 and a utility loss of 0.15 during the quarter in which they occur.\n      </p>", "The supporters of a right-wing extremist and racist party which held a seat in the Dutch Parliament, have been shown to be highly authoritarian and ethnocentric. Research among a large number of high school students in The Netherlands proves that the concepts and instruments of Adorno et al. are reliable and valid. Authoritarianism is related to ethnocentrism, right-wing extremism, conservatism, and anti-feminism. This was demonstrated using scaling methods and in-depth interviews. It was concluded that authoritarianism is not only related to potential fascism but also to actual fascism.\n      </p>", "Litterbag experiments were carried out in five forest ecosystems in the Netherlands to study weight loss and nitrogen dynamics during the first two years of decomposition of leaf and needle litter. All forests were characterized by a relatively high atmospheric nitrogen input by throughfall, ranging from 22-55 kg N ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; yr&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Correlation analysis of all seven leaf and needle litters revealed no significant relation between the measured litter quality indices (nitrogen and lignin concentration, lignin-to-nitrogen ratio) and the decomposition rate. A significant linear relation was found between initial lignin-to-nitrogen ratio and critical nitrogen concentration, suggesting an effect of litter quality on nitrogen dynamics. Comparison of the decomposition of oak leaves in a nitrogen-limited and a nitrogen-saturated forest suggested an increased nitrogen availability. The differences in capacities to retain atmospheric nitrogen inputs between these two sites could be explained by differences in net nitrogen immobilization in first year decomposing oak leaves: in the nitrogen-limited oak forest a major part (55%) of the nitrogen input by throughfall was immobilized in the first year oak leaf litter. The three coniferous forests consisted of two monocultures of Douglas fir and a mixed stand of Douglas fir and Scots pine. Despite comparable litter quality in the Douglas fir needles in all sites, completely different nitrogen dynamics were found.\n      </p>", "The association between alcohol consumption and cancer of the colon and rectum was investigated in a prospective cohort study, conducted in the Netherlands from 1986 onwards among 120,852 men and women, aged 55 to 69 years. During 3.3 years of follow-up, 312 and 166 cases of colon and rectal cancer had accumulated, respectively. After exclusion of cases diagnosed in the first year of follow-up, the analysis was based on 217 incident cases of colon cancer (107 men and 110 women) and 113 cases of rectal cancer (75 men and 38 women). For colon cancer, no association with total intake of alcohol nor with the consumption of beer and wine, specifically, could be demonstrated; for liquor intake, a significant (P = 0.04) decreasing risk with increasing consumption was observed. For rectal cancer in men, positive trends were observed for total alcohol intake (P = 0.04), beer (P = 0.05), and liquor (P = 0.06). Results for rectal cancer in women were consistent with those in men, but data were too sparse to provide stable estimates. Simultaneous adjustment for beverage type and quantity appeared to strengthen the association of rectal cancer with drinking beer (relative rate (yes/no) = 2.0, 95 percent confidence interval = 1.1-3.9), although a dose-response effect was not observed. When alcohol intake from beer, wine, and liquor were included as continuous variables, the association was somewhat stronger for liquor than for beer, but none of the associations were statistically significant. It is concluded that consumption of alcoholic beverages (beer, in particular) is associated with an increased risk for rectal but not colon cancer.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "The factors that influenced migration decisions in a nineteenth century rural-traditional area of the Netherlands are assessed. This is done in a micro-setting. Applying a new data set with individual characteristics of both migrants and non-migrants a logit-model is estimated. The analysis supports the revisionist and relatively positive picture of the standard of living in pre-modern rural-traditional areas.

About half of these costs are devoted to the residential care for the mentally disabled. This study studied the amount of cost inefficiency in a sample of homes operating in 198. We first apply a data envelopment analysis to our sample and then apply another stage-evaluating the nonradial slack of each input and the effects external factors have on them. After \"correcting\" for the external effects we find that technical and scale inefficiency disappears and cost efficiency increases by 6%. We attribute these findings with the strict regulation under which Dutch homes operate. Further, this approach can be applied to any service or market that faces governmental regulation.\n      </p>", "The awareness of the structural rather than cyclical nature of economic problems caused a fundamental rethinking of the institutions and instruments of industrial policy in most OECD countries. However, studies have concentrated on a limited number of large countries, with only marginal use being made of the experience of the smaller OECD countries. The need for comparative material becomes relevant since the large economies are increasingly facing the same structural problems as the smaller ones. This article analyses the experience of the Netherlands in comparison with other small European economies. The Netherlands economy is highly intertwined with the other economies of the European Community, particularly Germany. Multinationals (many home-based in the case of the Netherlands) dominate certain sectors of the economy and exports, but smaller companies provide the bulk of employment. The loss of employment since 1970 has mostly resulted from the restructuring of large firms. Government subsidies grew considerably, and proliferated in form, in the 1970s and most went to industries experiencing structural problems. Large firms have tended to benefit most. Criticisms have been made of rescue operations, the risky nature of development credits, the obstacles to the use of schemes by small firms and the cost and ineffectiveness of the investment subsidy account. Because of declining domestic investment, public subsidies accounted for 82 per cent of all private investment by 1982. In the 1980s there has been a move away from tripartite arrangements for discussing and administering industrial subsidies to commissions of 'independent' experts, and the degree of organisation in labour unions in the Netherlands, already low, has declined considerably in recent years. The prevalence of centre-right governments in recent years has made it easier to reduce support for individual firms, though large grants for modernisation are made to large firms. The Netherlands appears to be one of the small open countries in which the basic linkages in the model proposed by Cameron have been broken.\n      </p>", "This study summarizes the history, former management, sites and plant communities of the Dutch riverine woodlands as revealed by a nationwide forest ecosystem classification project. In this integrated historical ecological research, knowledge of forest history has proved to be an important tool for elucidating the variety and development of the present day riverine forest ecosystems. In The Netherlands, riverine forests have been scarce for many centuries. For a long time the riverine woods mainly consisted of intensively managed willow coppices, many of which survive near the mouths of rivers. Further upstream most present-day woodlands consist of willows which have sprung up recently. The classification of present-day Dutch riverine woodlands is based on the integration of site types and vegetation types. The riverine forest sites have been differentiated mainly on the basis of flooding characteristics and geomorphological processes. Fifteen vegetation types belonging to the Salicion albae and Ulmion carpinifoliae alliances have been distinguished on the basis of differences in the species composition of the natural vegetation. Factors such as forest management, succession and sedimentation cause riverine forest ecosystems to develop from one type to another. This process is illustrated by a case study of the Colenbrandersbos.\n      </p>", "This article discusses the major issues and character of internationalization of curricula in higher education institutions in recent years in three non-English-speaking countries - China, Japan and The Netherlands. By making a comparative analysis of curricula provided for international students and curricula with international subjects, perspectives or approach offered in both English and the local language, the author examines development and character of internationalized curricula in the three countries, describes the similarities and different aspects of how the three countries internationalized their university curricula and met the needs of different regions and social, economic and higher education systems.\n      </p>", "This paper argues that invisible places could have been just as important in ritual landscapes as the visible monuments that we usually study. It does so by means of a case study on the Bronze Age of the southern Netherlands, where I contrast the two most widespread 'ritual' places: barrows and deposition sites. Barrows were meant to be visible, lasting places with lengthy histories and an important structuring role in the landscape. Deposition sites were 'invisible' sites, lacking lasting man-made markers. They nevertheless had use histories and landscape-structuring roles comparable to those of visible monuments. The contrasts between barrows and depositions are discussed to find out why these coexisting practices had such different results.\n      </p>", "This article examines the sharp increase in cinema attendance in the Netherlands during the First World War and its long-term impact on Dutch film culture. The authors argue that a rise in youth wages, a coal shortage that forced people to look for entertainment outside the private sphere, and the emergence of a new upwardly mobile class of nouveau riches which had made their fortune with war profiteering, were responsible for the sudden popularity of the cinema in the Netherlands. Rather than a drive for respectability on the part of cinema owners, it was this growth in demand that accounts for the construction of picture palaces, which were partly financed by war profiteers. Because of their association with war profiteers and nouveau riche taste, picture palaces were criticized and shunned by the nation's cultural elite and vested middle classes, who continued to see the cinema as a fairground entertainment. Hence, in contrast with developments elsewhere in Europe and in the United States, the emergence of picture palaces in the Netherlands did not facilitate but rather hampered cinema's integration into the cultural mainstream.\n      </p>", "Owing to the growing internationalisation of research, educational researchers in the Netherlands are increasingly expected to publish through the medium of the English language. Though this undoubtedly benefits the communication between scholars, there are also side-effects. This paper discusses problematic issues from three perspectives: (i) the use of a non-native language for communication between scholars in the area of education; (ii) the use either exclusively, or not, of a publication record of such publications for purposes of recruitment and promotion of staff; (iii) the relationships between research groups of different disciplines and/or universities. It will be argued that the demand to publish exclusively in a non-native language has damaging effects as far as the context of education is concerned. Not only will it lead to a denial of one's own background and culture, but the uniformisation, (which is the result of it), will also stifle the rich educational landscape by allowing the publication only of items of international interest. The model of the natural sciences is not adequate for the context of education because of the necessarily more local character of the content of educational problems and production of strategies to deal with these. Thus it will become clear that the integrity of the educational researcher is at stake as the research area is selected.\n      </p>", "We analysed long-term epidemiological trends in influenza-like illness (ILI) in The Netherlands and used an ecological analysis to estimate its relationship with age, influenza vaccination, and virological aspects. This study used data from weekly ILI consultation reports from sentinel general practitioners (1986/1987 to 2006/2007), virological data from sentinel ILI patients (1992/1993 to 2006/2007), and data for influenza vaccine uptake (1991-2005). The incidence of ILI consultations, although varying during the study period, was estimated to decrease in the total population by 12\u00b72/10 000 persons each season (95% CI 8\u00b76-15\u00b79). Uptake of influenza vaccination in people aged \u226565 years (elderly) increased from 28% in 1991 to &gt;70% since 1997. ILI incidence in the elderly declined by 1\u00b77/10 000 persons (P = 0\u00b705) per percentage vaccine uptake per season. The decline in ILI incidence over the last 20 years could be related to the increased vaccine uptake. However, insufficient data were present to assess the impact of other potential contributing factors, such as diminished fitness of influenza viruses and changes in consulting behaviour.\n      </p>", "Cost containment in the Netherlands has been partly achieved by negotiated agreements between insurers and physician associations. The negotiating system in the Netherlands involves the determination of capitation and fee-for-service rates, based on negotiated norms for personal remuneration, practice costs, and practice size. Physician practice patterns are monitored in an effort to control volume. Selected aspects of the negotiating structure could be adopted by Medicare and HMOs to clarify issues in negotiations with physicians and to reimburse physicians more equitably. However, establishment of standardized fees and volume monitoring may not be as effective as global expenditure controls.\n      </p>", "The association between the use of exogenous hormones as either oral contraceptives (OC) or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in relation to postmenopausal breast cancer incidence was examined in the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS) among 62,573 women aged 55 to 69 years. Information on these types of exogenous hormone use and other risk factors was collected by mailed questionnaire. During 3.3 years of follow-up, 471 incident breast cancer cases were identified. After adjustment for traditional breast cancer risk factors, the relative risk (RR) of breast cancer was 1.09 (95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 0.79-1.48) for women who ever used OCs cf women who never used OCs. The relative rates (with CIs) for women who used OCs for a period &lt; 5 years, 5-9 years, 10-14 years, and 15+ years were 0.97 (0.61-1.55), 1.20 (0.69-2.07), 1.03 (0.60-1.77), and 1.96 (0.99-3.89), respectively. The test for trend was not significant (P = 0.13). There was no evidence of any association between the number of years between the first and the last use of OCs and breast cancer incidence. In the subgroup of women with first-degree relatives with breast cancer, the RR for breast cancer associated with ever use of OCs was 1.51 (CI = 0.67-3.41), whereas in the remaining women, the RR was 0.97 (CI = 0.73-1.27). Ever-use of HRT compared with never-use was not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk in the multivariate analysis (RR = 0.99, CI = 0.68-1.43). Also, the number of years of HRT use was not associated with an increased breast cancer risk (trend P = 0.83), nor was the number of years between the first and the last use of HRT and breast cancer incidence. One subgroup of women in which the use of HRT seemed associated (but not significantly) with an increase in breast cancer risk was women with an induced menopause (RR = 1.72, CI = 0.95-3.12). The RR of breast cancer for women who had ever used both OCs and HRT, compared with women who never used these exogenous hormones was 1.00 (CI = 0.51-1.94). From this study, it cannot be concluded that the use of exogenous hormones is a strong risk factor for the development of postmenopausal breast cancer.\n      </p>", "It is well-known that married and cohabiting women differ in labour supply. But we know very little about the causes of this difference. Is it due to differences in characteristics, like age, presence and ages of children, own net wage rate, and net income of the partner? Or is it a difference in behaviour that -- even after controlling for variation in characteristics -- is the basic cause? In this article we try to answer these questions for Dutch married and cohabiting women. We use data of national surveys by Statistics Netherlands for 1989 and 1998. This also allows us to investigate whether there have been important changes in the last decade. Because we are able to compare the results with those of an analogous analysis that two of the authors did on similar Dutch data for 1981 we are able to draw conclusions about changes that took place over the last twenty years. The results show that the massive growth in female labour force participation is especially due to the growth in participation by married women. A slight decrease in labour market participation of cohabiting women can be observed in the last decade. This seems to be the result of cohabitation becoming more normal, including cohabitation when there are young children in the household. /// Les diff\u00e9rences d'activit\u00e9 entre femmes mari\u00e9es et cohabitantes sont bien connues mais on sait peu de choses sur les facteurs de ces diff\u00e9rences.

Control of these outbreaks in birds would probably lead to reduced transmission of the avian virus to humans. This study presents a mathematical model based on stochastic farm-to-farm transmission that incorporates flock size and spatial contacts to evaluate the impact of control strategies. Fit to data from the recent epidemic in the Netherlands, we evaluate the efficacy of control strategies and forecast avian influenza dynamics. Our results identify high-risk areas of spread by mapping of the farm level reproductive number. Results suggest that an immediate depopulation of infected flocks following an accurate and quick diagnosis would have a greater impact than simply depopulating surrounding flocks. Understanding the relative importance of different control measures is essential for response planning.\n      </p>", "En 1901, une coalition de partis chr\u00e9tiens remporte les \u00e9lections l\u00e9gislatives n\u00e9erlandaises.

Colonial issues were given a strategic dimension by the new government, which strongly advocated the \"moral reform\" of the Netherlands' colonial policy in the Far East. The \"ethical colonialpolicy\" (1901-c.1926), which was defended both by leaders of the conservative Christian parties and by members of the worker-led social-democratic movement, aimed at fulfilling the \"moral obligation\" of the metropolitan state towards the native population of the East Indies. By focussing on the \"moral education\" of the native Javanese, this article begins by summarizing the institutional and political developments that gave birth to this \"ethical policy\". It then examines a number of actions taken by the colonial state in Java concerning educational policy, medical and hygienic modernisation, prison reforms and political \"decentralization\". The article demonstrates how these public policies were seen as contributing to the \"moral reform\" of the native Javanese, by introducing them to a capitalist, bureaucratic and Christian \"modernity\"-a modernity ultimately deemed to be contradictory with political protest and Islamic mobilization.\n      </p>", "In 1974, the Netherlands Social and Cultural Planning Office developed an index to monitor and document living conditions over time: the LCI (Living Conditions Index). It is composed of indicators which reflect conditions in areas that are influenceable by government policy, such as housing, health, leisure activity, and ownership of consumer durables. Taken together, the indicators provide an objectified description of living conditions. The index has proved its value over the past two decades. It enables us to monitor how the different factors that influence living conditions interrelate and change over time. Education, income and employment are the key facilitating factors ('resources') for the achievement of good living conditions. The LCI also correlates with subjective satisfaction. New trends in society, and discussions about which indicators are appropriate have necessitated modifications to the index from time to time. In 1997, the index was updated and revised. At present, the SCP is developing a conceptual model that will link the Living Conditions Index to indices of livability, poverty and socioeconomic deprivation.\n      </p>", "Although previous studies have demonstrated that religious people in Europe have larger families, the role played by religious socialisation in the context of contemporary fertility behaviour has not yet been analysed in detail. This contribution specifically looks at the interrelation between religious socialisation and current religiosity and their impact on the transition to the third child for Dutch women. It is based on data of the first wave of the Netherlands Kinship Panel Study (2002-2004) and uses event history analysis. The transitions to first, second and third birth are modelled jointly with a control for unobserved heterogeneity. The findings provide evidence for an impact of women's current church attendance as well as religious socialisation measured by their fathers' religious affiliation, when they were teenagers. A religious family background remains influential even when a woman has stopped attending church. The effects of religious indicators strengthen over cohorts. Moreover, the combined religious make-up of the respondent's parents also significantly determines the progression to the third child. /// S'il est bien \u00e9tabli que les croyants en Europe ont plus d'enfants que les autres, le r\u00f4le de la socialisation religieuse dans le contexte de la f\u00e9condit\u00e9 contemporaine n'a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 analys\u00e9 \u00e0 ce jour.

A vast majority of the Dutch people does not attend church regularly and more than half its population is not affiliated with any church at all. In this study we set out to test which individual and contextual characteristics affect religious disaffiliation. We deduced several hypotheses from theories on social integration and rationalization. To test these hypotheses we used retrospective data containing information on events that took place in the lives of our respondents since adolescence. These data were analysed using a discrete-time event history model. We found that the higher the level of rationalization in a certain year, the more likely people were to disaffiliate. This effect was particularly strong for young people. Moreover, by introducing rationalization in the model we found a number of spurious relationships that at first glance seemed to be causal. Not surprisingly, respondents were more likely to disaffiliate in cases where their partners were nonreligious. However, as respondents and their partners presumably are effected equally by rationalization, we cannot but conclude that the process of rationalization is mainly responsible for the process of religious disaffiliation that takes place in The Netherlands.\n      </p>", "This paper reports laboratory experiments on dinitrogen fixation and denitrification for two small quaking fens (discharge fen and recharge fen) using the acetylene reduction assay and the acetylene inhibition technique, respectively. Nitrogenase activity was detected in peat muck and associated with Alnus glutinosa saplings throughout the study period (May-October 1987), whereas no activity was observed associated with Sphagnum species. The annual amount of dinitrogen fixed was estimated at 2.1 and 12.7 kg N/ha/y for the recharge fen and the discharge fen, respectively. Denitrification at ambient nitrate levels (0.1 ppm NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) was absent in the discharge fen and very low in the recharge fen (0.1 \u03bcg N/g/d, or 0.3 kg N/ha/y). In nitrate-amended soil samples denitrification rates were 2 to 3 orders of magnitude higher. It is argued that in situ denitrification rates in the fens studied will depend almost entirely on the nitrate supply by precipitation. Denitrification rates associated with precipitation are estimated at 1.1 kg N/ha/y for both fens.\n      </p>", "Background: The study describes variations in use of surgical procedures by community income in the Netherlands. From the literature it is known that surgical rates have a socioeconomic gradient. Both positive and negative associations of socioeconomic factors of patients (for example, income, education) with surgical rates have been reported. The question raised here is: how do (possible) socioeconomic variations in surgery in the Netherlands compare with variations observed elsewhere? Data and Methods: The data comprised Dutch hospital discharges and population estimates for 1999. Socioeconomic status was indicated by a patient's income and based on the average family income of the postcode area of residence. Poisson regression was used to compute relative incidence (odds ratios) for 10 common surgical procedures. The model included age, gender, degree of urbanisation, and province of residence. Results: The association between surgical rates and community level income is rather weak. For half of the surgical rates the authors observed higher utilisation rates in communities with low income levels, but the differences are small. The range of odds ratios in the lowest income quintile group (compared with the group with the highest income) observed is: 0.87 to 1.18. Men from a low income community received more appendicectomies (1.18), cholecystectomies (1.12), knee replacements (1.06), and prostatectomies (1.14) and less tonsillectomies (0.90). Women from a low income community received more appendicectomies (1.12), caesarean sections (1.18), hip and knee replacements (1.05, 1.17), and hysterectomies (1.14). Whereas they received less coronary artery bypass grafts (0.92), cholecystectomies (0.87), and tonsillectomies (0.92). Conclusions: Compared with findings reported in the international literature, this study indicates that variations in use of surgical procedures by community income in the Netherlands are comparatively small. Because of lack of data the authors could not study the influence of variations in need for surgical care by community income, but as the incidence of conditions requiring surgical interventions generally is higher in lower income groups, it is suspected some degree of underutilisation exists in these groups.\n      </p>", "We conducted the study described in this paper to investigate the impact of ambient temperature on mortality in the Netherlands during 1979-1997, the impact of heat waves and cold spells on mortality in particular, and the possibility of any heat wave- or cold spell-induced forward displacement of mortality. We found a V-like relationship between mortality and temperature, with an optimum temperature value (e.g., average temperature with lowest mortality rate) of 16.5\u00b0C for total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, respiratory mortality, and mortality among those \u2265 65 year of age. For mortality due to malignant neoplasms and mortality in the youngest age group, the optimum temperatures were 15.5\u00b0C and 14.5\u00b0C, respectively. For temperatures above the optimum, mortality increased by 0.47, 1.86, 12.82, and 2.72% for malignant neoplasms, cardiovascular disease, respiratory diseases, and total mortality, respectively, for each degree Celsius increase above the optimum in the preceding month. For temperatures below the optimum, mortality increased 0.22, 1.69, 5.15, and 1.37%, respectively, for each degree Celsius decrease below the optimum in the preceding month. Mortality increased significantly during all of the heat waves studied, and the elderly were most effected by extreme heat. The heat waves led to increases in mortality due to all of the selected causes, especially respiratory mortality. Average total excess mortality during the heat waves studied was 12.1%, or 39.8 deaths/day. The average excess mortality during the cold spells was 12.8% or 46.6 deaths/day, which was mostly attributable to the increase in cardiovascular mortality and mortality among the elderly. The results concerning the forward displacement of deaths due to heat waves were not conclusive. We found no cold-induced forward displacement of deaths.\n      </p>", "This paper analyses the role of partisan politics in determining the local tax burden. Property taxes are the most important revenue source which municipalities in the Netherlands can decide upon themselves. Using a new data set on Dutch local property taxes in 1996, it is concluded that municipalities with a council dominated by left wing parties have a higher tax burden. We also find that larger coalitions have lower levels of taxation. Finally, tax exporting increases tax rates.\n      </p>", "Within a long-term research project studying the biogeochemical budget of an oak-beech forest ecosystem in the eastern part of the Netherlands, the nitrogen transformations and solute fluxes were determined in order to trace the fate of atmospherically deposited NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and to determine the contribution of nitrogen transformations to soil acidification. The oak-beech forest studied received an annual input of nitrogen via throughfall and stemflow of 45 kg N ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; yr&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, mainly as NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, whereas 8 kg N ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; yr&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; was taken up by the canopy. Due to the specific hydrological regime resulting in periodically occurring high groundwater levels, denitrification was found to be the dominant output flux (35 kg N ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; yr&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O emmission rate measurements indicated that 57% of this gaseous nitrogen loss (20 kg N ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; yr&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) was as N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The forest lost an annual amount of 11 kg N ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; yr&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; via streamwater output, mainly as NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;. Despite the acid conditions, high nitrification rates were measured. Nitrification occurred mainly in the litter layer and in the organic rich part of the mineral soil and was found to be closely correlated with soil temperature. The large amount of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; deposited on the forest floor via atmospheric deposition and produced by mineralization was to a large extent nitrified in the litter layer. Almost no NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; reached the subsurface soil horizons. The NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; was retained, taken up or transformed mainly in the mineral soil. A small amount of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; (9 kg N ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; yr&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) was removed from the system in streamwater output. A relatively small amount of nitrogen was measured in the soil water as Dissolved Organic Nitrogen. On the basis of these data the proton budget of the system was calculated using two different approaches. In both cases net proton production rates were high in the vegetation and in the litter layer of the forest ecosystem. Nitrogen transformations induced a net proton production rate of 2.4 kmol ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; yr&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the soil compartment.\n      </p>", "The last decade provides strong indications of an expansion in shadow economic activities in the Netherlands Antilles.

It has a high water table and sometimes even winter inundations, hence no trees or buildings, which are found along the edges.

This situation is now being changed with improved drainage, increased fertilization, earlier mowing, and higher cattle densities. Meadow-bird reserves can be recreated by imitating traditional methods and by keeping high water tables using dams and sluices. Meadow-bird management can be encouraged, for example, by financial compensation to private farmers for late mowing. Technically, we know how our meadow-bird populations can be preserved and managed; keeping them is mostly a political and financial matter.

The changing housing policies and the developing structures of social housing finance are analysed. These factors have contributed to the decline in social housing construction in the UK and the Netherlands. In particular, the desire of governments in both countries to cut public capital expenditure on housing and increase the role of private capital in new construction reduced the output during the 1980s. In the UK, a tight monetarist policy was adopted with the aim of keeping inflation down. This can be seen as a major cause of declining levels of public expenditure on housing production. In the Netherlands, a more significant role, compared to the UK, seems to have been played by developments on the housing market, especially the real estate crisis in 1978-1982. In both countries, the outlook for investment in social housing is gloomy.\n      </p>", "This paper discusses the causes of the current wave of renewal and relocation of football stadiums in the Netherlands and tries to shed some light on the changing form and location of Dutch football stadiums. Comparison with developments in the United Kingdom shows not only remarkable resemblances and mutual influences, but also some significant differences. In an inextricable upward spiral of causes and consequences such as recent successes of clubs and the national team, rising attendances, increasingly positive media attention, rising interests of commercial investors, new international and national requirements on stadium construction and an increasingly positive attitude of municipalities, a new wave of stadium redevelopment and relocation has emerged in the Netherlands.

The port of Rotterdam, and the companies operating the pipelines linking Rotterdam with its hinterland, have suffered significant setbacks. Oil refiners have found it essential to re-appraise their European production systems, and refineries in the Netherlands have necessarily been included in the resultant restructuring programmes. These programmes have involved both cutbacks and investment, and there is evidence that the industry is now much fitter than in the early 1980s. However, success in overcoming major difficulties does not reflect restructuring alone.

The probability of having hypertension was lower if blood pressure was measured at more than one point in time (Odds ratio 0\u00b744 (OR) (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0\u00b738, 0\u00b751) for men and 0\u00b747 (0\u00b741, 0\u00b754) for women, and if the study was carried out more recently (OR 0\u00b792 (0\u00b791, 0\u00b793) per year). The probability was higher if the study was carried out in a general practice (OR 1\u00b714 (1\u00b703, 1\u00b727) for men and 1\u00b752 (1\u00b736, 1\u00b769) for women). The inclusion of treated people as hypertensive yields contradictory results for men and women. Conclusions - The strong variation in prevalence is explained by methodology and by a period effect indicating a decrease of the prevalence of hypertension over time. Whether this decrease is true or caused by confounding due to unknown or unreported methodological variation over time is unknown. For future studies, a standardised method could reduce the influence of methodological variables and thereby the variation in reported prevalences.\n      </p>", "This paper examines the availability of housing in Israel and The Netherlands. Both are small, densely populated countries where land and planning policies affect housing supply significantly. The differences in house prices and densities between the two countries are due to the way land and planning policy is pursued. In The Netherlands, policies are used actively to ensure a plentiful supply of cheap land for housing, whereas in Israel severe restrictions are placed on the transfer of land into housing use. The comparison highlights the effects of policy choices and questions the effects of those choices on access to housing in the future.\n      </p>", "The establishment of mosques is an incentive for public discussions on Islam and the presence of Muslims in Western European societies. This article critically reconstructs Public Policy discourses on mosque establishment in the Dutch city of Rotterdam. It shows how urban-planning discourses, and their specific frames, which came to dominate mosque establishment as a policy issue in Rotterdam from the 1980s onwards, created their own set of meanings. The article analyses these discourses in terms of their enabling and constraining roles during a period in which local authorities became more involved in the improvement and placement of new mosques in the Rotterdam area. On the one hand, the urban renewal framework allowed for a substantial improvement in the housing of Islamic religious and cultural practice. On the other hand, urban planning policy discursive practices gave less attention to issues such as visibility and presence that are now at the heart of the heated debates about Muslim populations in Dutch society. More recent discussions on the aesthetics and location of mosques in Rotterdam illustrate how these dominant discourses are not only contestable but are also being contested from all quarters.\n      </p>", "Within the framework of the Dutch 'Network Ecological Monitoring', a large set of new permanent plots has been established to monitor selected plant communities throughout The Netherlands for studying the effects of environmental changes on species composition of semi-natural communities. This national programme will also make use of pre-existing permanent plots. These plots reflect the long and comprehensive history of research using permanent plots in The Netherlands, where the first permanent plots were established in the early 1930s. To enhance the usefulness of pre-existing permanent plots, a comprehensive permanent plot database was compiled. This database was derived from the Dutch National Vegetation Database, that was established for the recent vegetation classification of The Netherlands. This was supplemented with information from various organizations and a number of individual researchers. Currently, the permanent plot database contains ca. 6000 permanent plots. More than 2500 of these plots have been sampled at least 5\u00d7, and ca. 1500 plots at least 10\u00d7. Most of the plots are from grasslands, followed by forests and dune systems. This database not only provides insight into vegetation succession, fluctuations within plant communities over time, and the effects of changes of the environment on the vegetation but, indirectly, it also offers the possibility of studying the long-term behaviour of individual plant species (e.g. establishment, competition, longevity). For the Network Ecological Monitoring a selection of these (historical) plots will be added to the new network of permanent plots in The Netherlands, thus supplying information of past vegetation conditions.\n      </p>", "From the Netherlands four desmid species are newly described: Cosmarium calculus, C. jugatum, C. medioretusum and Roya closterioides. The names of eight taxa are newly given or recombined: Closterium tortitaenioides, Euastrum biscrobiculatum, Staurastrum crassangulatum, S. hirsutum var. arnellii, S. reductum, Staurodesmus cuspidatus var. divergens, Std. extensus var. malaccensis and Std. incus var. indentatus. Taxonomic affinities, habitat characteristics and regional distribution data are dealt with.\n      </p>", "Colonization success of woodland originating after 1850 was determined for seventeen forest plant species having different dispersal strategies. Colonization rate of the studied endo-and exozoochorous species apparently was considerable higher than that of species having short distance dispersal like myrmecochores and species lacking dispersal mechanisms. The occurrence of eight species in this young forest habitat was related to the distance to the nearest source patch (DNS), as well as to the age of the young patches and to their former land use. DNS calculated to old, existent and occupied source patches affected most analysed species. Only Ilex aquifolium L. had a significant higher occurrence in woodland originating before 1916 than in those originating after 1916. Former land use showed significant effects for three species. Although colonization rate and effects of studied parameters on occurrence were different for the studied species, no clear differences were found between different dispersal groups. The consequences of these results for the understanding of colonization processes of the species studied is discussed.\n      </p>", "The province North Brabant consists of 5083 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; between 40 m above and 1.5 m below sea level. Most of the land is in intensive agricultural use. Nature reserves consist of dune sands, heath, moorland pools and woods on very poor soils, bogs, low productive (wet) grasslands, stream valleys and a (former) estuary. There are 845 records of twenty charophyte species from 1986-1999. The majority of records were made in a small transition zone between the Pleistocene sand and loam area and the river and sea clay areas. Also the larger number of species (17) was found here. In the transition zone water quality varies considerably, due to the presence of seepage water of various age and origin. Some species are common to the Pleistocene area and the transition zone, others are common to the transition zone and both clay areas. At the loamy part of the Pleistocene area some species occur that grow in the transition zone and in the river clay area as well. In the dug off moor charophytes are only found at the edges of the area. In the former estuary, now a brackish lake, some species preferring slightly brackish to brackish water were found. Quite often charophytes are ephemeral, more so in shallow, eutrophic, and standing water, less so in opposite conditions. Charophytes are not protected by law. They may profit from conservation of rich sites and from nature improvement measures like digging pools for amphibians, restoration of moorland pools and removal of fertilised top soil. Charophytes may suffer from measures that have side effects such as reduction of surface water or deterioration of water quality.\n      </p>", "The vegetation of road verges in the coastal dune area of the Netherlands was surveyed phytosociologically. Nine plant communities have been distinguished. They belong to the Ammophiletea, Koelerio-Corynephoretea, Molinio-Arrhenatheretea, Plantaginetea majoris and Artemisietea vulgaris. Most plant communities appear to be fragmentarily developed and have thus been described by the so-called deductive method. Vegetation in road verges often appears to be heterogeneous. Species composition is influenced by man, distance from the sea, fertility and moisture content of the soil. It is clearly correlated with total nitrogen, magnesium and organic matter. Therophytes are preponderant; these and sclerophytes indicate the dry environment. The majority of the species are apophytes.\n      </p>", "We investigate which subsidiary roles are assigned by Japanese multinational firms to their manufacturing affiliates in the Netherlands in 1998, using the subsidiary role framework of White and Poynter (1984) and adaptations of it by Birkinshaw and Morrison (1995). Of the 24 subsidiaries responding to the survey, eleven were identified as miniature replicas, five as product specialists, three as strategic independents, three as marketing satellites, and two as rationalized manufacturers.\n      </p>", "We use a unique data source to examine postimmigration investments in education among four immigrant groups in the Netherlands. We derive hypotheses from the Immigrant Human Capital Investment model (IHCI), which argues that immigrants 'investments are an outcome of settlement intentions, skill transferability, and opportunity costs. The multinomial and ordered logistic regression analyses show that educational investments are stronger among immigrants with higher premigration education, immigrants from former colonies, immigrants who migrated for family reasons, and immigrants who arrived in periods of high unemployment. These findings generally support the IHCI model.\n      </p>", "In the Netherlands, interest in the USA as a historical cultural phenomenon and as a source of examples of product design in particular has been very slight. Dutch publications on the importance of American design and the ideas and professional practice of designers in the world's largest industrial nation of the twentieth century are a fraction of those on European modernist design culture.\u00b2 As a result, most overviews of the history of design in the Netherlands contain no mention whatsoever of the substantial American influence on Dutch industrial design during the period of this study.\u00b3 This article examines the importance of commercial American design for the Dutch design world during this period. It does so largely by reference to the design of technologically innovative domestic products, in particular electrical household products. The USA was able to build up and export a part of its own cultural identity with these new kinds of goods at the beginning of the twentieth century. This article takes as its case study the design of the products made during the interwar years by Erres, which was from 1930 until 1945 the Netherlands' largest manufacturer of electrical household goods. Finally, this article analyses the reasons why Dutch design histories have been only superficially interested in Dutch Americana.\n      </p>", "Integrated dual disorder treatment (IDDT), an evidence-based practice for people with severe mental illness and co-occurring substance dependence, is based on several key principles. This article compares implementation facilitators and challenges between IDDT teams in Ohio and the Netherlands for several items: stage-wise group interventions, participation in alcohol and drug self-help groups, the role of the psychiatrist, and the provision of supervision. Implementation efforts for IDDT have been moving ahead in Ohio since its introduction in 1999. The Netherlands introduced IDDT in 2004. Researchers from the Trimbos Institute in Utrecht have been working with consultants from the Ohio Substance Abuse Mental Illness Coordinating Center of Excellence at Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, to learn about facilitators and challenges related to implementing IDDT.\n      </p>", "The article explains the relation between the public insurance system and the costs of nursing homes in The Netherlands. In order to analyze this relation, the developments of costs of nursing homes in the seventies and eighties are decomposed. Furthermore, changes in costs are related to policy and insurance changes in The Netherlands during the same period. Conclusions are drawn on the potentials of policy instruments to control real cost developments. The main determinant of real cost development, the wage costs per working year, seems hard to control. Some success, however, is made in controlling other determinants, notably the development in use and various aspects of material costs. Gegenstand des vorliegenden Beitrags ist die Entwicklung der Aufwendungen f\u00fcr Pflegeheimunterbringung im Rahmen des Sozialversicherungssystems der Niederlande. F\u00fcr eine eingehendere Analyse wurde die Entwicklung der realen Pflegeheimkosten f\u00fcr die 70er und 80er Jahre nach den wichtigsten Kostenkomponenten aufgeschl\u00fcsselt sowie zu den im gleichen Zeitraum in den Niederlanden eingetretenen sozialpolitischen und versicherungsrechtlichen \u00c4nderungen in Beziehung gesetzt. Auf dieser Grundlage konnte die Eignung verschiedener Politikinstrumente zur Kostensteuerung abgesch\u00e4tzt werden. Dabei erwiesen sich die Lohnkosten pro Besch\u00e4ftigten, die die Haupteinflu\u00dfgr\u00f6\u00dfe der Gesamtkostenentwicklung darstellen, als nur schwer beeinflu\u00dfbar.

This network matches with the policy-structure in Dutch administration. One of the planning offices, the Social and Cultural Planning Office (SCP), studies social and cultural aspects. Most of the SCP publications deal with several different aspects of the living conditions. As an integrative tool the SCP developed an overall monitoring instrument: the living conditions index (LCI). The LCI measures aspects of individual living conditions and is composed of indicators from eight areas: housing, health, leisure activity, ownership of consumer durables, sport activity, vacation, social participation and mobility. Education, income and paid employment are considered as resources and are used to describe the backgrounds of living conditions. Not only developments in living conditions for the Netherlands as a whole are monitored, but for various groups in society as well.

Wetlands along the rivers Dommel (The Netherlands), Zwarte Beek (Belgium) and Biebrza (NE Poland). Assessment of external input and output fluxes as well as net N-mineralization rates. Annual N- and P-balances were estimated by the sum of all external input and output fluxes: atmospheric deposition, input of dissolved matter by flooding, input of sediment by flooding, input by groundwater, output by leaching, output by hay-making and for N also input by N2-fixation. For N we also estimated net annual N-availability for plant growth, i.e. the N-budget, which includes net mineralization in soil. The studied wetland sites had a negative balance, which means that nutrients are depleted but only if mown annually, except for the Dutch/Belgian fens which had an equilibrium N-balance and the Polish fen which had an equilibrium P-balance. For the N-budget it appeared that atmospheric deposition added significantly to the budget of Dutch/ Belgian fens and N-mineralization added significantly to fen and floodplain budgets, except for the Polish fens. Mineralization dominates the N-budget of the western European floodplains. Hay-making is the most important output pathway, particularly if practised annually. It seems to diminish N-enrichment in the Dutch fens and floodplains. We conclude that western European fens and floodplains as well as Polish floodplains have a significant positive N-budget indicating that there is a surplus of N for plant growth. In the Polish fens this is less due to low atmospheric deposition and lower N-mineralization rates. The latter is associated with less drying out of the studied Polish ecosystems in summer. Our approach, although an approximate quantification, is helpful for assessing priorities focused on nutrient management.\n      </p>"], "words": {"all": {"number": 1, "prob": 8.281264880397832e-06},
