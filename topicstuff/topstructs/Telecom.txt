Only 35% of the total demand for telecom equipment in the country is met by domestic production. This is not favourable to long-term sustained growth of the telecom sector. The country is also far behind in R&amp;D spending when compared to other leading countries. India needs to see an increase in R&amp;D investment, industry-academiagovernment partnership, better quality doctoral education and incentives to entrepreneurs for start-ups in telecom equipment manufacturing.\n      </p>", "This paper analyses the procedures used by different European countries for awarding spectrum licences to potential operators of third generation (3G) mobile telephone networks. We contrast market-based methods, such as auctions, with bureaucratic methods, such as 'beauty contests'. They have been used for decisions about two major questions: (1) How many licences should be awarded, and how much spectrum should each licence give access to?; (2) Which companies should receive which licences, and how much should they pay for their licences? Most countries used a bureaucratic process to answer the first question. However, Germany, Austria and Greece were different, and constructed auctions in which the number and size of licences were determined by the auction itself. As for the second question, there was much variation between countries, and both auctions, and 'beauty contests' were popular methods. We have four main findings. First, the bureaucratic procedure used by most countries to answer the first question led to companies concealing relevant information from the authorities. Second, while firms may have tried to manipulate the procedures used in Germany, Austria and Greece to deter entry to their markets, they were surprisingly unsuccessful in this. Third, the traditional economic criticisms of beauty contests seem to apply to some, but not to all those that were conducted. Finally, the bidding strategies adopted by the telecom companies were often more complex than those predicted by economic theory.\n      </p>", "This paper addresses a number of issues arising from the growth of telecom services in India since the mid-1990s. It also discusses a number of spillover effects for the rest of the economy and one of the more important effects is the potential to develop a major manufacturing hub in the country for telecom equipment and for downstream industries such as semiconductor devices. The telecom industry in India could slowly become an example of the service sector acting as a fillip to the growth of the manufacturing sector.\n      </p>", "This paper provides a historical overview of China\u2019s telecom development since market reform.

In view of Taiwan's achievements in economics and democratic politics since the early 1980s, we think it can serve as a significant model for other developing countries in the world. Several controversies involving privatization are discussed with respect to the case of Chunghwa Telecom Company, a critical example of privatization in Taiwan. To highlight the process of Chunghwa Telecom's privatization, we conducted in-depth interviews. The major findings include: 1. privatization improves efficiency under some conditions; 2. privatization can facilitate organizational competitiveness, however the organizational atmosphere and culture should be considered; 3. lack of accountability during privatization leads to corruption; and 4. privatization tends to disregard the public interest if the government fails to recognize its changed function.\n      </p>", "Some critical issues in telecom policy calling for immediate attention and action if telecom services are to be for the maximum good of users of these services.\n      </p>", "Telecom policies should be developed to foster the positive effects of network externalities, which enable the building up of a critical mass of users for services, thus motivating further growth.\n      </p>", "The growth in urban telephone services in India seen since 1999 has not been matched by growth in rural telephony, leading to a widening digital divide in the country.

Some of the important ones are discussed here.\n      </p>", "This paper reviews the reorganization of Thailand's telecommunications markets from the late 1980s up to the present with emphasis on the changes that have occurred during the current Thaksin administration. We take an interest group approach to analysing Thai telecom politics. Our view is that the main interested parties will have the greatest influence on policy and that policy outcomes will therefore reflect the goals of those groups. Currently, the telecom policy landscape in Thailand is characterized by the leading position held by the country's private sector telecom firms. Support for these companies and their goals has become the driving force behind telecom policy and has replaced the more bureaucratic-led policy-making of the last decade. While the newly dominant coalition of private sector telecom operators can be seen as supporting the completion of the privatization of Thailand's public sector telecommunications organizations, they are not likely to support the creation of the fully competitive telecom markets envisioned during past administrations. We therefore argue that oligopoly-structured markets similar to those which already exist for fixed-line and mobile telephony services will be the likely endpoint of Thailand's current telecom liberalization phase.\n      </p>", "Nowhere in the world has a government telecom department and an incumbent telephone company submitted itself willingly to demonopolisation. Concerned government functionaries, employees and their unions and populist parties and politicians have opposed demonopolisation. But notwithstanding the cacophony, determined and clear-headed ministers acting in the public interest have been demonopolising telecom. They see telecom as electronic and photonic infrastructure for transportation of dematerialised, electronified information (voice, text, image and data). It should be ubiquitous, broad-band, high-speed and inexpensive. Only a multi-policy of competing companies can ensure this. India must put in peace such a policy, ignoring vested interests, and institute an objective sector regulator with enough teeth.\n      </p>", "Market forces and rapid technological developments have contributed to the phenomenal growth of telecom services in India, which however, remain concentrated in urban areas.

The reforms may result in a better service for business users but are unlikely to benefit the majority of users or lead to any major expansion of the telecom network. The high fees quoted in the tenders for basic service are illusory and are transfers that the Department of Telecommunications is making out of its own revenue to private operators. The tariffs for the majority of consumers are bound to go up sharply as a result of such transfers.\n      </p>", "Fragmenting the existing physical telecom network or building parallel networks in the name of competition is a disastrous policy prescription at this stage of the country's development. Given our immediate development targets and scarce national resources, a rational policy should have looked at the basic issues confronting us-how to provide cheaper telecom access, rural telephone services and modern data communication to industry.

Our results suggest that telecoms regulation has not been captured in an overall sense, although there is an heterogeneous pattern of regulatory events. The results are consistent with recent observations of Spiller and Vogelsang, who argue that the regulatory framework for UK t\u00e9l\u00e9coms is designed to maintain substantial checks on the regulator's discretion, operating mainly through the rule of law. Our broad conclusion is that the impacts of regulation indicate a relatively soft attitude to British Telecom up to 1995, when a tightening of regulation tended to offset the previous bias.\n      </p>", "Telecom service providers are required to obtain a licence before starting any kind of service in India. They pay a certain percentage of their revenue as a licence fee to the government on a quarterly basis and the percentage of revenue to be shared depends on the type of service offered and the area of operation. This article argues that such a differential system of licensing is flawed and leads to cross subsidisation and possible arbitrage. It estimates the impact on individual operators and the government's revenue, in case the government implements a uniform licence fee for all services in each area and also argues for a reduction in the licence fee in line with revenue growth.\n      </p>", "This study raises two basic questions. How is competition in telecom and electricity governed? What explains the considerable differences in their governance regimes? To answer these questions the study compares the economic and technological characteristics of the sectors; deconstructs the telecom sector into two micro-regimes (terminal type-approval and networks interconnection) and the electricity sector into three (generation, transmission, distribution); defines intergovernmentalism, supranationalism, liberalism, and \u00e9tatism for each of the five segments of the sectors; distinguishes three different kinds of competition -- deregulated competition, regulation-of-competion, and regulation-for-competition; and deconstructs the European policy game into three different games (sectorial, national, and union). The European Union's policy choices are: supranational governance in telecom and intergovernmental governance in electricity. The introduction of competition as an administrative process leaves considerable room for entrepreneurship and political choice by European nation-states and strengthens their regulation capacities. Differences in the governance regime for telecom and electricity are explained by a state-centered multi-level approach.\n      </p>", "The Athreya Committee was set up last year to recommend an appropriate organisational structure for telecom operations. This article reviews the recommendations it has made, the objections which have been raised and the pros and cons of the alternative proposed and concludes by proposing a third alternative model.\n      </p>", "The telecom industry is a decreasing cost industry. Moreover, it plays a crucial role in national security and cultural development because most of the ' command and control' messages and interpersonal dialogues are passed on through telemedia. For these reasons, this industry had been, or is still being run as a state-monopoly almost in every country of the world. However, due to absence of competitive forces in national markets, productive inefficiencies were quite vivid in many cases. Consequently, some developed countries opened up their telecom markets for competition. Expectedly, the experience was reasonably successful. As a result, almost all the remaining countries including Pakistan are following the suite. It is, however, interesting to note that competition in this industry has different connotation. A new entrant in this industry first has to have interconnection links with one or more of its rivals, only then it can compete meaningfully. But an incumbent operator that usually possesses enough market power hardly grants interconnection privileges to the new entrant. Hence, the need for a regulatory body can hardly be undermined. The main function of this body should be to facilitate fair interconnection deals that ensure a reasonable rate of return to all efficient operators, minimum possible prices of telecom services to end users and, most importantly, a respectable growth rate for this industry. To make sure that the regulatory body keep performing in the best' public interest', it is desirable that either an advisory body is set up to review the decisions of the regulatory body, or open forums/hearings are arranged to solicit public opinion on critical issues.\n      </p>", "This paper explores the effects of privatization, competition, and regulation on telecommunications performance in 30 African and Latin American countries from 1984 through 1997. Fixed-effects regressions reveal that competition-measured by mobile operators not owned by the incumbent-is correlated with increases in the per capita number of mainlines, payphones, and connection capacity, and with decreases in the price of local calls. Privatization combined with an independent regulator is positively correlated with telecom performance measures. Privatization alone, however, is associated with few benefits, and is negatively correlated with connection capacity.\n      </p>", "The article presents a narrative of technological change, privatization, and globalization as they have affected Brazil's telecommunications industry. It is divided into three parts: A) A brief account of process of privatization in the telecom industry in Brazil; B) An analysis of the changes in work and employment relations in the industry; and C) A discussion of the implications of these changes for unions, focusing on problems they face and the strategies they are adopting to overcome their difficulties.

(CHT), applies heuristics to plan synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) network architecture and evolution. Planning SDH networks is complex and must be done quickly because of keen competition and rapid changes in telecommunications. A flexible, easy-to-use, state-of-the-art planning tool is needed. SDHTOOL simplifies the planning process, selecting the most appropriate network architecture in terms of cost and survivability. It helps planners to achieve global optimization, ensuring that networks meet service and protection objectives economically and maintain compatibility between new and old equipment during the transition. Compared to conventional labor-intensive planning, SDHTOOL reduces planning time and cuts costs 15 to 33 percent.\n      </p>", "The purpose of the paper is to analyse the direct economic costs of technology import in one of the important components of the telecom equipment industry, viz, the switching equipment industry. It also analyses the efforts made by the state-owned ITI towards absorbing imported technology and developing local capabilities. The analysis shows that successive imports have been effected at a high cost and its subsequent assimilation has been extremely tardy with the result that technological dependence in the industry has been extremely high. Though the industry has one of the highest research intensities, much of the R and D effort has gone towards adaptation of the inappropriate technologies that have been imported. The country has moved across the technological frontier but this has been done without properly absorbing previously imported technologies. Development of local capabilities consistent with the usage pattern existing in the country has received serious attention only with the creation of C-DOT.\n      </p>", "Theory: Gradual denationalization of state-owned-enterprises (SOEs) is premised on the theory that increasing levels of market exposure, regulation, and public reporting will improve both the market and social values that democracies cherish. Similar theories inform market-based approaches to public service delivery more generally. Hypotheses: As market exposure increases, rates of productivity, capitalization, and profitability will increase significantly. As price controls grow broader and more stringent, rates of capitalization and productivity will increase, but profitability rates will be significantly lower. As market exposure increases, and whenever performance measures are publicly reported, service quality will increase. As price controls become broader and more stringent, service quality will decrease significantly. Methods: We use ARIMA time-series analysis to assess the impact between 1982 and 1993 of three policy initiatives central to the gradual privatizing of British Telecom (BT): changes in the extent of BT's private ownership, in the breadth and stringency of price controls applied to it, and in the reporting of service quality measures to the public. Results: Neither the claims of privatization proponents regarding market values nor of opponents regarding social values appear totally justified. The gradual exposure of service delivery to market discipline risks the ascendancy of market over social values. This can be attenuated, however, if the latter are explicitly linked to performance measures that are routinely reported to the public. ARIMA analysis affords a way to avoid the \"apples and oranges\" comparisons of public versus private service delivery mechanisms.\n      </p>", "This article provides a microfoundation for the rise in optimism that seems to precede market crashes. Small, young markets are more likely to experience stock-price run-ups and crashes. We use a Zeira-Rob type of model in which demand size is uncertain. Optimism then grows rationally if traders' prior distribution over market size has a decreasing hazard. Such prior beliefs are appropriate if most new markets are duds and only a few reach a large size. The crash occurs when capacity outstrips demand. As an illustration, for the period 1971-2001 we fit the model to the Telecom sector.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Cet article s'int\u00e9resse \u00e0 la question des relations d'emploi durables et se propose de d\u00e9montrer la pertinence du paradigme du don/contre-don de Mauss (2003) pour lire et comprendre les r\u00e9glages de ces relations et l'engagement des individus inscrits \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur.

US patent statistics on the four industry leaders - Ericsson, Motorola, Nokia and Qualcomm - illustrate the growing trend of the internationalization of R&amp;&amp;D over the 1990s, yet we show that the most critical R&amp;&amp;D projects related to the development of wireless standards remain homebound. The paper then leverages qualitative data collected through interviews with informed managers to provide a fresh interpretation for the homeboundedness of critical industrial R&amp;&amp;D: the stickiness of core R&amp;&amp;D projects to domestic locations is related not only to organizational inertia and the unripe maturation of subsidiaries, as suggested by prior literature, but particularly to the headquarters centralization of intellectual property (IP) management, which offers a high level of appropriability of R&amp;&amp;D results. The unequal distribution of appropriability across corporate R&amp;&amp;D networks is at the base of the formation of safe nests, domestic R&amp;&amp;D centers that are sheltered from the forces of globalization because they offer a desirable setting for the exploitation of technologies deriving from a stronger coordination of inventive activities with the management of IP.\n      </p>", "Companies' interest in customer relationship modelling and key issues such as customer lifetime value and churn has substantially increased over the years. However, the complexity of building, interpreting and applying these models creates obstacles for their implementation. The main contribution of this paper is to show how domain knowledge can be incorporated in the data mining process for churn prediction, viz. through the evaluation of coefficient signs in a logistic regression model, and secondly, by analysing a decision table (DT) extracted from a decision tree or rule-based classifier. An algorithm to check DTs for violations of monotonicity constraints is presented, which involves the repeated application of condition reordering and table contraction to detect counter-intuitive patterns. Both approaches are applied to two telecom data sets to empirically demonstrate how domain knowledge can be used to ensure the interpretability of the resulting models.\n      </p>", "The paper has three purposes. First, it explains how the impact of liberalization of service sectors on output growth differs from that of liberalization of trade in goods. Second, it suggests a policy-based rather than outcome-based measure of the openness of a country's services regime. Such openness measures are constructed for two key service sectors, basic telecommunications and financial services. Finally, it provides some econometric evidence-relatively strong for the financial sector and less strong, but nevertheless statistically significant, for the telecommunications sector-that openness in services influences long run growth performance. Our estimates suggest that countries with fully open telecom and financial services sectors grow up to 1.5 percentage points faster than other countries.\n      </p>", "Telecommunications are witnessing the infusion of disruptive technologies.

By minimising transport cost it has reinforced the importance of economic principles like comparative advantage.

The concern is typically voiced in one of two claims: (1) there is an incentive for an incumbent to use a price squeeze when access prices are set above long-run incremental cost; or (2) prices set at that cost are preferred for interconnection because they eliminate incentives for a price squeeze. In principle, form (1) is generally true (Proposition 1), but form (2) is generally not (Proposition 2), The proof of these Propositions reveals why pricing access at long-run incremental cost coupled with appropriate price floors in the down-stage market does eliminate the incentive to squeeze.\n      </p>", "Where rival firms compete in a network industry, compatibility among all firms maximizes the size, density, and total value of the network by combining rivals into a single network.

Divestitures of state owned corporations in the UK and elsewhere were implemented by right wing parties with the over-arching objective to defeat trade unions. The producitivity and welfare changes were modest or negligible, sometimes negative. Why reformers of the left support privatization? The paper suggests that efficiency motivations are weaker than usually said by a mostly biased privatization empirical literature and by free-market apologetics. The reason lies in the nature of the privatized coroporation, wich is very far from a competitive enterprise. The paper conjectures that the centre-left seeks by its support to privatization to gain political rents. This implies to surrender financial rents to the globalized financial actors, to be paid out by political support or neutrality to centre-left governments. This strategy is at high risk of be captured by the financial \u00e8lites and poses a threat to democracy. A state without ownership, with a marginal role in service provision, becomes a tax -and -transfer, law -and -order state, with little democratic legitimacy. Public provision of services should be reformed as an explicit social inclusion mechanism, based on clearly stated policy goals and involvement of users. The Eu should not adopt a rigid privatization-liberalization-regulation paradygm, and should instead build on flexible tools to achieve common goals in terms of citizens' access to those services that have a community-building content.\n      </p>", "Liberalized countries that allow competition in international telecommunications favor traffic re-routing practices as arbitrage against foreign monopolists. This view is seriously incomplete. Monopolists, allied with carriers in liberalized countries, can use these practices to reduce termination payments to nonalliance carriers-thereby harming also consumers in liberalized countries-by gaming regulations that require equal termination rates at both ends and 'proportional return' (the monopolist's traffic is allocated among carriers in proportion to their shares of traffic to its country). We also present a simple bilateral settlements reform that eliminates gaming incentives and other proportional-return distortions, yet benefits both countries.\n      </p>", "The paper describes the use of logico-linguistic modelling, a logically enhanced version of Soft System Methodology, to identify the information needed to support decisions made in a marketing department of a Hong Kong telecommunications company.

In this Article we explore the extent to which antitrust can continue to serve as a source of access mandates following the Supreme Court's 2004 Verizon Communications Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP decision. Although Trinko sharply criticized access remedies and antitrust court's ability to enforce them, it is not yet clear whether future courts will interpret the opinion as barring all antitrust access claims. Even more importantly, the opinion contains language hinting at possible bases for differentiating among different types of access, in contrast to previous analyses, which have generally grouped all of the forms of access into a single category. We build upon this language to offer an analytical framework that captures the manner in which different components of a network can interact with one another as parts of a complex system. Our analysis also offers a basis for classifying the different types of access into five categories: retail, wholesale, interconnection, platform, and unbundled. We then employ this framework to analyze a range of policy and doctrinal issues, including the current debate over network neutrality.\n      </p>", "China and India have one of the largest telecommunications equipment markets in the world. This paper employs the sectoral system of innovation framework for understanding the differential outcomes in innovation capability building in the industry achieved by China and India. The two countries have pursued widely diverging strategies for developing their domestic innovation capability. India followed a very rigid policy of indigenous development of domestic technologies by establishing a stand-alone public laboratory that developed state-of-the-art switching technologies. The public laboratory was not given any strategic direction, even though it was technologically speaking, very competent. Consequently, the country, despite possessing good quality human resources was unable to keep pace with changes in the technology frontier and the equipment industry has now become essentially dominated by affiliates of MNCs. China, on the contrary, first depended on MNCs for her technology needs in this area. But subsequently encouraged the emergence of three national champions, two of which are erstwhile public laboratories. The country has built up considerable hardware capability in both fixed line and mobile communications technology and has also emerged as a major player in world markets.\n      </p>", "The importance of state support for industrial R and D in literature fails to take cognisance of the contextual specificity of late industrialising economies. The problem of inadequate investment in technology by domestic firms, engaged primarily in 'technology catch-up', is rooted in their dependence on technologically advanced foreign firms and their inability to break down non-technological barriers to entry in the product market. Through a comparative narrative of technology development under state support in India and China, this paper seeks to provide some evidence on the need to be sensitive to the stage of technological development, and the nature of industry in designing policies of state support for industrial R and D for effective intervention.\n      </p>", "We consider the effect of government-owned telecommunications providers on privately owned rivals by comparing the presence of private telecommunications services providers alongside municipal competitors in the US telecommunications industry from 1999 through 2002. Our primary finding is that the presence of a municipal provider is negatively correlated with a city's having private providers. However, the marginal effects indicate that the effect of municipal competition on private provision is largely concentrated on the first entrant, suggesting cities may choose to provide telecommunications services in areas with inadequate demand to support private provision.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
