{"total_words": 73, "documents": ["This paper introduces the term \"landscape meteorology\" to cover a variety of beliefs associating significant atmospheric processes and results with culturally induced features of the landscape. These beliefs, which became prominent during the period of discovery, played an important role in early America and during the settlement period of the Plains. In the forested East, weather and climate modification centered largely on deforestation and reforestation. The concept of the tree-rainfall syndrome was also transferred to the West, where it received much attention. New and largely indigenous Western concepts regarding landscape forms of weather and climate modification stressed plowing the hard sod, facilitating electrical expressions by various means, and storing water (including irrigation) to humidify and cool the air.\n      </p>", "Marine data (especially in meteorology) are often grouped geographically using a set of numbered 10\u00b0 latitude-longitude squares known as Marsden squares, which are usually attributed to William Marsden, Secretary of the Admiralty (and Vice-President of The Royal Society), who supposedly invented them early in the nineteenth century. Available records suggest that this system was in fact probably invented by Robert FitzRoy soon after his appointment as head of the British Meteorological Office in 1854. FitzRoy felt that early English work in marine meteorology was being ignored, notably by the American Matthew Fontaine Maury, who had pioneered the collecting of marine meteorological data from ship's logs. A desire to undo this wrong led FitzRoy to emphasize earlier (though abortive) British projects by A.B. Becher (in 1831) and by Marsden (probably in the 1780s), both of which involved grouping marine data geographically, though only over limited areas. FitzRoy's treatment of this earlier work seems to have created, much later, the belief that Marsden had invented the system of 10\u00b0 squares. Given both Maury's and FitzRoy's desire to demonstrate priority in this field, it is ironic that the first clear proposal to collect and group data from ship's logs was made by the American (and British) natural philosopher Isaac Greenwood in 1728.\n      </p>", "This article investigates visual methods in Victorian meteorology in the second half of the nineteenth century. While studies of visual representations in scientific work during this period have proliferated, there has been less attention paid to the relationships between scientific images and the broader visual culture in which they developed. Meteorology offers ideal ground for exploring visual culture and science, both because of the familiarity of the sky as an aesthetic subject, and because of the visual epistemology associated with popular forms of weather knowledge, called weather wisdom. Using examples from the study of clouds, especially the work of Charles Piazzi Smyth, the paper analyses the ways in which the challenges of meteorology raised questions about the nature of observation and precision. It concludes by suggesting that the broader context of Victorian visual culture must include the relationship of language and images, and traces those concerns in the history of cloud classification.\n      </p>", "An explicit formula is derived for the variance normalizing constant in the central limit theorem for chain-dependent processes. As an application to meteorology, a specific chain-dependent process is proposed as a probabilistic model for the sequence of daily amounts of precipitation. This model is a generalization of the commonly used Markov chain model for the occurrence of precipitation.\n      </p>", "This article explores the practice of simulation modeling by investigating how parameterizations are constructed and integrated into existing frameworks. Parameterizations are simplified process descriptions adapted for simulation models. On the basis of a study of meteorological research, the article presents predictive and representative construction as two different ways of developing parameterizations and the trade-offs involved in this work. Because the overall aim in predictive construction is to improve weather forecasts, the most practical solutions are chosen over the best theoretical solutions. In representative construction, the situation is reversed, but while discourse focuses on theory and models, the everyday work is often tied to computer programs. These different ways of construction work are closely related to the role of the simulation models as epistemic or technical objects, and this characterization is also used to compare the results with previous research.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a
