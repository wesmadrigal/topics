A distinction is drawn between simple and complex clothing, with the latter leading to repercussions that can ultimately became decoupled from thermal contingencies. Archaeological correlates of complex clothing can be linked to attributes of modern human behaviour, some but not all of which made a transient appearance in late Pleistocene Tasmania. Cave sites in the southwest of the island have yielded bone tools and distinctive stone scraper tools, along with evidence for the targeting of prey species and parietal artworks in some caves. Thermal conditions in late Pleistocene Tasmania approached the known limits of human cold tolerance, necessitating the use of clothing. The archaeological record is reviewed in relation to likely technological and other correlates of the manufacture of clothing. It is argued that thermal parameters were a significant aspect of the human response to climate change in Tasmania. These developments invite comparison with those witnessed outside the region during the Upper and late Middle Pleistocene, particularly in northern middle latitudes and also in Africa, where they are interpreted as indicating the emergence of modern human behaviour.\n      </p>", "Within the industrialization process of the Indonesian economy, the manufacture of clothing has played a significant role. Besides Java, Bali has the second highest agglomeration of industrial activities within this sector. However, in contrast to Javanese clothing firms, which have a strong emphasis on Western-styled clothing, Balinese clothing firms focus on the manufacture of Batik and embroidery products. Based on the commodity chain debate, I will show in this paper how Balinese clothing industry is organized into and governed within the global and local economy. This aims in particular to unravel how these types of garments (Batik and embroidery) can shape and reshape buyer relations. The analysis will also include a discussion of aspects, such as product development and raw material procurement. Furthermore, since Balinese clothing companies organize their production activities within extensive networks of rural home industries, the driving forces behind these specific network co-ordinations will be explored.\n      </p>", "This study examined effects of clothing cues on children's identification accuracy from lineups. Four- to 14-year-olds (n = 228) saw 12 video clips of individuals, each wearing a distinctly colored shirt. After watching each clip children were presented with a target-present or target-absent photo lineup. Three clothing conditions were included. In 2 conditions all lineup members wore the same colored shirt; in the third, biased condition, the shirt color of only one individual matched that seen in the preceding clip (the target in target-present trials and the replacement in target-absent trials). Correct identifications of the target in target-present trials were most frequent in the biased condition, whereas in target-absent trials the biased condition led to more false identifications of the target replacement. Older children were more accurate than younger children, both in choosing the target from target-present lineups and rejecting target-absent lineups. These findings suggest that a simple clothing cue such as shirt color can have a significant impact on children's lineup identification accuracy.\n      </p>", "Thermal considerations can help resolve two of the most challenging problems in later Palaeolithic archaeology - the demise of Neanderthals and the emergence of modern human behaviour. Both can be viewed as reflecting interactions between biological and behavioural cold adaptations, in the context of extreme climatic fluctuations during the Upper Pleistocene. Recent studies draw attention to the special difficulties these conditions posed for humans but few give sufficient regard to the need for adequate pre-adaptations, namely technologies for manufacturing complex clothing assemblages. It is argued here that pre-existing biological cold adaptations delayed the development of such technological capacities among Neanderthals, resulting ultimately in their extinction. In contrast, the greater biological vulnerability of fully modern humans promoted a precocious appearance of behavioural adaptations among some (though not all) groups, visible in the various archaeological markers of modern human behaviour.\n      </p>", "The interest in clothing as a powerful item for cultural inquiry has recently increased among anthropologists. This has to do with its dual connection to habitat and cultural identity, allowing for ecological as well as symbolic analysis. The identification of contexts in which identity is communicated by means of clothing is considered an additional dimension to the study of clothing proper. Clothing is viewed as the most efficient means of non-verbal communication of cultural identity as well as culture-specific values and standards. The communicative power of clothing is especially salient in various inter-ethnic contexts. Referring to the S\u00e1mi in northern Fennoscandia, clothing appears as an effective ethnic marker. At the same time the vitality of clothing as a material object is evident. /// Derni\u00e8rement, les anthropologues ont port\u00e9 un int\u00e9r\u00eat de plus en plus marqu\u00e9 pour le v\u00eatement en tant qu'article important dans l'investigation culturelle.

Driven by increasing costs in Western Europe, Western clothing retailers and buyers have increasingly outsourced production to lower-cost regions of postcommunist Eastern Europe. One consequence of these changes has been a dramatic growth of clothing producers in Eastern Europe, locked into supply relations with Western buyers while simultaneously involved in dense networks of relations between firms in regional clusters. This article focuses on the form that power relations take, which knit together pan-European supply linkages and regional clusters of clothing firms in Slovakia. In drawing on a weak form of actor-network theory and an understanding of capitalist commodity production, the article explores the uneven nature of these power relations, as well as their fluidity at three levels. First, attention is given to relations between Slovak firms and Western buyers that largely involve a tenuous form of price competitiveness, which is simultaneously under threat from lower-cost production zones elsewhere. Second, the variant power relations between producers in regional clusters of clothing firms in Slovakia are explored. Production flexibilities have been built through a network of locally agglomerated workshop production units and domestic home-based workers to whom work is outsourced when required. Third, the implications of these forms of outsourcing are explored in relation to workplace and wage-level pressures. The article therefore suggests the importance of understanding dynamic and fluid power relations in the economic geography of regional clusters and the globalization of outsourcing in the clothing sector.\n      </p>", "This article identifies the way in which a firm-centered, value-chain approach to studying the distinctive structure and evolution of the geography of the Italian textile and clothing industries (TCI) offers important insights that qualify the results of district-centered and commodity/value-chain research. Analyses of the functional profiles of textile and clothing companies and of the roles of design, distribution, and services help explain recent trends in industrial concentration and in the national and international fragmentation of value chains. These analyses also give rise to a view of districts as parts of an interdependent geographic division of labor that includes magic circles and delocalized zones of dependent manufacturing. An appreciation of these features of the system is vital for understanding recent trends in the performance of the TCI and the Made in Italy industries more generally.\n      </p>", "This paper considers the recent restructuring of the clothing retailing sector. The focus is upon changing relationships between clothing manufacturers and retailers. The traditional conceptualization of retailer control mechanisms throughout the 1980s was that there exists a spectrum ranging from the tight control 'marionette' model to the arms length approach. Our aim here is to refine this unrealistic representation of inter-organizational linkages, and to suggest that the traditional polar extreme control model is being replaced by a hierarchical or pyramidal model, with close control being exercised over preferred suppliers, alongside an increasingly fragmented chain of sub-contracting relationships further down the chain. We consider the implications of such changing buyer-supplier relations on the future of the British clothing industry, and argue that the prospect of an equalizing out of the asymmetrical relationship between retailers and clothing manufacturers seems remote.\n      </p>", "Clothing research has attracted renewed interest in anthropology over the past two decades, experiencing a florescence that had been kept within bounds by reigning theoretical paradigms. The works have been influenced by general explanatory shifts in anthropology, which inform disparate bodies of clothing research that otherwise have little unity. The most noticeable trend is a preoccupation with agency, practice, and performance that considers the dressed body as both subject in, and object of, dress practice. The turn to consumption as a site and process of meaning making is evident also in clothing research. Dress has been analyzed, by and large, as representing something else rather than something in its own right, although new efforts to reengage materiality suggest that this approach is changing. Little work has been done on clothing production issues, though some scholars examine the significance of dress in the context of the entire economic circuit and the unequal relationships between its actors.\n      </p>", "The cutting-stock problem in the clothing industry does not conform to the classical representation of such problems. Waste minimization is only a subsidiary objective. The overall objective is to maximize long-run profitability, but operational planning requires limiting consideration to a series of problems covering short planning periods. This requires a more complex objective to incorporate interaction between periods. Production constraints with unique characteristics occur in the laying, cutting and sewing operations. The conventional pattern-design problem is dealt with by use of a commercial computer-aided graphical design system. The question addressed in this paper is how to combine such patterns so as to satisfy the various objectives and constraints. This leads to both integer and quadratic formulations of appropriate mathematical programming models.\n      </p>", "Red-plumaged birds (red species) may behave more visibly in the presence of a red-orange safety vest that field observers must often wear, but species lacking red plumage (non-red species) may behave less visibly (i.e., the species-confidence hypothesis). Such responses may bias many common counting techniques. We experimentally tested if observer clothing color could affect richness and abundance variables derived from point counts. During summer and winter, we surveyed point-count stations while alternately wearing a red/orange vest (vest counts) and not wearing a vest (control counts). Winter estimates of species richness, total abundance, abundance of non-red species as a group, and the White-breasted Nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis) were significantly lower when the vest was worn, but red species were not significantly different. We did not observe any significant effects of the vest during summer counts. Power was high for community-level variables and intermediate for non-red species, but low power and marginally significant results suggested that we might have failed to detect effects on red species. Several factors may account for why we observed effects on non-red species during winter but not summer: species composition varied between seasons, dense summer foliage may have obscured the vest from view, or territoriality and nesting activities may have dampened avoidance behaviors during summer. Although effects of clothing color were significant for the winter season, managers and biologists should avoid risk of bias by restricting observers to dark or drab colored clothing for all seasons and for all avian sampling techniques, not just winter point counts. /// Aves de plumaje rojo (especies rojas) pueden conducirse m\u00e1s visiblemente en la presencia de un chaleco de seguridad rojo-naranja que los investigadores deben usar a menudo, pero especies que no tienen plumaje rojo (especies no-rojas) pueden actuar menos visiblemente (i.e., la hip\u00f3tesis de confianza de especies). Estas respuestas pueden viciar las t\u00e9cnicas comunes de conteo. Probamos experimentalmente si el color de la ropa pod\u00eda afectar las variables de riqueza y abundancia derivadas de conteos de puntos. Muestreamos estaciones de conteo de puntos en verano e invierno usando alternamente chalecos rojo-naranjas (conteos de chaleco) o sin usar chalecos (conteos control). Los estimados invernales de riqueza de especies, de abundancia total, de abundancia de especies no-rojas (como grupo) y de Sitta carolinensis fueron inferiores significativamente al usar chalecos, pero especies rojas no variaron significativamente. No observamos efectos significativos del uso de chalecos durante los conteos de verano. Para las variables de niveles comunitario e intermedio la potencia fu\u00e9 alta para las especies no-rojas, pero de baja potencia y resultados marginales sugieren que podemos haber fallado en detectar efectos en especies rojas. Varios factores pueden explicar por qu\u00e9 observamos efectos en especies no-rojas durante el invierno y no en verano: la composici\u00f3n de especies var\u00eda entre las temporadas, la vegetaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s densa en el verano pudo haber afectado la visibilidad del chaleco, o el territorialismo y actividades de anidaje pueden haber amortiguado las conductas de rechazo durante el verano.

This has been particularly the result of the economic crisis in the late 1990s, which affected companies serving the domestic market. Companies were trying to compensate for the loss of sales on the domestic market by redirecting their marketing activities to foreign countries. This export strategy has been driven largely by the sole aim to survive. However, in addition to these export activities, some companies have rather sophisticated, long-standing business relations to their distributors in overseas markets. This paper explores these export activities in the context of the global commodity chain framework.\n      </p>", "The need for high-performance protective clothing systems in space, polar, and underwater operations and in industrial environments has stimulated research in clothing physiology. New, sophisticated measurement methods, some of which are going to be international standards, have facilitated this research. Measurements with subjects have validated manikin data, but have also provided information about the dynamic character and the individual variability of thermal properties of clothing under conditions encountered in the field. Manikin measurements of the basic thermal properties of clothing (insulation and evaporative resistance) have to be corrected to apply to the user situation, due to the effects of wind, posture, body movement, and moisture absorption. Evaporative heat transfer is better defined and should be incorporated in heat exchange models and thermal indices. Important aspects of clothing physiology remain to be investigated.\n      </p>", "Since 1984, Erak Clothing, a Turkish contractor, has manufactured jeans as a full-package producer for international brands, such as Calvin Klein, Guess, and Esprit. Following the creation of its own brand, Mavi Jeans, in 1991, the firm has been transforming itself into an original brand-name manufacturer and retailer. Mavi Jeans are now sold worldwide at more than 3,000 sales points, including Nordstrom, Macy's, and Bloomingdale's department stores, and five directly owned and operated flagship stores in Vancouver, New York, Frankfurt, Berlin, and Montreal. In this article, the authors tell the exceptional story of the firm's transformation from a full-package manufacturer into an original brand-name manufacturer and retailer. They discuss how a peripheral manufacturing firm has managed to achieve a high value-added competitive advantage by gaining access to global networks of production, consumption, and information in the clothing industry: a buyer-driven industry in which the world's largest retailers, branded marketers, and manufacturers without factories are the dominant players with asymmetrical influence and power. The case study supports the theoretical position that individual firms have some room for autonomous action and that power relationships have some fragility that can be exploited by firms with strategic intent.\n      </p>", "Since the mid-1990s, the increasing export of the West's used clothing to southern regions may initially appear to be another marker of northern exploitation. But to consider the southern flow of this commodity in such terms sees people as passive recipients of global commodity chains and overlooks the alternatives they create in dress and work practice. Focussing on women's roles in the secondhand clothing industry in the Philippines, this paper argues that traders and consumers reconfigure the logic of the market and the meaning of this transnational commodity by incorporating cultural practices into a global trade marginal to state influence. By dialectically engaging this commodity across diverse cultural and economic spheres, women dissolve assumptions of fixed dichotomies and dominance to reconceptualize global processes from a gendered perspective and as multiple and ongoing. /// Depuis le milieu des ann\u00e9es quatre-vingt-dix, l'augmentation de l'exportation de v\u00eatements de seconde main vers les r\u00e9gions du Sud peut para\u00eetre de prime abord comme un autre signe de l'exploitation des pays du Nord.

Earlier point-count research indicated this mate-choice hypothesis also may explain avian reactions to observer clothing color. In central Texas, during January and February 1993, we tested further whether the species-confidence hypothesis holds for reactions to observer clothing color by determining how close an investigator could get to individuals before they flushed (approach distance) and how long individuals remained visible near their initial flush point (detectability period). The same investigator experimentally wore or did not wear a hunter-orange vest, which some wildlife biologists wear as a safety precaution during hunting-season field studies. The vest did not affect approach distance for species with red or orange on their bodies (American robin [Turdus migratorius], P = 0.247; northern cardinal [Cardinalis cardinalis], P = 0.196; ruby-crowned kinglet [Regulus calendula], P = 0.434; red-bellied woodpecker [Melanerpes carolinus], P = 0.113). In contrast, approach distances for species without red or orange were longer when the vest was worn than when it was not worn (Carolina chickadee [Parus carolinensis], P = 0.032; northern mockingbird [Mimus polyglottos], P = 0.033; yellow-rumped warbler [Dendroica coronata], P = 0.001). Differences in detectability period between vest conditions depended on air temperature for American robins (P = 0.003) and on the variation in visibility within habitats for northern cardinals (P &lt; 0.001). Detectability period was shorter when the vest was worn than when it was not worn for Carolina chickadees (P = 0.057) and yellow-rumped warblers (P = 0.060). Thus, for several species this matechoice hypothesis seems to apply to garment color as well. Some species' reactions demonstrated that, if birds respond significantly to clothing color, important assumptions of distance-sampling techniques used to estimate avian richness, density, and abundance will be violated, and these parameters will be underestimated. Wildlife scientists will be more likely to draw valid inferences and recommend effective management practices from avian data gathered via distance-sampling methods if reactions to clothing color are precluded.\n      </p>", "The effect of geometric factors on insulation was calculated mathematically for standing humans. It was found that internal radiative heat transfer in an ensemble was significant for insulation, that intrinsic clothing insulation is a useful concept only for indoor climates, and that shape plays a minor role. The literature agrees closely on insulation and clothing surface area figures, and the latter are compatible with model predictions. Finally, it was shown that wind, body motion, the effects of posture, and the fit of garments are predictable. Sitting provides more insulation than standing for light clothing, but the reverse is true for heavy clothing. Insulation is decreased by about 20 % by cycling and by about 40 % by walking, and a reasonable estimate can be made of the effect of wind and wind and motion together. The effect of air motion on vapor permeability is stronger than the effect on heat transfer.\n      </p>", "Some kind of protective clothing and personal safety items was needed in 90 % of the 163 workplaces surveyed. Protective clothing was used in 31 %, ear protectors in 28 %, eye protectors in 22 %, respiratory tract protectors in 18 % and other safety items in 1 % of the firms. Gloves were the most commonly used type of protective clothing. Protection against risks was proper in one-fourth of the firms, satisfactory in half, and poor or lacking in the rest. Ninety-five percent of the protectors available were appropriate, but only in a few companies were they properly cared for. Seven (12 %) industrial firms, 15 (20 %) service establishments and 1 (7 %) other firm lacked proper protective clothing or safety items. Faults were generally attributed to insufficient knowledge or negligence of responsibilities on the part of the employers. Management should provide more appropriate instruction for workers in the use and, particularly, the maintenance of personal protectors. To be effective, the inspection of the appropriateness of the protectors requires suitable training. This training should also be received by the staff providing occupational health services. Visits to workplaces, as well as health examinations, provide an opportunity to discuss protection and to advise employers and employees on protection. The problems of protection against harmful exposures is closely connected with health counseling. Yet, the provision of proper protectors and the supervision of their use is still the responsibility of the employer.\n      </p>", "The UR agreement has been widely perceived as constituting a major advance in the process of multilateral liberalisation of trade in goods and services and, when fully implemented, is expected to improve economic efficiency and welfare from the global, national and sectoral standpoints. The present paper explores the implications of the Uruguay Round agreement for Pakistan's textiles and clothing Sector. With the managed trade era in textiles due to be phased out in 205, it is important that the domestic textiles and clothing industry be prepared for a much more competitive environment, both at home as well as in foreign markets. The phasing-out of MFA type restrictions and other trade barriers is generally expected to have positive effects on Pakistan's exports of textiles and clothing in the long run. At the same time, however, the erosion of preferential treatment embodied in the Multi-Fiber Arrangements poses many challenges to the textiles and clothing industry in Pakistan. The emerging scenario of freer trade in textiles and clothing highlights the need to enhance competitiveness in this sector by improving product quality, efficiency of resource use, and productivity. Also, there is a need to advance in the reforms and liberalisation of the economy, and to focus public policy towards addressing the structural problems of the textiles and clothing industry with a view to enabling it to compete better in the more competitive international market.\n      </p>", "The purpose of this study was to examine individual differences in beliefs and attitudes regarding workplace attire including: the value placed on clothing, the impact of attire on workplace outcomes (e.g., promotions, raises), the effort and planning involved in dressing appropriately for work, how their clothing made them feel, and whether they used their attire to manage the impression of others in the workplace. Results from a sample of MBA students indicate that those who valued workplace attire used it to manage the impressions of others and believed that it positively impacts the way they feel about themselves and their workplace outcomes. Dressing to impress appeared to have particular utility for high self-monitors and those in management/executive positions.

These changes may alter the inherent properties of skin, such as fatty acid composition and shrinkage temperature. The present paper describes studies of fatty acid distribution and shrinkage temperature in a series of items of Inuit origin collected during the Fifth Thule Expedition (1921-24). The skins used for the clothing originate from ringed seal (Phoca hispida) and caribou (Rangifertarandus). For comparison, freshly prepared skins were studied, as were samples of sealskins found in the mummy burial ground in Qilakitsoq, Greenland. It appeared that ordinary use changed the fatty acid distribution to some extent, as well as the shrinkage temperature, indicating slow deterioration. However, more significant deterioration was observed for samples exposed for longer periods to daylight as, for example, when placed on exhibition. The effect of light was verified by studying samples deliberately exposed to full daylight for ca. 6 months. In contrast to these samples, the 500-year-old skins appeared, on the basis of fatty acid distribution and shrinkage temperature, to be in good condition, possibly because of the lack of ordinary use in combination with low storage temperatures. /// Les m\u00e9thodes de pr\u00e9paration ainsi que l'utilisation normale provoquent, semble-t-il, des changements dans l'aspect des v\u00eatements de peau inuit.

Used-clothing donations to thrift shops and other organisations in industrialised countries typically end up being sold to consumers in Africa. Since used clothing is initially provided as a donation, it shares characteristics with food aid, which always assists consumers, but at times harms African food producers. Used-clothing imports are found to have a negative impact on apparel production in Africa, explaining roughly 40% of the decline in production and 50% of the decline in employment over the period 1981-2000.\n      </p>", "The relationship between a female's clothing choice, sexual motivation, hormone levels, and partnership status (single or not single, partner present or not present) was analyzed in 351 females attending Austrian discotheques. We digitally analyzed clothing choice to determine the amount of skin display, sheerness, and clothing tightness. Participants self-reported sexual motivation, and we assessed estradiol and testosterone levels through saliva sampling. Results show that females are aware of the social signal function of their clothing and that they in some cases alter their clothing style to match their courtship motivation. In particular, sheer clothing--although rare in the study--positively correlated with the motivation for sex. Hormone levels influenced clothing choice in many groups, with testosterone levels correlating positively with physique display. In females who had a partner but were at the disco unaccompanied by the partner, estradiol levels correlated positively with skin display and clothing tightness. Significant differences were not found, however, for clothing choice across the partnership-status groups.\n      </p>", "The effect of operating clothing on the dispersal of bacterial particles from the wearers was studied in a dispersal chamber. A comparison was made of six gowns as well as four types of trousers. The gowns were of three basic types, namely a conventional cotton type, disposable types made of non-woven fabric and those of the total-body exhaust system (Charnley type). The dispersal chamber could simulate conditions as expected both in down-flow unidirectional ultra-clean systems and in a conventional turbulent plenum-ventilated system. It was found that the disposable gowns would reduce the dispersal rate by about 30% in the simulated conventionally ventillated system and about 65% in the laminar flow system. The total-body exhaust system (Charnley) would reduce the count by 10-fold in the conventional ventilated system and by 66-fold in the laminar-flow system. The poor performance of the gowns in conventionally ventilated systems was caused by the dispersal of bacterial particles from underneath the gown (about 80%). This was not reduced by the disposable gown and only partially by the Charnley type. This small drop would be further decreased in a conventionally ventilated operating-room as only scrubbed staff would wear the gown. In order to overcome this poor performance in conventionally ventilated operating-rooms impervious trousers would be required. Four types were studied and it was demonstrated that those made either from Ventile or non-woven fabric would reduce the bacterial dispersion fourfold. As these tests had been carried out in an artificial environment checks were carried out in the unidirectional-flow operating-room during total-hip arthroplasty. This was done by comparing conventional cotton gowns with non-woven gowns and total-body exhaust gowns. The results showed good correlation between the operating room and the chamber with the non-woven fabric gown but the total-body exhaust system did not perform as well in the operating room (12-fold compared to 66-fold) the difference being possibly due to the contribution from the patient. However, as this comparison was that which would be most open to influence from other variables confidence could be placed on the chamber test results. Values were also obtained for the total number of bacterial particles dispersed by persons during a standard exercise wearing different clothing. This count was dependent on the clothing worn but a median count of between 1000 and 1500 bacterial particles/min. would be expected when conventional clothing was worn, with a range of between 300 and 19,000. This count could be reduced to about 100/min. if a total-body exhaust suit was worn (range 30-400).\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "By the 1920s the production of men's clothing was clearly divided into two sectors. The first consisted of a relative handful of large firms, technologically and organizationally sophisticated and engaged in the manufacture of better-quality garments. The \"secondary sector\" included a great many small and technically more primitive enterprises producing mainly lower-priced and lower-quality clothing. In this article, Dr. Fraser examines the development of the industry from the period following the Civil War through the post-World War I era in order to explain why this dualistic industrial structure emerged. In so doing, he draws on a thesis developed by Michael Piore and Alfred Chandler regarding the relationship between industrial organization and the structure of the market. Fraser argues that the expansion of the mass market does not necessarily lead to the concentration of production. It may, on the contrary, and especially in those cases where demand is particularly unstable, encourage the growth of a \"secondary sector\" whose minimal fixed investment makes it well-suited to handle the more variable component of demand.\n      </p>", "The aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of United States (US) Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) restrictions on Pakistan's textiles and clothing industry and its export performance. The period under study covers 1975-1994, the entire life-time of the MFA. Source country in our analysis is Pakistan with quota rights to supply textiles to the destination country: USA. A particular feature of Pakistan's economy is that its leading export product group, textiles and clothing has been subject to a restrictive trade regime for decades. Pakistan has paid a high price in terms of export losses for this derogation from the GATT discipline. The integration of this sector into the mainstream of WTO (GATT 1994) disciplines was negotiated in the Uruguay Round and the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) provides for the gradual elimination of restrictions on textiles and clothing.\n      </p>", "This paper examines the positions of Belgian textile and clothing firms on trade policies. Observations on positions are generated by a survey. Along the Unes of th\u00e8 politicai economy of protection and anti-protection we test whether firm-specific characteristics influence textile and clothing firms' trade policy pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences. The results show thatinternational competition and having foreign establishments significantly determine firms' positions, but that product differentiation does not. A Chow test indicates no significant difference between firms' sensitivities in the textile and clothing industries. This suggests that the two Professional organizations should co-operate on trade issues. /// Die Verfasser untersuchen, welche Faktoren am besten die Pr\u00e4ferenzen der belgischen Textilwaren-und Bekleidungsunternehmen in bezug auf die Au\u00dfenhandelspolitik erkl\u00e4ren.

While consumer strategies for buying merchandise revolved around the typical purchaser, generally the female head of the household, particular situations (such as work camps in the western United States) were overwhelmingly comprised of individual men who not only built water or transportation systems but needed to negotiate their way through outfitting themselves for this work. What kind of shopping choices and brand names were available to this consumer while working in isolated areas? Product availability and cost provide a context for examining the buying strategies and fashion choices of work-camp workers. The 393 brand-name buttons from at least 110 work-clothing garments identified during data recovery at the 1912 Alabama Gates Construction Camp in southeastern California is used as the case study.\n      </p>", "Trading in second-hand textiles has developed into an industry of world-wide proportions. Alongside commercial collectors, more and more charitable organizations have begun, since the 1960's, to appeal for donations of second-hand clothing. The study of the West German second-hand clothing market shows that, at present, between one quarter and one third of all private textile waste is passed on for re-use or further processing. An analysis of the sales figures shows that developing countries are becoming more and more important as trade partners. Taking Syria as a case in point, this study investigates the significance of the further utilization in Third World countries of second-hand clothing collected in Europe. At first glance, the importing of these goods seems to be of advantage to the recipients, in so far as the poorest sections of the population can be provided with good clothing, possibly at very reasonable prices. A closer analysis of the conditions within the Syrian market, however, points to disadvantages in foreign trade, which extend to the structure of the domestic economy, and which involve a number of negative side-effects: \u2014 An extensive second-hand clothing market endangers the development of an independent textile and clothing industry. \u2014 Traditional crafts and trades are faced with considerable disadvantages when competing with the importation of second-hand clothing. \u2014 The second-hand clothing industry creates little employment, most of which is absorbed by the informal urban sector.\n      </p>", "Data from experiments on animals and humans have supported the development of computer models that predict human response to various combinations of the three main heat stress factors work, clothing, and environment. However, recent application of such models shows that the validity of their output is limited in part by the need to represent more faithfully the interactions among the primary heat stress factors and certain physiological variables. Examples of such interactions include the weight and stiffness of protective outfits increasing the metabolic cost of a task, profuse sweating that wets clothing and alters its heat transfer characteristics, task-related movements altering air exchange rates through clothing, individual aerobic capacity affecting thermoregulatory response to a given metabolic load, and sweat retention in clothing raising skin wettedness and possibly inducing sweat suppression. This paper reviews recent research in these areas and identifies certain areas where further data are needed.\n      </p>", "An overemphasis upon 'high-tech' industries has led geographers to neglect the impact of technological change on traditional industries like clothing.

This paper investigates the influence of different cultural identities on the risk of common mental disorders among Bangladeshi and white British pupils. Design: The cultural identity of 11-14-year-old school pupils was assessed by their preferences for friends and clothes of their own or other cultural groups; using this information pupils were classified into traditional, integrated, assimilated or marginalised groups. We undertook prospective analyses of cultural identity and its impacts on the later mental health of young people. Setting: East London. Participants: In 2001, white British (573) and Bangladeshi (682) school pupils from a representative sample of schools completed a self-report questionnaire that assessed their cultural, social and health characteristics. In 2003, 383 white British and 517 Bangladeshi pupils were resurveyed and completed measures of mental health. Main outcome measure: Strengths and difficulties questionnaire. Results: Bangladeshi pupils preferring clothes from their own cultural group (traditional clothing) were less likely to have later mental health problems when compared with Bangladeshi pupils showing an equal preference for clothing from their own and other cultures (integrated clothing; odds ratio (OR) 0.3, 95% Cl 0.1 to 0.9). In gender-specific analyses, this finding was sustained only among Bangladeshi girls (OR 0.1, 95% Cl 0.1 to 0.7). Integrated clothing choices were least risky only for white British adolescents. Friendship choices showed no prospective associations with later mental health problems. Conclusions: Cultural identity, expressed by clothing preferences, influences mental health; the effects differ by gender and ethnic group.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

A distinction is drawn between simple and complex forms of clothing, with broad implications for the interpretation of paleolithic technological transitions and the emergence of modern human behavior. Physiological principles and paleoenvironmental data are harnessed to identify conditions requiring simple, loosely draped garments and the more challenging conditions that demanded additional protection in the form of complex garment assemblages. No actual clothing survives from the Pleistocene, yet the archaeological record yields evidence for technological and other correlates of clothing\u2014more evidence than is generally supposed. Major innovations and trends in the distributions and relative frequencies of lithic and other tool forms may reflect the changing need for portable insulation in the context of fluctuating ice age climates. Moreover, the nonthermal repercussions of complex clothing can be connected with archaeological signatures of modern human behavior, notably adornment. Alternative models are less parsimonious in accounting for the geographical and temporal variability of prominent technological and other behavioral patterns in association with environmental change.\n      </p>", "Marine stingers hospitalize approximately 100 people annually in tropical Australian waters, and are known to have caused at least 73 fatalities. Elsewhere in the tropical and temperate seas of the world, marine stingers pose a similar threat to human safety, and reported sting numbers are on the rise. Lycra body suits (\"stinger suits\") have been used for stinger protection since the early 1980s, but have not been formally tested as a barrier against Irukandji (Carukia barnesi) tentacles. Other products are being used and developed; however, no safety standards currently exist for this widely used form of protective equipment. Eight products were tested with live C. barnesi: a Lycra stinger suit used by Surf Life Saving, a product developed by ROBIS Pty. Ltd. and marketed as \"The Stinger Suit\", three different styles of nylon pantyhose, two sport products designed to \"wick away\" moisture and keep the wearer cooler, and a 0.5-mm neoprene wetsuit. Products were evaluated for seven common concerns relating to safety and practical wearability. Primary concerns, i.e., those relating to performance of the fabric in preventing stings, include: ease of penetration by jellyfish tentacles, adherence of tentacles or body to fabric, and potential for crushing through the fabric. Secondary concerns, i.e., those relating to overall usage as stinger-preventative clothing, include: durability or integrity of the barrier, whether the product is available as a one-piece garment, heat-retention properties, and product cost. In general, the tighter the fabric weave, the better tentacle exclusion, and the smoother the fabric, the more resistant to adherence. Lycra is vulnerable to crushing of tentacles through the fabric, but appears to be the best choice for routine-use stinger-protective clothing. Recommendations are made for safe use of protective clothing, as a basis for development of an Australian Standard in protective clothing for marine stinger safety.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

To answer this question, I conducted fieldwork in the women's departments of several luxury goods stores in Paris that sell ready-to-wear clothes. In this negotiating context of personalized service, lower-status individuals (salespersons) propose new identities to higher-status consumers. This comparison of how saleswomen and gay salesmen negotiate clothing identities with women customers examines both their identification with the customers and the role-playing involved. The sales area as a \u201cbackstage\u201d permits the \u201cexpertise\u201d of the sales staff to mitigate the status differences and gives gay male sales staff latitude in their interactions with female clients.

In warm weather the poncho was often omitted sometimes exposing a wearer's profusely painted or tattooed mammae. By the 1820s some women of affluent families made their garments of trade cloth. By the 1850s a long, trade cloth dress, with kimono sleeves and inset gores was becoming fashionable. This garment, in turn, was superceded among women of status by a three piece skin dress after buckskin became relatively scarce. The two piece skin dress which Wissler proposed as the \"plains style\" was never typical of the tribes of the Southern Plains. Rather the evidence argues against culture area uniformity in women's clothing, while suggesting that climate and acculturation resulting from white contact strongly influenced a variety of dress styles among the women of the plains tribes. Indeed the body garments worn by women on the Southern Plains prior to 1850 strikingly resemble those depicted on classic figurines from Vera Cruz, Mexico, while they differed totally from garments worn by women of Northern Plains tribes during early historic times.\n      </p>", "This article attempts to advance the research on industrial districts and regional development through a study of the restructuring of the clothing industry in Wenzhou Municipality, a regional driver of the Chinese economy. Wenzhou is known for the Wenzhou model of development traditionally centred on familyowned small businesses embedded in local institutions. The clothing industry is one of the leading industries in Wenzhou, and a cluster with national significance has emerged, where most of the production components can be purchased locally. However, the industry has been scaled up nationally and internationally, with the expansion of sales networks and production facilities across China, and to a lesser extent, abroad. This restructuring has changed the endogenous nature of industrial clusters/districts. The restructuring challenges the orthodox notion of the Wenzhou model and the New Regionalism literature, particularly the orthodox notion of Marshallian industrial districts that overly emphasizes small firms and local assets, and the global production network perspective that highlights coupling with global lead firms in regional development.\n      </p>", "Background: Few studies have considered the potential utility of clothing size as a predictor of diseases associated with body weight. Methods: We used data on weight-stable men and women from a subcohort of the Netherlands Cohort Study to assess the correlation of clothing size with other anthropometric variables. Cox regression using the case-cohort approach was performed to establish whether clothing size can predict cancer risk after 13.3 years of follow-up, and if additionally considering body mass index (BMI) in the model improves the prediction. Results: Trouser and skirt size correlated well with circumference measurements. Skirt size predicted endometrial cancer risk, and this effect was slightly attenuated when BMI was added to the model. Trouser size predicted risk of renal cell carcinoma, regardless of whether BMI was in the model. Conclusions: Clothing size appears to predict cancer risk independently of BMI, suggesting that clothing size is a useful measure to consider in epidemiologic studies when waist circumference is not available.\n      </p>", "Most empirical studies of corporate social responsibility (CSR) focus on variables at the company level. In this article, I focus on the sector level: I consider features of the international clothing business and ot the global economy in general, that may influence the CSR potential. There is high 'CSR potential' when sectorspecific features indicate that the risk of violating CSR standards is high. Thus, ' high CSR potential' indicates that there is a potential for positive influence through CSR-related actions. Based on several empirical studies of the clothing business, I identify six features that indicate a high CSR potential. These features are shown to be consistent with more general features of the global economy. This holds whether we emphasize asymmetric relations and unequal distribution, the product cycle, or transnationalization. Thus, the CSR potential of the international clothing business seems not only to be a product of sector-specific properties, but also of more systemic and general features of the global economy. This suggests that the CSR performance of individual companies may enhance their social and environmental impact, but will probably have little effect on the features that determine the CSR potential.

Finally, I conclude that this study shows that it is useful to identify the CSR potential of a business sector.

Granting used clothing a history in which what becomes of it does not inhere in its commodity status as a western cast-off, but is a result of what people have made with it and of it, investing and divesting it of meanings, this paper explores how used clothing assumes meanings as it becomes embedded in a variety of contexts, particularly in the capital city of Lusaka.\n      </p>", "In the early twentieth century explorers, ethnographers, and entrepreneurs penetrated the territory of the Northern Copper Inuit who had been virtually isolated from western contact. They encountered a society and material culture seemingly unaltered by western influence. Working with both museum collections of indigenous fur clothing from this region and the graphic art of Copper Inuit elders, this paper proposes the existence of an extensive ceremonial clothing complex comprised of dance clothing and shamanistic vestments unknown elsewhere in the Canadian Arctic. The distinctive style of Copper Inuit caribou-fur clothing, including dance and shamanistic clothing, disappeared from this region by the 1930s. However, as a result of collaborative fieldwork in the early 1990s, a style of Copper Inuit clothing has re-emerged as dance clothing in the context of the Kingalik Jamboree, an annual festival held in Holman (Uluhaktok) on the western coast of Victoria Island, Canada.

The new round of trade negotiations is likely to be less important for trade in textiles and clothing, however, than were the recent renegotiations of the fourth Multifibre Arrangement (MFA). As the MFA remains in effect until July 1991, this limits the range of measures which can be altered in the interim. Nonetheless, textile trade will influence the process and outcome of the current negotiations because of the overlap of textile trade disputes with other broader trade issues. These include tariffs, the rollback of tariffs and quotas, voluntary export restraints, and other nontariff barriers, all of which have been applied to textiles trade at various times. Each of these measures has an influence on trade flows and a cost to both the importing and exporting countries. Any proponents of liberalization of trade in textiles and clothing must not only be familiar with these costs but also must be knowledgeable about the economic and political forces which have initiated and sustained the protective measures. The following discussion suggests that there are groups and transitional approaches which may favor some progress in textile trade liberalization in the current round of negotiations.\n      </p>", "Marketing strategies are often based on identifying heavy users and using demographics to profile and to distinguish them from light and non-users.

They were more involved with fashion, more innovative and knowledgeable about new fashions, more likely to act as opinion leaders for new fashions, and were less price sensitive. They were also more likely to seek out fashion information from various media and to shop more for clothing. Overall, the psychological variables were more strongly associated with product use than the demographics were.\n      </p>", "This article recounts the birth of the clothing industry in the United States after 1815. It contends, in contrast to recent historical literature, that the clothing business was at the center of the American experience of industrialization. This was not because ready-made clothing was a novel commodity. Nor was it because of new production technologies, social innovations, or legal structures adopted by the industry. Rather, clothing entrepreneurs were significant because they integrated several important markets-a trans-Atlantic trade in cloth, an urban trade in labor, and a market for manufactured goods in the interior regions of the United States. This helped to make the ready-made clothing business among the country's largest industries by 1850.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

If the massive production of children in Les Mamelles is purposive, the production of \u201cCirce\u201d is out of control, embodying both the pleasures and the dangers of industrial capitalism, an endless production of commodities that seems to offer change but generates instead a phantasmagoria. Reading \u201cCirce\u201d and Les Mamelles alongside Walter Benjamin's understanding of the effects of the capitalist city \u2014 explored in the Arcades Project in Paris while Joyce was finishing Ulysses there \u2014 allows us to see how \u201cCirce\u201d moves beyond the limits of Surrealism and offers another way of conceiving of the avant-garde.\n      </p>", "\"Job-conscious\" unionism is practiced not only by skilled trade but also by industrial unions composed primarily of semi-skilled and unskilled workers. This thesis is tested by an analysis of cases on shop discipline, shop practices and trade customs decided by the Chicago Trade Board in the period from 1919 to 1929. These cases concern questions of control of the opportunity to work and the conditions of tenure in the job--the fundamental bases of customary job control. The job security of the Chicago clothing workers is not fundamentally different from that of many of the skilled trade unions, although it may bear a closer relation to the economic efficiency of the industry than is occasionally found elsewhere.\n      </p>", "Die chinesischen Wirtschaftsreformen seit den sp\u00e4ten 70er Jahren haben das Wachstum des chinesischen Au\u00dfenhandels erheblich stimuliert.

The species used for clothing is influenced by environmental factors that vary from one region to the next. Birds were used by indigenous peoples from parts of Greenland, Canada, Alaska, and Siberia in the past, but today such use is extremely rare. Inuit living on the Belcher Islands, N.W.T., are the primary group discussed in this paper; other circumpolar groups are included for comparison. The objective of this study is to identify and discuss environmental factors that influence regional variations in bird-skin clothing production. Social science methodology, i.e., participant-observation, content analysis, and ethnographic review was used to document bird skin selection. Findings indicate that regional variations in species selected for use reflect the availability of birds and caribou in each area.

Factors which influence this air exchange are clothing permeability, wind speed, body movements, clothing design, and fabric properties. The influence of the first four factors has been studied using a trace gas technique for measuring the rate at which microclimate air is exchanged for ambient air. The trace gas technique and the mathematical model describing the loss of the trace gas from the microclimate are described. The technique is shown to have a high resolving power, enabling small changes in the four factors studied to be identified, and as the method is also very quick detailed studies of garment design can be made.\n      </p>", "This article considers how spray-on clothing made by Fabrican Ltd. might illuminate and complicate our understandings of craft, commodity fetishism, and object agency. Fabrican is a chemical substance that is sprayed onto the body to create a garment. I am interested in the ways this fabric appears seamless, self-made, and organic; it ostensibly removes the labor and skill associated with handcrafted and machineproduced textiles and, when worn, resembles a second skin, both concealing and revealing the body underneath. In so doing it brings into sharp focus the complex ways we relate to clothing as an object of production and consumption.\n      </p>", "Between 1890 and 1930 former slaves in the isles of Zanzibar transformed their social identities from those of servile 'outsiders' to local residents with vested social, economic and political interests. Clothing served as one important and visually immediate means of articulating these changes of identity. Intrigued by the power of drawings and photographs to act as historical sources, the author utilizes such evidence as an integral part of the discussion and text. She also uses more traditional forms of evidence to illustrate the ways in which clothing fashions mirrored not only changes in class position but also ethnic transformations and gender relations.\n      </p>", "Recently \"born global\" firms have received considerable attention in the entrepreneurship and international business literature. Managers leading these new ventures typically face substantial resource constraints when seeking information critical to internationalization. This paper examines how the owner/operators of new ventures in the Turkish clothing export industry utilize their informal and formal social networks to acquire the information they need to export successfully. Field research and a survey of 250 Turkish clothing firm owners was conducted in Istanbul, Turkey to explore this issue. Findings indicate that informal social ties - particularly friends and family connections - are key sources of information for new-venture firm owners in this industry. Two formal organizations provide export information to entrepreneurs in the Turkish clothing industry, but only one was found to be easily accessible to new-venture firm owners: the Istanbul Textile and Clothing Exporters' Union (ITKIB). OLS regression results reveal that new venture firm owners' perceptions of ITKIB's importance can be explained by their perceived importance of various kinds of exportoriented information offered by this organization. In particular, perceived importance of export-law, market-research, and export-process information drive their perceptions of the importance of their ITKIB membership.\n      </p>", "La plupart des gouvernements provinciaux du Canada exemptent les v\u00eatements et les chaussures d'enfants de la taxe de vente au d\u00e9tail.

A number of provinces exempt adult clothing and footwear as well. Only Saskatchewan taxes both. This paper analyses the revenue and equity aspects of clothing tax exemptions. Using a simple time-series cross-section model of clothing/footwear expenditures by families in urban centres, it is found that sales of these items constitute a strong revenue source in that very little substitution away occurs when the tax is imposed or increased. On the equity side, an examination of 1978 expenditure patterns of Canadian families by income class indicates that the taxation of clothing/footwear would not be regressive. However, there is a case for using measures to offset the absolute burden asociated with repeal of sales tax exemptions. There is no strong case for a particular exemption for clothing/footwear.\n      </p>", "This is the fourth of a series of papers reporting on changes in the level of living in rural West Bengal as reflected in the results of a resurvey of villages and households in Bardhaman, Birbhum and Purulia districts.

Clothing manufacture is spatially distributed in such a way that establishments are embedded in highly specific local labour markets. In the sector of small firms owned by ethnic minority entrepreneurs, profitability is maintained through the availability of low-cost skilled labour. In the larger U.K. firms, output and return on capital have been maintained through various combinations of technical change and intensification of labour. This has involved the deskilling of many jobs, but here too managerial strategy takes account of extraneous factors such as local traditions of trade union militancy.

The Swedish industrial policy, in the period 1970--1990, was general and defensive in character. In the majority of firms interviewed, government policy had either no effect at all on firm behaviour or where effects were found there were no underlying market imperfections. Only in a minority of firms was it found that the policy alleviated market imperfections and changed firms' investment behaviour in a way which was judged to be beneficial for the firms' competitiveness.
