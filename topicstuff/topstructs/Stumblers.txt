Following Origens dictum to \"search the scriptures till you find a stumbling block,\" Joyce loaded his last work with offences and scandals.

In the second phase of the study, we examined the relation between these programs and student achievement. We found an inverse relation between poverty and achievement, regardless of program. Similarly, there were no significant differences between programs for students who achieved at average levels. Nonetheless, significantly more students in program C achieved at the lowest test level, failing third grade, and significantly more students in program F achieved at the highest level.

This article examines how myths told by women in western Viti Levu, Fiji, represent a site of resistance (Abu-Lughod, 1990) wherein hegemonic understandings of gender are contested. This is achieved through a \"transformation of signs\" (Hall, Critcher, Jefferson, Clarke and Roberts, 1978) that sees authoritative male figures depicted as powerless, challenges a spatial order that privileges men, and attacks an order of knowledge that declares vision the dominant mode for the apperception of knowledge. By contravening dominant meanings, these myths present a \"rupture of representation\" (Sharpe, 1995) that subverts reigning constructions of truth. I argue that anthropology's understanding of the legitimizing role of myth must be tempered by an appreciation of its potential as a \"risk to the sense of signs\" (Sahlins, 1987: 149). /// Comment et dans quels domaines culturels est-ce que les femmes contestent, contredisent ou inversent les id\u00e9ologies li\u00e9es \u00e0 la condition sexuelle?

This efficiency approach has been especially useful with mature firms, where the structure of debt and limits to managerial spending decrease the downside risk and possible failure of the firm. This article illustrates how buyouts can also create entrepreneurial opportunities and allow upside growth. In particular, it focuses on understanding the aspects and circumstances of the entrepreneurial mindsets of managers who seek upside growth through buyouts. These entrepreneurial mindsets provide a wider view of buyouts as a vehicle for renewal that frequently leads to revitalization and strategic innovation. The article provides insights for entrepreneurs, managers, and financiers by articulating four categories of buyout opportunity--efficiency, revitalization, entrepreneurial, and failure buyouts. We specify the conditions under which each may be appropriate, including the governance and financial incentives, and give company examples for each category.\n      </p>", "Organizational crisis, which includes both bankruptcy and a dramatic fall in market value, has increasingly affected blue chip companies in recent years.

In an in-depth analysis of the 100 largest organizational crises of the last five years, a mutual logic behind these crises has been identified. In general the problems lay in the four areas of growth, change, leadership and organizational culture. In most cases the companies grew and changed too quickly, had too powerful managers and nurtured an excessive success culture. Conversely, if these factors were insufficiently developed, companies aged prematurely, which likewise led to failure. In order to sustain success, companies need to keep a balance between these extremes.

Her unfortunate categorization as a \"confessional\" poet as well as critics' obsession with her biography have resulted in, on one hand, an underestimation of Plath's engagement with the \"real world\" beyond her subjectivity, and on the other hand, an insufficient consideration of the craft and formal properties of her poems. She was, from an early age, drawn to the natural world, although she was equally fascinated by the sounds of language. Plath's sense of irony and linguistic awareness, that is, puts her in a different category from that of a mere nature lover. Her poetry derives its power from the generative friction between speakers and a nonhuman world that resists figurative appropriation. For Plath, this resistance is itself to be figured forth, creating the formal reverberations with which her poems still startle us.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Unlike HROs, which operate high-hazard technologies, reliability-seeking organizations operate in high-hazard environments. Reliability-seeking organizations are tightly coupled to their unpredictable and complex environments in such a manner that although the human mortality rate is low, the risk of small failures amplifying into organizational mortality is high. To cope with these environments, reliability-seeking organizations organize to remain open and flexible to emerging information and achieve the reliability demanded by their environments-intensity of innovation. These organizations utilize skilled temporary employees, positive employee relations, and an emphasis on training to innovate, and, in turn, generate greater financial performance. We test these hypotheses using a sample of 184 initial public offering (IPO) software firms that conducted their IPO between 1993 and 1996 and our results are consistent with our theorizing. Firms that utilized these human resource practices innovated more frequently and firms with more innovations had higher stock prices over time. Our findings combine to suggest a theoretical model of structural antecedents of a different type of reliability-intensity of innovation.\n      </p>", "While many large businesses start out as a small enterprise, remarkably little is known about how an organization actually changes internally during the periods of growth. Small business growth is known to strain internal communication processes, for example, which likely limits growth opportunities. Information systems are often called upon to remedy such deficiencies. Through a participatory action research project, we investigated the ways in which a small business management team developed an IS-enabled solution to address their growth needs. During the progression of the project, a new outcome of organizational effectiveness, internal transparency, was identified and developed. Adopting a punctuated equilibrium perspective, a theoretical process model is proposed that sheds light on a relationship between internal transparency, small business growth, and IS. The paper concludes with observations that internal transparency may well be a concept that offers significant potential for MIS research as well as a discussion about the applicability and credibility of participatory action research for this project.\n      </p>", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

In our findings we describe under what circumstances chief executive officer (CEO) changes are likely; the importance of humility, trust, and integrity to turnaround leadership; and why certain companies might purposefully delay the implementation of CEO changes. In addition, we found that newly appointed outsider CEOs and insider leaders who are not replaced are differentiated in the manner by which they manage expectations and implement retrenchment-oriented moves at the outset of the turnaround process.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "           ", "           ", "           ", "Respected commentators have floated several proposals for startling reforms of America's seventy-year-old securities regulation scheme.
