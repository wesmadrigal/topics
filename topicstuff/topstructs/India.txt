{"total_words": 1282, "documents": ["The inferences drawn from this study are as follows: The stagnation/increase in mortality rates of adult ages in the recent years in India as well as for the major states may be attributed to food shortages and price hikes experienced in the country during 1960-74. In other words, all those who were adults during 1980s had experienced the crisis of hunger due to nonavailability of food as well as entitlement failure during their childhood. These persons would have had higher risk of dying in their life time and that may be one of the main reasons for the stagnation or increase in adult mortality in India and in most of the states. The findings of the study suggest that, the economic crisis experienced in India during the late eighties, may decrease the survival chances of those born during this period in their future life time. However, successful containment of increase in food prices during the period of crisis would be helpful in protecting the entitlement of vulnerable groups. The policy implication of the study is that it is essential to control the prices of food during the time of food shortages and or economic crisis and even in the period when food is available, measures should be undertaken to evolve efficient distribution system ensuring the supply of food to those vulnerable groups, who were unlucky to be born or were in infancy during the period of economic crisis. Thus, essentially this is a study in interaction of economic factors and demographic trends in an economy where large segments of the population are periodically subject to heightened food insecurities, compression of real wages and entitlement failures.\n      </p>", "This article examines the biocultural dynamics of social discrimination and physical disfigurement among people with leprosy, or Hansen's disease (HD), in Banaras, northern India. Based on the narratives and observations of people living in colony and street settings, I trace three destructive processes by which the social stigmata of leprosy become physically expressed. First, strategies of concealment further the progression and spread of HD through late detection and undertreatment. Second, the internalization of stigma can lead to bodily dissociation and injury through self-neglect. Finally, some people intentionally seek injuries under conditions of desperate poverty. As a result of such mortification processes, these people came to embody, quite literally, the prejudices that exacerbated their condition in the first place.\n      </p>", "Weekly markets in tribal areas are an important socioeconomic institution. Surveys were conducted during 1997-1999 in over one dozen rural markets in Surguja in the State of Madhya Pradesh in the central region of India. Tribals bring products of at least 30 species to these markets for sale. Traders from towns come to these markets to purchase forest produce; others set up small shops for selling consumer goods such as ready-made clothes, toiletries, utensils, stationery, some plastic goods, match boxes, and some cereals and tobacco.\n      </p>", "Investigation reveals that the position of the water buffalo in India is a product of the multi-directional interaction of biological, economic, and socio-religious factors. The Indian farmer's response to the animaVs biological advantages in light of the prevailing economic conditions has resulted in the buffalo's position as the major milk producer of India. This economic success is also a consequence of the religious environment. Evaluation of the relative strengths of economic and religious influences on buffalo husbandry brings a fresh perspective to the economy vs. religion controversy raised by recent studies of India's primary bovine, the zebu, and its sanctified position. While religion plays an essentially restrictive role in zebu husbandry, with the unsanctified buffalo it plays a permissive role with its lack of restrictions on the slaughtering of useless and unproductive buffalo. Thus, this study supports the belief that religion is a powerful force influencing Indian economic activities, especially those relating to animal husbandry.\n      </p>", "J. B. Harley notes that 'maps as an impersonal type of knowledge tend to \"desocialize\" the territory they represent; they foster the notion of a socially empty space'. Focusing on twentieth-century India, this paper considers an alternate tradition of mapping territory in which the nation is cartographically presented to its subject-citizens not as 'empty social space', but as 'Mother India', the Indian nation imagined as woman, mother, goddess. Through an analysis of such 'bodyscapes' of Mother India, I ask what is at stake in cartographically deploying the female body to map national territory. And I consider how such bodyscapes, even as they systematize a particular visual image of 'India', also consolidate the notion of the nation as motherland. / Pour J. B.

Current energy supplies in the world are unsustainable from environmental, economic, and societal standpoints. All over the world, governments have initiated the use of alternative sources of energy for ensuring energy security, generating employment, and mitigating CO\u2082 emissions. Biofuels have emerged as an ideal choice to meet these requirements. Huge investments in research and subsidies for production are the rule in most of the developed countries. India started its biofuel initiative in 2003. This initiative differs from other nations' in its choice of raw material for biofuel production--molasses for bioethanol and nonedible oil for biodiesel. Cyclicality of sugar, molasses, and ethanol production resulted in a fuel ethanol program which suffered from inconsistent production and supply. The restrictive policies, availability of molasses, and cost hampered the fuel ethanol program. Inconsistent policies, availability of land, choice of nonnative crops, yield, and market price have been major impediments for biodiesel implementation. However, a coherent, consistent, and committed policy with long-term vision can sustain India's biofuel effort. This will provide energy security, economic growth, and prosperity and ensure a higher quality of life for India.\n      </p>", "Published literature would suggest that the distribution of sun bears (Ursus malayanus) in India does not extend northward into Manipur province.

Here we focus on the effect of changes in the educational composition of the population on the overall fertility of the population in the presence of strong fertility differentials by education. With data from India we show that alternative paths of future female enrolment in education result in significantly different total fertility rates (TFR) for the country over the coming decades, even assuming identical fertility trends within each education group. These results from multi-state population projections by education are then translated into a fully probabilistic population projection for India in which the results of alternative education scenarios are assumed to expand the uncertainty range of the future TFR in the total population. This first attempt to endogenize structural change with respect to education-which is the greatest measurable source of fertility heterogeneity in Asia-has resulted from a larger exercise of the Asian MetaCentre for Population and Sustainable Development Analysis to collect empirical information, scientific arguments as well as informed opinions about likely future population trends in Asia from a large number of population experts in the region. In this process, future changes in the educational composition of the population have been identified as a key driver of future fertility. The actual probabilistic population projections for India show that with high certainty, the Indian population will continue to grow to about 1.3 billion over the next quarter of a century. After that the uncertainty will get much wider, ranging from a continued strong increase to the beginning of a population decline in India. /// Parmi les diff\u00e9rentes sources d'incertitude dans les projections de population, les changements dans la structure de populations h\u00e9t\u00e9rog\u00e8nes ont re\u00e7u peu d'attention jusqu'ici, en d\u00e9pit de l'impact significatif qu'ils peuvent avoir.

Indeed, changes in their fertility are now making the major contribution to the country's overall fertility decline. We use multilevel statistical procedures to investigate the variation in contraceptive use among uneducated women across India. The analysis suggests that, while many of the expected socio-economic variables play their part, there are also considerable diffusion effects in progress, many of which operate at levels beyond the uneducated women's own individual circumstances. For example, we find significant relationships with others' use of contraception and others' education. Mass media exposure also emerges as an important diffusion channel. The multilevel analysis also reveals significant clustering of contraceptive use at different levels, much of which is accounted for by the variables included in the models.\n      </p>", "There have been competing arguments about the effect of public infrastructure on productivity.

Observations were gathered as part of a larger study of reproductive tract infections in women in Delhi, using both qualitative and quantitative methods. The qualitative phase consisted of 52 in-depth interviews, three focus groups discussions and five key informant interviews. In the quantitative phase inferences were drawn from 380 respondents. Mean age at menarche was 13.5. Onset of menarche is associated with physical maturity and the ability to marry and reproduce. However, a culture of silence surrounds menarche, an event which took the women interviewed almost by surprise. Most were previously unaware that it would happen and the information they were given was sparse. Menstruation is associated with taboos and restrictions on work, sex, food and bathing, but the taboos observed by most of the women were avoidance of sex and not participating in religious practices; the taboo on not going into the kitche, which had been observed in rural joint households, was not being observed after migration from rural areas due to lack of social support mechanisms. There is a clear need to provide information to young women on these subjects in ways that are acceptable to their parents, schools and the larger community, and that allow them to raise their own concerns. Education on these subjects should be envisaged as a long-term, continuous process, beginning well before menarche and continuing long after it. /// Cet article tente de comprendre l'exp\u00e9rience de la menstruation dans le contexte socio-culturel d'un bidonville indien, dans le cadre d'une \u00e9tude plus large des infections gyn\u00e9cologiques \u00e0 Delhi.

Most species showed obvious niche specificity in relation to zone although Polysphondylium pallidum was found in all zones. This is the most common dictyostelid in India and is a generalist in terms of distribution and morphological variety. Dictyostelium minutum, the fourth ranked species, is, by contrast, a specialist with more specific niche requirements and little morphological variation. Dictyostelium aureo-stipes was particularly abundant on the slopes of the Himalaya.

We made a study of nine colonies in the valley during the 1994-95 nesting season, followed by a more intensive study in two subsequent nesting seasons (1995-96 and 1996-97) of two colonies at Nagaon, in central Assam. We measured the dimensions of both nest and non-nest trees, nearest distance between nest trees, and nearest house, nearest forest, nearest road, nearest water source and nearest foraging ground from each colony. All of the colonies were near human settlements. The structure of nest trees differed significantly from non-nest trees in both the overall and the intensive studies. Number of nests was highly correlated with tree height, diameter at breast height (DBH) and canopy area. About 90% of nests were built on the top of the canopy. Storks preferred to nest in compact colonies on large, widely branched trees with thin foliage cover and nearby food sources.\n      </p>", "Over the last two decades, many countries around the world have been enthusiastically embarking on the path of decentralization. However, because of a preconceived idea that decentralization will automatically result in efficient allocation of public resources and due to the absence of an analytical framework and data, very little empirical work has been done in this area. Nor has much attention been given to an analysis of th\u00e8 factors enabling or constraining its outcomes. In this paper, we develop a theoretical model and use it to test empirically the impact of fiscal decentralization on rural infant mortality rates in India between 1990 and 1997. The random effect r\u00e9gression results show that fiscal decentralization plays a statistically significant role in reducing rural infant mortality rate and the results are robust. The results also show that the effectiveness of fiscal decentralization can be affected by other complementary factors such as the level of politicai decentralization.\n      </p>", "Although in some parts of the world the Indian mongoose is viewed as a pest y the animal's pest-destroying abilities have long been recognized by Indian society. Archeological evidence from Harappan sites shows that the mongoose frequented human habitation perhaps in a semi-domesticated condition. Although from Vedic times onward attitudes toward the animal vary, literary sources portray the mongoose as the deadly enemy of the snake and other poisonous creatures y a motif common in Indian folk lore and even seen indirectly in the European folk tradition. The mongoose is also associated with richeSy and identifies the tutelary god of wealth in Buddhist iconography. Indian culture generally represents the mongoose as an animal useful to man f and the loose ties that have evolved between mongoose and society in India are characteristic of an early stage in the domestication process, though it is unlikely that this will proceed any further.\n      </p>", "Geophysical maps depicting continental movement have consistently shown India, as it moved northward, to be located far out in the Tethys Sea. India split off from the African east coast about 148 m.y.a. From that time onward, according to almost all geophysical accounts, India was isolated from all other continents until the early Miocene when it made contact with Eurasia. But the biological data, both fossil and Recent, indicate that this concept cannot be correct. If India had really existed as an isolated, oceanic continent for about 100 m.y., it should have developed a peculiar biota with many endemic genera and families in its terrestrial and shallow marine habitats. But there are virtually no remains of organisms indicating that India was isolated for any substantial time (millions of years). Instead, we find that almost all Indian taxa were possessed in common with other continents. As time went on, the northern relationships became stronger and the southern ones weaker. Most of the recent geophysical accounts show India not making contact with Eurasia until the early Miocene, but fossil materials show that this event must have taken place by the early Eocene. It has been postulated that, as India moved northward, it created a biogeographic barrier that separated marine fish populations and resulted in the east-west provinces that are now apparent in the Indian Ocean. At the same time, the barrier effect was supposed to have resulted in the formation of sister species that are now located far apart. Information currently available indicates that most living, tropical marine species are probably not over 3 m.y. old. Consequently, the northward movement of India, which took place primarily between 148 and 50 m.y.a., could have no bearing on the relationships of modern species.\n      </p>", "We report the oldest known record of Lagomorpha, based on distinctive, small ankle bones (calcaneus and talus) from Early Eocene deposits (Middle Ypresian equivalent, ca 53 Myr ago) of Gujarat, west-central India.

The bones show a mosaic of derived cursorial adaptations found in gracile Leporidae (rabbits and hares) and primitive traits characteristic of extant Ochotonidae (pikas) and more robust leporids. Together with gracile and robust calcanei from the Middle Eocene of Shanghuang, China, also reported here, the Indian fossils suggest that diversification within crown Lagomorpha and possibly divergence of the family Leporidae were already underway in the Early Eocene.\n      </p>", "Los autores que han estudiado el dominio pol\u00edtico que ejerce un solo partido en differentes pa\u00edses con reg\u00edmenes no tatalitarios han identificado un \"ciclo de dominaci\u00f3n\" (Pempel, ed., 1990).

Along the same lines, this analysis concentrates on the political institutions, resources and social divisions to identify the origins, challenges and continuance (or extinction) of the dominance of a single party in Mexico, India and Japan. Despite the significant differences between these nations, the origins of their cycles of one-party dominance share a linkage of party elites, State bureaucrats and private capital that guaranteed positions and resources in the form of patronage and cronyism. In addition to material resources, the use of ideology (for example, the dominant party portrayed itself as the embodiment of the nation's central aspirations and values) was also crucial in creating and subsequently maintaining the dominance of a single party in these countries. In all three cases, dominance also faced similar challenges in the form of significant split in the party in power or in the emergence of an opposition capable of obtaining sufficient credibility regarding its capacity to govern. Finally, the framework of institutions, resources and social divisions also throws light on the extinction of the dominance of a single party in India and Mexico, as well as on its continuance in Japan.\n      </p>", "Harnessing primary and secondary evidence from India, our essay conceptualizes the cultural dynamics of migration. In so doing, it demonstrates the incompleteness of standard marginalist and Marxist accounts of labor circulation. As a corrective, we examine the linkages between culture, politics, space, and labor mobility and offer a way to think about them by building on poststructural critiques of development and postcolonial theories of migrant subjectivity. The proverbial compression of space-time not only has made extralocal work more viable for members of proletarianized groups but, more importantly, has allowed them to transfer their experiences of new ways of being into local contexts through acts of consumption and labor deployment that can become elements of a Gramscian counterhegemonic praxis. We argue that the possibility of this sort of \"body politics\" compels not merely a critique of the modernization paradigm that has organized classical migration studies but, more profoundly, a reassessment of the way we understand modernity itself. We advocate an approach that provincializes the Eurowest and foregrounds the existence of pluritopic \"regional modernities.\"\n      </p>", "The anthropology of India has been dominated by an emphasis on caste that has inhibited an integrated approach to understanding class in India. Using an ethnographic approach that takes into account the symbolic and material aspects of caste and class, this article focuses on the attempts to form a \"community\" of potters among a large group of potter-artisans in central India. It is problematic, however, to view this community as a federation of potter castes or as simply a bloc of classes. Katznelson's (1986) insights into different aspects of class formation help to understand how caste and class get constructed in the formation of a community. Here the apparently caste-based dispositions of potters reveals a class consciousness that is culturally organized by a custom that men work the potter's wheel and women do the marketing.\n      </p>", "Two new, primitive quillwort species, I. udupiensis and I. divyadarshanii, are described from peninsular India.

Providers of abortion range from traditional birth attendants to auxiliary nurse midwives and pharmacists, unqualified and qualified private doctors, to gynaecologists. Despite a well-defined law, there is a lack of regulation of abortion services or providers, and the cost to women is determined by supply side economics. The state is not a leading provider of abortions; services remain predominantly in the private sector. Abortions in the public sector are free only if the woman accepts some form of contraception; other fees may also be charged. The cost of abortion varies considerably, depending on the number of weeks of pregnancy, the woman's marital status, the method used, type of anaesthesia, whether it is a sex-selective abortion, whether diagnostic tests are carried out, whether the provider is registered and whether hospitalisation is required. A review of existing studies indicates that abortions cost a substantial amount - first trimester abortion averages Rs.500-1000 and second trimester abortion Rs.2000-3000. Given the number of unqualified providers and with 15-20% of maternal deaths due to unsafe abortions, the costs of unsafe abortions must also be counted. It is imperative for the state to regulate the abortion economy in India, both to rationalise costs and assure safe abortions for women. /// L'acc\u00e8s aux services d'avortement n'est pas difficile en Inde, m\u00eame dans les r\u00e9gions recul\u00e9es.

Yet they die. Based on insights derived from case studies of women seeking emergency obstetric care and participant-observation of government health services, this article highlights service delivery constraints that underlie the persistence of high levels of maternal mortality in Koppal. Weak information systems, discontinuity in care, unsupported health workers, haphazard referral systems and distorted accountability mechanisms are identified as critical service delivery problems. For example, maternal deaths are under-reported and not reviewed, antenatal care and institutional delivery are not linked to post-partum or emergency obstetric care, and health workers use inappropriate injections but don't treat anaemia or sepsis. Families waste valuable time and resources accessing many providers but fail to get effective care, and blame is laid on lower-level health workers and women for not accessing institutional delivery. Lastly, the role of administrators and politicians in ensuring functioning health services is obscured. While important supply and demand-side reforms are being implemented, these do not constructively engage with informal providers nor address systemic service delivery constraints. Critical managerial change is required, without which new budgetary allocations will be squandered with little impact on saving women's lives. /// A Koppal, le district le plus pauvre de l'\u00c9tat de Karnataka en Inde m\u00e9ridionale, les femmes rurales pr\u00e9sentant des complications obst\u00e9tricales ont acc\u00e8s \u00e0 de nombreux prestataires de soins.

Women saints ranged from the conformists who were either the wives, daughters, or sisters of male saints and the rebels who broke every social norm including the discarding of clothes. Some of the saints looked upon themselves as brides of the Lord. The compositions of rebel saints use mystic imagery and reflect their social alienation. It is interesting that not only the conformists but also the rebels have found acceptance in the modern Hindu pantheon.\n      </p>", "This study examines the dividend behavior of Indian corporate firms in an emerging market (India), identifying characteristics of dividend payers and nonpayers from 1991 to 2001. Dividend trends for a large sample of stocks traded on Indian markets indicate that the percentage of companies paying dividends declined, from over 57 percent in 1991 to 32 percent in 2001, and that only a few firms paid regular dividends. Even though regular payers consistently paid higher dividends than did other firms, on average, Indian firms became less likely to pay dividends by the close of the century. Dividend-paying companies were likely to be larger and more profitable than nonpaying companies, though growth opportunities do not seem to have significantly influenced the dividend policies of Indian firms.\n      </p>", "The medical abortion drugs mifepristone and misoprostol are now widely available in rural Tamil Nadu, India, and the practice of abortion is being transformed. This paper reports on current attitudes and practices concerning medical abortion among qualified abortion providers in a rural area of Tamil Nadu. Interviews were carried out with a purposive sample of 40 doctors, 15 informants at chemist shops, 10 village health nurses and 23 women who had recently had an abortion. Twelve of the 37 private doctors who were providing abortions, were providing medical abortion to 70-80% of their patients and 12 others to a selected minority. Eleven had largely rejected it and still used D&amp;C; two had never heard of it. A number of doctors were using misoprostol for cervical dilatation prior to D&amp;C. Some doctors and women who were concerned about incomplete abortion and heavy bleeding did not have a clear idea of what normal bleeding with medical abortion was. Incorrect regimens with second trimester medical abortions might have been responsible for cases of excessive bleeding. Most chemist shops said they were selling the tablets only on prescription, but doctors reported widespread over-the-counter sales. Medical abortion appeared to be quite acceptable to most women, and women were increasingly requesting it. Mechanisms are needed for sharing information about medical abortion among professionals, community health workers and rural families. The state government should develop a comprehensive plan for incorporating medical abortion into the public health system. /// La mif\u00e9pristone et le misoprostol, m\u00e9dicaments abortifs, sont maintenant largement disponibles dans l'\u00c9tat rural du Tamil Nadu, en Inde, et la pratique de l'avortement en est transform\u00e9e.

The 36 facilities they attended, both government and private, were ranked by 18 village health nurses, acting as key informants, as regards safety and quality of care. Three categories - qualified and safe, intermediate or unqualified and unsafe - were identified. Most of the providers were medically trained, and 75 of the 97 women went to facilities that were ranked as high or intermediate in quality. Government abortion services were mostly ranked intermediate in quality, and criticised by both women and village health nurses. There has been a substantial decrease in the numbers of traditional and unqualified providers. However, about 30% of the women experienced moderate to serious post-abortion complications, including women who went to facilities ranked high.

The focus of this study is on the situation of women in scheduled castes and tribes - groups which are referred to as 'weaker sections of people' and granted special safeguards and concessions under the Indian constitution. Women in these underprivileged groups are doubly disadvantaged: their minority group status interacts with India's patriarchal culture to produce deplorable living conditions. Drawing from both ethnographic and statistical sources, the paper presents a descriptive profile of scheduled caste and tribe women's status in Indian society. Using Indian Census data, the study documents extreme degrees of gender inequality among the scheduled groups. Findings indicate that relative to men, women in these groups have far more limited access to both educational and employment resources. This research also suggests that socioeconomic development serves to reduce the disadvantage of scheduled group women relative to men. Among the scheduled groups considered to be more developed according to standard indicators, findings indicate less gender inequality in education and employment.\n      </p>", "A classic exercise in geography consists of explaining the levels of economic development achieved by different regions with respect to their physical characteristics. In this paper a parallel is drawn between the agricultural systems of southern India and Sudano-Sahelian Africa, where possibilist theory, often dismissive of physical geography, has led authors to consider that Tamil Nadu agriculture should serve as a model of development for Africa. This idea is challenged by new evidence revealing that, in spite of superficial bioclimatic similarities, the greater fertility of Indian red soils may actually account for much of Tamil Nadu's advantage. Agricultural implications are discussed and show that physical determinants play an important part, too often overlooked in planning strategies devised by technocrats, in traditional human land management patterns. These findings are then input to a discussion on the possibilism vs. environmental determinism debate, introducing examples from the Calcutta hinterland and semi-arid Africa, in an attempt to moderate existing cut-and-dried theories on population growth, cultural identity, management of resources and land capability.\n      </p>", "A search for desiccation tolerant grasses in India revealed nine grass species (in the genera Eragrostiella, Oropetium and Tripogon) whose ability to recover from air-dryness had not previously been reported.

Original pollen data from tropical vegetation subjected to seasonal monsoon rains are presented along altitude/temperature gradients. This paper includes a summarized description of the vegetation types mapped in the area. The pollen results are presented in the form of quantitative pollen diagrams and correspondence analyses. They show clear distinct pollen assemblages and markers for all types of vegetation in deciduous and evergreen vegetation. Forests are well identified by percentages of Arboreal Pollen greater than 50%, despite the fact that Dipterocarpaceae and Lauraceae are hardly recorded by pollen. The pollen distinction between low, medium and high elevation evergreen forests matches that established by ecologists. The botanical limits, respectively, placed at 900 m and 1500 m limits, correspond to the 20 \u26acC and 15 \u26acC-values of mean temperature of the coldest month.

Design: Population-based, cross-sectional, house-to-house survey with face-to-face interviews in the city of Bombay during 1992-94. Data was input directly into a programmed, handheld computer (electronic diary). Participants: Permanent residents of the city of Bombay aged 35 years and older. Main outcome measures: Tobacco use in various smoking and smokeless forms. Results: 99 598 individuals were interviewed (60% women, 40% men). Among women, prevalence of tobacco use was high (57.5%) but almost solely in the smokeless form. Among men, 69.3% reported current tobacco use and 23.6% were smokers. The most common smokeless tobacco practice among women was mishri use (44.5% of smokeless users) and among men betel quid with tobacco (27.1%). About half of smokers used bidi and half smoked cigarettes. Chewing areca nut without tobacco was rare (&amp;lt; 0.5% of smokeless users). Educational level was inversely associated with tobacco use of all kinds except cigarette smoking. Conclusions: The pattern of tobacco use varies across India and, in Bombay, is very different from other areas.

A unique data set collected in Dungarpur - one of the less developed districts of India - allows us to closely examine both the determinants and impact of seasonal migration. Detailed information was gathered from all members of 624 households, thus enabling analyses at both individual and household levels. The findings indicate that seasonal migration among rural laborers is wide-spread. Rural households in India use migrant labor offered by their members to improve their well-being by both reducing the impacts of inferior conditions and by raising household's income levels. Migrant labor is a compensating mechanism used by households to reduce their disadvantageous position. Migrant households are characterized by lower education levels, lower levels of income from agriculture, and by an inferior geographical location. However, those households sending migrant labor are found to have higher income levels than those not sending migrant labor. Income from migrant labor accounts for almost 60% of total annual income of households sending at least one migrant laborer. Such findings are in accordance with explanations derived from the 'new economics of migration'. We can thus learn that migration-related decisions should not evaluated only on the basis of utility maximization of individual migrants, but also on the basis of risk reducing by households.\n      </p>", "The contention that objects in the hands of male and female deities sculpted on the exterior of the Kesav Temple at Somnathpur near the city of Mysore, Karnataka State, India, represent maize ears is rejected on linguistic, religious, sculptural, archaeological, agricultural, and botanical grounds. The stone inscriptions associated with the temple list items or commodities used in worship, maize is not included. We find no evidence for maize figuring in any kind of religious ritual or worship. The word for maize used currently in the Kannada language is \"Musukin Jola\" which refers to a kind of millet resembling sorghum (\"jola\"). This appellation is of recent origin and does not appear in any literary work contemporary with the period of construction of Somnathpur temple. The wall images do not fully simulate in form and proportion the actual human figures. The beaded ornamentation, likewise, of the hand-held object shows considerable variation and its comparison whether on qualitative or quantitative basis with actual maize kernels of both primitive and modern maize is inappropriate. The variation in form and proportion and stylistic features of these objects is ascribed to their being the work of different sculptors. Maize now grown near the temple comprises modern cultivars, especially hybrids released during the early 1960's. It is inconceivable that none of the primitive and advanced types of maize purported to be represented in the temple sculpture would have been considered worthy of cultivation from the thirteenth century to the present time. We hold that these temple sculptures do not represent maize or its ear but an imaginary fruit bearing pearls known in Sanskrit as \"Muktaphala.\"\n      </p>", "A new species of Chlorophytum, C. kolhapurense (Anthericaceae) is described and illustrated from Western Ghats, India.\n      </p>", "This paper contains an analysis of the technical options in agriculture for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and increasing sinks, arising from three distinct mechanisms: (i) increasing carbon sinks in soil organic matter and above-ground biomass; (ii) avoiding carbon emissions from farms by reducing direct and indirect energy use; and (iii) increasing renewable-energy production from biomass that either substitutes for consumption of fossil fuels or replaces inefficient burning of fuelwood or crop residues, and so avoids carbon emissions, together with use of biogas digesters and improved cookstoves. We then review best-practice sustainable agriculture and renewable-resource-management projects and initiatives in China and India, and analyse the annual net sinks being created by these projects, and the potential market value of the carbon sequestered. We conclude with a summary of the policy and institutional conditions and reforms required for adoption of best sustainability practice in the agricultural sector to achieve the desired reductions in emissions and increases in sinks. A review of 40 sustainable agriculture and renewable-resource-management projects in China and India under the three mechanisms estimated a carbon mitigation potential of 64.8 MtC yr&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; from 5.5 Mha. The potential income for carbon mitigation is $324 million at $5 per tonne of carbon. The potential exists to increase this by orders of magnitude, and so contribute significantly to greenhouse-gas abatement. Most agricultural mitigation options also provide several ancillary benefits. However, there are many technical, financial, policy, legal and institutional barriers to overcome.\n      </p>", "Understanding the regeneration niche of animal-dispersed epiphytes is important in understanding forest community structure, maintenance of species richness in plant communities, animal movements and distributions, and in managing plant and animal communities for conservation. Strangler figs are particularly interesting for studying epiphyte-host relations because they are hemiepiphytes, implying that strangler and host can potentially belong to the same species and either fuse together or strangle each other, and because all stranglers have many-seeded, animal-dispersed fruit, providing many opportunities for seed dispersal to other stranglers. A study was conducted at a roadside and at a forest site in Karnataka State, south India, to determine factors influencing host choice of strangler figs. Stranglers were found more frequently at the roadside site than at the forest site. At the roadside site, stranglers were found much more abundantly on Ficus hosts than on non-Ficus hosts, whereas at the forest site, stranglers were found more abundantly on non-Ficus hosts. Host tree species with animal-dispersed fruit bore significantly more stranglers than those with mechanically dispersed fruit. More stranglers were found on hosts in large d.b.h. size classes (&gt;80cm d.b.h.) than on those in small d.b.h. classes. Prior studies of strangler-host relations have never found stranglers growing on other stranglers. The results of this study suggest that stranglers are fully capable of regenerating on other stranglers, including conspecifics, but these regeneration events are not observed in forests because of relatively low strangler seed rain, due to lack of clumping of strangler hosts, and low insolation in these habitats.\n      </p>", "A new pteridophyte species, Polystichum manickamianum Benniamin, Fraser-Jenkins &amp; Irudayaraj, is described and illustrated from the Agasthiar Hills, South Western Ghats, South India.

Change detection studies based on land-use patterns of the region revealed that the areal extent of mangrove vegetation of the island during 1998 and 1999 was 2.1 km\u00b2 and 1.3 km\u00b2, respectively. The areal extent of agricultural fields during these periods was 130.4 km\u00b2 and 118.6 km\u00b2, respectively. These results can be used to develop an index for temporal land-use changes in the region as an aid to quantify the extent and nature of the development change and to understand the surrounding environment, which in turn may help the planning agencies to develop sound and sustainable land-use practices.\n      </p>", "Few hurricane impact studies provide robust spatial parameters of damage or relate geographical patterns of destruction accurately to storm trajectories or agencies. A detailed spatial analysis is, therefore, presented of the destruction caused by tropical hurricane 07B which made landfall on 6/7 November 1996 over the Godavari Delta region, Andhra Pradesh, eastern India. Patterns of destruction by storm surge, wind and flood water are quantitatively mapped for death tolls, house destruction and agricultural damage using local administrative (mandal) data bases. Results show that most impact occurred near the coast, but a well-defined path of destruction across the central part of the delta can be identified. Such mapping studies fail to indicate the types of individuals and social groups most affected by the storm hazard and their response to it. An investigation of landowning farmers, female migrant rural labourers and fishing communities in the delta shows that poverty and social ordering in Indian society puts differential limits on the risk reduction abilities of individuals and social groups in the face of the cyclone hazard. The paper also demonstrates that 'top down' institutional measures to reduce the effects of storm damage such as those introduced in the aftermath of hurricane 07B, including early storm warning and evacuation procedures and rehabilitation programmes, remain largely ineffective. It is suggested that the introduction of more 'bottom up' community-based programmes which seek to improve the risk awareness and risk avoiding abilities of affected individuals and groups would be much more beneficial. The case material on hurricane 07B and its effects are placed in context by reviewing and updating long and medium-term time series records of storm frequencies and impacts in the Bay of Bengal and particularly along the eastern coastline of India.\n      </p>", "India took important steps in 2006 to develop its economy and improve its standing abroad.

In India, it has been reported that nearly half of the children have elevated blood lead levels (BLLs). However, little is known about risk factors for these elevated BLLs. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of data from the Indian National Family Health Survey, a population-based study conducted in 1998-1999. We assessed potential correlates of BLLs in 1,081 children who were &lt; 3 years of age and living in Mumbain or Delhi, India. We examined factors such as age, sex, religion, caste, mother's education, standard of living, breast-feeding, and weight/height percentile. Results: Most children (76%) had BLLs between 5 and 20 \u03bcg/dL. Age, standard of living, weight/height percentile, and total number of children ever born to the mother were significantly associated with BLLs (log transformed) in multivariate regression models. Compared with children \u2264 3 months of age, children 4-11 and 12-23 month of age had 84 and 146% higher BLLs, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). A low standard of living correlated with a 32.3% increase in BLLs (p = 0.02). Children greater than the 95th percentile for their weight/height had 31% (p = 0.03) higher BLLs compared with those who were below the 5th percentile for their weight/height. Conclusions: Our study found various factors correlated with elevated BLLs in children. The correlation between greater than the 95th percentile weight/height and higher BLL may reflect an impact of lead exposure on body habitus. Our study may help in targeting susceptible populations and identifying correctable factors for elevated BLLs in Mumbai and Delhi.\n      </p>", "The Greater Adjutant Leptoptilos dubius is one of the rarest storks on the Indian subcontinent.

Methods: A population-based cancer registry was established in 1995 to register incident invasive and in-situ cancers. Cases were found and details abstracted by cancer registry staff visiting 26 data sources, comprising cancer hospitals, tertiary and secondary care hospitals, pathology laboratories and death registration offices. A customized version of CANREG-3 software was used for data entry and analysis. Results: During the period 1996-1998, 783 invasive cancers (310 male and 473 females) were registered, yielding an all-cancer crude incidence rate of 56.8/100,000 males and 88.5/100,000 females; the corresponding age standardized incidence rates (ASR) were 83.3 and 122.3 respectively. In males, mouth cancer (ASR 11.5) was the most frequently recorded malignancy followed by tongue (ASR 8.6), hypopharynx (ASR 7.8), esophagus (ASR 7.8) and larynx (ASR 7.8). Thus head and neck cancers accounted for half of the male cases. In females, cervical cancer (ASR 65.4) accounted for more than half of the cancers followed by breast (ASR 14.2) and mouth (ASR 10.2). Ambillikai Cancer Registry (ACR) reports the second highest incidence of cervical cancer in the world. More than four-fifths of cervical cancer cases were diagnosed in stages II B and III B; a third of these cancer patients either did not have, or did not complete, treatment. Conclusions: The observed cancer patterns in this population establish that measures directed at prevention and early detection (linked with treatment) of cervix and head and neck cancers are of paramount importance for cancer control in this and other rural populations of India where three-fourths of the total population live.\n      </p>", "As reproduction becomes increasingly biomedicalized throughout the globe, reproductive technologies are used in unique ways and imbued with different meanings. This article explores why lower-class women in south India in the 1990s were demanding to have childbirth labors induced with oxytocin drugs while rejecting anesthesia. Cultural constructions of women's reproductive power are evoked and reworked in discourses of modernity that explain this preference. Discourses on relationships among gender, pain, and modernity relate to political-economic constraints on hospitals to perpetuate this practice.\n      </p>", "Vegetation fires are one of the most serious environmental problems in several ecoregions of India. The purpose of this study is to characterize spatio-temporal characteristics of fire events in Orissa state, eastern India. In this study, ATSR satellite remote sensing data have been used to quantify fire events from 1997 to 2006. The spatial scan statistic that quantifies 'hotspot' areas of fire risk has been used to identify statistically significant fire clusters during the ten-year time period. To assess the causative factors of fires, topographic, vegetation, climatic, anthropogenic and accessibility factors were used in a robust multivariate statistical framework. Results suggested a clear variation in hotspots of fire occurrences among districts. Of the several districts, the most likely cluster of fire events has been identified in Jharsuguda district followed by secondary clusters in Gajapati, Phulbani, Anugul, Debagarh, Balangir and Raygada. The first three principal components (PCs) from multivariate statistical analysis could explain 70.48% of variance in biophysical and socio-economic indicators of fire events. The loadings were fairly large and highly positive for deciduous forest percentage, elevation, slope mean, aspect mean, and rural population density in the first PC explaining 40.21% of variance. The second PC included drought index, average temperature and illiteracy explaining nearly 19.2% variance. The third PC had a strong positive association with cropped area and forest cover explaining 10.98% of the total variance. Overall, by quantifying the disparities in fire events in space and time, this study demonstrates the utility of the spatial scan statistic in identifying priority areas of fire risk. Our results on fire hotspots and causative factors of risk can guide forest managers toward the best management strategies for avoiding damage to forests, human life, and personal property in the study area.\n      </p>", "Background: Lead exposure has long been associated with deficits in IQ among children. However, few studies have assessed the impact of lead on specific domains of behavior and cognition. Objective: We evaluated the associations between lead and different domains of neurobehavior and their relative sensitivity to lead. Methods: We determined blood lead levels using a LeadCare instrument in 756 children 3\u20147 years of age attending pre-and elementary schools in Chennai, India. Anxiety, social problems, inattention, hyperactivity, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as well as executive function were assessed in children by their schoolteachers using Conners' Teacher Rating Scales-39, Conners' ADHD/Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, 4th Edition Scales (CADS), and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function questionnaires, with higher scores denoting worse behavior. Analyses were carried out using multivariate generalized estimating equations with comparisons of outcome Z-scores to assess the relative strengths of the associations between log-blood lead and the different domains of behavior. Results: Mean blood lead level was 11.4 \u00b1 5.3 \u00b5g/dL. Blood lead was associated with higher anxiety (\u00df = 0.27,p = 0.01), social problems (\u00df = 0.20, p = 0.02), and higher scores in the ADHD index (\u00df = 0.17; p = 0.05). The effect estimate was highest for global executive function (\u00df = 0.42; p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Higher blood lead levels in this population of young children is associated with increased risk of neurobehavioral deficits and ADHD, with executive function and attention being particularly vulnerable domains to the effects of lead.\n      </p>", "Multi-level analyses of data on 18,519 families with opposite sex children from NFHS-3 are used to test the impact of maternal son preference and context on the gender differential in education in India. The results show that girls are at a greater educational disadvantage compared to their brothers in families with maternal son preference. Mother's education is shown to reduce the effect of son preference and to reduce the bias against daughters. Additionally, there is more gender inequality in education in communities with high levels of maternal son preference and low women's status. Importantly, a family's location in a community or region with higher women's status explains much of the effect of maternal son preference on the gender disparity. The importance of context is further solidified by significant interaction effects showing that the negative effect of mother's education is modified by context.\n      </p>", "Aim To present an up to date account of the Mesozoic history of India and its relationship to the other Gondwana continents and to Eurasia. Location Continents surrounding the Western Indian Ocean. Methods Utilization of recent evidence of continental relationships based upon research in stratigraphy, palaeomagnetism, palaeontology, and contemporary biotas. Results The physical data revealed a sequence of events as India moved northward: (1) India-Madagascar rifted from east Africa 158-160 Ma (million years ago), (2) India-Madagascar from Antarctica c. 130 Ma, (3) India-Seychelles from Madagascar 84-96 Ma, (4) India from Seychelles 65 Ma, (5) India began collision with Eurasia 55-65 Ma and (6) final suturing took place c. 42-55 Ma. However, data from fossil and contemporary faunas indicate that, throughout the late Cretaceous, India maintained exchanges with adjacent lands. There is an absence in the fossil record of peculiar animals and plants that should have evolved, had India undergone an extended period of isolation just before its contact with Eurasia. Main conclusions The depiction of India in late Cretaceous as an isolated continent is in error. Most global palaeomaps, including the most recent one, show India, as it moves northward, following a track far out in the Indian Ocean. But the evidence now indicates that India's journey into northern latitudes cannot have taken place under such isolated circumstances. Although real breaks among the lands were indicated by the physical data, faunal links were maintained by vagile animals that were able to surmount minor marine barriers. India, during its northward journey, remained close to Africa and Madagascar even as it began to contact Eurasia.\n      </p>", "In recent years, Indian leaders have elevated the prominence of democratic rhetoric in their regional and international political discourse.

Rather than simply trying to provide services through traditional bureaucratic mechanisms, governments can make use of oversight tools to influence how health care is delivered through the public and private sectors. Three main oversight functions are described: understanding health system performance, deciding when to intervene in the health system and strategizing and implementing change. Governments also need to understand the ethical basis for decisions. The potential for administering oversight through policy-making, disclosing and informing, regulating, collaborating, and strategically subsidising and contracting services in sexual and reproductive health is described. This approach implies an engagement with a broader set of stakeholders in the health sector than is often the case. It requires a set of skills for public officials beyond managing public programmes, and relies on a larger role for other stakeholders and the general public. When applied to reproductive and sexual health, implementation of the full range of oversight functions offers new opportunities to provide more effective, equitable, accountable and affordable services. /// Cet article examine l'influence du contr\u00f4le sur le secteur de la sant\u00e9, et l'illustre avec des exemples des services de sant\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9sique en Inde.

To understand and quantify the impact of land use change on natural systems, interdisciplinary approaches and concepts linking biophysical and socioeconomic factors are needed. One such approach for analysing the socioeconomic energy flows from land use changes is Human Appropriated Net Primary Production (HANPP). HANPP is defined as the difference between the net primary production of potential vegetation and the actual net primary production remaining in vegetation after harvest. In this study, we used HANPP to quantify the energy flows consequent upon land use/land cover change from 1961 to 1998 in India. Data from the Food and Agricultural Organization Statistics (FAOSTAT) covering land use/land cover estimates, crop production, harvest and fertilizer use data have been used to analyse the trends in HANPP. Land use changes between 1961 and 1998 indicate a small increase in agricultural areas from 58.2% to 60.8% and in forest and woodland areas from 19.0% to 23.2%. Actual above ground net primary production of vegetation increased from 1280.58 to 1818.23 Tg, an increase of approximately 1.4 times over 37 years. Although population increased exponentially, human appropriation of photosynthetic products did not rise as much due to increases in forest cover and agricultural production. Although the HANPP concept is a useful approach to analyse the trends in photosynthetic products brought about by land use changes and harvesting, more robust indicators are needed to understand the impacts associated with these changes. We discuss the relevance of the HANPP analysis results by focusing on land use/land cover change and exploring the inter-linkages between energy flows and environment.\n      </p>", "In recent years India has been moving further in the direction of adopting an Anglo-American model of corporate governance. This decision, the result more of international economic and political pressures than public debate, in effect represents a new development strategy for the world's most populous democracy. In light of this situation, it is important to ask two basic questions: 1) why has the Anglo-American model of corporate governance been adopted? and; 2) can it be justified? This paper addresses the first of these questions by distinguish and examining three historical models of governance in India: 1) the managing agency model in the colonial period; 2) the business house model that emerged after independence, and; 3) the Anglo-American model which has recently been adopted (and is still emerging). The second question is approached through an examination of the \"development impact\" of the new model, as indicated by such measures as growth, employment and respect for shareholder rights.\n      </p>", "Ethnobryological notes on the liverwort Targionia hypophylla to cure scabies, itches and other skin diseases by the Irula tribes and the leafy liverwort Frullania ericoides for head lice (Pediculus humanus) and nourishment of hair by the Mudugar tribes of Attappady, Western Ghats, Kerala are reported for the first time along with a note on the little-known medicinal bryophyte Bryum bicolor mentioned in Rheede's Hortus Malabaricus published in the 17th century.\n      </p>", "Reform politics in India reflects an increasing tendency for politicians and others to present themselves as icons of reforms.

Tidal constituents derived from this process were analyzed to study the tidal asymmetry in these estuaries. Sea level observations during March\u2013April 2003 at 13 stations in the Mandovi and Zuari estuaries were used for the harmonic analysis. Simulations of tides were carried out using a hybrid network numerical model. The model could well simulate the amplitude and phase of five major tidal constituents (K1, O1, M2, N2, S2) in almost all stations in the Mandovi and Zuari estuaries. Both observations and simulations show that the amplitude and phase of major diurnal and semidiurnal constituents increase toward the upstream regions. The increase of this predominant species toward the upstream regions shows that the Mandovi and Zuari estuaries are not frictionally dominated estuaries because amplification due to geometrical effects cancels the decay in amplitude due to friction. The rapid increase of the first and second harmonics of M2 and compound tides inside the estuaries shows the nonlinear response of the Mandovi and Zuari estuarine systems to tidal forcing. The M4/M2 amplitude ratio indicates that the tide is subjected to more asymmetry in the Zuari than that in the Mandovi estuary. The increase of the first harmonic of M2 and decrease of relative surface phase (2M2-M4) inside the Mandovi and Zuari estuaries show that these estuaries are flood dominant estuaries.\n      </p>", "Bambusa majumdarii P.

The many schemes that are specifically for women and general projects for the community from which women can also benefit represent a multi-pronged approach whose aim is the improvement of women's health, education and employment in the context of community development. However, despite five decades of work with a clear bias in favour of women, the improvement in health and the empowerment of women has lagged behind that achieved by men. We believe this is because the community, with its strong male bias, utilises the health facilities and education and employment programmes more for the benefit of men and boys than women and girls. The article argues for a change of approach, in which gender and women's issues are openly discussed and debated with the community.

Surface sediments from the western and eastern continental shelves of India were studied for their total organic matter content and the labile constituents such as total carbohydrates and proteins to get a better understanding of the hydrological and biogeochemical differences of the two regions on the nature of organic matter reaching the surface sediments. The sampling along the west coast was done during September-October 2003, when up welling signatures were found to be still persisting along the shelf as evidenced by the low-oxygenated, nutrient-rich surface waters. The eastern shelf was sampled during November-December 2002. The shelf was found to be oxygen saturated and oligotrophic during the season. The surface sediments of the west coast contained a greater quantity of total organic matter when compared to the east coast, but the percentages of labile constituents of total organic matter in the sediments were found to be higher in the east coast by a factor of three as compared to the west coast.

Cointegration analysis yields an income elasticity of calorie intake of 0.34, while the food-price elasticity is insignificant. Thus, economic growth in India, as measured by increasing per capita income, has significantly improved calorie intake; future income growth can alleviate further inadequate nutrition.

These results suggest that myxomycetes show recognizable patterns of latitudinal variation not unlike those described for many other groups of organisms. Not only is the assemblage of species found in tropical/subtropical regions of the world distinctly different from that of temperate regions, but the species present also exhibit quite different patterns of distribution with respect to the types of substrates upon which they typically occur.\n      </p>", "All previously obtained wolf (Canis lupus) and dog (Canis familiaris) mitochondrial (mt) DNA sequences fall within an intertwined and shallow clade (the 'wolf-dog' clade). We sequenced mtDNA of recent and historical samples from 45 wolves from throughout lowland peninsular India and 23 wolves from the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau and compared these sequences with all available wolf and dog sequences. All 45 lowland Indian wolves have one of four closely related haplotypes that form a well-supported, divergent sister lineage to the wolf-dog clade. This unique lineage may have been independent for more than 400 000 years. Although seven Himalayan wolves from western and central Kashmir fall within the widespread wolf-dog clade, one from Ladakh in eastern Kashmir, nine from Himachal Pradesh, four from Nepal and two from Tibet form a very different basal clade. This lineage contains five related haplotypes that probably diverged from other canids more than 800 000 years ago, but we find no evidence of current barriers to admixture. Thus, the Indian subcontinent has three divergent, ancient and apparently parapatric mtDNA lineages within the morphologically delineated wolf. No haplotypes of either novel lineage are found within a sample of 37 Indian (or other) dogs. Thus, we find no evidence that these two taxa played a part in the domestication of canids.\n      </p>", "The interests of India and Bangladesh have been diverging for some years now, bringing the two countries to what is probably the nadir of their bilateral relations. This article examines the factors shaping these relations and argues that a host of structural and domestic political variables are pulling India and Bangladesh in opposite directions. This deterioration in ties can have important consequences for the two states, South Asia, and the international community at large.\n      </p>", "In spite of modernization and women's increasing role in the market economy, the practice of the dowry in India is becoming more wide-spread, and the value of dowries is increasing. There are many well-documented adverse consequences of the dowry system, particularly for women. This is a study of attitudes toward the dowry system among married women in the northern province of Bihar (N = 4,603), in which the dowry has strong roots in tradition. Hypotheses regarding antecedents involving attachment to tradition, exposure to modernizing influences, and self-interest were developed. Each set of factors has some effects, and nearly two thirds of the women in the survey disapprove of the dowry. The practice may be quite resistant to change, however, because its social and economic consequences carry tangible benefits in an increasingly materialistic culture.\n      </p>", "Development of extension in agroforestry draws on the application of the innovation-diffusion process in agriculture. To be effective, agroforestry extension needs to fit the dynamics of the target farming system, the local socioeconomic and technological systems, and land use constraints. Failure of agroforestry extension has been blamed on inadequate and inappropriate methods, but there have been few studies to identify those factors that determine a farmer's awareness of, or attitude to, agroforestry. The present study focused on the modes of communication used in extension and how they affected adoption of agroforestry in a subsistence farming region of eastern India. The decision to adopt agroforestry was found to be determined by the farmers' attitude to agroforestry, which in turn was shaped by information received through farmer-to-farmer and farmer-to-extension contact. The mode of communication was important and, to be effective, needs to be customized for each target group.\n      </p>", "Phenological observations were made on 122 tree species in a subtropical humid seasonal forest in north-eastern India. The forest had a high proportion of evergreen compared to deciduous species. Leaf-fall of most of the tree species coincided with the dry season. Flushing started towards the end of the dry season for a majority of the tree species, the degree and period of leaflessness varying with the species. Leaf production in the overstorey species extended over a longer period compared to the understorey species. For most of the species, flowering coincided with leaflessness. Proportionately more overstorey species flowered during the dry season and wet season flowering was more characteristic of understorey species. A majority of the species produced fleshy fruits during the wet season. Fruits, produced during the dry season, were mostly dry.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Strobilanthes pothigaiensis, a new species of Strobilanthes (Acanthaceae) allied to S. foliosus T.

In this paper, the focus is on male migrants who are part-time peasants in Nepal and part-time workers in Uttarakhand, northern India. Strategies to choose both a destination and work are studied in order to understand the spatial dimensions of migration. Factors such as the availability of work, networks, proximity, and concepts about space influence the choice of a destination made by migrants, who have to find a balance between constraints and ambitions.\n      </p>", "Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of quartz grains extracted from beachrock on the southeast coast of India was attempted. Preliminary OSL ages of beachrock indicate that during the Late Holocene (3.6-2.1 ka) sea level along this coast was higher than at present. This observation is broadly consistent with the existing data based on radiocarbon dating of bioclasts in the beachrock, which suggests a higher sea stand during 4.3-2.3 ka. This study demonstrates the potential of optical luminescence dating of beachrock for refining sea-level chronology and shoreline evolution on the southeastern coast of India.\n      </p>", "Objective\u2014To determine the concentrations of blood lead (PbB) in pregnant women in the slums of Lucknow, north India. Methods\u2014Of the 203 designated municipal slums in Lucknow, 70 were randomly selected for study and a cohort of 500 pregnant women was enrolled. Each participant was interviewed with questions on possible sources of exposure to lead, surrogates of nutritional status were measured, and PbB was measured. Results\u2014The mean PbB was 14\u00b73 \u03bcg/dl and 19\u00b72% of women had PbB \u2265 20 \u03bcg/dl. PbB was not associated with age, height, weight, gestation, or history of abortions, although higher PbB was associated with higher parity. Women living in inner city neighbourhoods near heavy vehicular traffic had PbB 2\u00b72 \u03bcg/dl higher (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0\u00b78 to 3\u00b76) than those living in other neighbourhoods. The PbB was not associated with reported use of piped water or the presence of paint in homes, and increasing PbB was unexpectedly associated with decreasing use of the eye cosmetic \"surma\" and the duration of gestation. Conclusions\u2014The high PbB found in this population raises concern about fetal development and points to the urgent need to reduce exposure to lead.\n      </p>", "Since the time the English \"discovered\" the Nilgiri Hills of South India in the early 19th century, the numerous antiquities scattered throughout that region, viz., dolmens, stone circles, cairns, barrows, etc., have attracted a great number of investigators of varied provenance. But unto this day, these witnesses of a once flourishing \"megalithic\" culture have continued to puzzle the scholars who studied them, with regard to their authorship and date. From among the present Nilgiri communities, viz., the Todas, Kotas, Ku\u1e5fumbas (\u0100lu and P\u0101lu Ku\u1e5fumbas), Ba\u1e0dagas, and I\u1e5fulas, it is, above all, the Todas and the Ku\u1e5fumbas whose ancestors have been associated with the antiquities, unanimously. The present author aims at corroborating one of the two theories set forth, by devoting his study to an investigation into the Ku\u1e5fumbas\" past and present relationship to the \"megalithic\" cult of the Nilgiri Hills, on the basis of a great amount of hitherto largely unknown material which was collected among the Ku\u1e5fumbas in the course of a two years' field-stay. The materials presented and discussed in this study have been arranged according to the following main topics: unsculptured dolmens; miniature dolmens; alternatives or substitutes for dolmens; sculptured dolmens; stone circles; ancestor stones and memorial statues; shrines and religious centres; \"megalithic\" prisons; and miscellaneous antiquities.\n      </p>", "Structural change in Asia among India, China, and Pakistan has been intense and is directly associated with the instability that has resulted.

In order to examine this issue, an ethnographic study was conducted in one of the Northern Karnataka districts using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. Findings indicate that migration does not seem to be a key factor affecting sexual behaviour among married men. Nearly 35% of married migrant men reported being involved in extramarital sex and 40% of unmarried migrant men were involved in premarital sex. While earlier in the epidemic there was a strong correlation between HIV infection and migration, more recently the correlation seems to be getting weaker. More innovative HIV prevention programmes which take into account the social and cultural characteristics of this region are urgently needed to curtail the rapid development of the epidemic. /// L'hypoth\u00e8se selon laquelle la transmission du VIH est due \u00e0 l'\u00e9migration massive de travailleurs saisonniers de sexe masculin est largement r\u00e9pandue dans le Karnataka du Nord, en Inde.

Miss Marie Gilbert and Miss Ellen Arnold were the first of a stream of missionary women who left the young South Australian colony to work in India. Scores of women from other Christian denominations and from other Australian colonies also went to India and indeed to other mission fields in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. As with other western women missionaries, these women intended to save souls and to bring India's daughters to Christ, often by means of medical work. But unlike their British sisters, these women came from the edge of empire to intervene in another, but different, colonial site. These missionary ventures coincided with efforts of the Australian settlers to elaborate for themselves an identity separate from and against that of the metropolitan centre. Within these debates, contestations over the meaning of 'the colonial girl' and 'the Australian girl' played a key role. The article explores why the women were drawn to India rather than to working with Aboriginal people in Australia. It begins to investigate how in seeking to reconstruct Indian womanhood they elaborated for themselves a separate colonial, Australian identity and how much in their missionary endeavours they affirmed an identity as white, Christian and ultimately British.\n      </p>", "This study of political tolerance in India reveals a positive correlation between such tolerance and membership in political parties and unions, and living in urban areas.
