In this setting, the seller's reputation can become an important factor in the bid. This paper examines the impact of the seller's reputation on the willingness of buyers to bid on items sold via internet auctions, using a 1999 mint condition U.S. $5 gold coin whose average price was $32.73. The empirical results show that the seller's reputation has a positive, statistically significant, but small impact on the price.\n      </p>", "From publicly available data, we identified two national culture dimensions, individualism-collectivism and uncertainty avoidance, and their interaction that influences Internet shopping rates across a wide spectrum of countries. Together, these factors accounted for 14% of the explained variance (on top of the combined variance of 63% explained by national income level, educational level, economic growth rate, unemployment rate, and crime rate) in predicting Internet shopping rates. For countries lower in uncertainty avoidance, individualist cultures show higher Internet shopping rates than do collectivist cultures. Implications for national- and Internet firm-level web design strategies are discussed.\n      </p>", "This paper describes opportunities and challenges of using functional data analysis (FDA) for the exploration and analysis of data originating from electronic commerce (eCommerce). We discuss the special data structures that arise in the online environment and why FDA is a natural approach for representing and analyzing such data. The paper reviews several FDA methods and motivates their usefulness in eCommerce research by providing a glimpse into new domain insights that they allow. We argue that the wedding of eCommerce with FDA leads to innovations both in statistical methodology, due to the challenges and complications that arise in eCommerce data, and in online research, by being able to ask (and subsequently answer) new research questions that classical statistical methods are not able to address, and also by expanding on research questions beyond the ones traditionally asked in the offline environment. We describe several applications originating from online transactions which are new to the statistics literature, and point out statistical challenges accompanied by some solutions. We also discuss some promising future directions for joint research efforts between researchers in eCommerce and statistics.\n      </p>", "This study reexamines the value relevance of e-commerce announcements using an event study methodology. Event studies have become an increasingly popular technique for information systems research by giving researchers a tool to measure the notoriously elusive value of information technology. We find evidence that the traditional event study methodology may not provide an accurate measure of abnormal returns during periods of high market volatility, and propose an alternative methodology. The alternative methodology does not use an estimation period, and takes into account extreme or unusual market movements in the period in which the e-commerce announcement was made. Using the alternative methodology, we find evidence of positive abnormal returns for e-commerce announcements made in the fourth quarter of 1998, but no abnormal returns to e-commerce announcements made in the fourth quarter of 2000. We also find significant differences in value depending on the type of e-commerce initiative. In 2000, e-commerce initiatives with a digital product were valued significantly more than e-commerce initiatives with a tangible product, while in 1998 no such difference existed. In 1998, business-to-business ecommerce initiatives, e-commerce initiatives with a tangible product, and e-commerce initiatives by pure-play Internet firms were valued more than similar initiatives in 2000. The study makes a significant contribution for understanding the value of ecommerce initiatives in highly volatile markets and demonstrates how market values of e-commerce changed from 1998 to 2000. Furthermore, this study shows the importance of carefully considering both the time frame examined and the methodology used when assessing the value relevance of e-commerce initiatives as to avoid inflating the magnitude of any observed effects.\n      </p>", "As a specific institution of distributive trades, e-commerce displays similarities with retail stores and mail order companies. As well as providing theoretical support for the assumption that e-commerce is a way to sell certain goods and services at prices potentially lower than those of traditional distributive channels, this paper analyses its inter-firm diffusion among a sample of firms (mostly SMEs) in Italy. The paper has three main purposes. Firstly, it challenges the view of e-commerce as a \"technological revolution\", by pointing out its nature as a cost-minimizing marketing channel. In particular, it shows how, under certain conditions, ecommerce is a source of transaction cost advantages analogous to those yielded by mail order business. Secondly, the paper identifies from a theoretical viewpoint the circumstances under which e-commerce sales might achieve a significant level of penetration among those SMEs that would otherwise incur high costs in organizing a proprietary distributive channel. Thirdly, it employs a unique data set of Italian manufacturing, service, and hospitality firms (nearly 90% of them with fewer than 100 employees) to estimate a diffusion model based on the logistic curve. According to the estimates, by the fourth quarter of 2003 nearly 50% of the population of firms in the geographical area surveyed will have introduced e-commerce among their marketing channels.\n      </p>", "This paper conducts a two-period dynamic analysis of sourcing mode choices for e-commerce projects implemented by large firms during 1999-2002. We differentiate e-commerce assets that are the focus of a sourcing decision in terms of whether they are in the growth or maturity stages. We also consider hybrid governance mechanisms, such as minority equity arrangements, as a potential sourcing mode in addition to the conventional distinction between insourcing (i.e., hierarchical governance) and outsourcing (i.e., market governance). The rapid evolution in ecommerce technologies and their markets during this period allows us to test whether asset maturity plays any role in sourcing decisions. Results indicate that when the strategic intent of an e-commerce project is more business focused during the growth phase, hybrid governance is preferred over hierarchical governance for sourcing of e-commerce assets. Strategic intent is found not to influence sourcing mode choices during the technology/market maturity phase. Hierarchical governance is the preferred sourcing mode during the growth phase, when task complexity is high. For managing task complexity, as technologies and their markets mature, both hierarchical and hybrid governance modes become preferable to the market governance mode.\n      </p>", "           ", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

A sample of 107 undergraduates reported their Internet-related attitudes and behaviors in the context of a longitudinal survey of purchasing behavior. Path analysis showed that a slightly modified model fit the data well.

Though ethical lag has heretofore hindered our explorations of e-commerce ethics, it is now time to identify and confront them. In this paper we define e-commerce and describe the characteristics that set it apart from traditional brick and-mortar business. We then examine the ethical foundation of e-commerce, focusing on the question, \"Is there a special e-commerce ethics?\" Our answer is \"no.\" We support our answer by showing that the current issues in e-commerce ethics and brick-and-mortar business are fundamentally the same, but that e-commerce issues have different manifestations and scope. We then demonstrate that ethical principles and rules in e-commerce and brick-and-mortar business are fundamentally the same, but have different manifestations at the most specific level.

It is reported by many studies that a large number of online shoppers abandon their transactions because they do not trust the website when they are asked to provide personal information.

The model is based on the information a consumer expects to find on an EC website and that is shown from the literature to increase his/her trust towards online merchants. An information extraction system is then developed to help the user find this information. In this paper, we present the development of the information extraction system and its evaluation.

While the role of trust in e-commerce has been studied from a customer's perspective, the influence of trust from the perspective of the organization is largely unexplored. An initial survey was conducted that found trust was important in an organization's success with e-commerce involving transactions and identifiable partners (EDI), but not in other e-commerce relationships. The ability to secure the website was important in both implementation and success of all e-commerce regardless of purpose. Therefore a follow-up longitudinal case study explored these relationships further by comparing the nature of website purposes, types/functionality, and desired relationships.\n         Four organizations and their websites were examined based on the framework proposed. Under this framework, the desired relationship between customer and organization determines the functionality and the level of security or trust required. The evolution of the relationships and functionality of the websites over a two-year period was followed in these organizations to understand the role of trust and security in website implementation. Changing technology and sophistication of the organizations' resources for security played a key role in the evolution of specific websites. In sum, depending on the type of relationship desired and the level of the website's risk, trust and security play differential roles in the successful implementation of e-commerce.\n         The findings from the survey study, as well as the follow-up case study, are used to suggest a framework of the factors that impact the implementation and perceived success of e-commerce websites from an organizational perspective.

Gazelles do. And that is only 3% of all small companies.\" This paper focuses on the baby gazelles of the Internet economy. It looks at critical success factors that fast growing E-commerce ventures need to take into account in the start-up phase. Based on the results of the EU project KITE, the article demonstrates links between critical success factors, and highlights the competitive advantage deriving from the application of a certain critical success factor. It will compare the critical success factors identified for high growth E-commerce ventures in the start-up phase in KITE with research into the success of high growth companies in general.\n      </p>", "The anticipated growth of new communications technologies, including the Internet and other digital networks, will make it increasingly difficult for states to tax global commerce effectively. Greater harmonization and coordination of national tax policies will likely be required in the coming years in order to address this problem. Given that the history of the state is inseparable from the history of taxation, this \"globalization of taxation\" could have far-reaching political implications. The modern state itself emerged out of a fiscal crisis of medieval European feudalism, which by the 14th and 15th centuries was increasingly incapable of raising sufficient revenues to support the mounting expenses of warfare. If new developments in the technology of commerce are now undermining the efficiency of the state as an autonomous taxing entity, fiscal pressures may produce a similar shift in de facto political authority away from the state and toward whatever international mechanisms are created to expedite the taxation of these new forms of commerce.\n      </p>", "ith <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPal</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/discover/application/resources/images/bulletThree.gif\" alt=\"3\"/> Download the PDF from a link in your email or from your MyJSTOR account.</p>", "Electronic commerce is a worldwide phenomenon. Many Internet users browse the Web for information on products and services, but very few actually make purchases on-line. Until now, research on the factors that promote on-line shopping behavior has treated them independently and at the national level. The present study, in contrast, uses cross-country data from 26 nations and analyzes constructs with a structural equation model (SEM). The study finds that the factors of trust and economic conditions, but not educational level and technological savvy, make a significant positive contribution to on-line shopping behavior. In fact they explain more than 80 percent of the variability in on-line shopping behavior. Empirical guidelines are provided to help managers select one or more macro-level predictors to explain on-line shopping behavior. Future research opportunities are delineated.\n      </p>", "A systematic cross-country analysis of e-commerce activity reveals that although physical infrastructure explains much of the variation in basic Internet use, e-commerce activity also depends significantly on a supportive institutional environment. Chief among the characteristics of such an environment are national respect for the \"rule of law\" and, secondarily, the availability of credible payment channels such as credit cards. These results suggest that an institutional environment that facilitates the building of transactional integrity is critical to the development of e-commerce.\n      </p>", "The emergence of the Internet has created a dynamic electronic marketplace, where a new species of e-commerce corporations are taking root.

First, it attempts to critically evaluate the major international business theories to identify the variables affecting the growth of e-commerce corporations.

Some of that decline may be attributed to the increased size of the surviving local haberdashers while the rest is most likely the result of more intense competition from major department stores. Many wonder whether the haberdasher will meet the fate of locally owned toy stores, bookstores, drug stores, office supply stores, etc. This study focuses on the competitiveness of the local haberdasher and based upon the data gathered, albeit from a single major U. S. city, local haberdashers are doing well.

In a press conference after his inauguration as minister, he stated that Korea is now no longer just an advanced IT country but a global IT leader. He believes that strengthening the international competitiveness of the Korean IT industry is the foremost task of his ministry. From 2000 to 2001, Sang-Chul Lee was the chief executive officer of KT (Korea Telecom) and previously served as the first CEO of Korea Telecom Freetel, known as KTF, a mobile communication firm. As CEO of KT, he transformed KT from a \"dinosaur\" public utility firm into a private enterprise by selling off the government share of KT stock in spring 2002. Mr. Lee is an expert in the information/telecommunication area who graduated with a B.S. from Seoul National University, an M.S. from Virginia Polytechnic Institute, and a Ph.D. from Duke University, all in electrical engineering. He worked as a senior researcher at both Western Union Spacecom and Computer Science Corp. As CEO of KT and KTF, he demonstrated his exceptional managerial skills and global mindset. Now, at this critical juncture as Korea attempts to become a global IT powerhouse, Mr. Lee is the architect for the future direction of the Korean IT industry. Minister Lee oversees establishing basic government policies on: \u2022 Overall management and coordination of national informatization strategy \u2022 Development of high-speed information and communication infrastructure \u2022 Implementation of major national strategies related to information and communication \u2022 Strengthening international cooperation concerning IT and informatization issues \u2022 Development of strategies for broadcasting, satellite business, and media content \u2022 Management of Korean mail and postal finance operations.

The first point concerns how the antitrust laws work as an economic \"charter of freedom\" by protecting our economy from the misuse of market power by dominant firms, or from anticompetitive collusion by groups of firms, or from anticompetitive mergers, all of which can blunt the mainspring of our economic success - competitive markets. Second is an expansion on the first theme which focuses on how antitrust enforcement helps preserve two freedoms that I think small businesses care about very much: the freedom to engage in entrepreneurship, and the freedom to innovate. A final discussion involves a few recent cases recently seen at the Antitrust Division that illustrate the many ways in which antitrust enforcement has helped the small business marketplace.\n      </p>", "This paper explores three inter-related issues: globalisation; the role of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs); and electronic commerce (e-commerce). A central question is whether e-commerce offers advantages to SMEs that may facilitate their access to global markets and help them overcome the disadvantages they face vis-\u00e0-vis large transnational corporations (TNCs)? The paper starts by briefly considering the extent of globalisation and its relationship to free trade. We then go on to consider recent developments in e-commerce, focusing on the key issue of e-payment systems. Differences in the requirements of large and smaller firms are identified, and we identify a number of key issues concerning access of smaller firms to e-payment systems and the (virtual) market place, and outline their implications for regulatory policy. Our analysis highlights the importance of network externalities, and institutional factors affecting trust and the relationships amongst different economic actors. This leads to a consideration of networking and public policies more broadly. One of the central conclusions of our analysis is that there are important synergies between e-commerce (virtual) networks and (real) production networks. This suggests that policy makers and smaller firms should think in terms of extending existing, and catalysing new, real production networks to incorporate e-payment systems for networks of firms in order to facilitate their access to virtual markets.\n      </p>", "This paper attempts to develop a conceptual framework for analysing the impacts of the Internet and e-commerce upon industrial sectors. While a great deal has been written about the so-called 'new economy' much of it has been either speculative and hyperbolic, as in the 'boom' years of the late 1990s, or cynical and dismissive, as in the period since the collapse of 'dot.com' stocks in Spring 2000. We seek to move beyond and between these positions by providing a means to determine what difference the Internet and e-commerce might make to industrial organization through a consideration of the retail financial services industry. We do this through a critical evaluation of the concept of disintermediation that, as we argue in the paper, is better understood as reintermediation. We argue that the potential impacts of the Internet and e-commerce upon retail financial services are non-trivial, and they are consistent with the individualization of risk and reward that have characterized wider processes of financial inclusion and exclusion over the past decade or so.\n      </p>", "In November 1999, the Internet toy store eToys.com initiated a trademark lawsuit against \"net.art\" site etoy.com. etoy and other Internet activists responded by launching TOYWAR, a decentralized on-line mobilization against eToys, waged on fronts from shopping servers to on-line investors' forums.
