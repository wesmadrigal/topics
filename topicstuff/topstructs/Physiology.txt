However, very little is known about the physiological and biochemical mechanisms underlying bat migration. In contrast, the physiology of migrating birds has been studied for decades and many migration-related changes have been documented. Although bats and birds evolved flight and long-distance migration independently, they have likely experienced many similar selective pressures. We therefore suggest that knowledge of bird migration physiology can be used to generate predictions for emerging studies of bat migration physiology. In this review, we discuss major physiological and biochemical adaptations relating to fuel acquisition and fuel utilization. For each, we summarize knowledge gained from migration studies of birds and bats (if any) and make predictions of bat migration physiology. For many aspects, we predict that bats will have evolved similar physiological mechanisms to birds. However, there are some potentially major differences in the energetic models for bats and birds, including torpor, fuel selection at high-intensity exercise, and trade-offs between reproduction and migration.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

This paper reviews findings of that research in the areas of general physiology and energetics; protein, fat, and bone metabolism; metabolic endocrinology; reproductive physiology and lactation; serum chemistry and hematology; and the urea:creatinine ratio. Bears in hibernation exhibit several characteristics distinct from the deep hibernation of rodents, such as a lesser reduction in body temperature, protein conservation, lack of defecation and urination, and normal bone activity. The physiological constraints of hibernation are coupled to adaptations in reproductive physiology, such as delayed implantation and lactation. I argue that urea:creatinine is not a reliable indicator of hibernation, although ongoing research is searching for an opioid-like hibernation trigger. Study of hibernation physiology will continue to bear fruit, especially in the areas of evolution, physiology, and medicine.\n      </p>", "Short- and long-term firing patterns of neurosecretory cells releasing pheromonotropic neuropeptides in the silkworm moth Bombyx mori were examined. The cells showed three types of rhythmic changes in firing activity. Bursting activities with an interval of several seconds were synchronized with rhythmic abdominal motions for calling behavior. A slow fluctuation in firing activity over a period of several minutes depended on cyclic alternations of the flow of hemolymph. The electrical activity displayed a diel rhythm that related to light/dark cycles of the environment and sex pheromone titers in the pheromone gland. In addition to a transient inhibition of firing caused by a tactile or light stimulus, a long-term permanent inhibition was induced by mating with a fertile male. Thus, the insect neurosecretory system is highly coordinated with physiology and behavior in Bombyx mori and is influenced by external stimuli.\n      </p>", "Hibernation is a physiological adaptation characterized by dramatic decreases in heart rate, body temperature, and metabolism, resulting in long-term dormancy. Hibernating mammals survive for periods up to 6 mo in the absence of food by minimizing carbohydrate catabolism and using triglyceride stores as their primary source of fuel. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the changes from a state of activity to the hibernating state are poorly understood; however, the selective expression of genes offers one level of control. To address this problem, we used a differential gene expression screen to identify genes that are responsible for the physiological characteristics of hibernation in the heart of the thirteen-lined ground squirrel (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus). Here, we report that genes for pancreatic lipase and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 4 are up-regulated in the heart during hibernation. Pancreatic lipase is normally expressed exclusively in the pancreas, but when expressed in the hibernating heart it liberates fatty acids from triglycerides at temperatures as low as 0 degrees C. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 4 inhibits carbohydrate oxidation and depresses metabolism by preventing the conversion of pyruvate to Ac-CoA. The resulting anaerobic glycolysis and low-temperature lipid catabolism provide evidence that adaptive changes in cardiac physiology are controlled by the differential expression of genes during hibernation.\n      </p>", "Parvalbumin (PV) is a high affinity Ca2+-binding protein found at high concentration in fast-contracting/relaxing skeletal muscle fibers of vertebrates. It has been proposed that PV acts in the process of muscle relaxation by facilitating Ca2+ transport from the myofibrils to the sarcoplasmic reticulum. However, on the basis of metal-binding kinetics of PV in vitro, this hypothesis has been challenged. To investigate the function of PV in skeletal muscle fibers, direct gene transfer was applied in normal and regenerating rat soleus muscles which do not synthesize detectable amounts of PV. Two weeks after in vivo transfection with PV cDNA, considerable levels of PV mRNA and protein were detected in normal muscle, and even higher amounts were detected in regenerating muscle. Twitch half-relaxation time was significantly shortened in a dose-dependent way in transfected muscles, while contraction time remained unaltered. The observed shortening of half-relaxation time is due to PV and its ability to bind Ca2+, because a mutant protein lacking Ca2+-binding capacity did not promote any change in physiology. These results directly demonstrate the physiological function of PV as a relaxing factor in mammalian skeletal muscle.\n      </p>", "The hypothalamic hormone gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is released in a pulsatile fashion, with its frequency varying throughout the reproductive cycle. Varying pulse frequencies and amplitudes differentially regulate the biosynthesis and secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) by pituitary gonadotropes. The mechanism by which this occurs remains a major question in reproductive physiology. Previous studies have been limited by the lack of available cell lines that express the LH and FSH subunit genes and respond to GnRH. We have overcome this limitation by transfecting the rat pituitary GH3 cell line with rat GnRH receptor (GnRHR) cDNA driven by a heterologous promoter. These cells, when cotransfected with regulatory regions of the common \u03b1, LH\u03b2, or FSH\u03b2 subunit gene fused to a luciferase reporter gene, respond to GnRH with an increase in luciferase activity. Using this model, we demonstrate that different cell surface densities of the GnRHR result in the differential regulation of LH and FSH subunit gene expression by GnRH. This suggests that the differential regulation of gonadotropin subunit gene expression by GnRH observed in vivo in rats may, in turn, be mediated by varying gonadotrope cell surface GnRHR concentrations. This provides a physiologic mechanism by which a single ligand can act through a single receptor to regulate differentially the production of two hormones in the same cell.\n      </p>", "Although aquaporin 5 (AQP5) is the major water channel expressed in alveolar type I cells in the lung, its actual role in the lung is a matter of considerable speculation. By using immunohistochemical staining, we show that AQP5 expression in mouse lung is not restricted to type I cells, but is also detected in alveolar type II cells, and in tracheal and bronchial epithelium. Aqp5 knockout (Aqp5-/-) mice were used to analyze AQP5 function in pulmonary physiology. Compared with Aqp5+/+ mice, Aqp5-/- mice show a significantly increased concentration-dependent bronchoconstriction to intravenously administered Ach, as shown by an increase in total lung resistance and a decrease in dynamic lung compliance (P &lt; 0.05). Likewise, Penh, a measure of bronchoconstriction, was significantly enhanced in Aqp5-/- mice challenged with aerosolized methacholine (P &lt; 0.05). The hyperreactivity to bronchoconstriction observed in the Aqp5-/- mice was not due to differences in tracheal smooth muscle contractility in isolated preparations or to altered levels of surfactant protein B. These data suggest a novel pathway by which AQP5 influences bronchoconstriction. This observation is of special interest because studies to identify genetic loci involved in airway hyperresponsiveness associated with asthma bracket genetic intervals on human chromosome 12q and mouse chromosome 15, which contain the Aqp5 gene.\n      </p>", "Inorganic sulfate is required for numerous functions in mammalian physiology, and its circulating levels are proposed to be maintained by the Na+-SO4 2- cotransporter, (NaSi-1). To determine the role of NaSi-1 in sulfate homeostasis and the physiological consequences in its absence, we have generated a mouse lacking a functional NaSi-1 gene, Nas1. Serum sulfate concentration was reduced by &gt;75% in Nas1-/- mice when compared with Nas1+/+ mice. Nas1-/- mice exhibit increased urinary sulfate excretion, reduced renal and intestinal Na+-SO4 2- cotransport, and a general growth retardation. Nas1-/- mouse body weight was reduced by &gt;20% when compared with Nas1+/+ and Nas1+/- littermates at 2 weeks of age and remained so throughout adulthood. Nas1-/- females had a lowered fertility, with a 60% reduction in litter size. Spontaneous clonic seizures were observed in Nas1-/- mice from 8 months of age. These data demonstrate NaSi-1 is essential for maintaining sulfate homeostasis, and its expression is necessary for a wide range of physiological functions.\n      </p>", "Members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family play a critical role in embryonic lung development and adult lung physiology. The in vivo investigation of the role FGFs play in the adult lung has been hampered because the constitutive pulmonary expression of these factors often has deleterious effects and frequently results in neonatal lethality. To circumvent these shortcomings, we expressed FGF-3 in the lungs under the control of the progesterone antagonist-responsive binary transgenic system. Four binary transgenic lines were obtained that showed ligand-dependent induction of FGF-3 with induced levels of FGF-3 expression dependent on the levels of expression of the GLp65 regulator as well as the dose of the progesterone antagonist, RU486, administered. FGF-3 expression in the adult mouse lung resulted in two phenotypes depending on the levels of induction of FGF-3. Low levels of FGF-3 expression resulted in massive free alveolar macrophage infiltration. High levels of FGF-3 expression resulted in diffuse alveolar type II cell hyperplasia. Both phenotypes were reversible after the withdrawal of RU486. This system will be a valuable means of investigating the diverse roles of FGFs in the adult lung.\n      </p>", "Calcium sensitivity of myosin cross-bridge activation in striated muscles commonly varies during ontogeny and in response to alterations in muscle usage, but the consequences for whole-organism physiology are not well known. Here we show that the relative abundances of alternatively spliced transcripts of the calcium regulatory protein troponin T (TnT) vary widely in flight muscle of Libellula pulchella dragonflies, and that the mixture of TnT splice variants explains significant portions of the variation in muscle calcium sensitivity, wing-beat frequency, and an index of aerodynamic power output during free flight. Two size-distinguishable morphs differ in their maturational pattern of TnT splicing, yet they show the same relationship between TnT transcript mixture and calcium sensitivity and between calcium sensitivity and aerodynamic power output. This consistency of effect in different developmental and physiological contexts strengthens the hypothesis that TnT isoform variation modulates muscle calcium sensitivity and whole-organism locomotor performance. Modulating muscle power output appears to provide the ecologically important ability to operate at different points along a tradeoff between performance and energetic cost.\n      </p>", "The molecular determinants of water permeability in the human lung are incompletely defined. Aquaporins (AQP) are water-specific membrane channel proteins. AQP1 is present in endothelial cells in the lung, including those in the vascular plexus around the airways. Rare individuals have been identified who are deficient in AQP1. High-resolution computed tomography scans of the lung were used to evaluate the response to i.v. fluid challenge in two unrelated AQP1-null individuals and five normal controls. The airways and pulmonary vessels were measured at baseline and after i.v. administration of 3 liters of saline. Increases in airway wall thickness after fluid administration reflect peribronchiolar edema formation. Both control and AQP1 null subjects had approximately a 20% increase in pulmonary vessel area in response to saline infusion, suggesting similar degrees of volume loading. Control subjects had a 44% increase in the thickness of the airway wall, consistent with peribronchiolar edema formation. In marked contrast, airway wall thickness did not change in AQP1-null subjects in response to saline infusion. These studies indicate that AQP1 is a determinant of vascular permeability in the lung, and demonstrate a role for aquaporins in human pulmonary physiology.\n      </p>", "Metallothionein (MT) has several putative roles in metal detoxification, in Zn and Cu homeostasis, in scavenging free radicals, and in the acute phase response. Mice of mixed 129/Ola and C57BL/6J background with targeted disruption of MT-I and MT-II genes are more sensitive to toxic metals and oxidative stress. We noted that these animals were larger than most strains of mice, and we systematically studied aspects of their physiology and biochemistry relating to energy metabolism. During the first 2 weeks after weaning, the growth rates of MT-null and C57BL/6J mice were similar, but the transgenic mice became significantly heavier at age 5-6 weeks. At age 14 weeks, the body weight and food intake of MT-null mice was 16 and 30% higher, respectively, compared with C57BL/6J mice. Most 22- to 39-week-old male MT-null mice were obese, as shown by increased fat accretion, elevated obese (ob) gene expression, and high plasma leptin levels, similar to those recorded in Zucker fatty (fa/fa) rats. Seven-week-old MT-null mice also had significantly higher levels of plasma leptin and elevated expression of ob, lipoprotein lipase, and CCAAT enhancer binding protein \u03b1 genes as compared with age-matched C57BL/6J mice. These observations indicate that abnormal accretion of body fat and adipocyte maturation is initiated at 5-7 weeks of age, possibly coincident with sexual maturation. Targeted disruption of MT-I and MT-II genes seems to induce moderate obesity, providing a new obese animal model. A link between MT and the regulation of energy balance is implied.\n      </p>", "Computational modelling of biological processes and systems has witnessed a remarkable development in recent years. The search-term (modelling OR modeling) yields over 58 000 entries in PubMed, with more than 34 000 since the year 2000: thus, almost two-thirds of papers appeared in the last 5-6 years, compared to only about one-third in the preceding 5-6 decades. The development is fuelled both by the continuously improving tools and techniques available for bio-mathematical modelling and by the increasing demand in quantitative assessment of element inter-relations in complex biological systems. This has given rise to a worldwide public domain effort to build a computational framework that provides a comprehensive theoretical representation of integrated biological function-the Physiome. The current and next issues of this journal are devoted to a small sub-set of this initiative and address biocomputation and modelling in physiology, illustrating the breadth and depth of experimental data-based model development in biological research from sub-cellular events to whole organ simulations.\n      </p>", "The early history of parasite physiology is reviewed, using chiefly the investigations on Ascaris to illustrate the development of helminth biochemistry. It is noted that the interest centered here on the physiology of the worms themselves, while the majority of the relevant early protozoological papers dealt with the influence of the parasites on the metabolism of the hosts. Helminth physiology started essentially with Bunge and Weinland at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries, while physiological work on parasitic protozoa (disregarding some precursors) was initiated during the 1920's and 1930's by several independently working investigators. The importance of Keilin's early work on Gasterophilus, another approach to parasite physiology, is emphasized. While parasite physiology developed only slowly during the first decades of this century, the field has developed both in breadth and in depth since the Second World War. It is well known that the publication of parasitological papers in general has increased considerably in the last 25 years, but a differential growth rate in favor of physiology and biochemistry is readily demonstrable. It will, no doubt, come to an end sooner or later, even though some important physiological aspects of parasitism, such as sensory physiology, so far have received only very limited attention.\n      </p>", "This paper addresses the visual culture of late-19th-century experimental physiology. Taking the case of Johann Nepomuk Czermak (1828-1873) as a key example, it argues that images played a crucial role in acquiring experimental physiological skills. Czermak, Emil Du Bois-Reymond (1818-1896) and other late-19th-century physiologists sought to present the achievements and perspective of their discipline by way of \"immediate visual perception (unmittelbare Anschauung).\" However, the images they produced and presented for this purpose were strongly mediated. By means of specifically designed instruments, such as the \"cardioscope,\" the \"contraction telegraph,\" and the \"frog pistol,\" and of specifically constructed rooms, so-called \"spectatoriums,\" physiologists trained and controlled the perception of their students before allowing them to conduct experiments on their own. Studying the material culture of physiological image production reveals that technological resources such as telegraphy, photography, and even railways contributed to making physiological facts anschaulich. At the same time, it shows that the more traditional image techniques of anatomy played an important role in physiological lecture halls, especially when it came to displaying the details of vivisection experiments to the public. Thus, the images of late 19th century physiology stood half-way between machines and organisms, between books and instruments.\n      </p>", "Our understanding of insect societies is rapidly expanding due to an emphasis on integrative approaches. Emerging tools enabling the molecular dissection of social behavior, together with novel hypotheses for the evolution of eusociality, are emblematic of this progress. However, an obstacle to a truly integrative approach remains, as social physiology\u2014the basis of group-level coordination\u2014has generally been neglected by geneticists. In this paper, we begin a synthesis of these fields by first reviewing three classes of social insect organization that mark major transitions in increasing social complexity. We then develop an expansion of the superorganism concept in order to place eusociality into a broad evolutionary context, and we also interpret current molecular and genetic work on the evolution of eusociality. The groundplan hypothesis proposes that eusociality arose via simple changes in the regulation of ancestral gene sets affecting reproductive physiology and behavior, and we argue that this hypothesis is explanatory for the evolution of division of labor (social anatomy) but not for the regulatory systems that ensure group-level coordination of action (social physiology), which we propose is dependent on previously unrelated traits that are brought together into novel genetic networks. We conclude with a review of recent work in sociogenomics that supports our hypotheses.\n      </p>", "Calcium occupies a unique position among plant nutrients both chemically and functionally. Its chemical properties allow it to exist in a wide range of binding states and to serve in both structural and messenger roles. Despite its importance in many plant processes, Ca mobility is low, making Ca uptake and distribution rate a limiting process for many key plant functions. Ca plays an essential role in regulating many physiological processes that influence both growth and responses to environmental stresses. Included among these are: water and solute movement, influenced through effects on membrane structure and stomatal function; cell division and cell wall synthesis; direct or signaling roles in systems involved in plant defense and repair of damage from biotic and abiotic stress; rates of respiratory metabolism and translocation; and structural chemistry and function of woody support tissues. Forest trees, because of their size and age capacity, have been examined for evidence of limitations imposed by the timing and level of Ca supply. Examination of Ca physiology and biogeochemical cycling for forested systems reveals many indications that Ca supply places important limitations on forest structure and function. These limitations are likely to be most significant with older trees, later successional stages, high levels of soil acidity and/or high canopy, Ca leaching losses, or under conditions where plant competition is high or transpiration is limited by high humidity or low soil moisture. Evidence of structural and physiological adaptations of forests to limited Ca supply; indicators of system dysfunction at many levels under reduced Ca supply; and the positive responses of diverse indicators of forest vitality in liming experiments indicate that Ca is more important to forest function and structure than has generally been recognized. Lack of recognition of Ca limitations is due in part to that fact some important plant functions are controlled by changes in very small physiologically active pools within the cytoplasm, and whole-leaf Ca levels may not reflect these limitations. An additional aspect is the fact that Ca availability has declined significantly for many forests in just the past few decades. Additional research on the role of Ca supply in resistance of forests to disease, changes in structural integrity of woody tissues, restrictions on rooting patterns and function, and uptake of other nutrients, notably N, is needed. Increased understanding of the physiological ecology of Ca supply can be anticipated to provide important insights that will aid in future protection and management of both natural and commercial forest systems.\n      </p>", "Teachers know that educational experiences extend far beyond the classroom. With a wide variety of science-related programs on television, there is a need for more research into how these programs can be utilized in a classroom setting. In this mixed-methods study, we asked the question: Can student understanding of human physiology be improved through the use of multimedia resources, specifically through the use of popular television? Episodes of Fox's popular medical drama \"House, M.D.\" were incorporated into high school biology curricula during instructional units on two body systems: the nervous system and the immune system. Through the use of integrated media and classroom discussions, students were exposed to the social aspect of learning as they worked together to analyze what they viewed on TV. This study was conducted over a traditional school year in a general biology class at a lower-socioeconomic urban high school.\n      </p>", "There is growing recognition that opportunities exist to use physiology as part of the conservation and management of populations and ecosystems. However, this idea has rarely been extended to the field of restoration ecology. Physiological metrics (e.g., gas exchange, energy transfer and metabolism, stress response, nutritional condition, gene expression) from a range of taxa can be used to understand the function of ecosystems as well as the factors that influence their structure. Such knowledge can assist the development and implementation of effective restoration strategies that recognize the role of habitat quality on organismal performance. Furthermore, physiological tools can be used to monitor the success of restoration projects during their implementation and as part of postproject monitoring. The often rapid response of physiological metrics provides more immediate information, enabling an adaptive approach to restoration, than can usually be obtained if the focus is solely on population- or ecosystem-level metrics. Greater integration of physiological responses into ecological restoration will provide practitioners with fundamental scientific information needed to design, implement, and monitor restoration activities to aid in repairing ecosystems around the globe.\n      </p>", "Although many studies have debated the theoretical links between physiology, ecological niches and species distribution, few studies have provided evidence for a tight empirical coupling between these concepts at a macroecological scale. We used an ecophysiological model to assess the fundamental niche of a key-structural marine species. We found a close relationship between its fundamental and realized niche. The relationship remains constant at both biogeographical and decadal scales, showing that changes in environmental forcing propagate from the physiological to the macroecological level. A substantial shift in the spatial distribution is detected in the North Atlantic and projections of range shift using IPCC scenarios suggest a poleward movement of the species of one degree of latitude per decade for the 21st century. The shift in the spatial distribution of this species reveals a pronounced alteration of polar pelagic ecosystems with likely implications for lower and upper trophic levels and some biogeochemical cycles.\n      </p>", "The Pseudomonas syringae type III effector AvrRpt2 promotes bacterial virulence on Arabidopsis thaliana plants lacking a functional RPS2 gene (rps2 mutant plants). To investigate the mechanisms underlying the virulence activity of AvrRpt2, we examined the phenotypes of transgenic A. thaliana rps2 seedlings constitutively expressing AvrRpt2. These seedlings exhibited phenotypes reminiscent of A. thaliana mutants with altered auxin physiology, including longer primary roots, increased number of lateral roots, and increased sensitivity to exogenous auxin. They also had increased levels of free indole acetic acid (IAA). The presence of AvrRpt2 also was correlated with a further increase in free IAA levels during infection with P. syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000 (PstDC3000). These results indicate that AvrRpt2 alters A. thaliana auxin physiology. Application of the auxin analog 1-naphthaleneacetic acid promoted disease symptom development in PstDC3000-infected plants, suggesting that elevated auxin levels within host tissue promote PstDC3000 virulence. Thus, AvrRpt2 may be among the virulence factors of P. syringae that modulate host auxin physiology to promote disease.\n      </p>", "We investigate physiological mechanisms behind the convergent evolutionary loss of seed dormancy in plant lineages, focusing on mangroves as a model system. More than 60 angiosperm families, including several mangrove taxa, contain species with seeds that are intolerant of drying and do not undergo dormancy. These desiccation-intolerant species occur with disproportionate frequency in wet or coastal tropical habitats. In plants, the hormone abscisic acid (ABA) coordinates both the development of desiccation tolerance during the onset of seed dormancy and whole-organism responses to flooding. Thus, changes in ABA levels and/or modes of action in different plant compartments are implicated in the repeated evolutionary loss of seed dormancy among species of wet habitats. We compare ontogenetic dynamics of ABA levels in embryonic, maternal, and mature vegetative tissue of four phylogenetically independent pairs of related viviparous mangroves and nonviviparous nonmangroves. We demonstrate that ABA levels are consistently lower in embryos of viviparous mangrove taxa than embryos of nonmangrove, nonviviparous sister taxa. In contrast, elevated tissue concentrations of ABA characterize leaves of all mangrove species tested, while ABA levels in maternal tissues vary among mangrove species. These commonalities suggest a functionally important trade-off between the maintenance of embryonic development and the adjustment of the parent tree to salinity stress. This study yields comparative data on seed physiology in naturally occurring desiccation-intolerant species, for which these data are currently scarce, and demonstrates a potentially significant role of phytohormones in the evolution of plant life histories\n      </p>", "Twenty-four hours after parasitization by the solitary insect parasite Hyposoter exiguae, the nutritional physiology of its host, Trichoplusia ni, was examined. Rates of growth, food consumption, assimilation, excretion, and respiration were calculated as well as approximate digestibility and the rate ratios ECI, percent efficiency of conversion of ingested food to body substance, and ECD, percent efficiency of conversion of digested food to body substance. In addition, the effects of starvation on the above nutritional parameters in host larvae reared on nutrient-deficient diets were determined. Parasitizaton resulted in significant decreases in the rates of growth, feeding, and excretion, but the rates of assimilation and respiration were elevated. The ECI and ECD were also reduced as a result of parasitization, but digestibility was increased. The effects of starvation were qualitatively, but not quantitatively similar to those that resulted from parasitization. However, the metabolic rate, that is, the rate of intake of nutrients required to compensate for metabolism, was much higher in starved larvae.\n      </p>", "1 The paper reviews the literature on seed dormancy, with special regard to inconsistencies in terms and definitions used. It presents a concept of seed dormancy in which physiology and ecology are integrated. Its aim is to increase the understanding of seed dormancy and germination, and to help defining ecological research questions. 2 It is claimed that seed dormancy should not be identified with the absence of germination. Seed dormancy should rather be defined as a characteristic, the degree of which determines the range of conditions in which a seed is able to germinate. Dormancy varies on a continuous scale, which is visualized by continuous changes in the range of conditions suitable for germination. If the conditions required by the seed are met by its environment, the seed will germinate. 3 The concept of dormancy that is described in the paper is partly based on a physiological model for the regulation of dormancy and the stimulation of germination. In this model dormancy is related to the amount of a hypothetical phytochrome receptor in the seed. 4 It is argued that the process of dormancy release should be clearly distinguished from the germination process itself. It is stated that as yet only temperature has been shown to alter the degree of dormancy in seeds. Factors like light and nitrate are often indispensable for germination, but only by promoting the germination process itself, not by mitigating the requirements for germination. 5 It is suggested that seed dormancy prevents germination when conditions are favourable for germination, at a time of the year when it can be expected that the plant originating from the seed will not survive and produce offspring. 6 It is concluded that dormancy should not be regarded as inactivity of seeds. At any degree of dormancy, seeds continuously react to their environment by adjusting their level of dormancy to the changing environment.\n      </p>", "Cutaneous gas exchange is \"diffusion limited\" in most amphibians. Hence plethodontid salamanders, which lack lungs as adults, may be unable to maintain high rates of oxygen uptake at high temperatures, large body sizes, or when oxygen is scarce. However, this physiological constraint apparently does not limit plethodontids ecologically. For example, tropical plethodontids attain large size and experience high temperatures, yet they differ little from temperate zone forms in their respiratory physiology. A far more important consequence of cutaneous respiration for terrestrial plethodontids is that the skin must be moist and permeable if it is used in gas exchange, a constraint that restricts plethodontids to moist microhabitats. Even in moist terrestrial habitats, plethodontids lose water when outside of retreats or burrows. Water loss may restrict foraging and courtship opportunities on all but very wet nights, and plethodontids may abandon surface activity entirely during dry periods. The moist diurnal retreats of most active terrestrial plethodontids may lack sufficient thermal diversity to allow behavioral thermoregulation. Consequently, field body temperatures of plethodontids usually resemble prevailing local climatic conditions, are negatively correlated with elevation, and undergo predictable seasonal variation. Thermal acclimation of metabolism may be instrumental in compensating for this variation in body temperature. The lives of terrestrial plethodontids may consist of long periods of inactivity interspersed with brief periods of activity and energy processing when thermal and hydric conditions permit. Key specializations (low metabolic rate, relatively large energy stores, profound resistance to starvation) may enable plethodontids to survive indefinite periods between unpredictable bouts of feeding. The absence of energetically costly \"adaptations\" that might allow more regular activity may be a partial explanation of the extraordinarily low energy requirements of plethodontids.\n      </p>", "Measurement of fecal glucocorticoids is a new and non-invasive approach to studying stress in free-ranging animals and is being applied to an increasing number of species. The purpose of this review is to discuss the physiology underlying the stress response, measurement of fecal glucocorticoids in mammals, and nonstress factors affecting fecal excretion of glucocorticoid metabolites. We argue that adaptation and sensitization, sex, reproductive events, diet, prehibernatory preparations, inter-species differences, and assay methods are potential sources of difficulty in interpreting data when adapting this approach to studies of stress in wildlife.\n      </p>", "A surface electromyogram (sEMG) contains information about physiological and morphological characteristics of the active muscle and its neural strategies. Because the electrodes are situated on the skin above the muscle, the sEMG is an easily obtainable source of information. However, different combinations of physiological and morphological characteristics can lead to similar sEMG signals and sEMG recordings contain noise and other artefacts. Therefore, many sEMG signal processing methods have been developed and applied to allow insight into neuromuscular physiology. This paper gives an overview of important advances in the development and applications of sEMG signal processing methods, including spectral estimation, higher order statistics and spatio-temporal processing. These methods provide information about muscle activation dynamics and muscle fatigue, as well as characteristics and control of single motor units (conduction velocity, firing rate, amplitude distribution and synchronization).\n      </p>", "Hydrilla is one of the most serious aquatic weed problems in the United States, and fluridone is the only U.S. Environment Protection Agency (USEPA)-approved herbicide that provides relatively long-term systemic control. Recently, hydrilla biotypes with varying levels of fluridone resistance have been documented in Florida. Several biotypes of hydrilla varying in resistance levels were maintained in 950-L tanks under ambient sunlight and day-length conditions from September 2004 to September 2005 in absence of fluridone. Phenotypic measurements were performed during this 1-yr period to monitor differences in growth and reproductive physiology. All fluridone-resistant biotypes (except R3) were growing at the same rate or greater than the susceptible hydrilla. These data suggested that there are no deleterious effects on growth and reproductive physiology because of development of fluridone resistance. Aggressive spread of fluridone-resistant dioecious hydrilla in aquatic ecosystems can severely affect hydrilla management and, consequently, cause substantial and long-lasting ecological and economic problems throughout the southern United States.\n      </p>", "Microorganisms have a variety of evolutionary adaptations and physiological acclimation mechanisms that allow them to survive and remain active in the face of environmental stress. Physiological responses to stress have costs at the organismal level that can result in altered ecosystem-level C, energy, and nutrient flows. These large-scale impacts result from direct effects on active microbes' physiology and by controlling the composition of the active microbial community. We first consider some general aspects of how microbes experience environmental stresses and how they respond to them. We then discuss the impacts of two important ecosystem-level stressors, drought and freezing, on microbial physiology and community composition. Even when microbial community response to stress is limited, the physiological costs impsoed on soil microbes are large enough that they may cause large shifts in the allocation and fate of C and N. For example, for microbes to synthesize the osmolytes they need to survive a single drought episode they may consume up to 5% of total annual net primary production in grassland ecosystems, while acclimating to freezing condtions switches Arctic tundra soils from immobilizing N during the growing season to mineralizing it during the winter. We suggest that more effectively integrating microbial ecology into ecosystem ecology will require a more complete integration of microbial physiological ecology, population biology, and process ecology.\n      </p>", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "          \t\t\t        \t\tFor information about individual subscriptions for this title, please visit the \t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/individual-subscriptions\">Individual Access</a>\n\t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\tpage.\t\t        \t\n\t\t\t        \t\n\t\t        \n\t       \n           </p>\n           <p>\n           \t\t          \t \tFor more information about institutional access to this title, please visit the \t          \t \n          \t \t<a href=\"http://about.jstor.org/participate-jstor/subscribe\">Institutional Subscriptions</a>\n           \t\t           \t\tpage.           \t\n           </p>\n\n  \n", "", "       setTimeout(function(){\n                    var a=document.createElement(\"script\");\n                    var b=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n                    a.src=document.location.protocol+\"//dnn506yrbagrg.cloudfront.net/pages/scripts/0010/4927.js\";\n                    a.async=true;a.type=\"text/javascript\";b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)\n                }, 1);\n            </script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                \n                  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n                  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-20266811-1']);\n                  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n                \n                  (function() {\n                    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n                    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
